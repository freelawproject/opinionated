We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-24\">(1) Contreras contends that his guilty plea must be set aside because the district court did not fulfill the requirement to \u201caddress the defendant personally in open court and inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>the ... nature of the charge to which the plea is offered.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In particular, Contreras argues that the district court failed to adequately explain the \u201cfound in\u201d element of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, the crime with which the indictment charged him. He is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">During the change-of-plea colloquy in open court, the district court personally informed Contreras that he was charged with \u201cbeing an illegal alien found in the United States.\u201d The district court also sufficiently informed Contreras of the elements of \u00a7 1326\u2019s found-in offense: (1) the defendant is an alien; (2) had been deported; (3) was subsequently found in the United States; and (4) did not have the permission of the Attorney General to reapply for admission. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). However, Contreras contends the district court erred by mentioning \u201centry\u201d when it listed the elements of the crime, which he argues actually advised him not of \u00a7 1326\u2019s found-in offense, but rather its separate re-entry offense. But, of course, \u201cre-entry is part of being found in the United States and is \u2018embedded in the \u201cfound in\u201d offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Parga-Rosas, </em>238 F.3d 1209, 1213 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Pacheco-Medina, </em>212 F.3d 1162, 1165 (9th Cir.2000)). Moreover, the government\u2019s statement of the facts, which Contreras adopted in total, reemphasized that: (1) Contreras was an alien; (2) had been deported (at least four times); (3) was subsequently found in the United States; and (4) did not have the Attorney General\u2019s permission to be here. <em>See id. </em>at 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">(2) Contreras concedes that <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 966, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001), forecloses the challenge of his sentence based upon <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"Ani\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-21\">. When considering this issue, we limit ourselves to the plea colloquy, and plain error analysis applies. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>224 F.3d 1152, 1155 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. granted, </em>531 U.S. 1189, 121 S.Ct. 1185, 149 L.Ed.2d 102 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
