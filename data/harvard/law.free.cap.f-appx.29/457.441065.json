Lee contends that he did not join Ray\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, and that accordingly, the denial, as far as it refers to his case, should be vacated. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and decline to grant Ray\u2019s request for a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">To prevail on a Rule 33 motion for a new trial, Ray and Lee must satisfy a five-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">(1) the evidence must be newly discovered; (2) the failure to discover the evidence sooner must not be the result of a lack of diligence on the defendants\u2019 part; (3) the evidence must be material to the issues at trial; (4) the evidence must be neither cumulative nor merely impeaching; and (5) the evidence must indicate that a new trial would probably result in acquittal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-12\"><em>United States v. Kulczyk, </em>931 F.2d 542, 548 (9th Cir.1991); <em>see also United States v. Jackson, </em>209 F.3d 1103, 1106 (9th Cir.2000). We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial based on \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Sarno, </em>73 F.3d 1470, 1507 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">Here, the appellants\u2019 proffer of \u201cnew\u201d evidence consists of the testimony of Ray\u2019s brother, Fang Yu, which the district court properly characterizes as \u201cimpeachment evidence.\u201d Appellants contend that his testimony still warrants a new trial because it renders the trial testimony of the prosecution\u2019s key witness, Tony Gu, \u201ctotally incredible.\u201d <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>960 F.2d 820, 825 (9th Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 873, 113 S.Ct. 210, 121 L.Ed.2d 150 (1992). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">Moreover, Appellants fail to show that the admission of Yu\u2019s testimony would probably have resulted in an acquittal. Very similar impeachment arguments were already raised by defense counsel at trial. In addition, evidence that reinforced Gu\u2019s testimony that Ray and Lee were aware of the military nature of the products they manufactured and shipped to China was presented at trial, and there is some level of uncertainty as to the power and validity of Yu\u2019s testimony itself due to the rules of hearsay and other practical limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-15\">Because we find that appellants fail to meet the last requirement, we need not address the others. We therefore conclude that the district court properly exercised its discretion when it declined to grant the appellants\u2019 Rule 33 motion for a new trial on the basis of \u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The COA requirements of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) apply to the present appeal because it was filed after April 24, 1996, AEDPA\u2019s effective date. <em>Furman v. Wood, </em>190 F.3d 1002, 1004 (9th Cir.1999). Accordingly, Ray must obtain a COA as to each of the specific issues that she wishes to appeal. <em>See Morris v. Woodford, </em>229 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2000) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 2255 relief for those issues that parallel the basis for Ray\u2019s Rule 33 motion for a new trial. After the district court denied her application for a COA, Ray renewed her request here for a COA that covered three issues related to her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We conclude that Ray has not made the requisite \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d with respect to the district court\u2019s (1) denial of an evidentiary hearing on her \u00a7 2255 claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; (2) refusal to stay the proceedings; and (3) denial of leave to amend her \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). <em>See Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1104-05 (9th Cir.1999). We therefore deny Ray\u2019s request for a COA and dismiss her \u00a7 2255 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">As to Lee\u2019s claim, the government has conceded that Lee never joined in Ray\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion; therefore, the district court\u2019s denial of her motion should not have been applied to his case. Accordingly, we reverse and vacate the district court\u2019s decision to deny him \u00a7 2255 relief based upon Ray\u2019s failed motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the opinion of the district court is AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-10\">.
