The first order, entered on November 15, 2000, directed Wawa to produce certain documents requested in plaintiff R.J. Reynolds\u2019 subpoena. The second order, entered on November 20, 2000, directed Wawa to pay its own expenses in complying with the subpoena. We will affirm the first order and reverse the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-19\">JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b911-20\">As a non-party, Wawa cannot appeal the District Court\u2019s orders at the conclusion of R.J. Reynolds\u2019 suit against Phillip Morris in North Carolina. Thus, these orders are final orders over which we have appellate jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; <em>In re: Mark Madden, </em>151 F.3d 125, 127 (3d Cir.1998). Our standard of review is whether the District Court abused its discretion. James Wm. Moore, 9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 45.04[8][b] (3d ed.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-21\">NOVEMBER 15 ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b911-22\">R.J. Reynolds\u2019 subpoena requests documents and information concerning Wawa\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>cigarette business, especially its dealings with Phillip Morris and Phillip Morris\u2019s Retail Leaders Program. The documents and information that R.J. Reynolds seeks under this subpoena are subject to a protective order entered in the North Carolina action. The protective order provides that the \u201cinformation and documents provided shall be used only for purposes of the instant litigation and shall not be otherwise disclosed.\u201d Nevertheless, Wawa refused to produce certain documents requested by R.J. Reynolds on the ground that they are privileged trade secrets.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Wawa advances two main arguments on appeal. First, it argues that R.J. Reynolds\u2019 subpoena exceeds the scope of relevant discovery permitted under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1). Although the Federal Rule governing subpoenas is Rule 45, and not Rule 26, it is not necessary to resolve this distinction here. R.J. Reynolds\u2019 subpoena meets the requirements of Rule 26 in any event. Rule 26(b)(1) allows discovery regarding \u201cany matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party.\u201d Here, R.J. Reynolds has requested documents related to Wawa\u2019s retail cigarette business and dealings with Phillip Morris. This information plainly relates to R.J. Reynolds\u2019 antitrust claims challenging Phillip Morris\u2019s Retail Leaders program.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Second, Wawa argues that its documents are privileged as trade secrets and, thus, not obtainable under Fed.R.Civ.P. 45(c)(3)(B)(i). Wawa has the burden of establishing that its documents are privileged. See Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, 9A Fed. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Proc. \u00a7 2458 (1995); Fed.R.Civ.P. 45(d)(2) (when information subject to a subpoena is withheld under a claim of privilege, it must be supported by a sufficient description of the nature of the documents produced). Although Wawa has assembled a privilege log listing certain documents as trade secrets, the skeletal descriptions in its privilege log do not support a trade secret privilege for many documents. See, e.g. A118 (listing \u201cvarious daily log entries\u201d as trade secrets); A119 (listing \u201cinteroffice emails\u201d with \u201cvarious\u201d authors and \u201cvarious\u201d addressees as trade secrets); A121 (listing \u201cvarious miscell. Wawa notes/correspondence\u201d as trade secrets).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Even if Wawa\u2019s privilege log did establish that certain documents were trade secrets, however, Wawa\u2019s argument would still fail. This is because Wawa cannot meet the additional showing of good cause for restricting dissemination on the ground that it would be harmed by its disclosures. Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Richard L. Marcus, 8 Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. \u00a7 2048 (1994). The disclosure required by R.J. Reynolds\u2019 subpoena would be made under the limitations of the protective order entered in North Carolina. That order restricts the use of information gained from Wawa to the pending antitrust and unfair trade practices litigation between R.J. Reynolds, Phillip Morris and other tobacco producers. In light of this protective order, Wawa has not presented sufficient showing of harm to establish that the District Court abused its discretion in ordering production.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Therefore, we find that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in requiring Wawa to comply with R.J. Reynolds\u2019 subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">NOVEMBER 20 ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">The District Court also denied Wawa fees and costs incurred as a result of its compliance with R.J. Reynolds\u2019 subpoena. We find that the court abused its discretion when it summarily denied compensation without considering evidence of the expenses Wawa incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 45(c)(2)(B) imposes mandatory fee shifting and directs the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>\u201cprotect\u201d a nonparty from \u201csignificant expense resulting from inspection and copying commanded.\u201d Thus, district courts must determine whether the subpoena imposes expenses on a non-party and whether those expenses are significant. <em>James Wm. Moore, </em>9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 45.04[2] (3d ed.2001). Significant expenses must be borne by the party seeking discovery. <em>Id. </em>The District Court abused its discretion when it denied Wawa compensation without determining the existence and magnitude of Wawa\u2019s expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">We will affirm the District Court\u2019s November 15, 2000, order requiring Wawa to comply with R.J. Reynolds\u2019 subpoena. We will reverse the District Court\u2019s November 20, 2000, order and remand this case to the District Court to make findings regarding Wawa\u2019s expenses and to award any expenses required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 45(c)(2)(B).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
