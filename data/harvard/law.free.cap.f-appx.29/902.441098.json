We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We subject the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to plenary review and will apply the same standards as the District Court. <em>Beers-Capitol v. Whetzel, </em>256 F.3d 120, 130 n. 6 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Helfant alleges that Defendants\u2019 actions amounted to three separate legal violations: first, a violation of his rights to equal protection and substantive due process under both the United States and New Jersey Constitutions; second, employment discrimination in violation of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination; and, third, retaliation against him for conduct protected by the Conscientious Employees\u2019 Protection Act. After conducting a careful review of the record in this case, we reach the same conclusions as set forth by the District Court in its thorough and well-reasoned opinion. The District Court carefully considered the merits of each count as it applied to each Defendant, and we find no fault with its analysis. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
