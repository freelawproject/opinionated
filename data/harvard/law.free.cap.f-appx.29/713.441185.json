PARKER and SOTOMAYOR, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b744-11\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">George Rivera, <em>pro se, informa pauper-is, </em>and incarcerated, appeals from the denial of his motions for recusal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(b)(1), and modification of his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Kram, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">We affirm the dismissal of Rivera\u2019s motion to recuse for substantially the reasons stated by the district. <em>See Rivera v. United States, </em>No. 89 CR 346, 2001 WL 736778 at *3-5 (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 2001). We therefore need not address the government\u2019s argument that the motion to recuse was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-16\">We also affirm the dismissal of Rivera\u2019s motion to modify his sentence. The district court correctly ruled that Amendment 591 to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, effective on November 1, 2000, is inapplicable. By its terms, this amendment applies to the initial selection of the relevant guideline, and not to adjustments or enhancements imposed once the guideline is selected, which are what Rivera challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-17\">Even if Amendment 591 were applicable, it would not result in a sentence reduction for Rivera. When a court is determining whether a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), \u201cthe court should consider the term of imprisonment that it would have imposed had the amendment ... been in effect\u201d at the time of the original sentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b) (1991). \u201cIn determining the amended guideline range [], the court shall substitute only the [pertinent] amendment[ ] ... for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced. All other guideline application decisions remain unaffected.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt n. 2; <em>Berrios v. United States, </em>126 F.3d 430, 432 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-18\">At the time Rivera was sentenced, a district court had discretion to consider a defendant\u2019s \u201cactual\u201d conduct (i.e., all relevant conduct) when determining the applicable guideline provision to be used for selecting the base offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Manual, Supp. to App. C, amend. 591, at 29-32; <em>United States v. Kurtz, </em>237 F.3d 154, 155-56 (2d Cir.2001). If Amendment 591 had been in effect, the sentencing court would have had no such discretion; the applicable guideline provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>could have been based only on the offense of conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Since in this case the district court considered only the conduct underlying Rivera\u2019s offense of conviction, and not his actual conduct, the court\u2019s selection of \u00a7 2D1.1 as the appropriate guideline provision is not affected by Amendment 591. Accordingly, Rivera\u2019s motion for modification of sentence is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A2n\">. There is an exception not applicable in this case. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.2(a); U.S.S.G. Manual, Supp. to App. C, amend. 591, at 29-32.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
