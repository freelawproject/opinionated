R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">Plaintiff Loretta Castille, a forty-three-year-old African-American woman, appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of her former employer. Ms. Castille\u2019s suit claimed that the employer, Compliance Solutions, refused to promote her and later terminated her because of her age and because of her race. It alleged these actions violated Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq.) </em>and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">The parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge. Compliance Solutions subsequently moved for summary judgment on both claims under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. The magistrate judge granted the motion, ruling that: (1) Compliance Solutions lacked the requisite number of employees to constitute an \u201cemployer\u201d for purposes of Title VII and the ADEA; and (2) Ms. Castille failed to present sufficient evidence of discriminatory intent to warrant a trial. Ms. Castille appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">Her claims of error are not entirely clear. She does not, for instance, address the threshold issue whether Compliance Solutions employed a statutorily sufficient number of employees. Instead, she argues that the magistrate judge was biased, since in \u201c[her] belief\u2019 he did not \u201cread [her] whole file\u201d; had he done so, she adds, \u201cit would have been his belief that something was wrong.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 3. She also disputes the magistrate judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence supporting her claims of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-15\">We reject, at the outset, Ms. Castille\u2019s accusation of bias. Because she did not file a motion for recusal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144, we conduct our inquiry under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Her claim of bias rests, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>she candidly admits, on nothing more than her subjective \u201cbelief\u201d that the magistrate judge failed to read her pleadings or otherwise read \u201cthe file.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 3. She offers no evidence to support this charge, nor do we find any in our independent review of the record. To the contrary, the magistrate judge\u2019s thorough and well-written order reveals an impressive command of the facts and law germane to Ms. Castille\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Next, we agree with the primary basis supporting the magistrate judge\u2019s decision: Compliance Solutions is exempt from the reach of Title VII and the ADEA. Barring a handful of exceptions not relevant here, Title VII applies to organizations that have \u201cfifteen or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding year.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b). The ADEA definition is identical except that it requires an employer to employ twenty or more employees. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 630(b). An organization employing fewer than the fifteen people is not subject to the anti-discrimination provisions of Title VTI or the ADEA. <em>See Walters v. Metro. Educ. Enters., Inc., </em>519 U.S. 202, 205, 117 S.Ct. 660, 136 L.Ed.2d 644 (1997) (addressing definition of \u201cemployer\u201d under Title VII).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Attached to its motion for summary judgment, Compliance Solutions submitted an affidavit from its corporate president. It stated that at no time, including the period set forth in Title VII, has the company employed more than fourteen employees. Ms. Castille did not rebut this claim in any fashion, a failure, we conclude, that demanded the entry of summary judgment in favor of Compliance Solutions. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P 56(c) and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Because Compliance Solutions is exempt from the requirements of Title VII and the ADEA, we need not review the evidence supporting Ms. Castille\u2019s discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">The judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado is AFFIRMED. Ms. Castille\u2019s motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pawperis </em>is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b590-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-16\">. A judge may be disqualified for bias under either 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144 or 455. Under the former statute, a judge must disqualify himself whenever a party presents a \u201ctimely and sufficient affidavit\u201d that the judge has a personal bias or prejudice. The latter statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>places \"the obligation to identify the existence of [bias or prejudice] upon the judge himself, rather than requiring recusal only in response to a party affidavit.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 548, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994); <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
