Keltner appeals two separate district court orders granting the Appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment on his civil action alleging that various vehicles were improperly removed from his property. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinions and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Keltner v. </em>Shaver; No. CA-00-1162-6 (S.D.W.Va. filed Oct. 12, 2001; entered Oct. 15, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
