Violation of this statute carries a base prison sentence of two years, but \u00a7 1326(b)(2) provides for prison terms of up to twenty years for aliens who reenter the country illegally and have a previous aggravated felony conviction. Defendant stipulated that he had been convicted of two prior aggravated felonies. He was convicted following a jury trial and sentenced to 125 months imprisonment. We have jurisdiction over the appeal of his conviction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. With regard to the appeal of his sentence, we have jurisdiction over his \u201cacceptance of responsibility\u201d claim pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), but conclude we have no jurisdiction over his \u201cdownward departure\u201d claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Defendant\u2019s appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has moved to withdraw. <em>Anders </em>holds that if counsel finds an appeal \u201cto be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744. Counsel must also submit to the court a brief addressing anything in the record that arguably supports the appeal. <em>Id. </em>In the <em>Anders </em>brief, defendant\u2019s counsel raises an appellate issue regarding the government\u2019s preemptory challenge of a juror who was Hispanic. As required, a copy of counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief and motion to withdraw were provided to defendant, <em>see id., </em>who filed a pro se brief, raising two sentencing issues. Pursuant to our duty under <em>Anders, </em>we have conducted an independent review of defendant\u2019s proceedings. <em>Id. </em>Because we agree that there are no non-frivolous issues on appeal, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">Defendant first contends that the district court erred in granting the government\u2019s peremptory challenge of an Hispanic juror, claiming the juror was improperly excluded solely on the basis of his race. <em>See Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 89, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986) (precluding use of peremptory challenge to exclude potential juror solely on the basis of race). After defendant raised a <em>Batson </em>challenge to the juror\u2019s exclusion, the government explained that it struck the juror because he was a convicted felon and had stated, on voir dire questioning, that he did not believe his case had been fairly investigated or handled by the government and that his resentment of the government might affect his view of defendant\u2019s case. Defendant did not offer any argument or fact to show the government\u2019s explanation was pretextual. We conclude the district court did not err in finding the government offered a race-neutral explanation and that defendant failed to show the reason was a pretext for race discrimination. <em>See United States v. Sneed, </em>34 F.3d 1570, 1578-80 (10th Cir.1994) (explaining three-step <em>Batson </em>analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Defendant next challenges his sentence, referring generally in his pro se supplementary brief to a motion filed by his trial counsel \u201cdisputing the points used by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>government to increase [his] sentence.\u201d (Supplemental Opening Br. at 1.) Defendant\u2019s trial counsel actually filed two motions requesting a downward adjustment or departure. In one, counsel requested a two-level reduction from defendant\u2019s base offense level for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, claiming he was entitled to such a reduction because he stipulated to the fact that he was found in this country on the date and at the place charged and that he had two prior aggravated felony convictions. The district court denied the two-level reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1, finding \u201cabsolutely no evidence that the defendant [had] really accepted responsibility.... Indeed, he\u2019s almost defiant in his position that he\u2019s in this country no matter what the law says.... \u201d (R. Supp. Vol. 3, at 7-8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">We review the acceptance of responsibility determination as a question of fact under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Janusz, </em>135 F.3d 1319, 1325 (10th Cir.1998); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 5 (stating that trial court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant has accepted responsibility is subject to great deference on review). The fact that defendant chose to go to trial does not automatically bar him from receiving a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility; there may be \u201crare\u201d situations where \u201ca defendant may clearly demonstrate an acceptance of responsibility for his criminal conduct even though he exercises his constitutional right to a trial.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 2. This is not that rare situation. Although defendant stipulated to his past aggravated felonies so that evidence of these crimes would not be presented to the jury, he did not admit to illegally reentering the country after deportation or otherwise accept responsibility for his actions. We find no error in the district court\u2019s determination not to grant this requested two-level reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">In the second motion filed by defendant\u2019s trial counsel, defendant requested a downward departure from criminal history category VI under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, claiming that category VI significantly over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history. Specifically, he claimed that several of his twenty-seven criminal convictions were almost ten years old and several were for non-serious misdemeanors and minor felonies. The district court denied defendant\u2019s request for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, finding that defendant\u2019s criminal history was a \u201cstrong\u201d category VI and that even if it ignored some parts of his criminal history, defendant would still remain in category VI. (R. Supp. Vol. 3, at 9.) It is well-established law in this circuit that an appellate court does not have jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart downward from the sentencing guidelines unless the district court misunderstands its authority to depart. <em>United States v. McHenry, </em>968 F.2d 1047, 1048 (10th Cir.1992). There is nothing in the record to suggest that the district court misunderstood its authority to depart downward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to consider this allegation of error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRAiNTED. Defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(f) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), apparently in the mistaken belief that something in that decision invalidates some of his criminal history category points. He includes no arguments as to how he believes this decision relates to his conviction or sentence and we will not attempt to invent arguments on his behalf. <em>Drake v. City of Fort Collins, </em>927 F.2d 1156, 1159 (10th Cir.1991) (\u2019\u2019Despite the liberal construction afforded pro se pleadings, the court will not construct arguments or theories for the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>tiff in the absence of any discussion of those issues.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
