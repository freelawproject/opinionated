We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">First, Hernandez contends that the district court improperly enhanced his sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) based on a prior aggravated felony that was not charged in the indictment, proven beyond a reasonable doubt at trial or admitted to on the record. Specifically, Hernandez argues that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), rather than <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) governs his case because he challenged the use of his prior conviction to enhance his sentence and pleaded guilty rather than go to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">We review de novo, <em>see United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir.2001), and conclude that Hernandez\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. <em>See Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d at 1127 (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres ); United States v. Castillo-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1020, 1024 (9th Cir.2001) (upholding enhancement where defendant pleaded guilty and challenged use of prior conviction to enhance his sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-14\">Second, Hernandez challenges, as a matter of law, the district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart based on cultural assimilation. Hernandez argues that his facts are sufficiently unusual to take his case outside the relevant Guideline\u2019s \u201cheartland,\u201d and the only justification for the district court\u2019s decision not to depart was its erroneous reliance on the probation officer\u2019s suggestion that comparison of his case to others within its own district and caseload constituted a proper \u201cheartland\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-15\">Although Hernandez is correct that we may review, for an abuse of discretion, a district court\u2019s sentencing decision if it makes an error of law, <em>see United States v. Banuelos-Rodriguez, </em>215 F.3d 969, 979 (9th Cir.2000), we disagree that the district court made such an error in this case. Our review of the record shows that the district court expressly considered the factual support for Hernandez\u2019s argument, and simply declined to exercise its discretion to depart without a lengthy explanation for its decision. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Garcia, </em>927 F.2d 489, 491 (9th Cir.1991) (stating a district court has no obligation to state its reasons for declining to depart). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s discretionary re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>fusal to depart from the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Lipman, </em>133 F.3d 726, 732 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Finally, we reject Hernandez\u2019s alternative contention that the district court erred by failing to adequately explain its decision not to depart as required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). <em>See Garda-Garda, </em>927 F.2d at 490 (stating that section 3553(c)(1) only requires a statement of reasons for imposing a sentence at a particular point within a guideline range, if that range exceeds 24 months); <em>United States v. Howard, </em>894 F.2d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir.1990) (defining the term range as used in section 3553(c)(1) as the span of time within a category rather than the minimum sentence available in the category).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b472-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
