Mattel, Inc., </em>No. 99-560, 2000 WL 730350 (E.D. Pa. June 6, 2000) (order). Because Revson lacks standing to bring this appeal, we <em>dismiss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-29\">We first address the threshold issue whether Revson has standing to pursue this appeal. Whether a party has standing to appeal is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Prima Tek II L.L.C. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number><em>A-Roo Co., </em>222 F.3d 1372, 1376, 55 USPQ2d 1742, 1745 (Fed.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Revson contends that she has a stake in the appeal because, if the district court\u2019s ruling is not corrected, she faces the prospect of liability for representing herself from 1993 to 1999 as the owner of the \u2019030 patent to numerous licensees and infringers with whom she has settled. Revson also argues that she has standing because, as a condition of her not objecting to the settlement, L &amp; N expressly consented to Revson commencing this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">L <em>&amp; </em>N argues that Revson lacks a stake in the present appeal because, even if the district court\u2019s ruling on whether the 1993 Agreement granted all rights in the \u2019030 patent to L &amp; N was incorrect, the grant-back provision in a subsequent agreement between Revson and L <em>&amp; </em>N in 1999 negates any concern that Revson would be subject to any liability as a result of that decision. L &amp; N also contends that Rev-son is barred from bringing this appeal by the covenant not to sue contained in the final agreement between the parties, entered into in 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Ordinarily, only a party that was aggrieved by a judgment may take an appeal. <em>Deposit Guar. Nat\u2019l Bank v. Roper, </em>445 U.S. 326, 333, 100 S.Ct. 1166, 63 L.Ed.2d 427 (1980). However, a prevailing party, such as Revson, may appeal from \u201can adverse ruling collateral to the judgment on the merits ... so long as that party retains a stake in the appeal satisfying the requirements of Artficle] III.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333-34, 100 S.Ct. 1166; <em>see also Intellectual Prop. Dev., Inc. v. TCI Cablevision of Cal., </em>248 F.3d 1333, 1339, 58 USPQ2d 1681, 1684 (Fed.Cir.2001) (allowing prevailing defendant to appeal district court\u2019s order dismissing infringement action because that order \u201cfail[ed] to fully address all avenues of potential infringement liability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">We agree with L &amp; N that Revson does not have such a stake and therefore lacks standing to pursue this appeal. As a preliminary matter, parties cannot waive the requirements for jurisdiction under Article III by consent. <em>See Boeing Co. v. Comm\u2019r of Patents and Trademarks, </em>853 F.2d 878, 881, 7 USPQ2d 1487, 1489 (Fed.Cir.1988) (\u201cThe issue of standing calls into question the power of the court to hear and decide a case, and it is impossible for a party to waive this requirement. A court must dismiss an appeal whenever it becomes apparent that jurisdiction is lacking.\u201d). Rev-son therefore does not have standing merely because the parties purportedly consented to Revson\u2019s right to bring this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Furthermore, Revson\u2019s assertion that she might incur liability for representing herself from 1993 to 1999 as the owner of the \u2019030 patent does not provide her with a stake in the appeal sufficient to satisfy Article III. Although \u201c[t]he threat of an unfavorable determination in future litigation due to the res judicata effect of an adverse judicial determination\u201d can provide a party with standing to appeal, <em>Nat\u2019l Presto Indus., Inc. v. Dazey Corp., </em>107 F.3d 1576, 1579, 42 USPQ2d 1070, 1073 (Fed.Cir.1997), any such threat Revson faces is highly speculative. The grant-back provision in the 1999 agreement makes explicit Revson\u2019s right to grant licenses under the \u2019030 patent to stores located outside of L &amp; N\u2019s \u201cExclusive Territory,\u201d a right Revson implicitly retained under the 1993 Agreement when she granted L &amp; N only a nonexclusive license in that territory. Moreover, the 2000 agreement explicitly provides that \u201cany monies previously collected by Revson [for past infringement of the \u2019030 patent] belong to her.\u201d Revson therefore cannot incur liability to L <em>&amp; </em>N, or any other party, for any licenses she granted be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>tween 1993 and 1999 that are covered by her retained rights, and she is also entitled to keep any royalties or payments that she received prior to the effective date of the 2000 agreement. Accordingly, we conclude that Revson does not have a stake in the appeal sufficient to provide her with Article III standing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AOXE\">Because Revson lacks standing to bring this appeal, we dismiss.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Au2\"> Because we conclude that Revson does not have standing to bring this appeal, we need not consider the effect of the covenant not to sue in the 2000 Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
