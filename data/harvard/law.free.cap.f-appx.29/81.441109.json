He was sentenced to a total of thirty-four years incarceration after he pled guilty to armed bank robbery, attempted armed bank robbery and to two counts of using, carrying and brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Matthews raises two issues in his appeal: (1) the District Court erred in imposing the mandated enhanced sentence under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C) for a second or subsequent conviction and (2) the District Court erred in failing to examine the factors set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 before determining the extent of the downward departure based on Matthews\u2019 cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). The standard of review is plain error because at sentencing Matthews did not object either to the enhanced sentence or to the extent of the downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">Matthews took part in the armed robberies and attempted armed robberies of four banks. He was charged in a twelve-count indictment. On August 17, 2000, he pled guilty to seven counts, including two violations of \u00a7 924(c). As a result, on March 21, 2001, the District Court sentenced Matthews as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-15\">(1) Seven years on Count One of Criminal Action No. 99-81 and Counts One, Five, Eight, and Eleven of Criminal Action No. 00-155-2, to run concurrently to each other;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-16\">(2) Seven years on Count Two of Criminal Action No. 99-81 pursuant to \u00a7 924(c), to run consecutively to all other counts and;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-17\">(3) Twenty years on Count Five of Criminal Action No. 00-155-2 pursuant to \u00a7 924(c), to run consecutively to all other counts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-18\">The total sentence imposed was thirty-four years incarceration. Because the District Court granted the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, the period of incarceration was approximately 12 years below the minimum sentence indicated by the Sentencing Guidelines for the offenses of conviction. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), the downward departure includes a five year reduction of the \u00a7 924(c) mandatory minimum sentence for a second or subsequent offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-19\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b112-20\">The first issue before us is whether the District Court erred in imposing the mandatory enhanced sentence for Matthews\u2019 second violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-21\">(C) In the case of a second or subsequent conviction under this subsection, the person shall</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 25 years</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Matthews argues that, since his guilty pleas were entered simultaneously, \u00a7 924(c) cannot apply. First, he contends that he simply did not have two convictions, only one, because he pled guilty to all offenses at the same time in one plea. Second, he argues that even if he did have more than one conviction of violating \u00a7 924(c), neither was \u201csecond\u201d or \u201csubsequent\u201d again because he pled simultaneously to both offenses. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993), disposes of both contentions. In Deal, the defendant was convicted by a jury of six separate bank robberies and six counts of carrying and using a firearm during a crime of violence. Deal argued that his convictions on the second through sixth firearm counts were not \u201csecond or subsequent convictions\u201d because Deal was convicted of the \u00a7 924 offenses during the same trial. <em>Id. </em>at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The Court stated that it is unambiguous that the word \u201cconviction\u201d refers to the finding of guilt by a judge or jury. <em>Id. </em>The phrase \u201csecond or subsequent conviction\u201d does not mean that a defendant must first be convicted of a crime and then, later, of a second crime. The Court interpreted the statute to mean simply one \u201cconviction after the first conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">It follows from Deal that timing does not matter. It does not matter whether a defendant is tried by a jury or pleads guilty and it does not matter whether he pleads simultaneously or separately to multiple offenses, he is convicted of all the offenses. Each guilty plea is a separate conviction, one following after the other, no matter how many times the word \u201cguilty\u201d is uttered.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">It is evident from the opinion of the Court in Deal and from the text of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) that if a defendant is convicted by plea, by jury or by judge of more than one of the relevant charges under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), whether or not those convictions occur at the same time, he must receive the mandatory enhanced term of imprisonment. See also <em>United States v. Casiano, </em>113 F.3d 420 (3d Cir.1997) (upholding mandatory consecutive sentences where \u00a7 924(c) violations charged in a single indictment during same course of criminal activity).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">For the above reasons, the District Court did not err, much less clearly err, in imposing the mandatory enhanced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">The second issue before us is whether the District Court erred in departing downward in the sentence imposed. Matthews argues that the district court failed to examine the factors set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, before determining the extent of the downward departure based on Matthews\u2019 cooperation. Matthews contends that the District Court did not follow the requirements subsequently set out in <em>United States v. Torres, </em>251 F.3d 138 (3d Cir.2001), that it make explicit findings justifying the departure. Under Torres, a sentencing court must indicate its consideration of the \u00a7 5K1.1 factors as well as any factors outside those listed in \u00a7 5K1.1. However, Torres only urges, but does not require, sentencing judges to make specific findings regarding each factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">Here, the District Judge was made well aware of Matthews\u2019 cooperation from the Sentencing Memorandum and Motions for Departure Pursuant to Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), which was filed by the government prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>sentencing. In addition, at the commencement of Matthews\u2019 sentencing hearing, the government recited for the District Court the grounds for the departure motions. The court heard this evidence and stated before imposing sentence, \u201cMr. Matthews, I want you to know, sir, that I\u2019ve given you a substantial reduction in your sentence, pursuant to the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion and 3553(e).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">We conclude from the above that the District Judge did adequately consider the \u00a7 5K1.1 factors. He, therefore, met the Torres requirements and did not err, much less commit plain error. For the above reasons, we will affirm the judgement of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
