For the reasons that follow, we grant a certificate of appealability and vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-29\">In the district court below, Hogge made several allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel including whether counsel failed to file a petition for certiorari from this court\u2019s affirmance of his convictions and sentence. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>No. 99-4032, 1999 WL 957706 (4th Cir. Oct. 19, 1999) (unpublished). Specifically, Hogge alleged by affidavit that his \u00a7 2255 motion filed on March 15, 2001, was filed beyond the one-year period allowed under the statute because: Hogge\u2019s counsel told him he was filing a petition for certiorari on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>October 22, 1999; counsel neglected to inform Hogge that he decided not to file the petition; Hogge relied on counsel\u2019s representations that counsel was filing such a petition and thus delayed filing his \u00a7 2255 motion. After Hogge discovered in February 2001 that counsel failed to file the petition, he filed the instant \u00a7 2255 motion on March 15, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The district court did not address Hogge\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance on the merits. Rather, the court found, without conducting an evidentiary hearing, that Hogge should have discovered, through the exercise of due diligence under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255(4), that his counsel failed to file the certiorari petition. The court reasoned that because Hogge\u2019s counsel only had ninety days within which to file the petition for certiorari, Hogge should have been able to discover counsel\u2019s failure to file the petition within that time period. Thus, the court found that the limitations period began to run on January 17, 2000 (ninety- days after this court\u2019s affirmance of Hogge\u2019s conviction), and therefore the one-year period for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion expired on January 17, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Unless it is clear from the pleadings, files, and records that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, \u00a7 2255 makes a hearing mandatory. <em>Raines v. United States, </em>423 F.2d 526, 529 (4th Cir.1970). Accordingly, we vacate and remand for a factual hearing to determine at what point in time that Hogge, through the exercise of due diligence, should have discovered his counsel\u2019s failure to file a petition for certiorari. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255(4). If the district court finds that Hogge\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was timely filed, then it should address Hogge\u2019s other claims of ineffective assistance including whether counsel complied with the dictates of <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 476-77, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">We deny Hogge\u2019s \u201cmotion to vacate and reenter judgment\u201d in No. 99-4032 as moot because it seeks the same relief as the instant appeal of Hogge\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, and we decline to address the other issues raised in this appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
