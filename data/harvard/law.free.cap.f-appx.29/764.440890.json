Gorley alleges that he was dismissed from his job with Metro-North because of racial discrimination, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, et seq., and Connecticut law, C.G.S.A. \u00a7 46a-60(a)(1). Metro-North argues that it discharged Gorley because he misappropriated funds. The district court granted Metro-North\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that Gorley failed to present evidence from which a rational fact finder could infer that Metro-North was motivated by discriminatory animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">We affirm for substantially the reasons given by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
