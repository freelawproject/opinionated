For the reasons given below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Julian and Mimco entered into an agreement in September 1997, granting Mimco an exclusive license to use certain trademarks owned by Julian. A dispute over Mimco\u2019s payments under the licensing agreement arose. Julian served Mimco with a demand for arbitration in accordance with the licensing agreement in July 1999. Julian also served Mimco with a notice terminating the license agreement in October 1999. Mimco questioned whether the license termination was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">The parties and arbitrators attended a pre-arbitration conference on February 11, 2000. Mimco\u2019s counsel at the hearing, Mitchell Kaplan, states he explained to the panel that Kenneth R. Schachter of the law firm Silverberg, Stonehill and Goldsmith would defend Mimco at the arbitration hearing. Kaplan states he told the panel Schachter had two separate trials scheduled to begin in March 2000, including a trial in the Eastern District of New York scheduled to start March 13, 2000, and suggested May 2000 as an alternate date for the hearings. Julian (and the arbitrators) insist Kaplan attempted to have the arbitration hearings scheduled for summer 2000. Regardless, Julian and the arbitrators appear to have insisted on March. One of the arbitrators stated during the March 13, 2000, hearing, \u201c[tjhere was a conflict for everybody else at one point or another, and as I recall, it was August before we could locate any free time, so it wasn\u2019t a two-week delay, it was much more like a five-month delay and would have put us a year after the initiation of arbitration before the first evidentiary hearing will be held.\u201d The arbitrators, over Kaplan\u2019s objection, selected March 13, 2000, as the opening day of arbitration, with March 14 and April 3, 2000, as the continuation dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-15\">Schachter wrote to the American Arbitration Association on February 15 and February 17, 2000, asking the case administrator to forward his request to the panel that the first two days of the hearing be adjourned because of his scheduling conflict. The arbitration schedule remained the same. On the first scheduled day of the hearing \u2014 March 13, 2000 \u2014 Walter Jeram, an associate from Schachter\u2019s office, appeared. He again asked the panel to adjourn the case. When the panel refused, he left.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-16\">Schachter appeared in federal court as scheduled at 9 a.m. on March 13, 2000. Julian argues he was not actually engaged on that date, as the parties in Schachter\u2019s federal action, <em>Lee v. Picower Institute, </em>98 Civ 5472 (E.D.N.Y. filed Aug. 7, 1998), told the court in a letter dated March 9, 2000, that they had settled. Schachter states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>that because the settlement was not finalized, the judge refused to mark the case off the trial calender. On March 13, 2000, Schachter states Judge Spatt was persuaded, after hearing from counsel in court, to mark the case settled. Mimco argues Schachter could not appear at the arbitration after his case was marked settled on March 13 because the arbitration had already commenced. Further, with the judge refusing to mark the case off, Schachter argues he had to prepare for trial in his federal court case and could not prepare for arbitration at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The March 13, 2000, arbitration commenced without Mimco. The panel adjourned the scheduled March 14 hearing to April 3 to permit Julian time to secure additional evidence. Julian subpoenaed records from Mimco. Jeremy Bell, another associate, appeared at the April 3, 2000, hearing to deliver the subpoenaed documents, but left the hearing after delivering the documents. The hearing ended April 3, 2000, without the presentation of evidence from Mimco.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The arbitration panel delivered its award in May 2000. The arbitrators said they refused to delay the arbitration because Julian argued any delay would be highly prejudicial, as the disagreement over whether the license was properly terminated prevented Julian from awarding the license to another manufacturer. Further, the arbitrators reasoned Mimco could have found alternate counsel in the month before the hearing. The panel held Mimco in breach, awarded Julian $842,000 plus interest and terminated the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">On May 11, 2000, Mimco filed a petition pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 7511 in New York Supreme Court seeking to vacate the arbitration award. On June 1, 2000, Julian timely filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, along with a cross-petition to confirm the award. The district court denied the petition to vacate and granted the cross-petition to confirm. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">\u201cThe showing required to avoid summary confirmation of an arbitration award is high, and a party moving to vacate the award has the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Willemijn Houdstermaatschappij, B.V. v. Standard Micro. Corp., </em>103 F.3d 9, 12 (2d Cir.1997) (citations omitted). Further, \u201carbitration awards are subject to very limited review in order to avoid undermining the twin goals of arbitration, namely, settling disputes efficiently and avoiding long and expensive litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Legal conclusions made by a district court confirming an arbitration award are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>while findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>DiRussa v. Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., </em>121 F.3d 818, 821 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Federal courts may vacate an arbitration award if \u201cthe arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">This case turns on the standard of review, as the tremendous amount of discretion vested in the arbitrators leaves us with little choice but to affirm their findings. Mimco first argues scheduling the arbitration for the same day its attorney needed to be in federal court falls under the rubric of \u201cany other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced\u201d and is thus considered miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>duct under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(3). Mimco cites no case to support this proposition. Generally, \u201c[c]ourts have interpreted section 10(a)(3) to mean that except where fundamental fairness is violated, arbitration determinations will not be opened up to evidentiary review.\u201d <em>Tempo Shain Corp. v. Bertek, Inc., </em>120 F.3d 16, 20 (2d Cir.1997). \u201cMisconduct typically arises where there is proof of either bad faith or gross error on the part of the arbitrator.\u201d <em>Bisnoff v. King, </em>154 F.Supp.2d 630, 637 (S.D.N.Y.2001) (citations omittted). We cannot say it is fundamentally unfair for the arbitrators to have set the arbitration hearing dates for the exact dates Mimco\u2019s counsel was unavailable. Mimco had ample notice of the arbitrators\u2019 decision to hold the arbitration on the appointed days and could have substituted counsel from Schachter\u2019s <em>firm, </em>or chosen alternate representation. Schachter could also have asked Judge Spatt for an adjournment of the date set for jury selection after learning of the conflict with the arbitration hearing. Notwithstanding the availability of these options, Schachter chose not to appear at the arbitration hearing, without taking precautions against prejudicing the interests of his client. The arbitrators made clear that due to other scheduling conflicts, the hearing could be heard on these three days or not until August, a delay the arbitrators deemed unacceptable. Finally, Mimco simply failed to sustain its burden of proof by showing the arbitration so complex that representation by anyone other than its designated attorney would be fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">We must also agree with the district court that the arbitrators had \u201cat least a barely colorable justification\u201d for denying Mimco\u2019s request for an adjournment. \u201cThe granting or denying of an adjournment falls within the broad discretion of appointed arbitrators.\u201d <em>Tempo Shain, </em>120 F.3d at 18. \u201cIn evaluating an arbitrator\u2019s decision to deny a postponement, courts consider whether there existed a reasonable basis for the arbitrator\u2019s decision and whether the denial created a \u2018fundamentally unfair\u2019 proceeding.\u201d <em>Bisnoff, </em>154 F.Supp.2d at 637. \u201cA fundamentally unfair proceeding may result if the arbitrators fail to \u2018give each of the parties to the dispute an adequate opportunity to present its evidence and argument.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Arbitrators \u201cneed not follow all the niceties observed by the federal courts. [They] need only grant the parties a fundamentally fair hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted). Here, as the district court noted, the arbitrators were entitled to credit Julian\u2019s insistence that it would be prejudiced by a delay. Further, Mimco had ample opportunity for representation at the hearing. It chose to protest the arbitrators\u2019 decision by not putting on a defense. It could have chosen to lodge a vigorous protest about the scheduling while putting on a defense using alternate counsel. Its failure to proceed does not make the hearings fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">We have examined the remainder of Mimco\u2019s arguments and find them without merit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
