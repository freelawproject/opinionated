Cordova\u2019s counsel filed a notice of appeal, but because he could not discern a non-frivolous issue for appeal he now moves to withdraw in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Cordova was notified of his counsel\u2019s motion, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), but did not respond. Counsel\u2019s supporting <em>Anders </em>brief is facially adequate, so we confine our review to the potential issues discussed in that submission. <em>United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997). Because we agree that the potential issues counsel identifies are frivolous, we grant his motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Counsel first discusses whether on appeal Cordova might argue that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. Our review on this issue would be for plain error because Cordova did not ask the district court to set aside his plea. <em>See United States v. Driver, </em>242 F.3d 767, 769 (7th Cir.2001). Having reviewed the transcript from the plea colloquy, we agree with counsel that the district court substantially complied with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The district court first ascertained Cordova\u2019s competence to enter a plea and then explained to him the charge he was pleading guilty to, the potential penalties and consequences, and the rights he was giving up. The district court also inquired into the factual basis for the plea and whether Cordova had been coerced or pressured into pleading guilty. Cordova agreed with the proffered factual basis and stated that he was not coerced or pressured into pleading guilty. The district court did not inform Cordova that his statements made during the plea colloquy could be used against him in a perjury prosecution, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(5), but this omission was harmless because there is no indication of a current or prospective prosecution for perjury. <em>See United States v. Graves, </em>98 F.3d 258, 259 (7th Cir.1996). Therefore, we agree that a challenge to Cordova\u2019s guilty plea would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Counsel next discusses whether Cordova\u2019s sentencing might provide a potential issue for appeal. The district court sentenced Cordova to a 24-month term of imprisonment after calculating his total offense level at 10 and his criminal history category at VI. The offense level was derived from a base level of 8 for a violation of \u00a7 1326(a), see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), a 4-level increase for deportation following a felony, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b), and a 2-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. Cordova had a criminal history of category VI because his past convictions established criminal-history points well above the 13 required to qualify him for that category. Accordingly, Cordova\u2019s offense level and criminal history resulted in a sentencing range of 24 to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the term imposed was both within the statutory maximum and the presumptive guideline sentence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(l). Moreover, we agree with counsel that a challenge to the guideline calculations in this case would be frivolous because Brown waived the right to any such challenge by explicitly electing not to object before the district court. <em>See United States v. Staples, </em>202 F.3d 992, 995 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Accordingly, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
