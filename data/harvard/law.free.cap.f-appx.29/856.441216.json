Corradi III appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of a downward departure based on his susceptibility to abuse while in prison, as well as its denial of a departure based upon his extraordinary family ties and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction to review the final order of the District Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Furthermore, we have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1), (2), because this ruling involved a determination by the District Court as to Whether the facts were such that a departure was called for under the guidelines. We will review the District Court\u2019s ruling for an abuse of discretion. See <em>United States v. Jacobs, </em>167 F.3d 792, 798 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">The District Court assessed Corradi\u2019s physical characteristics: Corradi is apparently of slight build, weighing 160 pounds, and is 5'5\" tall. He pled guilty to possession of visual depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. While Corradi contended that he was immature and behaves in a way that \u201cexudes vulnerability and inexperience,\u201d the District Court, who had the opportunity to observe Corradi, did not find that the circumstances warranted a departure. The court stated: \u201cI don\u2019t find that Mr. Corradi is particularly vulnerable to abuse in prison, and it is certainly not present to such an extreme that his confinement would be much more severe than the norm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">This type of departure has been held to be justified only in extraordinary circumstances. See <em>United States v. Wilke, </em>156 F.3d 749, 753-4 (7th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Drew, </em>131 F.3d 1269, 1271 (8th Cir.1997). It is clear to us that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying a departure on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">We find Corradi\u2019s argument with respect to the departure based on family circumstances to be similarly flawed. Based on the record before us, we conclude that the District Court determined that the facts were not outside the \u201cheartland.\u201d Even though Corradi contended that he had \u201cbeen a help\u201d to his parents by taking them to their medical appointments, and had also helped with the shopping, and some housekeeping, this was not \u201ca strong type showing.\u201d The District Court viewed his evidence as \u201ca little vague, both as to what I will refer to as quality and quantity.\u201d The court noted that this was not a case like <em>United States v. Gaskill, </em>991 F.2d 82 (3d Cir.1993), in which the defendant\u2019s parents were ill and essentially unable to do anything for themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">The District Court even granted Corradi additional time to provide a more complete record but found that even the additional submissions did not present what was necessary. Specifically, the District Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-15\">What is required is a showing that efforts to secure other caretakers were made, that other caretakers were unavailable, that the taxis and social services agencies that are available to transport people in need of medical services to the providers are not available. Unquestionably, it is preferable for Mr. Corradi\u2019s mother to have him perform all these services, simply because he is her son. But that isn\u2019t that is not the standard, as to whether it is preferable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>The standard is far stricter. And I don\u2019t find that [the investigator\u2019s report] meets the standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-4\">Accordingly, I will not depart downward based upon the extraordinary family circumstance arguments that have been made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The District Court applied the proper principles and the relevant law regarding the \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances required. Only where the family circumstances are truly extraordinary should this exception be permitted. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>213 F.3d 95, 100-101 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>531 U.S. 906, 121 S.Ct. 249, 148 L.Ed.2d 180 (2000). The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the downward departure requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Accordingly, we will affirm the Judgment and Commitment Order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
