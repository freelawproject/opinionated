Sha (\u201cSha\u201d) appeals from (a) the District Court\u2019s (Hellerstein, <em>J.) </em>Memorandum and Order of November 29, 2000 granting in part the motion to dismiss of Defendants Appellees Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Richard Barakat, Nadeem Abu Rustum, Dawn Hendricks, Moshe Shike, and Janet Levy, and (b) the court\u2019s order of Order of May 4, 2001 granting Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the remaining claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">On multiple occasions in 1995 and 1996, Sha received treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (\u201cMemorial\u201d) for ovarian cancer and related complications. Sha subsequently brought suit against Memorial and the relevant medical personnel claiming that during her treatment, non-diseased organs were removed without her permission. She alleges that she suffers from either dyslexia, attention deficit disorder, or both and that Defendants failed to get informed consent appropriate to her alleged disability. Sha\u2019s suit includes claims under 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1983, the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cADA\u201d), in addition to state law claims for medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">Defendants moved for dismissal or judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), 12(c). In a Memorandum and Order dated November 29, 2000, the district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion in part and dismissed all claims except for the ADA claim against Memorial.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">Following discovery, in an Order dated May 4, 2001, the district court granted Memorial\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court explained that under the ADA, an individual seeking an accommodation must request one. It added that the record in the case unambiguously established that Sha had not requested such an accommodation. Sha now appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">Because Appellant conceded during oral argument that no claims against the individual Defendants he under the ADA, we consider any appeal from the dismissal of those claims to have been abandoned. As to all Appellant\u2019s other claims under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and \u00a7 1983, we AFFIRM the district court for substantially the reasons it gave. Because we have dismissed all of Appellant\u2019s federal claims, we decline jurisdiction over her state law malpractice claims and on that ground AFFIRM the dismissal of those claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-10\">. Sha earlier moved for reconsideration of the May 9, 2001 order, but the district court denied her motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
