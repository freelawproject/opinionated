The acceptance having been made without consideration, for the accommodation of Pelton, and having had no validity until it was negotiated, and having been first negotiated in Illinois, it had its legal inception there, and the only contract made by the defendants, or created by the transfer of the acceptance, was made there.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-10\">2. The draft is dated at Chicago, and that was the place of residence, and place of business, of the drawer; and the acceptance having been made and delivered for the purpose of being negotiated in Illinois, and used in the business carried on by the drawer in that State, it is clear that the acceptance was made with intentional and direct reference to the laws of Illinois.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-11\">3. Although the signature of the defendants was affixed to the draft in New York, it was not delivered there, but was sent to Pelton, the drawer, at Chicago, by letter, and it was there received and there negotiated by Pelton in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>with the intention of the defendants. In such circumstances the acceptance is to be treated as made in Illinois.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-6\">As the contract is to be governed by the laws of Illinois, the question whether the purchase by Blair was a violation of the usury laws of that State, is a matter to be decided by its own courts. Those courts have held that the usuiy laws do not affect the right to <em>purchase </em>negotiable commercial paper at auy price which may be agreed upon between the parties; that a man who purchases negotiable commercial paper does not make a loan of money.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-7\">This being the true law of the case, and there having in truth been no question of usury in the case, it is Blair, the plaintiff below, not Tilden &amp; Co., who has cause to complain of the judgment. Blair, it is plain, has recovered less than he was entitled to. While the acceptance was $5000, he recovered but $4825, thus losing $175. In. addition he lost the interest from 6th October, 1869, when the note matured, to 2d March, 187-3, when the judgment was rendered. The question now is, whether, inasmuch as the record is brought here by the other side and not by us, we can obtain the relief which we are clearly entitled to? What good reason is there why this court should not correct the error in the judgment of which we complain ? The sole object of a writ of error is to bring into the appellate court the record from the court below, in order that it may be reviewed. The whole case with all the facts found and the conclusions of law as stated, is already before the court on the present writ. By no possibility can the court ever be better informed as to the facts or the alleged error of which we complain. Should Blair be required to sue out a separate writ of error in his own behalf, he would necessarily bring here this same record without the variation of a word. Is such a duplication of this suit required ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-8\">The second section of the act of June 1st, 1872,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>that this court may affirm, modify, or reverse the judgment, decree, or order, brought before it for review, <em>or may direct such judgment, decree, or order, to be </em>rendered, or such further proceeding to be had, by the inferior court, <em>as the justice of the case may require.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arq\">This provision is similar to that contained in section 330 of the Code of Procedure, by which appeals in the State of New York are governed; and according to the decisions of the courts of that State, where the facts are found by a court without the intervention of a jury, it is competent and proper for the appellate tribunal to render such judgment as upon the facts conceded or established either party was entitled to.*</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b256-12\"> Everett <em>v. </em>Vendryes, 19 New York, 436; Hyde <em>v. </em>Goodnow, 3 Id. 266; Cook v.

It is true the defendants formally accepted the draft in New York, and promised to pay at a bank in New York, but there was no operative acceptance until the draft was negotiated. They sent it back to Illinois, where it had been drawn, for the purpose of having it negotiated there. Pelton, the drawer, for whose accommodation the acceptance was given, was thus constituted the agent of the acceptors to give effect to their action. While the draft remained in his hands it was no binding contract. He had no rights as against the defendants, but he was empowered to negotiate the draft, and thereby to initiate a liability not only of himself, but also of the defendants. It was only when the instrument was negotiated that it became an accepted draft. It has long been settled that the liabilit}' of an acceptor does not arise from merely writing his name on the bill, but that it commences with the subsequent delivery to a <em>bond fide </em>holder, or with notice of acceptance given to such holder.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> That this is so has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>often been asserted in judicial decisions, and often in New York.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The doctrine is most reasonable. It is, therefore, quite immaterial, under the facts of this case, that the defendants resided in New York, and that they <em>there </em>wrote their acceptance upon the draft. In legal effect they accepted the draft in Chicago, when by their authority the drawer negotiated it, and thus caused effect to be given to their undertaking. Nor is the law of the contract changed by the fact that the acceptance was made payable in New York. The plaee of payment was doubtless designated for the convenience of the acceptors, or to facilitate the negotiation of the draft. But it is a controlling fact that before the acceptance had any operation \u2014 before the instrument became a bill, the defendants sent it to Illinois for the purpose of having it negotiated in that State \u2014 negotiated, it must be presumed, at such a rate of discount as by the law of that State was allowable. What more cogent evidence could there be that it was intended to create an Illinois bill? The ease is exactly the same as it would be if the. defendants had been residents of Chicago when the draft was drawn, 'and had accepted it at Chicago for the accommodation of the drawer, designating New York as the place of payment. It is plain, therefore, that the contract is an Illinois contract, and that the rights and liabilities of the parties must be determined according to the law of that State. By its statutes persons may contract to receive ten per cent, interest upon any debt due them, whether it be verbal or written. If they stipulate for a higher rate they forfeit the interest, but the statute expressly allows the recovery of the principal. The contract is'not declared to be void. Only so much of it is void as exacts the excessive interest. And by a legislative act passed February 12th, A.D. 1857, it is enacted as follows, viz.: \u201cWhen any contract or loan shall be made in this State, or between citizens of this State and any other State or country, bearing interest at any rate which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>was or shall be lawful according to any law of the State of Illinois, it shall and may be lawful to make the amount of principal and interest of such contract or loan payable in any other State or Territory of the United States, or in the city of London, in England, and in all such cases such contract or loan shall be deemed and considered as governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, and shall not be affected by the laws of the State or country\u2019 where the same shall be made payable.\u201d Provisions very similar to these are also made by the statute of February 12th, 1857.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">If, then, the contract is, as we think it must be regarded, an Illinois contract, and if, therefore, the rights of the plaintiff are to be determined by the laws of that State, there can be no doubt he was entitled to judgment, and to judgment for the full face of the draft, with interest from the time it fell due. Even if the contract had been usurious, he would have been entitled to a judgment for all that the Circuit Court allowed him, for, as we have seen, the contract would not have been void, the statute expressly declaring that when usury is taken the principal debt may be recovered, while the interest reserved may not be. The case would be quite different if the law of the State made void an instrument usuriously negotiated. There was, however, no usury. And where a note or a bill is not made void by statute, mere illegality in its consideration will not affect the rights of a <em>bond fide </em>holder for value.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The plaintiff in this case was a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser of the draft. At the time of his purchase he had no notice of any equities in the drawer, or in the acceptors. There was nothing on the face of the instrument to awaken suspicion that it was accommodation paper, or that it had not been regularly and lawfully negotiated. He bought it from bill brokers, after it had been indorsed by the drawer and payee, and also by Carpenter, an apparent indorsee of the payee. That his purchase was not <em>corrupt; </em>that it was perfectly lawful under the law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Illinois cau admit of no question.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> And this is the rule everywhere uuless the note or bill is declared by statute to be void in its inception.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The plaintiffs in error, therefore, have no cause of complaint. The Circuit Court gave judgment against them for the sum which the plaintiff had paid for the draft, without interest. The judgment was only too favorable to them. It should have been for the full amount of the acceptance, with interest from the time it fell due, and had the case beeu brought here by the plaintiffs below we should direct such a judgment. But the present writ presents to us only the assignments of error made by the defendants, and as they are unsustained, we can do no more than</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Affirm the judgment given.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-9\"> Marquat <em>v. </em>Marquat, 12 New York, 336; Beach <em>v. </em>Cooke, 28 Id. 508; Edmonston <em>v. </em>McLoud, 16 Id. 543; Purchase v.
