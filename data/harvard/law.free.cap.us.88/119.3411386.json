That by the terms of the original charter of Sacramento, in force'when the bonds sued ou were issued, the charter was liable to be altered from time to time, or repealed, and because, in 1863, it bad been altered in such a way as that while it was enacted that the city might be sued by its name on any bond, it was provided that this should be'only when such bond had been made after April 25th, 1863: which was not the case here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-9\">The court below admitted the evidence, and judgment was given for the plaintiff.

The corporation had no president, and .there was no \u201chead\u201d to the corporation, within the meaning of that word, as used in the statute, except the board of trustees sitting as such; each officer had distinct duties prescribed for him in the charter,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> .and each was head \u00f3f his distinct department.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3Z\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>The summons not having been served on the defendant, as provided by statute, the default of the defendant jn the Twelfth District Court was irregularly entered, and the judgment was void.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-5\">2. A municipal corporation cannot be sued except as allowed to be by statute;<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and under the charter of Sacramento, the bondholders took, subject to the contingency, that the charter might be so altered that they must look to payment of their claims without an action of the ordinary kind at law against the city.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-6\"><em>Mr. H.

Indeed, it would seem that a service upon any officer of less grade would not be a compliance with the statute. The legislature doubtless intended, in pursuance of a wise public policy, to guard the city from the consequences which have sometimes followed legislation permitting suits to be prosecuted against municipal corporations where process was served upon any officer of the city government. It is easy to see that in such a case the public interests might suffer, but no reasonable apprehension could be indulged in this regard if the chief officer intrusted by the people with the management of their affairs was notified of the pendency of judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">The decision on this point disposes of the case, for if the service was in conformity with the statute, the court had jurisdiction of the party and the subject-matter, and the judgment is conclusive against the city, until reversed on direct proceedings, by the Supreme Court of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>It is hardly necessary to say that the question of the original liability of the city on the bonds sued upon is not open here. If the city had any defence to make to them, it should have been made when suit was brought against it in the State court.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
