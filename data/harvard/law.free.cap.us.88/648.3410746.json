Whan a claim on tho government, not capable of being otherwise prosecuted, is referred by special net of Congress tq the Court of Claims, acting judicially in its determination, a right of appeal to this court, in the absence of provision to tho contrary, is given by the act of June 25th, 1808 (section 8707 Revised Statutes). That net gives to the United States the right of appeal from the adverse judgment of the said court, in all eases where it is required by any general or special law to take jurisdiction of a claim made against the United States, and net judicially in its determination.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b660-8\">2.

Judgment was rendered in the action on the 18th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>January, 1875, against (he United States for \u00a749,898. From this judgment the United States asked the Court of Claims for the allowance of an appeal to this court, which was refused. The present application was for a mandamus from this court directing the judges of that to allow the appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b661-6\"><em>Mr. J. S.

All this would have been unnecessary if the court was not to be governed by the general laws regulating its practice and \u2022 jurisdiction except so far as they might be modified to meet the necessities of this <em>special </em>caso. So, too, wo find that no provision is made for the payment of any judgment that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>might 1)0 rendered or for any report from the court to Congress, although it must have been expected that a judgment against the United States was at least possible. Such an omission would hardly have occurred if it had not been supposed that provision for payment had already been made in the general law regulating the payment of all judgments of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">From all this we think it manifest that Congress intended to refer this claim to the court for judicial determination and to confer special power and jurisdiction for that purpose. Such being the case the right of appeal necessarily follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Atocha\u2019s case is materially different from this. In that, the claim of Atocha was against Mexico, and the obligation of the United States for its payment grew out of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. By that treaty the United States exonerated Mexico from all demands of their citizens, which had previously arisen and had not been decided against that government, and engaged to satisfy them to an amount not exceeding $3,250,000. They also stipulated for the establishment of a board of commissioners to ascertain the validity and amount of the claims, and provided that its awards should be final. On the 14th of February, 1865, Congress passed a special act for the relief of Atocha, and in it directed the Court of Claims to examine into his claim, and if found to be just and within the treaty, to fix and determine its amount. The act also directed that the amount adjudicated and determined <em>by that court </em>should be paid out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, but the amount to be paid was in no event to exceed the balance of the moneys provided in the treaty for the payment of such claims which remained unapplied to that object. The Court of Claims was of the opinion \u201cthat it was the intention of Congress that the court should proceed, not as a court in trying an action against the United States, but as a commission similar to that provided by the treaty.\u201d And this court construed the act as referring the matter \u201c to the court to ascertain a particular fact to guide the government in the execution of its treaty stipulations,\u201d and held that \u201c as no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>mode was provided for a review of its action, it must be taken and regarded as final.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">We think that the return of the judges of the Court of Claims to the alternative writ in this case is not sufficient, and a</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Peremptory mandamus is ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b661-11\"> 10 Stat. at Large, 612; Revised Statutes, \u00a7 1059.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u00a7\">\n<p id=\"b661-12\"> 12 Stat. at Large, 765; Revised Statutes, J 1060.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b662-8\"> 12 Stat. at Large, 766; Revised Statutes, <em>\u00a7 </em>1089.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b662-9\"> 15 Stat. at Large, 75.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
