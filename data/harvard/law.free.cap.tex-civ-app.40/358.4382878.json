The testimony shows that appellee was engaged as a stonemason, together with two other workmen, on the side wall of a culvert on appellant\u2019s road at Rockdale. He was standing on a scaffold, about four feet from the ground, and engaged in laying stones. Appellant had another crew of employes working at the same time and place under a different foreman. These were known as the piledriver gang. At the time in question, they were working on the trestle, and the scaffold on which they were working was about 18 feet from the ground. It was not directly over the scaffold on which appellee was. standing, but about 13 or 14 feet to one side of it. It became necessary for the piledriver gang to remove the scaffold or staging used by them, and while one of them was taking it down, he shoved off a plank which struck appellee and caused the injuries complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The petition charged, and the jury evidently found, that it was negligence to remove the plank in the manner disclosed by appellee\u2019s testimony without first giving him warning. Appellee was not working with the piledriver gang, and did not assume the risk resulting from the negligence complained of. (Brown v. Sullivan, 71 Texas, 470; Railway v. Silliphant, 70 Texas, 633; Railway v. Brock, 3 Texas Law Journal, 188; Railway v. Pelfrey, 4 Texas Law Jour., 766; Railway v. Jonte, 10 Texas Ct. Rep., 63.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The fourth assignment complains of the charge of the court wherein the jury were informed that they were \u201cbound to receive the law of the case from the court, as given you in this charge, and be governed thereby in arriving at your verdict.\u201d The contention is that the language quoted had a tendency to mislead the jury and prevent them from considering a special charge requested by appellant and given by the court. We do not think the language referred to is susceptible of that construction. Its object and purpose was to impress upon the jury the fact that they were to obtain the law of the case from the court, whether given of its own motion or by request. The requested instruction related to the question of release, which had already been covered by the court\u2019s charge; and there being no conflict between the charges given upon that subject, we do not think the jury were misled by the language complained of, though \"the special charge may have been more elaborate than the court\u2019s charge upon that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The other assignments complain of the verdict, which we find to be supported by testimony. All the assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
