Ry. v. Ryon, 80 Texas, 59; Missouri Pac. Ry. v. Artusy, 73 Texas, 191; Beach, Con. Neg., 183.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\">Where a suit of the kind in question is based upon alleged negligence on the part of the employes in failing to give the statutory signals when approaching a certain public crossing, such employes should be allowed to testify as to their habit or custom in reference to giving such signals for said crossing, notwithstanding they may not be able to remember whether this was done on the particular occasion in question, when their attention is first called to such alleged failure months after the occurrence. Texas &amp; Pac. Ry. v. Crutcher, 82 S. W. Rep., 340; Craven v. Central Pac. Ry. Co., 72 Cal., 345; State v. Manchester <em>&amp; </em>L. Ry. Co., 52 N.

McMahon </em>and <em>Thurmond &amp; Steger, </em>for appellee.-</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ax7\">In its motion for a new trial appellant did not claim nor set up that the damages awarded plaintiff for loss of time might be excessive, or were so; and appellant did not ask a charge limiting the amount recovered for loss of time to that alleged in the petition; but if the court should overrule this objection and uphold said assignment, then appellee says that it is willing to remit, and does here remit, any or all such sums as the court may find that the jury might have allowed in excess of. that claimed in the petition. The court did not err in refusing the charges asked, because the matters of law covered by said charges were fully presented in the general charge and the special charges given at the request of appellant. Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. Thomas, 28 S. W. Rep., 139.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-7\">The court did not err in refusing to permit the witnesses Moore and Mann to testify that it was their habit and custom to give the statutory signals on approaching public crossings, and especially so, as there had been direct testimony introduced that no such signals were given at the time and place in question. International &amp; G. N. Ry. Co. v. Gilbert, 64 Texas, 541; Moore v. Kennedy, 81 Texas, 147.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b111-8\">KEY, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AZz\">This is a personal injury suit, and from a judgment in favor of the plaintiff the defendant prosecutes this appeal. The plaintiff alleged in his petition that he was confined to his bed ten days at a loss of $3.50 per day; that was the only averment in referenc\u00e9 to loss of time. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony tends to show that he lost fifteen whole days of time, and parts of an uncertain number of other days on account of the injuries complained'of, all of which time he testified was worth $2.50 per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">As to the measure of damages the court instructed the jury as fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>lows: \u201cIf you find a verdict for plaintiff yon may, in estimating his damages, consider any injury to his buggy; any loss of time by him; any reasonable expense for physician; any reasonable expense for medicine, and any bodily and mental pain suffered by plaintiff, which the evidence may' show is the direct result to plaintiff of the injuries, or damages, if any, caused by the negligence of defendant, and assess such amount \u00e1s will, in your judgment, reasonably compensate him therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\">This instruction is assigned as error, because it authorized the jury to allow the plaintiff more compensation for loss of time than was authorized by his pleading. The assignment is well taken, and, as there was testimony tending to show greater damage resulting from loss of time than was set up in the plaintiff\u2019s petition, the error complained of was material; and the evidence on the subject being too indefinite for the error to be cured by remittitur, a reversal must follow. (City of Dallas v. Jones, 93 Texas, 38; Texas &amp; Pac. Ry. v. Taylor, 58 S. W. Rep., 844.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">We also hold that appellant\u2019s requested instruction number eleven should have been given. The court\u2019s charge on the subject of contributory negligence was general, while the requested instruction referred to was more specific; and, being correct in form, it was error to refuse to give it.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Ho error was committed in refusing to permit the engineer and fireman who were running the train on the occasion in question to testify that it was their habit or custom to ring the bell and blow the whistle at the place where the accident occurred. (Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. Johnson, <em>92 </em>Texas, 380.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Some other questions are presented, on all of which we rule against the' appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">For the errors pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
