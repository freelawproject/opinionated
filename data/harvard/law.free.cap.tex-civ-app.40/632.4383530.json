D. 1903, styled W. J. Lee v. T. L. Hickson, No. 1763, upon the alleged ground that said judgment was procured by the false and fraudulent testimony of defendant\u2019s witness B. G. Sweet, said suit being an action in trespass to try title to half section No. 4, certificate No. 3152, G. C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. land in Brown County, and for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-16\">The court below, after hearing the case on its merits, refused to vacate said original judgment, and again rendered judgment for said defendant Hickson and also for interveners in this suit for the land in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-17\">Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error complain of the action of the court below in overruling his exception to defendant Hick-son\u2019s answer, based upon the ground that said answer was not sworn to and did not deny the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s petition. While the judgment of the court below recites that the court overruled the exceptions of plaintiff to defendant\u2019s pleadings, \u25a0 we find no exceptions, either general or special, of plaintiff to defendant Hickson\u2019s pleadings contained in the record; and, for this reason, these assignments need not be considered. However, there is an answer contained in the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>for defendant Hickson, signed by his attorney, not sworn - to, which denies all the allegations embraced in plaintiff\u2019s petition. We know of no rule of law, and appellant has cited no authority, holding that an answer in this character of case should be sworn to, or that it could hot be filed and presented by an attorney. Hence we overrule appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is not well taken. The court below properly permitted King and Harrison to intervene in this cause. The order of the court allowing them to intervene recites that the plaintiff, in open court, agreed that they might be allowed to inter-vene in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">There being no statement of facts legally in the record, appellant\u2019s other assignments of error, all of which relate to matters of evidence, can not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
