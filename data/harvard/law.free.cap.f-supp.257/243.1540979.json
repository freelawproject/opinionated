Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company, et al., 325 I.C.C. 400 (1965). The order held that the export rates for cotton from specified origins in northern Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico were unduly prejudicial to the port of Corpus Christi and unduly preferential to the ports of Houston and Galveston, in violation of Section 3(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A. Section 3U).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court concludes that the order is supported by substantial evidence, is consistent with Section 3(1), and meets the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. Section 1001, et seq. This court enforces the order by denying relief and dismissing the cause on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-21\">This court properly performs only a very limited role in reviewing a decision of an administrative body such as the ICC. Once a rational basis for the conclusions of an administrative body is found, the judicial function is ended. Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co. v. United States, 292 U.S. 282, 286-287, 54 S.Ct. 692, 78 L.Ed. 1260 (1934). Courts are not empowered to weigh the wisdom of a particular decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-22\">\u201cIt cannot substitute its own view concerning what should be done, whether with reference to competitive considerations or others, for the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>mission\u2019s judgment upon matters committed to its determination, if that has support in the record and the applicable law.\u201d United States v. Pierce Auto Freight Lines, Inc., 327 U.S. 515, 536, 66 S.Ct. 687, 698, 90 L.Ed. 821 (1946).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Courts have long recognized the application of this principle to discriminatory rail rate situations and pointed to the particular considerations which support the rule in this area. Whether a discrimination or preference is undue, unreasonable and unjust is a determination for the ICC to make. Nashville, C. &amp; St. L. Ry. v. State of Tennessee, 262 U.S. 318, 322, 43 S.Ct. 583, 67 L.Ed. 999 (1923). A court \u201chas no concern with the correctness of the Commission\u2019s reasoning, with the soundness of its conclusions, or with the alleged inconsistency with findings made in other proceedings before it.\u201d Virginian Ry. v. United States, 272 U.S. 658, 665-666, 47 S.Ct. 222, 225, 71 L.Ed. 463 (1926). Congress has constituted the ICC as the expert body which is informed by experience to determine whether undue discriminations exist in rail rates.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">\u201cThe complexities and involvements of railroad rates are not to be shifted from the shoulders of the experts commissioned to handle them to the backs of the judiciary; nor are the broad powers of judgment conferred upon the experts to be unduly hampered.\u201d Koppers Company, Inc. v. United States, 166 F.Supp. 96, 103 (W.D.Pa. 1958).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">This court must determine whether the Commission has followed correct legal procedures and principles, but beyond that this court is permitted no greater role than ascertaining whether there exists a rational basis for the ICC order.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">\u201c * * * We would depart from our competence and our limited function in this field if we undertook to accommodate the factors of transportation conditions, distance and competition differently than the Commission has done in this case. This is a task peculiarly for it.\u201d Ayrshire Collieries Corp. v. United States, 335 U.S. 573, 593, 69 S.Ct. 278, 289, 93 L.Ed. 243 (1949).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">The ICC findings under review here are sketchy and present this court with difficulties which more explicit findings would remove. The ICC opinion is so imprecise in revealing just what findings it is making that the order borders dangerously on running afoul of the requirement that agencies disclose the basis of their orders.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">However, this court concludes that the findings are adequate under Section 8 (b) of the Administrative Procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Act, 5 U.S.C.A. Section 1007(b). No purpose would be accomplished by returning the case to the ICC for further findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The ICC decision here must be tested on the basis of what it contains, and not on any new ideas offered to support it. The United States, the ICC, and the defendant intervenors have offered new rationales for the ICC order, but whatever their merits, such suggestions could only call for remand to the agency for consideration. S. E. C. v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94-95, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">However, plaintiffs have repeatedly insisted that a remand to secure more precise findings would accomplish nothing. They maintain that the factual record is so deficient that no findings, however explicit, can support the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">This court deems that the ICC was aware of what it was doing and intended the result it achieved. It did not purpose to go outside traditional guidelines or to establish new precedents designed to advance the equalization of all ports. New or improved findings would not serve to articulate the process of decision and expose the factual weaknesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The order stands or falls on the sufficiency of the findings made and the evidence to support them.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">Before the ICC can equalize rates, there must be an adequate factual showing of (a) prejudice, and (b) prejudice which is undue resulting from a rate disparity or \u201cmisalignment of rates\u201d. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. v. United States, 218 F.Supp. 359, 363 (N.D.Ill., 1963). Plaintiffs assert that to make an initial showing of prejudice, rates to the more distant port must be shown to be higher <em>relative mileage considered </em>than those to the nearer port. If the rates <em>per mile </em>are not higher to the more distant port, plaintiffs claim that there is no showing of prejudice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">This court squarely rejects this mechanical definition of prejudice. Prejudice is a practical consequence in the practical world of transportation. That Corpus Christi is prejudiced is established by uncontradicted testimony in the record. Corpus Christi has ample shipping facilities and liner services. It is geographically and frequently by highway distances closer to this cotton origin territory than Houston-Galveston, yet Corpus Christi cannot get a single bale of cotton by rail for export.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Corpus Christi now gets practically no cotton from these origins by truck.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This result is a direct consequence of the rail rate structure. Shippers decline to ship cotton to Corpus Christi simply because it costs about 25(5 per bale more than does shipping to Houston-Galveston. Per mile or \u201cdistance considered\u201d rates do not figure in their calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>If this result flows from the natural advantage and location of Houston-Galveston and the natural disadvantage of Corpus Christi in relation to them, then the ICC lacks authority to equalize the rail rates. \u201cThe law does not attempt to equalize fortune, opportunities, or abilities.\u201d I. C. C. v. Diffenbaugh, 222 U.S. 42, 46, 32 S.Ct. 22, 24, 56 L.Ed. 83(1911). \u201c* * * the natural advantage which belongs to a locality does not constitute a preference.\u201d Baltimore &amp; O. R. R. v. United States, 151 F.Supp. 258, 275 (D.Md., 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">However, there is more to natural advantage and location than geographic mileage differences, and shorter mileage to one port does not automatically give immunity from' rate equalization.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">\u201cIt is true that the law does not attempt to equalize opportunities among localities, Interstate Commerce Commission v. Diffenbaugh, 222 U.S. 42, 46, 32 Sup.Ct. 22, 56 L.Ed. 83, and that the advantage which comes to a shipper merely as a result of the position of his plant does not constitute an illegal preference. * * * To bring a difference in rates within the prohibition of section 3, it must be shown that the discrimination practiced is unjust when measured by the transportation standard. In other words, the difference in rates cannot be held illegal, unless it is shown that it is not justified by the cost of the respective services, by their values, or by other transportation conditions.\u201d United States v. Illinois Central Ry., 263 U.S. 515, 524, 44 S.Ct. 189, 193, 68 L.Ed. 417 (1924).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">While mileage is important, the \u201ctransportation standard\u201d includes other transportation conditions. Boston &amp; M. R. R. v. United States, 202 F.Supp. 830 (D.Mass., 1962), aff\u2019d 373 U.S. 372, 83 S. Ct. 1312, 10 L.Ed.2d 419 (1963), 374 U.S. 859 (1963); Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. v. United States, 231 F.Supp. 422, 430 (N.D.Ill., 1964); City of Wilmington v. Alabama G. S. Ry., 316 ICC 709, 724-5 (1962). The Commission pointed out that the Corpus Christi and Houston-Galveston ports had been equalized on cotton for a number of years before the railroads voluntarily reduced their rates to Houston. Rail rates for certain other commodities from these origins and others are equalized between the ports, some voluntarily and some by order of the ICC.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The ICC found that \u201cThe general terrain of the territory over which the defendants operate is the same whether the traffic moves to Corpus Christi or Houston-Galveston.\u201d (325 ICC 406). The ICC conclusion that Corpus Christi\u2019s disadvantage amounts to undue prejudice was clearly stated: \u201cTransportation conditions are substantially the same from points of origin, although the distances are slightly more to Corpus Christi.\u201d (325 ICC 408).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">The question of mileage is not a simple one, as the ICC emphasized. The examiner preferred percentage comparisons of short-line distances from 19 selected origins which gave an average difference of 14%. The Corpus Christi interest urged a weighted average which produced smaller variations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The ICC considered the docket No. 28300 distances urged by Galveston interests which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>showed variations of 120 to 160 miles, or 20% on longer hauls and 60% on shorter hauls. The ICC did not reject the other standards, but emphasized docket No. 28300 distances to give consideration to the greatest mileage differences presented. Using these computations which showed the greatest mileage variations, the ICC made two findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\">(1) \u201cIn relating export rates, distance is an important factor; however, equal rates have been required to related ports even where there have been substantial differences in distances.\u201d (325 ICC 408).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">(2) \u201cSuch ranges in distance have existed in prior proceedings from substantially the same origins to the same Texas ports * * * and equal rates have been required.\u201d (325 ICC 408.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The short-line route from Lubbock, Texas, the center of the heavy cotton production area, to Corpus Christi is 67 miles farther than to Galveston, which in turn is 45 miles farther than Houston. The railroads' have already equalized Galveston and Houston, so the required equalization here is an additional 22 mile difference on a 646 mile haul.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The prior equalization of rates from these origins for other commodities is a relevant transportation condition. The ICC concluded that \u201cno different conclusion is warranted in the instant proceedings.\u201d (325 ICC 408). This court cannot say that this decision was without a rational basis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Considering the record and findings as a whole, this court concludes that the ICC gave due consideration to the distance factor, and that its ultimate conclusion was well within its \u201cbroad discretion * * * to accommodate the factors of transportation conditions, distance and competition.\u201d Ayrshire Collieries Corp. v. United States, supra; 335 U.S. at 593, 69 S.Ct. at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">It is therefore the opinion of this court that the ICC order should be enforced and the complaints dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-15\">.
