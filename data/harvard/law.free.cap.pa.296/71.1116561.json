The death certificate stated that \u201carthritis\u201d was a \u201ccontributory cause\u201d to his demise. The surgeon-in-chief of the hospital in question, who attended Dopkin and who gave the death certificate, testified that there was nothing in the institution \u201cthat would give him pneumonia,\u201d adding, \u201cother than this injury and arthritis.\u201d He said that his patient \u201cfailed dreadfully while in bed,\u201d and that this rendered him \u201csusceptible to pneumonia\u201d; finally, that, in his opinion, the injury suffered by Dopkin at the time of the accident was \u201ca contributory cause\u201d to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>A doctor called by defendant said he did not \u201cthink\u201d the injury had anything to do with Dopkin\u2019s death, because, in this witness\u2019s opinion, \u201cthe pneumonia...... was caused by a pneumococcus, and the arthritis was just an inflammation of the joint\u201d; but, on cross-examination, he stated that, the pneumococcus might have affected the joint, and, in\u2019 answer to the question, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what germ affected the joint?\u201d he replied, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">On this state of the evidence, it was for the compensation authorities to decide the facts; and the referee found that Dopkin\u2019s death was \u201ccontributed to by the injury that he sustained while in the employ of defendant.\u201d This finding was approved by the board, and, on appeal, by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In Kelly v. Watson Coal Co., 272 Pa. 39, 41-2, the compensation authorities found that \u201cthe injuries sustained by the decedent......so lowered his vital resistance that a tubercular condition quickly developed, hastening and causing his death.\u201d We there said that the medical testimony showed the accident to have been \u201ca contributory cause of the development of the tuberculosis which resulted in his, Kelly\u2019s, death,\u201d and that, \u201cunder our cases, this was sufficient to warrant and sustain the award,\u201d citing authorities. Again, in Farran v. Curtis Pub. Co., 276 Pa. 553, 556, this court said that where the testimony of .the medical expert is \u201csufficiently exact to satisfy the mind of the referee or board that the accident......contributed to claimant\u2019s condition,\u201d ordinarily we would not interfere with the finding made by the compensation authorities. Of course, in this class of cases, it is necessary for the medical experts relied on by the claimant to testify not only that, in their professional opinion, the condition caused by the accident might have contributed to the death of the injured person, but further, that it did so contribute, though \u201csuch testimony need not be given in any par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>ticular words\u201d: Johnston v. Payne-Yost C. Co., 292 Pa. 509, 515; Rushonosky v. Lehigh Valley Coal Co., 293 Pa. 150, 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
