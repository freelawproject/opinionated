At the same term,\u2019 however, it struck off that judgment, on motion of defendants, because not \u201cbased on the opinion or action of the court on the pleadings, but on an alleged default of the defendants in failing to file an answer to the rule [to show cause] which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>called for judgment on the pleadings, and not for judgment by default\u201d; at the same time, it reviewed the pleadings and held they raised an issue of fact, which would have to be decided by a jury. Plaintiff appeals; and in determining whether he was entitled to the summary judgment which he alleges the court below erred in striking off, every relevant fact pleaded by defendants, and all proper inferences therefrom, must be accepted as true, and all reasonable doubts must be resolved in their favor: Smith v. Miller, 289 Pa. 184, 190; Moore v. Luzerne County, 262 Pa. 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Both parties claim title through Agnes Mistysyn Berzowiski (hereinafter called testatrix), who died seized in fee of the property in dispute. She left a will which was duly probated, but has not been printed for our information. She left surviving her, seven minor children, who would have been her heirs at law if she had died intestate, and they and their fiduciaries are the defendants in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s alleged title is as follows: Rev. Y. M. Skrotsky, upon a petition which falsely averred testatrix had died intestate, obtained letters of administration on her estate; two days later he secured the appointment of a guardian of the estates of her minor children, and the latter, about a month and a half thereafter, presented to the orphans\u2019 court a petition for leave to sell the property at private sale, to Skrotsky, the administrator, personally, without advising the court that he was the administrator. Leave was granted, a deed was made by the guardian to Skrotsky, as whose property it was later sold by the sheriff, on a judgment against him, and a deed made by the sheriff to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Defendants\u2019 abstract of title admits the records and deeds referred to in plaintiff\u2019s abstract, but avers .that the orphans\u2019 court sale was obtained through the collusive fraud of Skrotsky and the guardian, of which plaintiff had knowledge by reason of a notice, setting forth the facts, which was read at the sale immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>before the property was sold by the sheriff. Defendants\u2019 pleadings fully stated the facts from which a jury could properly find the fraud; but it is not necessary to specify them here, since plaintiff (by his statement of the questions involved, which limits the scope of the appeal: Com. ex rel. v. Snyder, 294 Pa. 555), does not question their sufficiency to show the fraud, but only denies defendants\u2019 right to prove them in the present state of the record. If their sufficiency had -been challenged, we would unhesitatingly reach the same conclusion on the point as the court below did.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\">Plaintiff\u2019s first contention is that the decree of the orphans\u2019 court, authorizing the .guardian to sell the property to Skrotsky, being unappealed from and unreversed, is a conclusive bar to defendants\u2019 claim. This would be so, of course, but for the fraud averred in the pleadings. \u201cBut in the eye of the law, fraud spoils everything it touches. The broad seal of the Commonwealth is crumbled into dust, as against the interest designed to be defrauded. Every\" transaction of life between individuals, in which it mingles, is corrupted by its contagion. Why then, should it find shelter in the decrees of courts? <em>There </em>is the last place on earth where it ought to find refuge. But it is not protected by record, judgment or decree; whenever and wherever it is detected, its disguises fall from around it, and the lurking spirit of mischief, as if touched by the spear of Ithuriel, stands exposed to the rebuke and condemnation of the law\u201d: Mitchell v. Kintzer, 5 Pa. 216, 217. This principle has never been doubted by-us; on the contrary, it has often been recognized and applied: Jackson v. Summerville, 13 Pa. 359, 369; Phelps v. Benson, 161 Pa. 418; Smith v. Markland, 223 Pa. 605, 629; West Homestead Borough v. Erbeck, 230 Pa. 316, 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Plaintiff next contends that defendants are estopped because they did not appeal, from the. refusal of the orphans\u2019 court to vacate the decree authorizing the private sale to Skrotsky, after they had, by petition filed, sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>relief therefrom. This is but part of the story, however. The petition was \u201crefused without prejudice,\u201d solely because certain creditors of Skrotsky, who had obtained judgments pending the proceeding, had not been notified thereof. It would have been wiser if the orphans\u2019 court, instead of dismissing the petition, had directed petitioners to give notice to those judgment creditors, as it would also for petitioners to have done so, of their own motion, after they knew the court thought this a necessary prerequisite to the relief sought; but these omissions do not alter the fact that the petition was simply \u201crefused without prejudice,\u201d the effect of which was to leave the parties in the same position as if it had never been presented: House v. Mullen, 22 Wallace 42; 16 Cyc. 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The record further shows that while Skrotsky, by virtue of the deed from the guardian, had entered into possession of property, \u2014 without even paying the inadequate purchase price stated in the decree of the orphans\u2019 court, \u2014 subsequently, and before plaintiff obtained his alleged title from the sheriff, Skrotsky had been ousted by defendants, by virtue of a judgment in ejectment in a suit by them against him. By this proceeding, the effect of the decree of the orphans\u2019 court was wholly overcome so far as Skrotsky was concerned, and probably as to plaintiff also, since his title was derived by a sale under a judgment against Skrotsky, after notice of the fraud, and judgment creditors are not within the protection of the recording acts: Cover v. Black, 1 Pa. 493; Reed\u2019s Appeal, 13 Pa. 476; Shryock v. Waggoner, 28 Pa. 430; Lancaster County National Bank\u2019s Appeal, 127 Pa. 214; Kauffman v. Kauffman, 266 Pa. 270. It is not necessary to decide this point, however; it is sufficient that the fact stated conclusively determines that there is no basis for plaintiff\u2019s final suggestion that he was entitled to believe defendants had abandoned their contention that Skrotsky\u2019s title was obtained by fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The order of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
