When his employment terminated, plaintiff claimed there was due him under the terms of the contract the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>sum of $43,488.32 and brought this suit, to recover it. He was nonsuited by the learned trial judge and from the refusal to take off the nonsuit, he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The contract provided that appellant should be paid a salary at the rate of $10,000 a year, $6,000 in monthly installments of $500 each and the balance, $4,000, out of the \u201cnet profits, if any,\u201d of the business at the end of each year. The writing further provided: \u201cFourth. As additional compensation or bonus the employer shall pay the employee fifty per cent of the divided profits during the life of this contract.\u201d The salary, including that part payable out of net profits, has all been paid and the claim is made under the provision for the payment of an additional compensation or bonus of fifty per cent of the divided profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Plaintiff, however, did not prove that there had been any profits divided. All he established was that as of the date of the termination of the contract defendant by its balance sheet showed the following statement of its affairs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">Cash......................... $5,309.72</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">Notes receivable .............. 10,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">Accounts receivable ........... 252,863.40</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">Contracts in process........... 4,563.58</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-11\">Materials &amp; supplies........... 19,165.65</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-12\">Prepaid expense............... 1,056.90</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-13\">Investments .................. 450.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-14\">Plant &amp; equipment............ 168,626.03</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-15\">-$462,035.28</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-16\">Notes payable................. $40,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-17\">Notes receivable discounted---- 10,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-18\">Accounts payable.............. 112,167.44</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-19\">Accrued expense .............. 515.20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-20\">Accrued salaries .............. 4,626.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-21\">Mortgage payable............. 13,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-22\">Capital stock................. 150,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-23\">Surplus ...................... 131,726.64</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-24\">\u2022$462,035.28</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>' It is argued that the surplus as thus shown, less the sum of $30,000 provided in the agreement to be set aside as working capital, is divided profits. It is a little difficult to follow the line of reasoning which would make it so. The surplus may not indicate real profits at all, certainly not profits made during the term of appellant\u2019s employment and in no event divided profits. This was merely a bookkeeping statement to show the books in balance. If the item of plant and equipment should be reduced when actual intrinsic values come to be taken into account, as very likely it might be, this charge would lower its surplus figures. The agreement itself recognizes two classes of profits, \u201cnet profits\u201d and \u201cdivided profits.\u201d In construing the writing, the latter term could no more be disregarded than the former. The word \u201cdivided\u201d as the parties used it must be given its meaning and play its part in their understanding. It is clear to us that what was meant was profits which had been set aside \u2014 divided from accumulated surplus as profits, and declared as such for division among those entitled to them, plaintiff and the company\u2019s stockholders. Until the proper officials of the company, its board of directors, weighing the financial standing of the concern, deemed it wise to set aside for division as profits moneys in the company\u2019s treasury so accumulated, there were no \u201cdivided profits\u201d and consequently plaintiff has no claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
