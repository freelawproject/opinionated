He was operated on for a stomach condition on May 4th and returned to work June 29, 1953. The complainant worked until August 14, 1953, at which time the incision of the first operation pulled loose.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">It is the contention of Roberts that a board struck him in the vicinity of the incision causing it to pull loose. It is not disputed that the incision was responsible for a rupture. The complainant received medical aid and was sewed up with stainless steel wire. The proof shows that complainant has not been able to work since March 29, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">It is the insistence of the complainant that he could not work and perform manual labor because these wires are a source of constant irritation to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">Doctor Budd testified that the wire could cause constant irritation. The evidence shows that complainant is a man of quite limited education and his only means of earning a living is through manual labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The record shows that when the complainant returned to work he was unable to perform the task of handling heavy lumber.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">It is well settled that under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws an employee may recover for a new injury or an aggravation of his injury resulting from medical or surgical treatment of a compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">There is abundant evidence in the record to sustain the finding of the Chancellor.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">We find no error in the decree below and it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
