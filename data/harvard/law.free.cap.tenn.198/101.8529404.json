This accident arose out of, and in the course of, his employment by defendant, J. C. La Rue, whose business fell within the requirements of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The doctor who represented both the employer and his insurer was immediately called. That doctor found Lynch\u2019s condition \u201cpretty low\u201d, with a blood count that was \u201cvery low\u201d. His head was hurting. In response to an inquiry as to what those symptoms indicated, this doctor said \u201cyou get that from an electrical shock, or you can get it from any shock\u201d. Six weeks thereafter he discharged Lynch as \u201ccompletely recovered\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Lynch immediately went back to work, but for another employer. With the exception of a short interruption for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>an appendix operation in December of 1945, and tonsil and bemorrboid operations in 1946 be worked regularly until September of 1952. He then consulted Ms doctor with reference to tbe cause of a \u201cdrawing\u201d in tbe back of bis neck wbicb be first noticed in August, 1952. Tbis was followed in October of 1952 by blackout spells and drowsiness preceded by prolonged severe beadacbes.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\">His physician, Dr. Woods, sent bim to Dr. McClure, a neurological surgeon for further diagnosis. An X ray of bis skull revealed tbe fact that Lynch bad a \u201ccerebrovas-cular disease\u201d. An operation followed. He continues under treatment by Dr. McClure.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Within a few months after tbe discovery of tbis physical condition, Lynch brought tbis suit against bis employer, La Rue, on tbe theory that tbe disease wbicb was first discovered in October of 1952 was caused by tbe aforesaid electrical shock received in August of 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">One of tbe three reasons given by tbe Trial Judge for tbe dismissal of tbe petition is that tbe evidence \u201cfailed to show any causal connection between tbe accident and the injuries complained of in bis petition\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Only two of tbe doctors were asked about any connection between tbe 1945' accident and tbe 1952 disease. One of these was Dr. Powers, tbe physician who attended bim immediately after tbe 1945 accident. When asked whether tbe brain condition found by Dr. McClure \u201ccould have been\u201d caused by tbe 1945 electrical shock be replied \u201cWell, I am not an expert witness, understand, but it could have been, yet, I am not saying yes \u2019 \u2019. He repeated that be was not saying yes, but that \u201cit is possible\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Tbe testimony of Dr. McClure as to tbe cause of tbis brain disease discovered in 1952 is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u201cThe cause of this trouble is difficult to definitely define, although there are several possible causes in his case, namely, a severe electrical burn over the right side of his head ten years ago, with an extreme nervous tension ever since, either of which factors could be responsible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-3\">There is no evidence that Mr. Lynch suffered \u2018 \u2018 an extreme nervous tension ever since\u201d the 1945 accident. The evidence is quite the contrary. Therefore, Dr. McClure\u2019s testimony is that the electrical shock received in 1945 \u201ccould be responsible\u201d for the brain condition discovered by Dr. McClure.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">It is to be noted that neither of the medical witnesses was willing to express an opinion that there is a causal relation between the 1945 accident and the brain disease discovered in 1902. The extent to which they would go is that, in the language of Dr. Powers, such causal connection \u201cis possible\u201d or, in the words of Dr. McClure, \u201ccould be responsible\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">It is elementary that an award cannot be predicated solely upon the testimony of medical experts who are not willing to go any further than to say that it \u201cis possible\u201d or <em>1 \u2018 </em>could be \u2019 \u2019 that there is a causal connection between the accident and the injury for which compensation is sought. However, such testimony is not entirely without value if there be other evidence from which the trial judge may reasonably infer that the injury did result from the accident that the experts say \u201ccould be\u201d the cause of the injury. Read the discussion in Volume 4 N. A. C. 0. A. Law Journal, page 78, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The only other evidence in this record with reference to this causal connection question is that of the injured employee, Mr. Lynch. His testimony is that the only head <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>injury lie ever had in Ms life was the one received at the time of the 1945 accident and that the only electricity shock he ever received was in the 1945 accident. In connection with this evidence, we have the testimony of two medical experts that the 1945 accident \u2018\u2018could be\u201d the cause of the trouble discovered in 1952. In view of the evidence stated, nothing else appearing, a reasonable inference is that there is a causal connection between the 1945 accident and the brain trouble in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">But Mr. Lynch also testified that from the time he was released by Dr. Powers in September of 1945 as a \u201ccompletely recovered\u201d person he never suffered any pain about his head until September of 1952, and until that time \u201cfelt perfectly normal\u201d in every manner except for the appendix and tonsil operations heretofore mentioned, and had no pains or blackouts or any other trouble with his head during all those intervening years. In connection with this evidence, we have the testimony of Dr. McClure that it is difficult to define the cause of this brain disease, though there are several possible causes. In view of the evidence stated, a reasonable inference is that there is no causal connection between the 1945 accident and the brain disease in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Thus it is that the facts established by the undisputed evidence make reasonable each of two contrary inferences. One of these inferences supports a conclusion of a causal connection. The other supports an opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In that situation, the trial judge, in his findings of fact, stated that Mr. Lynch \u201chas failed to carry the burden of proof that his injury arose out of and in the course of his employment\u201d. The language used to state the same result in the judgment is that the evidence \u201cfailed to show any causal connection between the accident and the injuries complained of in his petition\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The record being as stated, the disposition to he made of this appeal is controlled by <em>Hartwell Motor Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hicherson, </em>160 Tenn. 513, 519-520, 26 S. W. (2d) 153, wherein it is held that if the findings of the trial judge are supported by inferences which may reasonably be had from the evidence, though that evidence be reasonably capable of opposing inferences, a reviewing court will not disturb those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Aside from <em>Hartwell Motor Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hickerson, </em>supra, the evidence in this case supporting the one conclusion or the opposite upon the issue of causal connection is such that a reviewing court cannot reasonably hold that the trial judge was wrong in finding that Mr. Lynch has failed to carry the burden of proof upon this question of causal connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">For the reasons stated the judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
