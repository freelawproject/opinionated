We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and affirm its decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Husketh v. Sills, </em>No. CA-01-682-3-MU-02 (W.D.N.C. Jan. 9, 2002). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-10\">. We interpret the district court\u2019s dismissal as being without prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-11\">. Husketh\u2019s claim is barred because his challenge of his parole eligibility implies the invalidity of his continued confinement, and Husketh makes no showing that his conviction or sentence has been invalidated or called into question by the issuance of a federal writ of habeas corpus. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); <em>McGrew v. Texas Bd. of Pardons &amp; Paroles, </em>47 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir.1995) (holding action challenging validity of parole proceedings calls into question fact of confinement and thus must satisfy <em>Heck </em>element).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
