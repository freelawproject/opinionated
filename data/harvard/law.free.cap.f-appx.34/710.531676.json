We have jurisdiction under 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 607(g)(1)(A). Because the Board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and is not contrary to law, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The scope of our review of the Board\u2019s decision is governed by 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 609(b), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">[T]he decision of the agency board on any question of law shall not be final or conclusive, but the decision on any question of fact shall be final and conclusive and shall not be set aside unless the decision is fraudulent, or arbitrary, or capricious, or so grossly erroneous as to necessarily imply bad faith, or if such decision is not supported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Substantial evidence means \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd., </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938). With respect to questions of law, this court reviews the Board\u2019s decision <em>de novo </em>but gives careful consideration to the Board\u2019s legal conclusions in recognition of its considerable experience in construing government contracts. <em>Wickham Contracting Co. v. Fischer, </em>12 F.3d 1574, 1577 (Fed.Cir.1994). Under these standards, we review each of the Board\u2019s alleged errors identified by Rohr.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Rohr first argues that the Board applied a \u201clearning curve\u201d theory of damages that was arbitrary and not supported by substantial evidence. According to Rohr, the Board relied on the testimony of the government\u2019s expert who did not properly apply the learning curve theory. Rohr and the government each presented expert testimony about how the learning curve theory should be applied in this case. The Board then chose to adopt the approach of the government\u2019s expert instead of Rohr\u2019s, explaining that \u201c[biased on the evidence presented, the \u2018recovery\u2019 learning curve theory presented by Rohr\u2019s expert, Mr. Lewis, appears to be without support.\u201d Board\u2019s Opinion at 105. The Board considered the same argument Rohr now raises on appeal and concluded that \u201c[t]hough Rohr has criticized [the expert\u2019s] approach as at odds with the theory he espouses, we believe it is a rational way to recognize the disruption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106. Based on our review of the record and the Board\u2019s Opinion, we conclude that the Board\u2019s decision was not arbitrary and is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">Rohr next challenges the Board\u2019s reduction in the number of overrun hours for which the government should be hable, claiming that the Board arbitrarily double deducted for Rohr\u2019s involvement in the cost overrun. After considering, <em>inter alia, </em>the testimony of each party\u2019s expert and the evidence of Rohr\u2019s internal major assembly assessments of the cost overrun, the Board concluded that \u201c67,310 excess hours already accounts for 9,545 hours for which Rohr has accepted responsibility. We believe the 67,310 excess hours must be further reduced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). According to the Board, \u201csome further adjustment is in order\u201d because \u201cRohr contributed to the additional costs incurred throughout the claim period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107. Thus, the Board determined that Rohr\u2019s admitted deductions were insufficient to account for the non-government induced cost overruns and that a further adjustment based on the evidence before it was necessary. Based on our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>review of the record and the Board\u2019s Opinion, we do not agree with Rohr that the Board\u2019s decision was arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Rohr also argues that the Board erroneously cut off any relief for damages occurring after July 1, 1990. New operating guidelines went into effect on July 2, 1990, and as a result, the number of rejections of Rohr-manufactured components and documentation dramatically decreased. <em>Id. </em>at 65, 73. The Board\u2019s Opinion indicates that the disruption to Rohr\u2019s business from changes in the government\u2019s review process effectively ended with the implementation of the new operating guidelines and that other events occurring in 1990 eased the burden on Rohr. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 20, 30, 31, 50, 54, 59, 61-62, 65, 73. Moreover, in 1990 Rohr negotiated a higher sales price for its F-14 components to account for the increase in its costs. Rohr realized a 15% profit from the newly-priced components. <em>Id. </em>at 71-73. Rohr argues that it nevertheless should be compensated for the period between July 1990 and October 1990 when its last lower priced lot was completed. Rohr fails, however, to identify any evidence in the record to substantiate this claim. Based on our review of the record and the Board\u2019s Opinion, we are not persuaded that the Board\u2019s decision was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Rohr next argues that the Board erred by refusing to award any damages in certain areas where the government was clearly liable for injury to Rohr. In particular, Rohr argues that it should recover the amounts it claimed for its Bond Shop, Process Impact Team, Throughput Improvement Team, Direct and Allocated Services Labor, Materials and Wheel Wells. While Rohr provides us with scant specifics, it claims to have \u201coffered sufficient evidence for the Board to make a fair and reasonable approximation of damages in these areas, but the Board granted no relief.\u201d In each of these instances, the Board assessed the evidence presented by Rohr but found it to be insufficient or lacking credibility. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 110 (\u201cRohr\u2019s methodology for proving the common shops claim is simply not convincing\u201d), 119 (\u201cwe are not persuaded in light of the uncertainty of the overall analysis\u201d), 121 (\u201cRohr\u2019s evidence in support of recovery in the fifth period is not persuasive\u201d), 125 (\u201cRohr has not established that the Government caused it to create the [special] teams nor has it given credit for any benefits to its commercial programs\u201d), 129 (\u201c[Rohr\u2019s] study is an inadequate foundation for assigning what would be an \u2018estimated\u2019 casual responsibility to DCAS and reliance on it would be invitation to speculation\u201d), 133 (\u201cIn the final analysis, Rohr has not persuaded us that DCAS was the principal reason for the decision or that, in any event, the costs claimed are an appropriate alternative way of measuring any damage Rohr would otherwise have suffered\u201d). We are not persuaded that the Board\u2019s decision, made after a careful and thorough consideration of Rohr\u2019s evidence as described in its Opinion, was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Finally, Rohr argues that it should have been awarded consultant costs of nearly $3 million. The Board denied these costs, stating that the testimony presented by Rohr did not permit the Board \u201cto understand the details of the assignment [of Rohr\u2019s consultants and attorneys] \u2014 details that we believe are crucial for understanding the purposes for which counsel and, in turn, the consultants were engaged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138. In addition, the Board stated that it was \u201cnot in a position to determine whether the costs incurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>prior to claim submission were incurred for the genuine purpose of furthering the negotiation process with the Government, either prior to or after a claim submission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After pointing out these shortcomings in Rohr\u2019s evidence, the Board concluded that \u201c[t]he record that is before us discloses a litigation posture from the outset.... Rohr has not proved that the costs claimed were incurred for the genuine purpose of materially furthering the negotiation process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138-39. Rohr\u2019s brief on appeal identifies the evidence, which it believes satisfies the deficiencies noted by the Board. While these portions of the record may help to explain the tasks performed by the consultants in order to assess the reasons for Rohr\u2019s cost overruns, they do not address the Board\u2019s concern that there was insufficient evidence presented by Rohr that this work was performed for purposes of negotiation instead of litigation. Based on our review of the record and the Board\u2019s Opinion, we believe the Board\u2019s decision was consistent with the evidence before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">In summary, Rohr has failed to show that the Board\u2019s decision was arbitrary, erroneous, or not supported by substantial evidence. The Board\u2019s decision is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
