He appeals that sentence, claiming the district court erred in declining to depart based upon an over-representation of criminal history, and asserting that the district court mistakenly believed that it lacked authority to depart. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>We find McPherson\u2019s claim that the district court erred in refusing to grant his motion for a downward departure to be without merit. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742 (West 2000); <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 31 (4th Cir.1990). A fair and complete reading of the record reveals that the district court fully considered its authority to depart, and factually determined that departure in McPherson\u2019s case was not warranted. The district court is not required to do more. <em>Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d at 31. Accordingly, we affirm McPherson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
