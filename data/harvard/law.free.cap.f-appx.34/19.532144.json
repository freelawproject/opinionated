Macchia, </em>35 F.3d 662, 668 (2d Cir.1994). Furthermore, even if they were the same offense, the denial of community release would not qualify as a punishment that could invoke double jeopardy protection. \u201cThe Double Jeopardy Clause applies to judicial proceedings, not parole .... A denial of parole is a decision to withhold early release from the confinement component of a sentence. It is neither the imposition nor the increase of a sentence, and it is not punishment for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause ____\u201d <em>Alessi v. Quinlan, </em>711 F.2d 497, 501 (2d Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">We have considered all of defendant\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
