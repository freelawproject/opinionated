Lyons-Bey, a pro se Michigan prisoner, appeals a district court order denying him a free copy of his court record. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In 1997, Lyons-Bey filed a civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The action was dismissed by the district court and affirmed by this court on June 30, 2000. A subsequent request for mandamus relief was also denied on September 18, 2000. Lyons-Bey then filed a request to have the court replace his copy of the record at government expense. The district court denied the request. It is from this order that Lyons-Bey appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Lyons-Bey argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying him a copy of his case file. He contends that without his records, he is being denied access to the courts and is unable to prosecute his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">To establish a claim for denial of access to the courts, Lyons-Bey must establish actual prejudice to the litigation. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351-52, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); <em>Hadix v. Johnson, </em>182 F.3d 400, 404-06 (6th Cir. 1999); <em>Pilgrim v. Littlefield, </em>92 F.3d 413, 416 (6th Cir.1996). As the district court noted, Lyons-Bey\u2019s case had been dismissed and affirmed on appeal. Further, the time to seek review before the United States Supreme Court has expired. Therefore, Lyons-Bey\u2019s case is finished, and no further avenue of relief is available. The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
