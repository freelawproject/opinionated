We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and after de novo review, <em>Margolis v. Ryan, </em>140 F.3d 850, 852 (9th Cir.1998), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-22\">The district court properly dismissed Fields\u2019 disability discrimination claims against defendants in their official capacities because the claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, </em>531 U.S. 356, 360, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-23\">The district court properly dismissed Fields\u2019 disability discrimination claims against defendants in their individual capacities because Fields failed to raise material facts to show that she was disabled. <em>See Thornton v. McClatchy Newspapers, Inc., </em>261 F.3d 789, 797-98 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-24\">The district court properly dismissed Fields\u2019 section 1983 claims against the Legislative Counsel and against individual defendants in their official capacities because the claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Pennhurst State Sch. and Hosp. v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 101, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-25\">The district court properly dismissed Fields\u2019 section 1983 claims against defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>dants in their individual capacities because Fields\u2019 failed to raise material facts to show that defendants defamed her, <em>see Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 706, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976), or that she was denied equal protection, <em>see Sischo-Nownejad v. Merced Comty. Coll. Dist., </em>934 F.2d 1104, 1112-1113 (9th Cir.1991) (noting that because plaintiff failed to establish discrimination under Title VII, equal protection claim under section 1983 also fails).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The district court properly concluded that Fields failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Legislative Counsel\u2019s proffered reason for terminating her employment was pretextual. <em>See Merrick v. Farmers Ins. Group, </em>892 F.2d 1434, 1437 (9th Cir.1990). Therefore, the district court properly granted summary judgment on her race discrimination claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The district court properly dismissed Fields\u2019 retaliation claim because she failed to raise material facts to show a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>See EEOC v. Dinuba Med. Clinic, </em>222 F.3d 580, 586 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Fields\u2019 state law claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); <em>Binder v. Gillespie, </em>184 F.3d 1059, 1066 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b348-26\"> \u25a0pjjjg disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
