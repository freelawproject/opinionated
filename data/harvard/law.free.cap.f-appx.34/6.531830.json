Carter, Judge) granting intervener status to four minority members of the union \u2014 Iran Bennett, Charles Brown, Leroy Pratt, and Angel Vasquez.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In 1978, Local 580 entered a consent decree with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York prohibiting the union from engaging in racial discrimination. Subsequently, the district court found that Local 580 manifested \u201cdeliberate and egregious indifference to ... obligations under the Consent Judgment,\u201d prompting it to enter several judgments and orders holding the union in contempt. <em>See, e.g., EEOC v. Local 580, </em>925 F.2d 588, 594 (2d Cir.1991); <em>EEOC v. Local 580, </em>669 F.Supp. 606, 609-11 (S.D.N.Y.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The present litigation began in 1998, when five minority members of the union filed a motion asking Judge Carter to hold the union in contempt based on its persisting racial discrimination. The district court treated the motion as one requesting intervenor status, which it duly granted as to four minority union members. Local 580 appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), we have subject matter jurisdiction from \u201c[i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts of the United States ... granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions, except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Two conditions precedent must be satisfied for jurisdiction under \u00a7 1292(a)(1): \u201c(1) ... the district court erroneously interpreted the terms of the consent decree [and] \u2018modified\u2019 that injunction within the meaning of \u00a7 1292(a)(1)\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe order of the district court might have a serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence ... that can be effectually challenged only by immediate appeal.\u201d <em>EEOC v. Local 40, </em>76 F.3d 76, 79 (2d Cir.1996) (internal punctuation and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Local 580 argues that the district court\u2019s April 18, 2001 order was both a modification of and a refusal to dissolve an injunction. Its argument relies on paragraphs three and five of a 1991 order entered by the district court pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) which granted \u201cfinal approval of the settlement of the back pay claims\u201d (the \u201cBack Pay order\u201d). Local 580 argues that these provisions\u2019 plain language precludes <em>all </em>claims for \u201cindividual relief for minority members\u201d brought pursuant to the consent decree, including those arising after the order was issued in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">\u201cConsent decrees are a hybrid in the sense that they are at once both contracts and orders ... construed largely as contracts, but ... enforced as orders.\u201d <em>Berger v. Heckler, </em>771 F.2d 1556, 1567-68 (2d Cir.1985). The Back Pay order describes itself as a \u201cfinal ... settlement of the <em>remaining </em>back pay claims.\u201d (emphasis added) Thus, not all back pay claims but only those that \u201cremain[ ]\u201d at the time the order was entered fall within its ambit. The Back Pay order was also styled a Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) order. Rule 54(b) permits resolution of less than all claims in a wider action. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) (\u201cWhen more than one claim for relief is presented in an action ... the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims.... \u201d). Rule 54 permits resolution of claims <em>already </em>presented, not those yet to be presented. Because the Back Pay order by its terms only applies, and only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>could apply, to claims filed before the effective date of the order, the order does not govern claims filed after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Paragraph Five of the Back Pay order also limited the order\u2019s scope \u201cto the extent [of the district court\u2019s past] orders and judgments [that] provided individual relief.\u201d The Back Pay order\u2019s preamble further mentioned two previous awards as sources of back pay awards. Examination of these earlier orders reveals that they encompassed only claims based on past discrimination but did not create a mechanism for the settlement of future claims. According to one 1989 order, only \u201cthose present or past black and Hispanic journeymen workers or applicants for journeyman status, who ... were discriminated against by Local 580\u201d receive back pay under that order. Local 580, in sum, bargaining for and obtained a release from all claims arising prior to the effective date of the Back Pay order \u2014 not for an absolute bar to future discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Local 580 finally relies on the releases signed by two plaintiffs, Brown and Pratt, to demonstrate that a <em>quid pro quo </em>occurred. The releases confirm that the <em>quid pro quo </em>concerned only past claims. Pratt\u2019s and Brown\u2019s releases, for instance, cover claims \u201cfrom the beginning of time to the date of this Release and Agreement Not to Sue.\u201d The releases thus exclude on their face claims arising from new discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Because Local 580 fails to demonstrate that the district court erroneously interpreted the consent decree, we need not resolve the question of whether it must also make a showing of irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
