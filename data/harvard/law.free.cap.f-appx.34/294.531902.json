We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts of a particular case for an abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Antonakeas, </em>255 F.3d 714, 727 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">A federal grand jury indicted Martinez-Vasquez and three co-defendants of six counts under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028 &amp; 1546. Martinez-Vasquez ultimately pled guilty to one count: knowingly transferring two false identification documents in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(2). The district court sentenced Martinez-Vasquez in accordance with the recommendations of the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), which noted that, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a), 1,055 counterfeit documents seized at Martinez-Vasquez\u2019s apartment were \u201crelevant conduct\u201d for determining his offense level. Thus, because the offense involved over 100 documents, the district court applied a nine-level increase, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2)(C), and sentenced Martinez-Vasquez to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment, thirty-six months of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Martinez-Vasquez claims that the 1,055 counterfeit documents found in his apartment should not be considered \u201crelevant conduct.\u201d The Sentencing Guidelines provide that \u201crelevant conduct\u201d includes all \u201creasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of ... jointly undertaken criminal activity!.]\u201d \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B). In the present case, Martinez-Vasquez lived at the apartment with two of his co-defendants. By his own admission, he knew that the counterfeit documents were being produced in the apartment, and he and his co-defendants would go to the apartment to obtain the documents when they received orders. It is, therefore, apparent that the 1,055 documents found in the apartment were produced in furtherance of the criminal activity jointly undertaken by Martinez-Vasquez and his co-defendants, and that the documents were reasonably foreseeable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">Martinez-Vasquez also argues that the sentence enhancement was improper because the government failed to satisfy its burden of proof and the district court did not make adequate findings. However, both the government and the district court relied on the PSR, and the facts in a PSR are sufficient to meet the burden of proof for establishing a sentence enhancement. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Tam, </em>240 F.3d 797, 804 (9th Cir.2001). Moreover, in addition to relying on the PSR, the district court accepted the government\u2019s argument that the enhancement was warranted and gave Martinez-Vasquez ample opportunity to present contrary evidence. Thus, there was no need for further findings. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Peters, </em>962 F.2d 1410, 1415 (9th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Corley, </em>909 F.2d 359, 362 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b335-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3. \u201e</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
