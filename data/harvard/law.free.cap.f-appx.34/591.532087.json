He complains that the drafts were discovered in a search of his property that the district court found illegal. However, the bank that issued the drafts was identified in a search of Ag Chem that Johnson does not have standing to contest. With the name of Johnson\u2019s bank, the government was certain to discover the foreign drafts. Because of inevitable discovery, Johnson\u2019s challenge to the admissibility of the drafts fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>The foreign drafts were relevant to the alleged conspiracy and money laundering, the government provided a proper foundation for them, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the drafts into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The district court also properly denied Johnson\u2019s motion to acquit on the money laundering counts. The extensive circumstantial evidence that Johnson purchased Canadian Roundup with the drafts was more than sufficient to convict, and gives adequate support to the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">We reverse the district court\u2019s reduction of sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a) for acceptance of responsibility. Johnson did not accept responsibility for the crimes charged in the indictment. He denied at sentencing that he participated in the smuggling with which he was charged, and that was a key element of the indictment. The court could not properly find acceptance of responsibility in the face of Johnson\u2019s denial that he brought contraband across the border.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The government\u2019s cross-appeal on the four-month sentence is moot in light of reversal on the acceptance of responsibility adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART. REVERSED IN PART. VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b631-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publica- \u2022 tion and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
