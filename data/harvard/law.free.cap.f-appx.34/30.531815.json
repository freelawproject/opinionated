Plaintiffs claim of unauthorized computer access in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030 is without merit in light of the statutory exception for the \u201clawfully authorized investigative ... activity of a law enforcement agency.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">We have considered all of plaintiffs contentions on this appeal and have found in them no basis for reversal. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
