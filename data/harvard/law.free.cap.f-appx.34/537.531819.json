We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and, after de novo review, <em>Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Burley\u2019s false arrest claim as to Chief Nichelini because he had probable cause to arrest Burley for violating California Vehicle Code \u00a7\u00a7 4454(a), 12500(a), and 21650. <em>See Cabrera v. City of Huntington Park, </em>159 F.3d 374, 380 (9th Cir.1998) (per curiam) (\u201cTo prevail on his section 1983 claim for false arrest and imprisonment, [plaintiff] would have to demonstrate that there was no probable cause to arrest him,\u201d). The district court properly granted summary judgment on the false arrest claim as to Officer Nichelini because Burley failed to show that he participated in the arrest. <em>See Martinez v. City of Los Angeles, </em>141 F.3d 1373, 1380 (9th Cir.1998). Because Officer Nichelini is not liable for false arrest, the district court properly granted summary judgment on the claim as to the City of Oakland Police Department as well. <em>See City of Los Angeles v. Heller, </em>475 U.S. 796, 799, 106 S.Ct. 1571, 89 L.Ed.2d 806 (1986) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-16\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Burley\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim because the search attendant to Burley\u2019s lawful arrest was constitutionally permissible. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 235-36, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-17\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Burley\u2019s claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 because he failed to show that any of the appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>violated his constitutional rights. <em>See Giannini v. Real, </em>911 F.2d 354, 359 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Burley\u2019s contention that Judge Armstrong should have sua sponte recused herself from his action is without merit. <em>See Pau v. Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., </em>928 F.2d 880, 884-85 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">We decline to consider Burley\u2019s contention on appeal that the appellees are collaterally estopped from defending against this action because he did not raise this issue in the district court. <em>See United States v. $22,474.00 in U.S. Currency, </em>246 F.3d 1212, 1218 (9th Cir.2001). Burley\u2019s contention that he appeared at Chief Nichelini\u2019s home for a lawful purpose is not relevant to the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">We deny all pending requests for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 39, without prejudice to the filing of such requests in accordance with Ninth Circuit Rule 39-1.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b578-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
