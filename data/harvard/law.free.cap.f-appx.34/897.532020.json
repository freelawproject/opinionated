Because Rene Van Bur\u00e9n had died in the interim, her estate filed a claim in Rae\u2019s bankruptcy case. The bankruptcy court disallowed the claim, reasoning that the underlying loan was usurious under Florida law; the district court affirmed. The Van Bur\u00e9n estate appeals, contending that Rae waived his usury argument below, that Rae failed to prove the loan was usurious, and that Rae\u2019s perjury and falsification require a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">By way of background, we note that before the loan that led to this appeal, Rae, the debtor, had conducted financial transactions for several years with David Van Bur\u00e9n, the son and executor of the estate of Rene Van Bur\u00e9n. In their dealings, Rae and David Van Bur\u00e9n tended to rely on uneven and informal documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Rae, David Van Bur\u00e9n, and Rene Van Bur\u00e9n were all present at the formation of the loan in question. Rae\u2019s account of that transaction, which the bankruptcy court expressly credited over contrary testimony by witnesses for the Van Bur\u00e9n estate, is that Rene Van Bur\u00e9n loaned him $100,000, at 18% interest according to the written documentation, and that he paid an additional 12% interest, or $12,000, to David Van Buren, to yield a total interest rate of 30%. Florida\u2019s usury law (which, the parties agree, applies here) forbids any recovery on a debt with an interest rate greater than 25%, <em>see </em>Fla. Stat. ch. 687, 071(2,7) (2002); <em>Dixon v. Sharp, </em>276 So.2d 817, 819 (Fla.1973), and Rae testified that the transaction was deliberately structured in two parts to hide the usury. The Van Bur\u00e9n estate contends that the transactions were separate and legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">Although he made various payments, the purpose and implications of which the parties disputed below, Rae defaulted on the Van Bur\u00e9n loan. Unable to meet other financial obligations as well, Rae applied for and on August 8, 1998, received a general discharge in bankruptcy. On November 9, 1998, however, after a trial, the bankruptcy court revoked Rae\u2019s general discharge under 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 727 (West 1993 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2001), which bars discharge in certain circumstances. In the revocation proceeding, Rae did not formally plead that the Van Bur\u00e9n loan was invalid as usurious, but he did testify to this effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">When revoking the discharge (\u201cthe revocation proceeding\u201d), the bankruptcy court declined to rule, as moved by the Van Bur\u00e9n estate, that Rae\u2019s debt to the Van Buren estate was nondischargeable. <em>See 11 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 523 (West 1993 &amp; Supp. 2001). After the revocation proceeding, then, the Van Bur\u00e9n estate was free to pursue its claim, since all of Rae\u2019s debts had been reinstated, but it had not won any specific ruling as to its own claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">On December 4, 1998, the Van Bur\u00e9n estate filed a proof of claim in Rae\u2019s bankruptcy case. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 501, 726 (West 1993 &amp; Supp.2001). Rae objected to this proof of claim on the ground that the underlying loan had been usurious. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 502 (West 1993 &amp; Supp.2001). On April 20, 1999, after a bench trial (\u201cthe proof of claim proceeding\u201d), the bankruptcy court disallowed the Van Bur\u00e9n estate\u2019s claim against Rae, finding the loan usurious. Expressly relying on credibility determinations favoring Rae over David Van Bur\u00e9n and other witnesses for his mother\u2019s estate, the court ruled that the two payments constituted one transaction with an interest rate of 30% that was thus usurious under Florida law. In doing so, the court noted, however, that Rae\u2019s explanation of a particular check he had submitted in support of his story was unsatisfactory, because Rae could not explain why the check said \u201c3 superbowls\u201d as well as \u201cinterest\u201d in its description line.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">On April 30, 1999, the Van Bur\u00e9n estate moved for reconsideration pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9023 (2002). On June 10, 1999, the Van Bur\u00e9n estate amended and supplemented its earlier motion to reconsider, moving for relief from the judgment or a new trial under Bankruptcy Rules 9023 and 9024 (2002). The ground for the supplemental pleading, which had not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>raised in the April 30 motion, was newly discovered evidence of fraud. The Van Bur\u00e9n estate offered new evidence that Rae had altered the markings on two checks, including the check that the bankruptcy court had expressly found questionable in its earlier ruling; after the checks cleared, Rae added the notation \u201cinterest\u201d to the description section of one check and \u201cprepaid interest\u201d to that of the other check.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">On June 15, 1999, the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the estate\u2019s motion. Rae was unable to dispute the Van Bur\u00e9n estate\u2019s evidence of fraud. Nevertheless, the court denied the estate\u2019s motion in all respects on July 9, 1999, explaining, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cnotations on the checks weighed so little in the balance that it could not affect the result reached.\u201d Whether the court held an entirely new trial or merely reopened the record for new evidence, the court specifically stated, \u201cI am convinced that I would reach exactly the same result on the underlying issue, which was the defense of usury in this ease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">The district court affirmed in full, and the Van Bur\u00e9n estate timely noted this appeal. We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and the legal conclusions of the bankruptcy and district courts <em>de novo, </em>considering the record as a whole. <em>See In re Morris Communications, </em>914 F.2d 458, 467 (4th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">The Van Bur\u00e9n estate first contends that in support of Rae\u2019s contention that the loan was usurious, Rae failed to offer \u201cclear and satisfactory\u201d evidence, as required by Florida law. We disagree. To show that a transaction is usurious, Florida law requires \u201cclear and satisfactory\u201d evidence of (a) an existing loan, (b) an understanding that the money would be returned, (c) an agreement that the rate of interest would be greater than the legal limit, and (d) a \u201ccorrupt intent to take more than the legal rate for the use of the money loaned.\u201d <em>Dixon, </em>276 So.2d at 819 (citation omitted). In attacking Rae\u2019s evidence of usury, the Van Bur\u00e9n estate relies on negative findings that the bankruptcy court made as to Rae\u2019s honesty and other factors that fundamentally go to the witnesses\u2019 relative credibility. The Achilles heel of this approach is the bankruptcy court\u2019s explicit determination that Rae\u2019s credibility \u2014 even in light of the altered checks \u2014 was greater than that of the Van Bur\u00e9n estate\u2019s witnesses. Rae\u2019s account, once accepted by the trier of fact, is more than sufficient, considered with the available documentation, to provide clear and satisfactory evidence that the agreement among Rae and the Van Burens was usurious under Florida law. For the reasons stated by the district court, <em>see Estate of Van Buren v. Rae (In re </em>Rae), No. 991724-A, slip op. at 3-4 (E.D.Va. Aug. 23, 2001), we will not second guess the credibility determinations of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">The estate next argues that because Rae failed formally to plead an affirmative defense of usury during the revocation proceeding, he waived the right to make any usury argument in'the future. <em>See </em>Bankr.R. 7008, 7013, 4007(e) (2002). At the proof of claim proceeding, the bankruptcy judge ruled that at the revocation proceeding he had never reached the question of the validity of the Van Buren loan to Rae, because he had rejected the Van Buren estate\u2019s argument at an earlier step, when ruling that the Van Buren debt was <em>not </em>nondisehargeable under \u00a7 523. In order to rule the other way, to hold the debt nondisehargeable, the court would have had to reach the debt\u2019s validity, but in declining to so rule, the court said, it sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>ply did not reach the issue. As the court noted, the usury issue was raised in testimony in the revocation proceeding, though not formally pled. In addition, the Van Bur\u00e9n estate later had a full opportunity to litigate the matter in the proof of claim proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Under the rationale that the Van Bur\u00e9n estate urges upon us, every dischargeability and revocation proceeding would have to address the validity of every underlying claim. Yet, the estate has not cited a single case, considering either discharge-ability, (11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 523) or revocation (11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 727), with the result it seeks in this case. The estate does point to cases showing that a bankruptcy court <em>may </em>address validity during a discharge-ability proceeding under \u00a7 523. <em>See In re Gergely, </em>186 B.R. 951 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1995), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>110 F.3d 1448 (9th Cir.1997); <em>In re Shapiro, </em>22 B.R. 685 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1982). But it has failed to offer (nor have we located) any case holding that a debtor waived an invalidity argument by failing to raise it in a proceeding in which a court did <em>not </em>deem a debt nondischargeable under \u00a7 523. <em>Cf Sanders v. First Nat'l Bank in Great Bend, </em>114 B.R. 507 (M.D.Tenn.1990) (dismissing a civil non-bankruptcy complaint because it had not been pled in an earlier proceeding that resulted in a ruling of nondischargeability). Nor has the Van Bur\u00e9n estate identified a single case dealing with a determination of the validity of a debt at a general revocation proceeding under \u00a7 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Moreover, contrary to the Van Bur\u00e9n estate\u2019s contention that the usury defense is waived and therefore \u201cforever barred,\u201d the bankruptcy rules allow a debtor to resurrect even a compulsory counter-claim if it can show \u201coversight, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, or when justice so requires.\u201d <em>Sanders, </em>114 B.R. at 515 n. 3; Bankr.R. 7008, 7013. Given the liberality of the rules, and the Van Bur\u00e9n estate\u2019s failure either to provide one case on point or to show surprise or prejudice, we decline to reverse the bankruptcy court for its handling of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">Finally, the Van Bur\u00e9n estate contends that the bankruptcy court violated Bankruptcy Rules 9023 and 9024, which incorporate Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59 and 60, respectively, in refusing to overturn its own usury ruling on the ground that Rae perjured himself and faked evidence. Although we view the evidence of Rae\u2019s fraud at least as seriously as did the bankruptcy judge, who described it as \u201cvery troubling,\u201d we find no basis for finding a violation of Bankruptcy Rules 9023 or 9024.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">With respect to Rule 9023, the bankruptcy court explained that the motion was late given that rule\u2019s strict ten-day time limit. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 59. The Van Bur\u00e9n estate made no argument in its brief as to the timeliness of the motion, and has thus waived any challenge to this procedural ruling. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>see, e.g., Marvel Specialty Co. v. Bell Hosiery Mills, Inc., </em>330 F.2d 164, 169 n. 5 (4th Cir.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">As for Rule 9024 (incorporating Rule 60), contrary to the implication of the Van Bur\u00e9n estate\u2019s argument, the bankruptcy court plainly understood the different standards applicable under Federal Rules of Procedure 60(b)(2) and 60(b)(3). Pursuant to Rule 60(b)(2), the court noted not only that the newly discovered evidence was cumulative but also that it would not have altered the result of the trial; both are relevant observations under that subsection of the rule. <em>See Boryan v. United States, </em>884 F.2d 767, 771 (4th Cir.1989). We see no reason to believe that these conclusions constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>Under Rule 60(b)(3), the bankruptcy court had to determine whether the Van Bur\u00e9n estate had shown a \u201cmeritorious defense,\u201d misconduct proven by clear and convincing evidence, and that the movant was not fully permitted to present its case because of the misconduct. <em>Schultz v. Butcher, </em>24 F.3d 626, 630 (4th Cir.1994) (granting a new bench trial). The bankruptcy court rejected the motion on the third prong. The court concluded that the estate had had a full and fair opportunity to litigate its case despite this evidence, noting that the parties extensively debated what the notations on the checks might have meant and what the checks might have covered. Indeed, David Van Bur\u00e9n testified as to the difference in handwriting between the two notations on one check, and the court itself, in its judgment <em>before </em>the new evidence of falsification was offered, noted that Rae had been unable satisfactorily to account for one check. Given that the bankruptcy court held a full two-hour hearing on the new evidence, and that the bankruptcy court had expressly doubted this aspect of Rae\u2019s testimony in its initial ruling, we decline to hold that the court abused its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the judgment of the bankruptcy court is</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
