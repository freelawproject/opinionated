Specifically, Appellants challenge the district court\u2019s holding that the claim was barred by the Act\u2019s statute of limitations. We have jurisdiction to hear this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-20\">Dismissals based on statutes of limitations are reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A dismissal without leave to amend is also reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such dismissal is improper unless it is clear that the complaint could not be saved by any amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-21\">1. <em>Commencement of the Statute of Limitations Period</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-22\">The initial issue in this case concerns the appropriate time at which to start the statute of limitations period. The applicable provision states that \u201c[n]o action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under any provision of this chapter unless brought before the expiration of ... one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>year after the discovery by the plaintiff of the facts constituting such violation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court applied the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d to the statute, concluding that discovery of the necessary facts occurred when plaintiffs actually or constructively discovered those facts. We agree with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Under California\u2019s discovery rule, the limitations period commences when the plaintiff suspects, or should suspect, that his or her injury was caused by wrongdoing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cSubjective suspicion is not required. If a person becomes aware of facts which would make a reasonably prudent person suspicious, he or she has a duty to investigate further and is charged with knowledge of matters which would have been revealed by such an investigation.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Based on the California courts\u2019 interpretation of the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d in other statutes of limitations, the district court was correct in applying the discovery rule to this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">California courts originally applied the discovery rule in 1936,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and have used it to interpret statutes of limitations in a variety of contexts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We can presume, based on the long history of the discovery rule, that the California legislature is aware of the judicial interpretation of the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d in statutes of limitations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As noted in a recent opinion by the California Court of Appeals, \u201cit is reasonable to assume that [the legislature] would have used a word other than \u2018discovery\u2019 if it intended for the limitations period to commence only upon actual knowledge of a violation.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We can therefore analogize the language in Section 20999.3(b) to the language in other statutes of limitations and draw the same conclusion in interpreting that language. The term \u201cdiscovery\u201d in Section 20999.3(b) means not only actual notice of the wrongdoing, but notice that would put a reasonable person on inquiry.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">II. <em>Actual or Constructive Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">The district court held that letters sent by Shell and Texaco to the appellants provided both actual and constructive notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>of the violation of California Business <em>&amp; </em>Profession Code \u00a7 20999.25(a). While we do not agree that the letters provided actual notice, we affirm the district court because we hold, as a matter of law, that the letters provided constructive notice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The letters did not explicitly state that Shell and Texaco transferred their interest in the gas stations to Equilon. The letters primarily-focused on the assignment of the leases and dealer agreements, with only brief references to the fact that Shell and Texaco were transferring all of their assets to Equilon. Because none of the letters clearly revealed that Equilon took over ownership of the gas stations, the letters did not provide actual notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The letters were sufficient, however, to provide constructive notice. Shell\u2019s first letter stated that Shell had \u201centered into an agreement to contribute its refining and marketing assets in the western and mid-western United States to Equilon Enterprises.\u201d Then its second letter began with \u201c[effective July 1, 1998 certain assets formerly owned by Shell Oil Company will be transferred to Equilon Enterprises LLC.\u201d The Texaco letter noted that \u201cShell Oil Company and Texaco Inc. formed Equilon Enterprises LLC, a joint venture combining Shell and Texaco\u2019s western and central U.S. refining and marketing, trading, transportation and lubricants businesses.\u201d While these statements do not expressly refer to the transfer of the gas station properties, they provide enough information to put the station dealers on notice that the companies were involved in something larger than just the assignment of gas station leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Appellants admitted in their brief that the letters were \u201cambiguous,\u201d \u201ccryptic,\u201d and \u201cvague.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Even if this ambiguous language did not raise suspicion in Appellants, it would have caused a reasonably prudent person to investigate the nature of the transaction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It would have been easy to accept the invitation in Shell\u2019s first letter and contact a sales representative if someone had questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">It is also noteworthy that Appellants\u2019 original attorney stated in a declaration that his firm \u201cdid not make a definite decision to proceed\u201d until they obtained documents proving that Shell and Texaco had transferred the gas station properties. This delay was because \u201c[w]e could not be sure that Shell and Texaco had not retained title to the relevant service station properties.\u201d These statements prove that there was uncertainty about the nature of the transaction between Shell, Texaco, and Equilon, and that the firm was aware, even before receiving the recording notices, that Shell and Texaco may have assigned their interest in the stations to Equilon. Because the letters contained enough information to put a reasonably prudent person on inquiry, they provided constructive notice, and Appellants\u2019 claim is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>III. <em>Amendment of the Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The district court dismissed Appellants\u2019 claim with prejudice. This order is only proper if the complaint could not be saved by any amendment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because the facts that Appellants offer for amendment would not save the complaint, the district court was correct in dismissing with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Appellants contend that Shell and Texaco purposefully made their letters misleading to hide the true nature of the transaction. Regardless of the companies\u2019 intent, the letters were sufficient to provide constructive notice. Therefore, Appellants\u2019 proposed amendment is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Appellants also offer the fact that the property transfers did not appear in the Property Profiles until several months after they occurred. Because we hold that the letters provided constructive notice, no notice from the Property Profiles was necessary, and any delay in those documents is irrelevant. There is nothing that can be added to the complaint to negate the fact that the letters provided constructive notice, and thus, Appellants\u2019 claim is untimely. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b574-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-13\">. <em>Ellis v.
