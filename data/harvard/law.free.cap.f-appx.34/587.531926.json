Weast, a sergeant with the Pierce County Sheriffs Department (\u201cthe Department\u201d), filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim alleging that he was removed from his position as supervisor of the Hazardous Devices Squad (\u201cHDS\u201d) after criticizing the policies and management of the Department. The individual defendants, Sheriff John Shields and Captain Myron Smith, asserted that they were entitled to qualified immunity and moved for summary judgment dismissal. The district court denied the motion. Defendants filed this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Qualified immunity will attach to Shields and Smith unless Weast can show \u201c1) that [his] speech involved a matter of public concern, and 2) that the interests served by allowing [him] to express [himself] outweighed the [County\u2019s] interest in promoting workplace efficiency and avoiding workplace disruption.\u201d <em>Keyser v. Sacramento City Unified Sch. Dist., </em>265 F.3d 741, 747 (9th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Brewster v. Board of Educ., </em>149 F.3d 971, 978 (9th Cir.1998)). This balancing of free expression and workplace disruption was first articulated in <em>Pickering v. Board of Educ., </em>391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">We next examine whether Weast has shown that the <em>Pickering </em>balancing test weighs in his favor. This test requires \u201ca balance between the interests of [Weast], as a citizen, in commenting on matters of public concern and the interest of the [County], as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d <em>Pickering, </em>391 U.S. at 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731. In this balance, we recognize that the defendants have \u201cwide discretion and control over the management of [their] personnel and internal affairs.\u201d <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 151, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>(quoting <em>Arnett v. Kennedy, </em>416 U.S. 134, 168, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring)). Moreover, for the <em>Pickering </em>balance to weigh in their favor, \u201cpublic employers need not allege that an employee\u2019s expression actually disrupted the workplace; \u2018reasonable predictions of disruption\u2019 are sufficient.\u201d <em>Brewster, </em>149 F.3d at 979 (quoting <em>Waters v. Churchill, </em>511 U.S. 661, 673, 114 S.Ct. 1878, 128 L.Ed.2d 686 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>We have previously held that a public employee\u2019s statements on the competency, readiness and preparation of firefighters and police officers are statements addressing matters of public concern. <em>See Gilbrook v. City of Westminster, </em>177 F.3d 839, 866 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201c[A]n opinion about the preparedness of a vital public-safety institution, such as a fire department, goes to the core of what constitutes speech on matters of public concern\u201d); <em>McKinley v. City of Eloy, </em>705 F.2d 1110, 1114 (9th Cir.1983) (\u201c[T]he competency of the police force is surely a matter of great public concern.\u201d). Weast\u2019s letter and whistleblower complaint addressed the HDS\u2019 ability to respond to bomb-related emergencies safely and adequately. This speech involved a matter of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Here, defendants argue that the \u201cinherent disruption caused by [Weast\u2019s] insubordination\u201d would be \u201cdisruptive to the cohesive operation of the Department.\u201d This allegation is conclusory and not supported by any evidence in the record. That Weast did not apologize to Sheriff Shields for the alleged defamatory tone of his letter does not, by itself, establish that Weast\u2019s speech had or predictably would have disruptive effects. <em>See Roth v. Veteran\u2019s Admin., </em>856 F.2d 1401, 1408 (9th Cir.1988) (\u201cDefendants cannot rely on disruption which they instigated or exacerbated to outweigh [plaintiffs] first amendment rights.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Defendants also contend that Weast was removed from his position as HDS supervisor because he was not competent to lead the HDS. Defendants\u2019 alleged justifications for removal, however, do not address whether Weast\u2019s letter or whistleblower complaint disrupted the Department\u2019s operations or \u201cthreatened to have any such negative consequence.\u201d <em>Gilbrook, </em>177 F.3d at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Weast has shown that (1) his speech involved a matter of public concern and (2) the <em>Pickering </em>balancing test weighs in his favor. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment on defendants\u2019 qualified immunity claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b628-9\"> This disposition is inappropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
