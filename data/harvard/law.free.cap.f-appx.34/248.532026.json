We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of Washington\u2019s federal habeas petition, <em>Patterson v. Gomez, </em>228 F.3d 959, 963 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">Washington contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\u2019s (\u201cAED-PA\u201d) one-year statute of limitations period, because he allegedly was \u201cabandoned by his lawyer while incarcerated in state prison as a mentally handicapped pro se prisoner.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-16\">The AEDPA\u2019s limitation period began to run in Washington\u2019s case on April 25, 1996, as his state conviction became final in 1993. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A); <em>Bowen v. Roe, </em>188 F.3d 1157, 1158-59 (9th Cir.1999). Absent any tolling during the pendency of an application for State post-conviction review, <em>see Nino v. Galaza, </em>183 F.3d 1003, 1006 (9th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1104, 120 S.Ct. 1846, 146 L.Ed.2d 787 (2000), Washington was required to file his federal habeas petition no later than April 24, 1997, <em>see Patterson v. Stewart, </em>251 F.3d 1243, 1245-46 (9th Cir. 2001) (concluding that Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a)\u2019s method for computing time period applies in federal habeas actions). Washington, nevertheless, filed his first habeas petition in the State court 16 months after expiration of the one-year statute of limitations, and thus his first federal habeas petition more than 24 months after the expiration of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-17\">Where, as here, a petitioner seeks equitable tolling of the statute of limitations, a petitioner must demonstrate extraordinary circumstances beyond his control that made it impossible to file a petition on time. <em>Allen v. Lewis, </em>255 F.3d 798, 799 (9th Cir.2001), <em>citing Calderon v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>States Dist. Court (Beeler), </em>128 F.3d 1283, 1288 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">In this case, however, Washington has failed to show that equitable tolling of the statute of limitations was warranted. The district court therefore properly dismissed Washington\u2019s petition as untimely. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d); <em>Allen, </em>255 F.3d at 800-01 (requiring prisoner to show that the extraordinary circumstances warranting equitable tolling were the but-for and proximate cause of his untimeliness).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b289-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
