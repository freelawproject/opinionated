The adjudication by the state courts did not misapply federal law, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), and was not \u201can unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). We see no error in the rulings of the district court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ramirez, </em>79 F.3d 298, 304-05 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 850, 117 S.Ct. 140, 136 L.Ed.2d 87 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">We have considered all of petitioner\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
