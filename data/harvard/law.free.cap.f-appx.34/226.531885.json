The district court dismissed the action after determining that Nesbitt\u2019s claims were barred by the relevant statutes of limitations. The court concluded that Nesbitt\u2019s claims accrued when he was arrested in August 1998, more than two years before he filed his complaint in December 2000. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b267-17\">In August 1998 defendant James Clark, a Champaign, Illinois police officer, received an anonymous tip that a black man had robbed a Jiffy Lube store and was driving northbound in a white car on Third Street. Clark himself was driving north on Second Street when he spotted Nesbitt, who matched the description in the tip. Clark pulled Nesbitt over, at which time Officer Dennis Thomas arrived in his squad car. Guns drawn, Officers Clark and Thomas immediately handcuffed and arrested Nesbitt. They then searched Nesbitt\u2019s car, where they found a hammer, a baseball bat, and glass fragments.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-18\">Nesbitt was convicted of burglary in state court. The state appellate court reversed the conviction, however, finding that the uncorroborated and vague anonymous tip that led to Nesbitt\u2019s arrest lacked sufficient indicia of reliability. The court remanded the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-19\">On December 22, 2000, Nesbitt sued the City of Champaign, Clark, and Thomas, alleging under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 that his arrest violated the Fourth Amendment because the officers lacked reasonable suspicion. Nesbitt\u2019s complaint also included related state law claims of assault, battery, and wrongful arrest. The district judge, accepting the recommendation of a magistrate judge, agreed that Nesbitt\u2019s federal claim was barred by a two-year statute of limitations, <em>see </em>735 ILCS 5/13-202, and that his state law claims were barred by a one-year statute of limitations, <em>see </em>745 ILCS 10/8-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-20\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AzJ\">A. Federal Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b267-21\">Nesbitt first argues that the district court incorrectly determined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>statute of limitations had run on his federal claim. Section 1983 claims \u201cborrow\u201d the statute of limitations established by the state in which the claims are filed. <em>Shropshear v. Corp. Counsel of the City of Chicago, </em>275 F.3d 593, 594 (7th Cir.2001). For a case such as Nesbitt\u2019s filed in Illinois, the statute of limitations bars suits filed more than two years after the claim accrues. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Nesbitt argues that his claim accrued not at the time of his arrest (August 1998) but rather when the state appellate court found that his arrest was without reasonable suspicion (August 2000). But this court has held that Fourth Amendment claims may be brought at the time of the violation because a Fourth Amendment violation does not necessarily undermine a conviction. <em>See Gonzalez v. Entress, </em>133 F.3d 551, 553 (7th Cir.1998) (citing <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994)). Therefore, the cause of action in Fourth Amendment claims \u201cnecessarily \u2018accrues\u2019 at the time of the unlawful search or seizure,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 553; <em>see also Newsome v. McCabe, </em>256 F.3d 747, 749 (7th Cir.2001) (wrongful arrest and detention claims accrued at time of arrest). The district court thus correctly determined that Nesbitt\u2019s cause of action accrued when he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Nesbitt also argues that it would be unfair to require him to file his \u00a7 1983 claim while his state criminal appeal was pending, because a federal court could not have acted on his \u00a7 1983 claim until his state appeal was resolved. Nesbitt is correct that a federal court must stay a Fourth Amendment claim filed while a related state criminal appeal is ongoing. <em>See Simpson v. Rowan, </em>73 F.3d 134, 137-39 (7th Cir.1996). Nonetheless, Nesbitt\u2019s claim accrued when he was arrested. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>133 F.3d at 553. To preserve his claim, Nesbitt should have filed a complaint before the statute of limitations expired, even though his federal claim would have been stayed until his state appeal was resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Nesbitt further contends federal equitable tolling principles should have been applied to his claims. Equitable tolling allows a plaintiff to avoid the running of the statute of limitations \u201cif it would have been unreasonable to expect [the plaintiff] to sue earlier.\u201d <em>Shropshear, </em>275 F.3d at 595. Nesbitt believes that it was unreasonable to expect him to sue before his criminal appeal was resolved. But only state, not federal, equitable tolling principles apply to \u00a7 1983 cases. <em>Id. </em>at 596. Nesbitt has not argued that his claims should have been tolled under Illinois law, so we need not address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">B. State Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">In a single sentence, Nesbitt raises a general argument that the district court erred in deciding that the one-year statute of limitations had run on his state law claims. Nesbitt has provided no cogent argument or relevant legal authority explaining his statement, and he therefore has waived this undeveloped argument. <em>See Maltby v. Winston, </em>36 F.3d 548, 564 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
