(\u201cTFD\u201d) brought suit against defendants Thomas and Betts Corporation, Tyco International, Ltd., Tyco Electronics Corporation, and Augat, Inc. (collectively \u201cAugat\u201d), in the Eastern District of Virginia, for misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of contract. The jury found in Augat\u2019s favor on the trade secret count and in TFD\u2019s favor on the contract claims, awarding TFD damages. <em>Trimless-Flashless Design, Inc. v. Thomas &amp; Betts Corp., </em>Order, No. 00-245-A (E.D.Va. September 13, 2001). The district court then entered judgement as a matter of law on behalf of Augat. TFD appeals, and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">Augat is a subsidiary of Thomas and Betts Corporation, which was recently acquired by Tyco. Augat is in the business of producing \u201cmetallized particle interconnect\u201d (\u201cMPI\u201d) devices, which conduct electricity and are used to connect chips to circuit boards in personal computers. TFD designs and develops molds, tooling, rubber and plastic formulae, and processes for customers in the rubber, plastics, and other industries.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">In October 1995, Augat and TFD entered into a product development relationship contemplating the development of \u201cprototype and production molds\u201d to assist in the commercial manufacture of MPI devices. On October 23, 1995, Augat and TFD executed a \u201cProprietary and Nondisclosure Agreement\u201d (\u201c1995 NDA\u201d) barring Augat from disclosing or using confidential information belonging to TFD. J.A. at 3286. Soon thereafter, TFD sent price quotations for its molds to Augat, and Augat signed and submitted several purchase orders to TFD based on the quoted prices. On August 22, 1996, TFD and Augat signed a \u201cDraft Outline Agreement\u201d (\u201c1996 Agreement\u201d) that established a broader business relationship between the parties, explicitly referencing and incorporating the 1995 NDA and providing a number of other terms. J.A. at 3281. The 1996 Agreement was \u201ceffective unless and until replaced.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-13\">In 1997, Augat, dissatisfied with TFD\u2019s work, ceased purchasing from TFD and contracted with a new mold manufacturer. A functional, commercially successful MPI product was eventually developed. However, in December 1999, TFD sued Augat for misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of the 1995 and 1996 agreements. TFD asserts that, during the process of developing the MPI mold for Augat, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>disclosed substantial quantities of proprietary and confidential information to Augat in reliance on the 1995 NDA. TFD claims that Augat used this proprietary information in the production of the devices it now produces in conjunction with another mold manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">On June 11, 2001, a jury returned a defense verdict on TFD\u2019s trade secret claim but found for TFD on its breach of contract claims, awarding $10,466,500 in damages. However, on September 13, 2001, the district court entered judgement for the defendants as a matter of law on both contract claims. In granting Augat judgement as a matter of law on the 1996 Agreement claim, the district court concluded that (1) Augat never consented to litigate any alleged breach of that agreement, and (2) because TFD had strenuously argued earlier in the litigation that the 1996 Agreement was unenforceable,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it would be \u201cprejudicial and unjust\u201d to allow TFD now to recover for the breach of that agreement. <em>See Trimless-Flashless Design, Inc. v. Thomas &amp; Betts Corp., </em>Memorandum Opinion at 15, No. 00-245-A (E.D.Va. September 13, 2001) (the \u201cOpinion\u201d). Judgement as a matter of law was granted to Augat on TFD\u2019s claim under the 1995 Nondisclosure Agreement because (1) TFD failed to prove that the molds allegedly copied by Augat utilized TFD\u2019s proprietary information, and (2) Augat\u2019s purchase orders, agreed to by TFD, specifically assigned ownership of the subject \u201cmolds, tools, and dies\u201d to Augat. Opinion at 19-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">TFD contends that the district court erred in entering judgement as a matter of law for the defendants on TFD\u2019s breach of contract claims, arguing that Augat in fact \u201cconsented\u201d to litigation of the claim for breach of the 1996 Agreement and, with regard to the claim under the 1995 NDA, that the assignment clause in Augat\u2019s purchase orders was \u201cboilerplate fine print\u201d insufficient to supersede the parties\u2019 bargained-for agreements. In addition, TFD claims that it is entitled to a new trial on its misappropriation of trade secret claim because the district court instructed the jury that, under Massachusetts law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[fjor information to be a trade secret, it must be put to continuous use in the plaintiffs business.\u201d J.A. at 2563. TFD argues that this instruction is, in fact, contrary to Massachusetts law.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">Having had the benefit of oral argument and the parties\u2019 briefs, we agree with the district court\u2019s decision to award judgement as a matter of law on behalf of the defendants. In addition, we conclude that the district court correctly instructed the jury with regard to Massachusetts trade secret law. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b955-8\">. This argument was made in an effort to defeat Augat\u2019s motion to compel arbitration under the 1996 Agreement\u2019s arbitration clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b955-16\"><em>. </em>Section 6.4 of the 1996 Agreement provides for the application of Massachusetts law.
