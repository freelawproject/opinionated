We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-17\">In the certificate of appealability for this matter, we limited the issue to \u201cwhether the district court abused its discretion by faffing to consider holding a mixed petition in abeyance, given that petitioner may be barred from refiling by the AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations.\u201d The clear answer to that question is no. <em>See Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 522, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 1205, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982) (\u201c[A] district court must dismiss habeas petitions containing both unexhausted and exhausted claims.\u201d); <em>Calderon v. U.S. Dist. Court (Gordon), </em>107 F.3d 756, 760 (9th Cir.1997) (\u201cBecause [the] amended habeas corpus petition undisputably contained unexhausted state claims, dismissal of the federal petition was required.\u201d). That, of necessity, disposes of Scherbovitsch\u2019s claim that the court did not rule on his motion to stay the mixed petition \u2014 it simply could not rule in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-21\">We recognize that the district court must first give a pro se petitioner the opportunity to withdraw the unexhausted claims. <em>See James v. Pliler, </em>269 F.3d 1124, 1125 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Tillema v. Long, </em>253 F.3d 494, 503-04 (9th Cir.2001); <em>James v. Giles, </em>221 F.3d 1074, 1077 (9th Cir.2000). That, however, is not the question delineated in the certificate of appealabilty, and, in any event, the district court did give Scherbovitsch that opportunity. Thus, we must affirm the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b393-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-25\">.

The district court ruled that his petition included both \u201cexhausted\u201d federal claims and \u201cunexhausted\u201d federal claims, that is some claims which had not been fairly presented to the state\u2019s highest court. As such, the petition mixed exhausted and unexhausted claims. On De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>cember 9, 1999, well after AEDPA\u2019s one year statute of limitations had run,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation concluding that this \u201cmixed\u201d petition should be dismissed without prejudice under <em>Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 522, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 1205, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Seherbovitseh had moved for a stay, under <em>Fetterly v. Paskett, </em>997 F.2d 1295, 1299 (9th Cir.1993), prior to the Report and Recommendation of the magistrate judge. The magistrate judge had advised Seherbovitseh that he could amend his petition to delete the unexhausted claims. The magistrate judge did not rule on Scherbovitsch\u2019s motion for stay but did state, \u201c[i]f the Petitioner chooses to withdraw claims numbers 1, 2 and 3 from the present petition, he should be aware that he cannot raise those claims at a later time in this court.\u201d The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings and conclusions and dismissed the petition without prejudice on January 10, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The majority correctly states that, \u201cIn the certif\u00edcate of appealability for this matter, we limited this matter to \u2018whether the district court abused its discretion by failing to consider holding a mixed petition in abeyance, given that petitioner may be barred from refiling by the AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations.\u2019 The clear answer to that question is no.\u201d Given the <em>Rose </em>requirement that mixed petitions must be dismissed, there are only two ways to read the language of the certificate of appealability: either the certificate was improperly granted because a \u201cmixed petition\u201d cannot be held in abeyance per <em>Rose v. Lundy </em>or the actual issue is as briefed and argued by the parties, to wit, whether it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to fail to consider following the \u201cwithdrawal- and-abeyance procedure\u201d for dealing with a mixed petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">Congress has made clear that a certificate of appealability <em>should not issue </em>unless \u201cthe applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The Supreme Court has interpreted \u00a7 2253(c) to require \u201cshowing reasonable jurists could debate whether (or for that matter agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 1603-04, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Applying these principles to the certificate of appealability persuades me that the Petitioner had \u201cmade a substantial showing of a denial of constitutional right\u201d and the certificate was properly issued, but inartfully framed. I reached that conclusion by looking at the facts in this case which document that Seherbovitseh did request a stay thereby implicating the court\u2019s \u201cwithdrawal-and-abeyance\u201d procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">As I, then, view the certificate of appeal-ability, the issue is whether the magistrate judge erred as a matter of law in failing to decide the issue of whether to hold the petition in abeyance and by erroneously telling Seherbovitseh in his findings and conclusions, \u201c[i]f the Petitioner chooses to withdraw claims numbers 1, 2, and 3 from the present petition, he should be aware that he cannot raise those claims at a later time in this court.\u201d The record is clear that the district court had before it a motion to hold in abeyance and had the discretion to hold the matter in abeyance after permitting withdrawal of the unexhausted claims. <em>Calderon v. United States Dist. Ct. (Taylor), </em>134 F.3d 981, 987 (9th Cir.1998). \u201cA district court by definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.\u201d <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2048, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). I would reverse the district court and remand for a decision on the petitioner\u2019s motion to stay which clearly invoked this circuit\u2019s withdrawal-and-abeyance procedure. Given the facts, that resolution carries out the apparent intent of this Court to provide the Petitioner with a meaningful review of his only appeal. Remanding for decision on the motion to stay would enable this court in a subsequent appeal to evaluate the decision of the district court for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\">. <em>Duncan v. Walker, </em>531 U.S. 167, 180-181, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 2129, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 <em>(2001), held that the </em>time during which a federal habeas petition is pending does not toll the statute, as a state habeas petition would. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Thus, the limitations period continues to run during the pendency of a federal petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b395-15\">. Since the question of whether or not the court must permit withdrawal of unexhausted claims and hold the remaining claims in the petition in abeyance pending the outcome of the efforts to exhaust those withdrawn claims where AEDPA may bar refiling is not before us, I express no opinion on the propriety of the the Second Circuit's holding that withdrawal-and-abeyance is the \"only appropriate course\u201d where AEDPA may bar refiling. <em>Zarvela v. Artuz, </em>254 F.3d 374, 380 (2nd Cir. 2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
