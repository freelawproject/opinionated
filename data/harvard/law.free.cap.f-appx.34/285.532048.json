We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, and a district court\u2019s factual findings in the sentencing phase for clear error. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>135 F.3d 667, 669 (9th Cir.1998). We review a district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts of a particular case for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Johansson, </em>249 F.3d 848, 858 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Maldonado-Quijada contends the district court erred by imposing a three-level official-victim upward adjustment because there was insufficient evidence of an assault or threat on a law-enforcement officer. The Guidelines define assault as a \u201csubstantial risk of serious bodily injury,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(b), and do not require that such an assault actually harm an officer. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Sandoval, </em>211 F.3d 1115, 1118 (9th Cir. 2000) (ruling defendant assaulted law enforcement officers when his \u201cactions plainly evinced a discrete and specific intent\u201d to do so). Because the district court found sufficient factual basis for the adjustment in the presentence report, this argument is without merit. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Guardado, </em>228 F.3d 1017, 1027 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">Alternatively, Maldonado-Quijada appeals the official-victim adjustment because his assaultive conduct did not occur during the course of the offense. However, there is no legally significant distinction between \u201csubsequent\u201d versus \u201ccourse of\u2019 the offense, because the Guidelines only require the assaultive conduct to occur \u201cproximate in time to the commission of the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2, cmt. n. 5; <em>United States v. Powell, </em>6 F.3d 611, 613 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">Finally, in appealing the upward adjustment, Maldonado-Quijada asserts his assaultive actions were justified as a form of \u201cimperfect self-defense.\u201d The district court acted within its discretion, based upon the facts contained in the presentence report, in dismissing this claim. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>258 F.3d 971, 976 (9th Cir.2001) (ruling no evidentiary hearing is required when the district court has allowed the defendant to rebut the allegations of the presentence report) (citing <em>Farrow v. United States, </em>580 F.2d 1339, 1359-60 (9th Cir.1978) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">Maldonado-Quijada also contends the district court erred by denying his requests for downward departure based upon diminished capacity and fast-track plea bargain. We are precluded from ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>dressing these issues because the district court\u2019s decision not to depart downwardly is a discretionary one and not reviewable on appeal. <em>United States v. Tam, </em>240 F.3d 797, 805 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">AFFIRMED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b326-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
