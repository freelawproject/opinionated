Finding no merit in his contentions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Although in addressing the parties\u2019 respective pretrial motions for summary judgment the district court did not expressly state that it was denying Crichlow\u2019s motion, the court implicitly denied that motion when it stated that there were genuine issues of material fact to be tried and when it scheduled trial. There was no failure to rule. Nor was the court\u2019s decision incorrect, for the record did not permit the conclusion that Crichlow was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Crichlow\u2019s contention that he is entitled to judgment because the district court ruled that he had adduced sufficient evidence to make out a prima facie case is mistaken. Regardless of the initial presumptions created by the presentation of a prima facie case, \u201c \u2018[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 507, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (quoting <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981)); <em>see also St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. at 511, 113 S.Ct. 2742 (\u201c[A] presumption does not shift the burden of proof[;] ... the Title VII plaintiff at all times bears the ultimate burden of persuasion.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). In this case, the trier of fact, the jury, found against Crichlow. We see no basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">We have considered all of Crichlow\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
