He appeals his sentence. Sluss\u2019 attorney has filed a brief citing <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), contending the district court erred in determining Sluss\u2019 relevant conduct but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Sluss has filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-22\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings regarding the application of the federal sentencing guidelines for clear error. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>977 F.2d 866, 869 (4th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir. 1989). We find the district court did not clearly error in determining Sluss\u2019 relevant conduct. <em>See United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2) (2000). We have also reviewed Sluss\u2019 supplemental brief and find his claims meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-23\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Sluss\u2019 conviction and sentence. We deny Sluss\u2019 motions to relieve his counsel and to appoint him new counsel. This court requires that counsel inform his chent, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel's motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-24\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
