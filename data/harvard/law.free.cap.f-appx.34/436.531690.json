The court agreed with a magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that Mazique, a federal inmate, failed to demonstrate a motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2001) would be an inadequate or ineffective means to address his claims. Additionally, the district court properly noted that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>See United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 151 (4th Cir.2001). Because we find no reversible error, we affirm on the on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Mazique v. United States, </em>No. CA-01-343 (D.S.C. Aug. 30, 2001).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-16\"> Moreover, even if Mazique could raise an <em>Apprendi </em>claim on collateral review in a \u00a7 2241 petition, we note he could not prevail on his claim, as he was convicted under both 21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2001), each of which permits a twenty-year statutory maximum sentence. Because the district court could have imposed partially concurrent sentences for these convictions in order to reach Mazique\u2019s 263-month term of incarceration, Mazique's sentence does not offend <em>Apprendi. See United States v. White, </em>238 F.3d 537, 543 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
