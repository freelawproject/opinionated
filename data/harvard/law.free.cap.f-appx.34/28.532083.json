Although plaintiff apparently was initially classified incorrectly by defendant with respect to her request for housing assistance, neither the priorities established by defendant nor the reclassification of plaintiff in accordance with those priorities violated plaintiffs rights under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-19\">We have considered all of plaintiffs contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
