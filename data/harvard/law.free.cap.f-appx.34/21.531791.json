Defendant Commissioner of Social Security (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) conceded that the ALJ had not properly applied the law to Shabtai\u2019s case and requested the remand. The district court, implicitly reversing the ALJ\u2019s decision, granted the remand for further proceedings and an adjudication in accordance with correct legal principles. On appeal, Shabtai contends that application of the correct legal principles to the present record requires the conclusion that he retired on July 1, 1994, and thereafter rendered no substantial services to the corporation he had owned, and hence the scope of the remand should be limited to a determination of the amount of retirement benefits to which he is entitled for the period July 1, 1994, to August 10, 1998. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The regulations applied by the Commissioner to Shabtai place the burden on an individual who asserts that he did not render substantial services after a given date to \u201csubmit detailed information about the operation of the trades or businesses, including the individual\u2019s activities in connection therewith,\u201d and, when requested by the Commissioner, to \u201csubmit such additional statements, information, and other evidence as the [Commissioner] may consider necessary for a proper determination.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.446(c). \u201cFailure of the individual to submit the requested statements, information, and other evidence is a sufficient basis for a determination that the individual rendered substantial services in self-employment during the period in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have upheld the drawing of such an inference from the applicant\u2019s failure to produce information. <em>See, e.g., Ciccone v. Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, </em>861 F.2d 14, 17 (2d Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">Here, it is indisputable that there are gaps in the factual record. For example, Shabtai contends that he retired in 1994, and he submitted copies of his personal income tax returns for 1993, 1994, 1996, and 1997. But he did not submit such a return for 1995. And although he submitted his corporation\u2019s tax return for 1993-94, he did not submit the corporation\u2019s returns for 1994-95 or 1995-96. <em>(See also </em>Shabtai brief on appeal at 39 (attributing some gaps to documents that were \u201cnot due and readied\u201d at the time of his application for benefits).) Shabtai concedes that the ALJ twice requested the pertinent tax returns (Shabtai reply brief on appeal at 6), and that he did not produce them. The ALJ was not required to credit Shabtai\u2019s assertion that he had no ability to obtain the relevant corporate tax returns, especially given the fact that Shabtai retained check-signing authority for the corporation into 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">We have considered all of Shabtai\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court remanding the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>for further proceedings before the ALJ is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
