Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (quotation marks omitted), showing they have suffered an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d that is fairly traceable to the action they seek to challenge. <em>Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw, </em>528 U.S. 167, 180-81, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>(2000); <em>Clark v. City of Lakewood, </em>259 F.3d 996, 1006 (9th Cir.2001). Plaintiffs brought this action seeking to challenge the constitutionality of defendants\u2019 implementation of California Government Code \u00a7 3584(a), providing an exemption to the payment of nonmember dues (\u201cagency fees\u201d) to those holding conscientious objections to supporting public employee organizations based on the beliefs of their \u201cbona fide religion.\u201d <em>See Wilson v. NLRB, </em>920 F.2d 1282, 1285-87 (6th Cir. 1990). But defendants aver that they have never, and will never, implement the bona fide religion factor in their consideration of applications for religious exemption to agency fees requirements. The district court found that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this action, determining that defendants \u201cdenied plaintiffs\u2019 applications because ... their beliefs were not \u2018sincerely held,\u2019 a factor which the United States Supreme Court declares is \u2018a prime consideration to the validity of every claim for exemption as a conscientious objector.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Seeger, </em>380 U.S. 163, 185, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965)). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires reasonable accommodations of \u201can employee\u2019s ... religious observance or practice.\u201d 42 U.S.C. S 2000e(j). We have held it is a reasonable accommodation of religious observance required by Title VII to allow an employee who sincerely holds beliefs antithetical to supporting unions to substitute a charitable contribution for required union dues, and that accommodation does not violate First Amendment rights. <em>Tooley v. Martin-Marietta Corp., </em>648 F.2d 1239, 1243-46 (9th Cir.1981). Title VII does not contain the \u201cbona fide religion\u201d requirement to which plaintiffs object and defendants aver that they relied only on Title VII standards in rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 applications for a religious exemption to the payment of agency fees. <em>See International Assoc. of Machinists v. Boeing, </em>833 F.2d 165, 169 (9th Cir.1987) (explaining that because \u201cTitle VII defines religion as \u2018all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief,\u2019 ... [a]n employee who sincerely held religious beliefs opposing unions could be relieved from paying dues under Title VII, even if he or she was not a member of an organized religious group that opposes unions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The letter rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 applications makes no mention of the bona fide religion factor. It states that defendants considered whether the belief expressed \u201cis in fact religious,\u201d and \u201cwhether the belief is sincerely held.\u201d And in a declaration supporting their cross motion for summary judgment, defendants state that they have not considered, and will not ever in the future consider, whether the individual is a member of a bona fide religion as a factor in denying a religious accommodation to agency fees requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Plaintiffs base their appeal on the initial notice circulated by defendants immediately after the effective date of the Act, which is addressed to individuals requesting an exemption based on \u201cthe historically held conscientious objections of their religion.\u201d Subsequent to the circulation of that notice, however, the defendants disavowed use of the bona fide religion factor, implicitly in their rejection letter and explicitly in the declaration submitted in connection with the summary judgment motions. Plaintiffs failed to controvert defendants\u2019 statements through discovery or otherwise, determining to rely instead solely on the initial notice. On the record before us, we conclude that the district court properly found that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this action because plaintiffs failed to set forth specific facts showing that their injury is fairly traceable to the implementation of the bona fide religion factor, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>action they seek to challenge. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (explaining that \u201ca mere \u2018scintilla\u2019 of evidence\u201d is not sufficient to warrant a trial).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b343-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-26\">. The district court did not explain clearly what role in its analysis was played by its determination that the defendants denied plaintiffs' applications because their beliefs were not sincerely held, rather than based on their bona fide religions. We interpret that determination as supporting an unstated premise that plaintiffs\u2019 injury was not fairly traceable to the action they seek to challenge, and affirm the district court on that basis. Because we can affirm on any basis supported by the record, <em>Tanaka v. Univ. of S. California, </em>252 F.3d 1059, 1062 (9th Cir. 2001), whether our interpretation of the district court\u2019s opinion is correct is immaterial to our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
