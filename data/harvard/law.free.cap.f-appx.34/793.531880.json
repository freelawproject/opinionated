OPM, </em>No. DA-0831-01-0306-1-1, slip, op at 1 (MSPB June 20, 2001). The initial decision became final on October 25, 2001, when the Board denied Mr. Gremillion\u2019s petition for review. We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-22\">Mr. Gremillion worked as a Special Agent with the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and was covered by the Civil Ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>vice Retirement System (\u201cCSRS\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 2. In 1981, Mr. Gremillion was removed from his job. <em>Id. </em>After successfully appealing his removal to the Board, Petitioner was reinstated and received back pay for the period from December 11, 1981, through October 27, 1984. This back pay award amounted to $123,287.00, less applicable deductions, and it was granted to Mr. Gremillion in January 1985. <em>Id. </em>For income tax purposes, the IRS added the award to Petitioner\u2019s regular salary for 1985. Mr. Gremillion was therefore required to pay taxes on the entire amount of $164,856.00. <em>Id. </em>Petitioner retired from his employment with the IRS on December 30,1989. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">As a law enforcement officer, Mr. Gremillion is entitled to a retirement annuity as calculated according to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8339(d)(1). Section 8339(d)(1) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-5\">The annuity of an employee retiring under section 8335(b) or 8336(c) of this title is -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-6\">(A) 2)6 percent of his <em>average pay </em>multiplied by so much of his total service as does not exceed 20 years; plus</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-7\">(B) 2 percent of his <em>average pay </em>multiplied by so much of his total service as exceeds 20 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8339(d)(1) (emphases added). Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(4), \u201caverage pay\u201d is \u201cthe largest annual rate resulting from averaging an employee\u2019s ... <em>rates of basic pay </em>in effect over any three consecutive years of creditable service.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(4) (emphasis added). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(3) further clarifies that \u201cbasic pay\u201d \u201cdoes not include bonuses, allowances, overtime pay, military pay, [or] pay given in addition to the base pay of the position as fixed by law or regulation,\u201d except as provided by various subparagraphs that do not apply to Mr. Gremillion\u2019s case. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">To determine Mr. Gremillion\u2019s retirement annuity, the OPM averaged Petitioner\u2019s annual rate of pay for 1987, 1988, and 1989 and arrived at a figure of $49,411.00. <em>Id. </em>Petitioner subsequently asked the OPM to recalculate his retirement benefits, using the gross wages stated on his 1985 W-2 form, $164,856.36, to determine his average pay. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The OPM denied this request, as well as Mr. Gremillion\u2019s request for reconsideration, and Petitioner appealed to the Board. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">Before the Board, Mr. Gremillion argued that the OPM should be required to calculate his retirement annuity in a manner consistent with the IRS\u2019s handling of his back pay award. <em>Id. </em>at 5. According to Petitioner, it was discriminatory and unfair for the two federal agencies to treat his reported wages differently for retirement and for tax purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The administrative judge rejected Mr. Gremillion\u2019s arguments and affirmed the OPM\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, </em>496 U.S. 414, 110 S.Ct. 2465, 110 L.Ed.2d 387 (1990), the administrative judge held that Petitioner\u2019s entitlements under the CSRS are determined by statute, and that the OPM cannot be ordered to grant benefits not otherwise permitted by law. <em>Id. </em>at 6. The administrative judge concluded that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(4) governs the \u201caverage pay\u201d used to calculate an employee\u2019s retirement annuity, <em>id. </em>at 6, and that under the statute, \u201caverage pay\u201d does not necessarily encompass an employee\u2019s total annual income, <em>id. </em>at 7. As such, the administrative judge held that the OPM lacked authority to provide the relief Mr. Gremillion sought. <em>Id. </em>A full Board affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision, and Mr. Gremillion timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>The scope of our review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. This court must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not in accordance with law, obtained without procedures required by rule, law, or regulation, or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (1988). <em>See Phillips v. United States Postal Serv., </em>695 F.2d 1389, 1390 (Fed.Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">On appeal, Mr. Gremillion reiterates his argument that if the IRS considered him to have received $164,856.00 in gross earnings for 1985, so should the OPM. Petitioner challenges the administrative judge\u2019s holding that under <em>Richmond, </em>the OPM lacks authority to adjust his \u201caverage pay\u201d accordingly, and he urges us to find in his favor in order to alert the relevant federal agencies to what he perceives as their inequitable lack of uniformity.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">We conclude that the Board did not err when it affirmed the OPM\u2019s decision that Mr. Gremillion\u2019s back pay award should not be included in his annual average pay for retirement annuity considerations. In <em>Richmond, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe payment of money from the Treasury must be authorized by a statute.\u201d <em>Richmond, </em>496 U.S. at 424, 110 S.Ct. 2465. Here, not only does the statutory scheme fail to authorize the relief that Mr. Gremillion seeks, but \u00a7 8331(3) explicitly excludes \u201cpay given in addition to [an employee\u2019s] base pay\u201d from retirement benefit calculations. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(3). As the administrative judge correctly held, therefore, the OPM cannot be compelled to determine Petitioner\u2019s retirement annuity on the basis of his entire income for 1985, <em>id. </em>at 6, regardless of how the IRS treated this income for tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">Because the Board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
