Because Morris\u2019s objections to the ALJ\u2019s written opinion are without merit, and because substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-20\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b282-21\">Morris applied for disability benefits after resigning from his position as a telecommunicator with the Milwaukee Police Department in 1993. After a hearing, the ALJ determined that Morris suffered from several severe impairments but was not disabled. Morris sought judicial review, and a magistrate judge sitting by designation remanded the case for redetermination of Morris\u2019s ability to perform the telecommunicator job. The ALJ held a second hearing on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-22\">Morris testified at both hearings, explaining that he worked as a police officer until a shoulder injury, which required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>arthroscopic surgery, forced him to take disability retirement from the police force in 1988. Morris testified that his shoulder injury continues to cause weakness and constant moderate-to-severe pain in his right arm and shoulder, and that occasionally the pain radiates into his hand causing numbness in three fingers and limiting use of his right hand. He offered a decision from the police department\u2019s pension board noting his testimony at his 1988 pension hearing that he had \u201cexperienced some numbness in his right hand\u201d since the surgery. In 1989 Morris took a civilian job answering telephones at the Milwaukee Police Department\u2019s communications center. The center later implemented a system that required operators to type information received from callers, and soon, Morris testified, he was required to type constantly, sometimes answering 500 calls in a day. Morris explained that the typing bothered his shoulder and caused numbness in his fingers that limited his ability to touch-type. He left the job voluntarily in 1993, explaining in his letter of resignation that \u201ctoo much typing\u201d caused his fingers to \u201cgo numb late in the day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Morris reported the numbness to two doctors: Dr. Gregory VanWinkle, who treated Morris\u2019s shoulder injury, and consulting physician Dr. Christopher Evanich. Dr. VanWinkle, however, found Morris\u2019s sensation to be \u201cnormal\u201d during a January 1995 examination, and opined in a September 1995 evaluation that Morris could perform both \u201csimple grasping\u201d and \u201cfine manipulation\u201d \u201crepetitively]\u201d throughout an eight-hour work day. Similarly, Dr. Evanich, who examined Morris in 1994, observed that although Morris <em>complained </em>of numbness he <em>experienced </em>only intermittent paresthesia \u2014 an abnormal sensation, such as of burning, pricking, tickling, or tingling, <em>see Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>1316 (27th ed.2000) \u2014 in three fingers on his right hand. Thus, Dr. Evanich concluded, Morris \u201cshould have no difficulty in handling and manipulating objects.\u201d Dr. Evanich further noted that Morris was able to pinch and grip with both hands without difficulty and demonstrated no deficiency in finger dexterity.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The ALJ also heard testimony from a vocational expert (VE), who testified that although a person with numbness in his fingers could not perform Morris\u2019s telecommunicator job, a person with the capacity for grasping and manipulation specified in Dr. Evanich\u2019s and Dr. VanWinkle\u2019s reports could perform the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">The ALJ, in a written opinion acknowledging that Morris complained of pain and numbness and that his job required typing, relied on the medical and vocational evidence to conclude that Morris was not disabled because he could perform his past relevant work as a telecommunicator. <em>See, e.g., Knight v. Chater, </em>55 F.3d 309, 313 (7th Cir.1995). The district court affirmed that decision, and Morris appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">Morris first contends that the ALJ ignored evidence of numbness from both doctors. Contrary to Morris\u2019s assertions, however, neither doctor corroborated his claims; their reports reflect that Morris <em>complained </em>of numbness but demonstrated no deficiency in dexterity. Rather than ignoring this medical evidence the ALJ relied on it \u2014 particularly on Dr. VanWinkle\u2019s opinion that Morris could perform repetitive fine manipulations for eight hours at a time. Indeed, the only source of evidence on numbness was Morris\u2019s own testimony, which the ALJ acknowledged in his opinion. The ALJ was not required to specifically mention the pension board\u2019s decision or Morris\u2019s letter of resignation in his opinion, because they merely reiterate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>rather than substantiate Morris\u2019s claims. <em>See, e.g., Dixon v. Massanari, </em>270 F.3d 1171, 1176 (7th Cir.2001) (ALJ\u2019s opinion need not address every piece of evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Second, Morris asserts that the ALJ failed to discuss \u201ccontrary\u201d evidence concerning the nature of his shoulder injury and certain testimony from the VE. The ALJ\u2019s opinion describes Morris as suffering from a torn rotator cuff and shoulder impingement syndrome, and notes that the injury causes pain, mild sclerosis, and decreased joint space, strength, and range of motion. Morris\u2019s only objection to this assessment is that the ALJ failed to note that Dr. VanWinkle described the condition in one of his reports as \u201crotator cuff tendinitis.\u201d But Morris does not explain why this omission is significant, and we do not think it is. Nor are we persuaded by Morris\u2019s argument the ALJ failed to sufficiently \u201cdiscuss\u201d his testimony concerning arm and shoulder pain. The ALJ acknowledged Morris\u2019s complaints of pain but concluded that the pain was not disabling, noting that Morris\u2019s doctors had recommended only conservative treatment following his surgery and that no evidence showed Morris had treated the pain with any medications besides aspirin until 1997 \u2014 -four years after he allegedly became disabled. This reasoning is entirely appropriate, <em>see, e.g., Donahue v. Barnhart, </em>279 F.3d 441, 444 (7th Cir.2002) (evidence that claimant \u201crelied for pain control on over-the-counter analgesics\u201d supports conclusion that pain is not disabling); <em>Powers v. Apfel, </em>207 F.3d 431, 435-36 (7th Cir.2000) (reliance on drugs not intended to treat severe pain suggests claimant may be exaggerating condition), and Morris does not contend that the facts on which it is based are inaccurate. Finally, the VE\u2019s testimony that someone with numbness in his hands would be unable to perform Morris\u2019s old job became irrelevant once the ALJ concluded that Morris did <em>not </em>suffer from numbness. The ALJ thus was not required to discuss this evidence. <em>See Dixon, </em>270 F.3d at 1176 (ALJ need not address all evidence); <em>Clifford v. Apfel, </em>227 F.3d 863, 871 (7th Cir.2000) (ALJ must consider all <em>relevant </em>evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Morris next challenges the ALJ\u2019s characterization of his testimony that he answered 500 calls in one day as \u201cnot entirely credible.\u201d But Morris does not explain why this determination is \u201cflawed\u201d or even what effect it had on the ALJ\u2019s disability determination. On the contrary, Morris suggests that it is irrelevant, and we agree. So long as Morris was required to type \u201cconstantly\u201d \u2014 and the ALJ did not find his testimony on this point incredible \u2014 it does not matter whether Morris handled 5 long calls or 500 short ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Morris\u2019s final argument \u2014 that the ALJ\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence \u2014 also is unavailing. The ALJ based his decision on medical evidence from Drs. Evanich and VanWinkle that Morris\u2019s finger dexterity remained intact, and on the VE\u2019s testimony that a person having the limitations both doctors specified would be able to perform Morris\u2019s old job. This constitutes substantial evidence. <em>See, e.g., Kepple v. Massanari, </em>268 F.3d 513, 516 (7th Cir.2001) (ALJ\u2019s decision supported by medical evidence and testimony of vocational expert was based on substantial evidence); <em>Zurawski v. Halter, </em>245 F.3d 881, 887 (7th Cir.2001) (substantial evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable person might accept as an adequate basis for a conclusion). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AG\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
