We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s orders and find no reversible error. Dennis challenges the grant of summary judgment to Appellee on her malicious prosecution claim that asserted Appellee caused her to be arrested for trespassing. Dennis was not charged with trespassing because Appellee did not seek a warrant for trespassing. Based on these facts there can be no finding of malicious prosecution. In addition, Dennis raises issues for the first time on appeal. Because she has shown no extraordinary circumstances, we decline to consider these issues. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir. 1993). Finally, Dennis seeks expungement of her criminal record. Expungement of a state criminal record must be sought through the state court system.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-22\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
