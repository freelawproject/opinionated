Redfearn petitions for review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) that sustained the denial by the Fish and Wildlife Service (\u201cagency\u201d) of his application for law enforcement officer (\u201cLEO\u201d) retirement credit under the Civil Service Retirement System (\u201cCSRS\u201d). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">The CSRS provides preferential retirement credit to employees who serve as law enforcement officers. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8336(c)(1) (2000). A \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d is defined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(20) (2000) as \u201can employee, the duties of whose position are <em>primarily </em>the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">The Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) has issued a regulation explaining the term \u201cprimary duties.\u201d Under that regulation, \u201cprimary duties\u201d are duties that -</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-15\">(1) (i) Are paramount in influence or weight; that is, constitute the basic reasons for the existence of the position;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-16\">(ii) Occupy a substantial portion of the individual\u2019s working time over a typical work cycle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-17\">(iii) Are assigned on a regular and recurring basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-18\">(2) Duties that are of an emergency, incidental, or temporary nature cannot be considered \u201cprimary\u201d even if they meet the substantial portion of time criterion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-19\">5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.902 (2001). A duty typically is considered a primary duty if an employee spends an average of at least 50 percent of his or her time in its performance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-20\">Mr. Redfearn held the position of Refuge Manager, GS-04855-12. After the agency denied his application for LEO retirement credit, he appealed to the Board. Before the Board, Mr. Redfearn had the burden of establishing entitlement to LEO retirement credit by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.56(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>In an initial decision, which followed a hearing, the administrative judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) to whom the case was assigned held that Mr. Redfearn was not entitled to LEO credit because he had not shown the duties of his position to be primarily those associated with law enforcement. The AJ determined that the basic purpose of the Refuge Manager position was not the performance of law enforcement duties within the meaning of the CSRS. The AJ stated: \u201cI find that the reason for the creation of the position ... of Refuge Manager at issue in this appeal was for the protection of refuge properties, protection of wildlife on the refuge, and the conservation of land exploration and public, commercial, industrial, and agrarian land use.\u201d <em>Redfearn v. Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>No. DE-0831-01-0095-I-1, slip op. at 4 (M.S.P.B. August 14, 2001). The AJ further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-4\">The objectives of the position are to preserve, restore, and enhance populations of all species of animals and plants that are endangered or threatened; to perpetuate migratory bird resources; to preserve the natural diversity and abundance of fauna and flora on refuge lands; to provide an understanding and appreciation of fish and wildlife ecology and of the public\u2019s role in its environment; and to provide the public with high quality, safe, and recreational experiences in wildlife to the extent that the activities are compatible with the purpose for which the refuge was established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-5\"><em>Id. </em>Finally, the AJ noted that there was no evidence presented to suggest that Mr. Redfearn\u2019s position involved regular arrests, investigations, or court appearances, or that it required training in areas typical to law enforcement, such as the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the collection of evidence, and the detention of suspects. <em>Id. </em>at 5. In due course, the initial decision of the AJ sustaining the agency\u2019s denial of Mr. Redfearn\u2019s application for LEO retirement credit became the final decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">We affirm a final decision of the Board unless it is found to be \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">Mr. Redfearn argues that the decision of the Board in this case is inconsistent with the Board\u2019s decision in <em>Ferrier v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>60 M.S.P.R. 342 (1994). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">In <em>Feirier, </em>LEO retirement credit was sought by certain police officers employed by the Fish and Wildlife Service. <em>Ferrier </em>is different from this case. In <em>Fertier, </em>the Board found that the police officers seeking LEO credit were involved with between 29 and 111 crimes each year, ranging from disorderly conduct to murder. <em>Ferrier, </em>60 M.S.P.R. at 346. Additionally, the officers\u2019 manual provided training on firearms, the use of force and deadly force, chemical mace, arrests, evidence management, and the investigation of crimes. As the AJ noted, unlike in <em>Ferrier, </em>there is no evidence here \u201cto show that the appellant\u2019s position was that of a Police Officer or Agent who frequently made arrests, frequently investigated crimes committed on the Refuge, and frequently testified in civil or criminal matters as a witness.\u201d <em>Redfearn, </em>slip op. at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">Mr. Redfearn also argues that the Board\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, he claims that the Board failed to consider that the Refuge manager is fully authorized \u201cto enforce statutory laws protecting wildlife and regulations to protect property and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>the public,\u201d that the manager\u2019s authority is not limited to .Refuge lands, and that Refuge officers are first-line officers with responsibility for investigation and apprehension of offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Our review of the Board\u2019s factual conclusions leads us to conclude that there is substantial evidence to support its finding that law enforcement was not Mr. Redfearn\u2019s primary duty. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is defined as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd., </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938). That standard is met here. The Board reviewed evidence descriptive of Mr. Redfearn\u2019s position and determined that the basic reasons for the existence of his position were not related to law enforcement. This conclusion is supported by Office of Personnel Management materials descriptive of Mr. Redfearn\u2019s GS-0485 classification: the Wildlife Refuge Management Series. This reference defines the position as one that \u201crequire[s] primarily professional knowledge and competence in the management, administration, and scientific operation of public lands and waters designated as national wildlife refuges.\u201d The reference also states that Mr. Redfearn\u2019s position \u201chas as its principal purpose the conservation, protection, and propagation of wildlife species and the manipulation and utilization of their required habitat.\u201d On this basis, the Board properly found that the first factor of paragraph (1) of the regulation defining \u201cprimary duties\u201d was not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Further, the Board also considered evidence of Mr. Redfearn\u2019s actual duties. The Board concluded, and Mr. Redfearn admits, that he was not trained or required to have training in law enforcement procedures. The Board also concluded, based on an absence of evidence, that Mr. Redfearn did not have frequent contact with criminal suspects or that he was ever involved in investigations of criminal matters. Mr. Redfearn does not argue on appeal that such evidence does exist. Therefore, we find that the Board\u2019s conclusion that the duties of Mr. Redfearn\u2019s position were not \u201cprimarily\u201d law enforcement is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
