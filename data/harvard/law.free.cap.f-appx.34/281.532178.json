The Honorable Thomas S.

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Freiberg first argues that the district court erred in enhancing his base offense level twelve points, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, because it failed to offset the aggregate amount Freiberg\u2019s investors lost by any actual value that they may have received from his scheme. Freiberg, however, did not raise this argument at sentencing or otherwise object to any of the Presentence Report\u2019s factual findings regarding loss, and has thus waived any challenge relating to those underlying facts. <em>United States v. Manarite, </em>44 F.3d 1407, 1419 n. 18 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">Freiberg also argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(4) after finding that he had violated a California state administrative order by soliciting the purchase of security interests. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, <em>United States v. Sayakhom, </em>186 F.3d 928, 946 (9th Cir.1999), <em>as amended by </em>197 F.3d 959 (9th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1179, 120 S.Ct. 1216, 145 L.Ed.2d 1117 (2000), and its interpretation of California law de novo. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>72 F.3d 1370, 1377 (9th Cir. 1995). The record demonstrates that during a meeting with two undercover federal agents, Freiberg pitched investment opportunities that purported to, among other things, allow prospective investors to earn profits without contributing their own services or assisting in managerial operations. He also failed to specify whether the agents\u2019 potential capital investment would have been secured adequately by the fair market value of individual ostriches or other aspects of the breeding operation. Such an offering constituted a security under California law. <em>See </em>Cal. Corp.Code \u00a7 25019 (West 2002); <em>Hamilton Jewelers v. Dep\u2019t. of Corps., </em>37 Cal.App.3d 330, 112 Cal.Rptr. 387, 390-91 (1974). Consequently, the district court did not clearly err in enhancing Freiberg\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">Finally, Freiberg contends that the district court erred by enhancing his base offense level by four points pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a) because of his leadership role in an \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d fraudulent scheme. We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of a sentencing guideline. <em>Sayakhom, </em>186 F.3d at 946. Subsequent to Freiberg\u2019s sentencing proceeding, we clarified in <em>United States v. King, </em>257 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir.2001), that \u00a7 3B1.1(a) requires the government to prove that a defendant supervised at least one other \u201cparticipant\u201d who had independent criminal liability. <em>Id. </em>at 1024. Here, the district court did not make any such findings. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s enhancement of Freiberg\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.1(a) and remand for resentencing so that the district court can consider the leadership role enhancement in light of <em>King.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
