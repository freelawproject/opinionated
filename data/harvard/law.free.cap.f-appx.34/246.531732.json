For reversal, Pyeatt argues that the sentence was an upward departure from the Chapter 7 Guidelines and that the district court might have imposed a shorter sentence if the court had realized that Pyeatt might fail to complete a Bureau of Prisons boot-camp program. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-18\">As Pyeatt\u2019s counsel acknowledges, the court was not bound to impose a sentence within Chapter 7\u2019s recommended range. <em>See United States v. Carr, </em>66 F.3d 981, 983 (8th Cir.1995) (per curiam). Further, the district court specifically noted that Pyeatt would have to serve the full 30-month sentence in prison if he failed to complete boot camp.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-19\">Accordingly, we affirm. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-16\">. The Honorable Ortrie D. Smith, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
