R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b521-20\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b521-21\">Wisconsin inmate Roy Rogers sued sixteen employees of the Columbia Correctional Institution (CCI) under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that they violated his First Amendment rights by withholding various magazines devoted to hip-hop music and culture (\u201cVibe,\u201d \u201cSister 2 Sister,\u201d and \u201cMo\u2019 Flava\u201d) and certain \u201cinternet materials\u201d sent to him by mail. Rogers argued that although CCI purportedly withheld the magazines under prison regulations banning \u201cpornography\u201d and material that \u201cteaches or advocates ... behavior consistent with a gang,\u201d <em>see </em>Wis. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 DOC 309.04(4)(c)(8)(a), .04(4)(c)(10), the magazines lacked pornographic or gang-related content, and that CCI\u2019s policy banning Internet materials was facially invalid because prison officials had no rational reason to distinguish such materials from regular mail. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants, and Rogers appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-22\">The defendants supported their motion for summary judgment with affidavits from \u201cCertified Gang Coordinator\u201d Alan Morris and former mailroom supervisor Bruce Thomure. Morris, who testified that he receives ongoing training in gang signs, symbols, and trends, averred that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>reviewed all of the withheld magazines and that each contained either pornography or \u201cimages\u201d of \u201cgang[-]related identifiers, such as gang signing.\u201d Thomure explained in his affidavit that he instituted CCI\u2019s ban on \u201cpaper-media internet material sent to CCI inmates via U.S. Mail from a person or source other than directly from the publisher or website\u201d because such material increases the risk of sensitive information entering the prison unnoticed: senders can easily use \u201c[e]omputer technologies]\u201d such as \u201ccut[ting] and pasting]\u201d to embed information in downloaded photographs and articles before printing them, and such alterations are difficult for mailroom personnel to detect.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In both of Rogers\u2019s challenges, the question is whether the regulations (as written or as applied) are \u201creasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\u201d <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). <em>See also Shaw v. Murphy, </em>532 U.S. 223, 232, 121 S.Ct. 1475, 149 L.Ed.2d 420 (2001); <em>Thornburgh v. Abbott, </em>490 U.S. 401, 404, 109 S.Ct. 1874, 104 L.Ed.2d 459 (1989). Regarding the magazines, Rogers concedes that the defendants have a legitimate penological interest in banning gang-related materials because they may lead to violence; he does not dispute the defendants\u2019 contention that they have valid reasons for banning pornography as well. Rogers argues only that <em>his </em>magazines do not fall within either category. The only relevant evidence on this point came from Morris\u2019s affidavit. Rogers countered with affidavits from long-time readers of the excluded magazines (himself included) who claimed never to have known the publications to include gang-related content, and with copies of photographs from hip-hop magazines that had been approved by mailroom personnel and yet, according to Rogers, were representative of the withheld issues. As the district court recognized, the content of the authorized magazines says nothing about the content of the disallowed issues; indeed, if the screening process is effective, the content of those permitted and those excluded should be quite different. The affidavits are likewise irrelevant because Rogers and the other affiants (all CCI inmates) do not claim to have seen the withheld issues. Nor is Rogers\u2019s averment that the withheld issues were allowed at other Wisconsin prisons competent evidence for purposes of summary judgment; he concedes in his affidavit that he based this statement not on personal knowledge but on his \u201ccorrespondence with various men at [other] facilities who received the publications.\u201d In short, Rogers did not establish the existence of a material dispute concerning the application of a policy that he concedes to be legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">As for the ban on Internet materials, Rogers offered no evidence to contradict Thomure\u2019s justification for the policy. Moreover, Rogers does not contend that he was unable to obtain the withheld materials \u201cdirectly from the publisher or website\u201d as the policy permits. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Rogers failed to demonstrate any real- dispute concerning the reasonableness of the ban, and note that at least one other court has upheld a similar policy as reasonable. <em>See In re Collins, </em>86 Cal.App.4th 1176, 104 Cal.Rptr.2d 108 (2001) (upholding ban on \u201cInternet-generated material\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Because Rogers faked to show a triable issue as to whether either deprivation violated his First Amendment rights, his assertion that the defendants also \u201cconspired\u201d to commit the violations adds nothing. See <em>Ryan v. Mary Immaculate Queen Ctr., </em>188 F.3d 857 (7th Cir.1999). His challenge to CCI\u2019s grievance procedures also is without merit; Wisconsin provides Rogers adequate state-court remedies to recover for the deprivation of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>mail. <em>See Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984); <em>see also, e.g., Richards v. Gamble, </em>No. 01-0871, 2002 WL 203749, (Wis.Ct. App. Feb.6, 2002) (unpublished) (tort suit against warden for violations of prison policies regarding depositing inmates\u2019 funds and disposal of personal property); <em>Pischke v. Sondalle, </em>No. 00-0046, 2000 WL 678539 (Wis.Ct.App. May 25, 2000) (unpublished) (small claims action against warden for property lost in prison transfer); <em>State ex rel. Meriwether v. Melindez, </em>No. 99-0966, 1999 WL 815602 (Wis.Ct. App. Oct.14, 1999) (unpublished) (action for damages against warden for personal property lost while inmate was in segregation).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Finally, we reject Rogers\u2019s contentions that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motions for appointment of counsel and to amend the pretrial scheduling order. As the district court observed, Rogers\u2019s pleadings suggested that he was competent to represent himself. <em>See Hudson v. McHugh, </em>148 F.3d 859, 862 n. 1 (7th Cir.1998) (failure to appoint counsel not abuse of discretion where plaintiff appeared, based on his pleadings, to be \u201cas competent as any average pro se litigant\u201d). Rogers\u2019s argument concerning the scheduling order is unclear: he insists that the court\u2019s denial of his motion to \u201cstay\u201d the deadline for filing dispositive motions unfairly limited his ability to obtain discovery necessary to defend against the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, but the motion had not yet been filed when Rogers requested the stay. And even after the defendants filed their motion, Rogers never asked for additional time to respond to it or to conduct discovery. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) (nonmoving party may submit affidavit requesting continuance if further discovery is required to oppose motion for summary judgment); <em>DiCesare v. Stuart, </em>12 F.3d 973, 979 (10th Cir.1993) (Rule 56(f) applies to pro se litigants). We thus fail to see how the ruling affected the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
