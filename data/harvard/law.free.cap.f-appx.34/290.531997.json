We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. Reviewing de novo, <em>United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir.2001), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">Hoey contends that because the jury did not determine the issue of marijuana quantity, the district court erred by sentencing him under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D), instead of \u00a7 841(b)(4). Hoey\u2019s otherwise judicially estopped contention is without merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-17\">The jury found Hoey guilty of conspiring to manufacture marijuana, therefore the penalty provision for distribution under \u00a7 841(b)(4) does not apply. Moreover, we have concluded that the five-year maximum under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D) applies to \u00a7 841(a) convictions for an undetermined amount of marijuana. <em>See United States v. Nordby, </em>225 F.3d 1053, 1059 (9th Cir. 2000),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>overruled in part by United States v. Buckland, </em>277 F.3d 1173, 1181 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc) (overruling Nordby\u2019s conclusion that Congress committed drug quantity to the sentencing judge to decide by a preponderance of the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Hoey\u2019s second contention is that the district court misapplied the sentencing guidelines because it found him responsible for less than 50 marijuana plants, and thus his sentencing range should have been 10-16 months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is unsupported by the record. <em>See United States v. Fisher, </em>137 F.3d 1158, 1165 (9th Cir.1998) (addressing defendant\u2019s claim only summarily because it was unsupported by the record); <em>United States v. Shetty, </em>130 F.3d 1324, 1328 n. 1 (9th Cir.1997) (declining to address defendant\u2019s claim because it was unsupported by any authority). The district court expressly found Hoey responsible for at least 600 marijuana plants. <em>See Buckland, </em>at 1184 (stating that <em>Apprendi </em>does not alter the judge\u2019s authority to calculate drug quantity for purposes of the U.S.S.G., so long as the sentence actually imposed does not exceed the statutory maximum as determined by the jury\u2019s quantity finding). Accordingly, the district court did not err by sentencing Hoey to 60 months. <em>See Nordby, </em>225 F.3d at 1059.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b331-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-13\">. Hoey argued before the district court that because of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), it should sentence him under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D), but he now contends that it erred by doing so. Furthermore, Hoey agreed in the district court that \u00a7 841(b)(4) did not apply to his case, but he now argues that it does. Although not raised by the government, we recognize that Hoey is judicially estopped from making this contention. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>37 F.3d 1359, 1367-68 (9th Cir.1994) (stating that it is an abuse of the judicial process for a parly to take inconsistent positions in the same litigation), <em>receded from on other grounds by United States v. Jackson, </em>167 F.3d 1280 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b331-19\">. We decline Hoey\u2019s invitation to reconsider the rule announced in <em>Nordby. </em>Not only is Hoey\u2019s argument unsupported in law, a three-judge panel cannot overrule a prior decision of this court. <em>See Hart v. Massanari, </em>266 F.3d 1155, 1171-72 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\">. In his reply brief, Hoey contends that the district court erred in its calculation of the guideline range because the record only supported a finding that he was responsible for 194 marijuana plants, resulting in a sentencing range of 33 \u2014 41 months. We will not consider this otherwise unsupported, foreclosed and incorrect contention raised for the first time in the reply brief. <em>See United States v. Patterson, </em>230 F.3d 1168, 1172 n. 3 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
