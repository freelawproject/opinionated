Prior to the events under review on this appeal, the Olsens obtained an order of protection against Spallone, and Spallone obtained an order of protection against the Olsens. Mary had power of attorney and a health care proxy for her mother, while Spallone had the same powers for her father, Salvatore Cartaeio.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">On May 5, 1994, Carol Spallone and officers employed by the Suffolk County Police Department entered Cartacio\u2019s home, which Tomas and Mary claim was also their home. The testimony at trial varied as to whether either of the Olsens gave the officers and Spallone permission to enter. During the course of the visit, Spallone took certain papers from a table. Tomas claims that these papers were papers he needed to defend himself against a lawsuit Spallone had brought against him in which she alleged that Tomas defrauded Cartaeio by causing him to invest in a fraudulent corporation. Spallone, however, testified that she took only Cartacio\u2019s 1988 tax return and a travel brochure.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">Cartaeio later brought an eviction proceeding against the Olsens, alleging that they entered his home without permission on May 4, 1994. The Olsens ultimately were evicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">In August 1995, the Olsens filed a civil rights complaint against the Suffolk County Police Department, Suffolk County, Carol Spallone, and several John Does. The Olsens claimed defendants had violated the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The Fourth Amendment claim covered both the allegedly illegal entry and the seizure of Tomas\u2019 papers. Spallone counterclaimed, but prior to trial, the Olsens and Spallone withdrew their claims against each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">After both sides rested, the Suffolk County defendants moved to dismiss all of the Olsens\u2019 claims. Magistrate Judge Pohorelsky granted the motion except as to Tomas\u2019 claim that defendants violated the Fourth Amendment by seizing his papers. The jury ruled against Tomas on the only issue presented to it, the seizure of the papers. In response to a special verdict question, the jury indicated that police officers did not seize or assist in seizing the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">On appeal the Olsens argue that (1) the court improperly dismissed their Eighth and Fourth Amendment search claims; (2) the jury charge on the Fourth Amendment seizure claim was overbroad and unclear; (8) the court should not have removed Spallone as a defendant without a hearing; and (4) the court improperly allowed the jury to hear about prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">We initially dismissed the Olsens\u2019 appeal because they had not filed trial transcripts but ordered reinstatement of the appeal upon the filing of transcripts. The Olsens now have filed transcripts, and we consider the merits of their arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>The court committed no error in dismissing the claims against Spallone since the Olsens stipulated to this relief. Because the Olsens provide no specifics or argument concerning the alleged improper admission of prior convictions, we can find no error. The Fourth Amendment illegal entry claim was properly dismissed because the police entered with the consent of Spallone who held a power of attorney for her father, the lawful occupant of the house. <em>See United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 171-72, 94 S.Ct. 988, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974) (holding that police may rely on \u201cpermission to search ... from a third party who possessed common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected\u201d despite lack of consent by the defendant). Because the Olsens received no punishment as the result of a conviction of a crime, the district court correctly determined that the Eighth Amendment does not apply to their claims. <em>See Ingraham v. Wright, </em>430 U.S. 651, 671 n. 40, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977). The court also correctly dismissed the Olsens\u2019 Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claims because these claims addressed conduct covered by the Fourth Amendment, making the Fourth Amendment analysis that the court performed the only appropriate one. <em>See Lauro v. Charles Marvin, </em>219 F.3d 202, 207-08 (2d Cir.2000). Finally, the court\u2019s charge on seizure set out the governing law and was neither vague nor confusing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
