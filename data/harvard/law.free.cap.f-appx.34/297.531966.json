We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">Williams was arrested by officers of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department on two arrest warrants issued as a result of Williams\u2019 failure to complete a sentence previously imposed by the Las Vegas Municipal Court for two misdemeanor traffic violations. He was transported to the Las Vegas Department of Detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">All of the police conduct that furnishes the basis for Williams\u2019 claims occurred at the Detention Center and was videotaped by the in-house surveillance cameras from three different positions. The District Court carefully set forth the claims and the evidence before it and concluded that \u201cthe evidence adduced (as compared to Plaintiffs unsupported allegations contained in his Complaint) does not support Plaintiffs Complaint that Officer Medcalf used excessive force against Williams during the booking process. <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 6, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). Nor does the Court find that the use of waist and leg restraints employed in restraining Plaintiff Williams in the jail cell constitutes a violation of the Eighth Amendment. <em>LeMaire v. Maass, </em>12 F.3d 1444, 1448 (9th Cir. 1993).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-16\">The parties differ as to whether Williams\u2019 claims must be evaluated under Eighth Amendment standards or under Fourteenth Amendment standards. This Court does not need to resolve that issue because we find that the result is the same whether examined under the Eighth Amendment\u2019s excessive force standards applicable to prisoners or the Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Amendment\u2019s substantive due process standards applicable to pretrial detainees.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Section 1983 requires a claimant to prove that a person acting under color of state law deprived the claimant of a right, privilege, or immunity protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States. <em>Leer v. Murphy, </em>844 F.2d 628, 632-633 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The analysis of whether the actions of the City constitute a Fourteenth Amendment violation is informed by this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>White v. Roper, </em>901 F.2d 1501 (9th Cir.1990). This Court stated that to show a violation of substantive due process, White must show \u201cegregious government conduct in the form of excessive and brutal use of physical force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1507 (citations omitted). We set forth a four-part test for determining whether such excessive force was used. The factors are: (1) the need for the application of force; (2) the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used; (3) the extent of the injury inflicted; and (4) whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain and restore discipline. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">To demonstrate that the City\u2019s conduct violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, Williams must show that the conduct was \u201cunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\u201d <em>Jeffers v. Gomez, </em>267 F.3d 895, 910 (9th Cir.2001) (citations omitted). Where a prison security measure is undertaken ostensibly for the protection of prison officials and the inmate population, force does not \"violate the Eighth Amendment so long as it is applied \u201cin a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline [and not] maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 910-11 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">This Court has reviewed the record and the briefs of the parties. Since the briefs differed in describing the actions shown on videotape, we have carefully viewed the original videotape in Court conference. We conclude that the treatment of which Williams complains does not rise to the level required to state a constitutional violation. We conclude that the district court did not err in its evaluation of the evidence and pleadings before it, nor in its application of the law that applies to cases of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">The videotape supports the district court\u2019s findings that Officer Medcalf did not slam Williams\u2019 head or body into a counter, wall or floor, and that Williams refused to stand still during the frisk search at the Detention Center. Given Williams\u2019 erratic and seemingly uncooperative behavior, the restrictions that Officer Medcalf placed on Williams were not unconstitutionally excessive. Rather, they were reasonably related to the City\u2019s legitimate interest in securing his appearance before the municipal court for a status check regarding the completion of his sentence. There is no evidence that Officer Medcalf applied the restrictions maliciously, or without a legitimate, good-faith intent to maintain discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">We hold that the district court did not err in finding that Williams\u2019 treatment was not in violation of the Constitution. This is true whether the record is reviewed under the Eighth Amendment\u2019s excessive force standards applicable to prisoners, or the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s substantive due process standards applicable to pretrial detainees.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b338-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
