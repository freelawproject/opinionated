Edwards\u2019s employment, Edwards filed a complaint in federal district court in April 2000 alleging illegal race and age discrimination. In January 2002, the district court dismissed Edwards\u2019s case because of Edwards\u2019s failure to comply with court orders and observe relevant procedural rules of the court. Edwards appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his case with prejudice and denial of his request to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-20\">Edwards is proceeding pro se. Although we construe Edwards\u2019s arguments liberally, we cannot find in Edwards\u2019s documents any evidence which would contradict the magistrate judge\u2019s findings. Edwards refused to provide the required prediscovery disclosures, respond to Long-view Fibre\u2019s discovery requests, pay the sanction the court imposed or offer evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>dence to show he cannot pay the sanction, and produce factual support for his claims. Based on these facts, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Edwards\u2019s case with prejudice. Further, we grant Edwards\u2019s request for in forma pauperis status on appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
