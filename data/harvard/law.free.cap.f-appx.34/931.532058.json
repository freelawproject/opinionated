We find the district court properly sentenced Dyke and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>Dyke contends the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement pursuant to <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2F1.1(b)(7) (1998) based on its finding that his fraudulent conduct involved the reckless risk of serious bodily injury and in imposing a four-level enhancement under \u00a7\u00a7 3A1.1(b)(1) and (b)(2) for an offense involving a large number of unusually vulnerable victims. We review the district court\u2019s factual determinations for clear error. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>102 F.3d 1350, 1357-58 (4th Cir.1996). Given the circumstances of Dyke\u2019s offense,, we find the district court did not clearly err in applying the enhancements. <em>See United States v. Singh, </em>54 F.3d 1182, 1191 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Dyke also challenges the district court\u2019s seven-level upward departure for non-monetary loss and extreme conduct. We find the district court did not error in departing upward seven levels. <em>See United States v. Bonetti, </em>277 F.3d 441, 449 (4th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Rybicki, </em>96 F.3d 754, 757 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Dyke\u2019s 108 month sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
