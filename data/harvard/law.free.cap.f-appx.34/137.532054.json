The district court denied the motion without discussion; Goodman noted a timely appeal. For the reasons discussed below, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-19\">Goodman filed the motion for return of property on June 18, 2000. According to the district court\u2019s docket sheet, the property was administratively forfeited in February 1994. The Government stated in its response to Goodman\u2019s motion that it served a copy of its \u201cmotion for destruction of evidence\u201d on Goodman\u2019s trial attorney. At the time, Goodman was in federal custody, serving a 241-month sentence for drug and firearms offenses. Goodman contends, and the Government does not refute, that Goodman\u2019s trial attorney was no longer representing him at the time notice was served on the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-21\">In administrative forfeiture proceedings, notice must be \u201creasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action .... The means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.\u201d <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314-15, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950). In <em>United States v. Minor, </em>228 F.3d 352 (4th Cir.2000), we decided that, when holding a property owner in custody and at the same time desirous of actually informing that owner of the impending forfeiture, the government is required to prove, not that the prisoner received actual notice, but that the procedures employed to provide notice were substantially reliable. <em>Minor, </em>228 F.3d at 358. We noted that, in most cases, the government could meet its burden by showing that: (1) it sent a certified letter, return receipt requested, to the facility where the prisoner was being housed; (2) the return receipt was signed by a prison official; and (3) mail delivery procedures at that facility were reasonably calculated to ensure that the notice would reach the inmate and would be accepted only where the inmate was actually present. <em>Id.See also Dusenbery v. United States, </em>534 U.S. 161, 122 S.Ct. 694, 151 L.Ed.2d 597 (2002) (holding that due process does not entitle a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>prisoner to actual notice of an administrative forfeiture; instead, the question is whether \u201cthe notice in this case [was] \u2018reasonably calculated under all the circumstances\u2019 to apprise petitioner of the pendency of the ... forfeiture\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Applying this analysis, we find that the Government\u2019s notice <em>to Goodman </em>was clearly inadequate. In its response to Goodman\u2019s motion, the Government submitted no evidence whatsoever to show that any attempt was made to notify Goodman, who was no longer represented by counsel, of the forfeiture of his property. The Government\u2019s unsupported assertion that Goodman \u201cwas served with the motion, through his attorney,\u201d even if true, is insufficient notice under <em>Minor </em>or <em>Dusenbery. </em>The \u201cmotion for destruction of evidence\u201d was filed more than a year after Goodman was sentenced, <em>cf. Bye v. Uni</em>ted <em>States, </em>105 F.3d 856, 857 (2d Cir.1997) (pretrial detainee, whose attorney was served with notice and acknowledged its receipt, was sufficiently notified), and the Government was aware of Goodman\u2019s whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">However, Goodman\u2019s motion may nevertheless be untimely. The applicable limitations period for an action seeking return of forfeited property is six years. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a) (1994); <em>United States v. Minor, </em>228 F.3d at 359. To decide whether Goodman filed his action outside the six-year limitations period, it is necessary to determine when the cause of action accrued. The cause of action accrues and the limitations period begins to run on the date when the movant first becomes aware that the government declared the property forfeited or when, through an inquiry he reasonably could have been expected to make, he would have been aware of the forfeiture. <em>Id. </em>at 359. In this case, the record is not sufficiently developed to determine when the cause of action accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order denying relief on the motion for return of property and remand to the district court for a determination of when the cause of action accrued and whether Goodman\u2019s motion was timely filed. If the motion was timely, Goodman should be permitted to proceed with his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
