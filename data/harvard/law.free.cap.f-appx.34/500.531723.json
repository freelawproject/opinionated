Capital Engineering, Inc., </em>185 F.3d 804, 808 (7th Cir.1999). And indeed the district court did award fees on remand, on the basis of the frivolous nature of Poteete\u2019s suit and of his incessant follow-up filings, also frivolous. The award precipitated the current appeal, which is pro se and completely frivolous-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>we cannot discern an intelligible argument and are given no basis for thinking that the award of fees was an abuse of discretion or otherwise unwarranted. The judgment of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"Ayd\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
