The Appeals Council, however, disagreed and denied benefits. Khang, represented by counsel, then filed a complaint in federal district court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). A magistrate judge recommended that the district court affirm the Appeals Council\u2019s decision because it was supported by substantial evidence. The district court, noting that Khang had not filed any objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, adopted the report and recommendation and affirmed the Appeals Council\u2019s decision. Khang now wishes to appeal the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-21\">The Commissioner argues that by failing to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report in the district court, Khang has waived her right to appeal. We agree. A party\u2019s failure to object to a magistrate judge\u2019s report issued pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) waives the right to appeal all factual and legal issues. <em>Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 142, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985); <em>Johnson v. Zema Systems Corp., </em>170 F.3d 734, 739 (7th Cir. 1999); <em>Video Views, Inc. v. Studio 21, Ltd., </em>797 F.2d 538, 539 (7th Cir.1986); <em>see also Howell v. Sullivan, </em>950 F.2d 343, 347 (7th Cir.1991) (applying this waiver rule in a social security disability benefits case). This court will enforce that rule as long as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>the litigant is informed of the consequences of fading to make a timely objection. <em>Provident Bank v. Manor Steel Corp., </em>882 F.2d 258, 261-62 (7th Cir.1989). Here, the clerk mailed the magistrate judge\u2019s report to Khang\u2019s counsel along with a letter specifically warning that Khang had 10 days after service of the report to file objections, and a notice stating that failure to do so \u201cmay constitute a waiver of [her] right to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals.\u201d Nonetheless, Khang filed no objections to the report. She therefore has waived appellate review unless she can demonstrate \u201csufficient cause\u201d for failing to do so. <em>See United States v. Raymond, </em>228 F.3d 804, 810 (7th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Counsel\u2019s only explanation for failing to file objections is that, in his opinion, objecting would have been futile. But litigants may not simply bypass the district court because they think they will be unsuccessful. The reason that we require objections to be filed under \u00a7 636(b)(1) is to give the district court the first opportunity to consider them and modify the magistrate judge\u2019s report accordingly-Thomas, 474 U.S. at 147-48, 106 S.Ct. 466; <em>Provident, </em>882 F.2d at 262. Because counsel failed to do so and has provided no legitimate reason excusing this failure, Khang may not now appeal to this court. Although we are sympathetic to Khang\u2019s plight, in civil litigation \u201cthe mistakes of counsel, who is the legal agent of the client, are chargeable to the client.\u201d <em>Kagan v. Caterpiller Tractor Co., </em>795 F.2d 601, 611 (7th Cir.1986) (citation omitted); <em>see also Link v. Wabash Railroad Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 633-34, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962). Thus, Khang\u2019s recourse at this point would be to seek malpractice damages from her attorney. To hold otherwise under these circumstances would eviscerate our rule requiring that litigants first file their objections with the district court before they may seek appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">AFFIRMED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
