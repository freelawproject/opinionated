United States, </em>811 F.2d 736, 739-40 (2d Cir.1987). The magistrate judge correctly applied this principle in determining that defendants were entitled to summary judgment in light of plaintiffs failure to proffer evidence from a medical expert as to the standard of care prevailing in the medical community. <em>See, e.g., McDonnell v. County of Nassau, </em>129 Misc.2d 228, 229, 233, 492 N.Y.S.2d 699, 700, 702 (Sup.Ct.Nas.Co.1985) (answering the question \u201cis a licensed psychologist competent to testify as an expert witness in a medical malpractice action against a psychiatrist and/or hospital where the issue is the alleged departure from good and accepted medical and/or psychiatric practice?\u201d in the negative: \u201c[WJhere a medical discipline is in issue, a non-medical person cannot be permitted to offer testimony to a jury to establish what the proper medical and/or psychiatric standard of care was in this case and what, if any, departures from that standard of care were committed by the defendants.\u201d). Plaintiffs reliance on cases such as <em>Korek v. United States, </em>734 F.2d 923 (2d Cir.1984), and <em>Karasik v. Bird, </em>98 A.D.2d 359, 470 N.Y.S.2d 605 (1st Dep\u2019t 1984), is misplaced. In <em>Karasik, </em>the testimony by the nonmedical expert went to whether the chemicals in question could have caused the plaintiffs injury, not to the standard of care in the medical community and to whether the defendant deviated from it. <em>See id. </em>at 363, 470 N.Y.S.2d at 608. And in <em>Korek, </em>the defendant had conceded negligence. <em>See </em>734 F.2d at 924.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-17\">We have considered all of plaintiffs contentions on this appeal, including those with regard to pretrial discovery, and have found in them no basis for reversal. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
