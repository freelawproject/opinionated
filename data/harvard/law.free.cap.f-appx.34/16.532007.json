After the jury returned a verdict for the defense, Accardo sought a new trial. The district court denied the motion, finding none of Accardo\u2019s claims sufficient to indicate that the jury\u2019s verdict was a \u201cseriously erroneous result\u201d or a \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>See United States v. Landau, </em>155 F.3d 93, 104 (2d Cir.1998). Having reviewed Accardo\u2019s claims on appeal, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the new trial motion. <em>See Luciano v. Olsten Corp., </em>110 F.3d 210, 217 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-19\">For the reasons set forth above, the district court\u2019s denial of Accardo\u2019s motion for a new trial is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
