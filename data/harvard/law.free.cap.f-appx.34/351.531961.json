Justice appeals the district court\u2019s grant of Defendant Martin Automatic, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cMAI\u201d) cross-motion for partial summary judgment on Justice\u2019s age discrimination claim under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (\u201cFEHA\u201d). On <em>de novo </em>review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-25\">California employs a three part burden shifting analysis for evaluating discrimination cases. <em>Guz v. Bechtel Nat\u2019l, Inc., </em>24 Cal.4th 317, 100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089, 1113 (Cal.2000) (citing <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)). Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, the employee bears the initial burden of demonstrating a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination against the employer. If the employee establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision. Finally, the plaintiff must show that the employer\u2019s asserted reason for termination is a pretext for another motive that is discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-26\">Although Justice presented a <em>pnma facie </em>case of discrimination,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> MAI presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>a legitimate reason for termination, namely Justice\u2019s lackluster sales combined with MAI\u2019s desire to re-hire an outstanding former employee in his place. Thus, the burden shifted to Justice to show that the stated reason for discharge was false and that the true reason was a discriminatory one. To meet its burden, Justice needed to produce \u201c \u2018specific, substantial evidence of pretext.\u2019 \u201d <em>Horn v. Cushman &amp; Wakefield Western, Inc., </em>72 Cal.App.4th 798, 85 Cal.Rptr.2d 459, 466 (Cal.App.1999) (quoting <em>Bradley v. Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., </em>104 F.3d 267, 270 (9th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Justice attempted to meet his burden by pointing to allegedly inconsistent statements by David Wright, MAI\u2019s Vice President of Sales, regarding the reasons for Justice\u2019s termination. However, even if Wright\u2019s statements were inconsistent, Justice presented no evidence that his termination was motivated by animus toward older workers. To the contrary, the evidence demonstrates that MAI does not discriminate against older individuals. MAI presented employment data showing that in 1997, 40 percent of all employees at MAI and 76 percent of MAI\u2019s Sales Department were over forty years old. In fact, Wright, who terminated Justice, was nearly as old as Justice, and the company head with whom Wright consulted was even older than Justice. Having presented insufficient evidence that MAI\u2019s stated reasons for termination were pretextual, Justice\u2019s age discrimination claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b391-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-28\">.
