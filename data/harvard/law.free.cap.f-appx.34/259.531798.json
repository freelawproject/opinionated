Long.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Aubrey was convicted of first-degree murder in 1990. In 1992, the California Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction and the California Supreme Court denied review. Aubrey filed a federal habeas petition on October 15,1996.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 9, 1997, the district court dismissed the petition for asserting unexhausted claims, without giving Aubrey an opportunity to amend the petition to strike them. Aubrey filed the habeas petition at issue in this case on March 13, 1998. On January 12, 1999, the district court dismissed the petition as time-barred under \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Aubrey argues on appeal that equitable and statutory tolling rendered his petition timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition as untimely under \u00a7 2244(d)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is no dispute that Aubrey\u2019s conviction was final before the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> became effective. Thus, AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations began running on April 24, 1996,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, barring tolling, expired on April 24, 1997. Aubrey filed his petition almost a year later, on March 13,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-18\">Aubrey first argues that equitable tolling under <em>Tillema v. </em>Long<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> applies to his case. We agree, and therefore we do not reach Aubrey\u2019s other arguments. In <em>Tillema, </em>the district court dismissed a petition after the limitation period had run for failure to exhaust, but without affording the petitioner an opportunity to strike his unexhausted claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court dismissed the petitioner\u2019s next petition as untimely under \u00a7 2244(d)(1).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We reversed because we concluded that the district court had violated <em>Rose v. </em>Lundy<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> by dismissing the previous petition without affording the petitioner an opportunity to amend the petition to strike his unexhausted claims.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-19\">In <em>Rose, </em>the Supreme Court held that a district court must dismiss petitions containing a mix of exhausted and unexhausted claims, \u201cleaving the prisoner with the choice of returning to state court to exhaust his claims or of amending or resubmitting the habeas petition to present only unexhausted claims to the district court.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Tillema, </em>we observed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>under <em>Rose, </em>\u201cwe have \u2018long held that a federal habeas petitioner has a right to amend a mixed petition to delete unexhausted claims as an alternative to suffering a dismissal^]\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> especially a dismissal after the end of the limitation period, which \u201cliterally and immediately extinguish[es] [the petitioner\u2019s] right to federal habeas review.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, \u201cany time in excess of AEDPA\u2019s limitation period should be equitably tolled\u201d in such circumstances.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Aubrey\u2019s case falls squarely under the <em>Tillema </em>analysis. Aubrey filed a timely petition on October 15, 1996. The district court dismissed the petition for failure to exhaust state remedies, without affording Aubrey an opportunity to amend the petition to strike any unexhausted claims. This dismissal came after the end of the AEDPA limitation period.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The district court dismissed Aubrey\u2019s next petition as untimely. Thus, the district court violated Aubrey\u2019s \u201cright to amend a mixed petition to delete unexhausted claims as an alternative to suffering dismissal ... literally and immediately extinguish[ing] his right to federal habeas review.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that Aubrey \u201cis entitled to a determination that his [subsequent] habeas petition was timely filed.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We need not reach Aubrey\u2019s other tolling arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b299-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-8\">. 253 F.3d 494 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b300-9\">.

We note that this language could be interpreted to mean that an erroneous dismissal without affording the opportunity to strike unexhausted claims tolls the limitation period indefinitely, rendering timely even a petition filed a number of years later.
