We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinions and find no reversible error. Although the district court construed Watkins\u2019 claim that his base offense level should be reduced to thirty-eight in accordance with Amendment 505 to the sentencing guidelines as being filed under \u00a7 2255, the claim was properly brought under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We find that any error in construing that claim is harmless because, applying the Amendment to Watkins\u2019 ease, he is not entitled to relief. We also find that the district court properly denied Watkins\u2019 remaining claims as being successive. Finally, with regard to the denial of his motion for reconsideration, Watkins failed to challenge that order in his informal brief and, therefore, has waived appellate review under 4th Cir. R. 34(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal substantially on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Watkins, </em>Nos. CR-90-260-A; CA-93-1035-AM (E.D. Va. Jan. 4, 2002; Feb. 11, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
