The Board dismissed petitioners\u2019 appeals on the ground that the reports Mrs. Gernert had made did not amount to a protected disclosure within the meaning of the Whistleblower Protection Act (\u201cWPA\u201d). <em>Gernert v. Dep\u2019t of the </em>Army, Nos. DE-1221-99-0125-W-1, DE-1221-99-0128-W-1, 2000 WL 1007279 (M.S.P.B. July 14, 2000) (final order). Because the Board correctly determined that petitioners failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a protected disclosure under the WPA had been made, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">This dispute stems from the involuntary transfers of Mr. and Mrs. Gernert from positions they held at the Army Knowledge Network at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to other positions within the government. The transfers followed and are alleged to be in reprisal for disclosures by Mrs. Gernert of what she considered to be misuse of government time and facilities by her immediate supervisor, Becky Doyal. Specifically, Mrs. Gernert reported to Ms. Doyal\u2019s supervisor, Dr. Morris, and subsequently to an Inspector General, that she observed Ms. Doyal making personal and private business-related telephone calls using government telephones at various times during regular government office hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">After exhausting their administrative remedies, petitioners each filed an IRA appeal, alleging that the transfers were in retaliation for Mrs. Gernert\u2019s disclosure of Ms. Doyal\u2019s telephone usage. After a hearing, the administrative judge found that Mrs. Gernert\u2019s reports were not protected disclosures within the meaning of the WPA, and concluded that the Board lacked jurisdiction. The full Board denied petitioners\u2019 petition for review of the administrative judge\u2019s initial decisions, which therefore became the final decisions of the Board. Petitioners timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b800-14\">The WPA provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-15\">(b) Any employee who has the authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-16\">(8) take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>with respect to any employee or applicant for employment because of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-5\">(A) any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-6\">(i) a violation of any law, rule or regulation, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-7\">(ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b) (2000). This court has interpreted the WPA to require four elements of proof to establish a violation of section 2302(b)(8): \u201c(1) the acting official has the authority to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action; (2) the aggrieved employee made a disclosure protected under section 2302(b)(8); (3) the acting official used his authority to take, or refuse to take, a personnel action against the aggrieved employee; [and] (4) the acting official took, or failed to take, the personnel action against the aggrieved employee because of the protected disclosure.\u201d <em>Frederick v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>73 F.3d 349, 352 (Fed.Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Eidmann v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>976 F.2d 1400, 1407 (Fed.Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Jurisdiction over an IRA claim under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8) is vested in the Board. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221(a) (2000). For the Board to have subject matter jurisdiction over an IRA appeal under the WPA, a petitioner must assert a non-frivolous claim that the WPA has been violated. <em>Langer v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>265 F.3d 1259, 1265 (Fed. Cir.2001). Thereafter, \u201cto prevail in [an] IRA appeal, [appellant must] demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he made a disclosure that he reasonably believed evidenced a violation of law, rule or regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Meuwissen v. Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>234 F.3d 9, 12 (Fed.Cir. 2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Petitioners in this case have alleged that Mrs. Gernert made a protected disclosure to persons with authority, precipitating personnel actions against petitioners. These allegations are non-frivolous and meet the threshold necessary to trigger Board jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">After properly conducting a hearing on the merits and determining that petitioners had not established a prima facie case, the Board decided the case and characterized its disposition as a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Because petitioners had made non-frivolous allegations in support of their claims, the Board\u2019s characterization of its decision as a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was not technically correct, and the proper course of action would have been to dismiss for failure of proof. <em>Langer, </em>265 F.3d at 1264-65 (\u201cAlthough the Board stated that it was dismissing Langer\u2019s IRA appeal for \u2018lack of jurisdiction,\u2019 its disposition of this case is more appropriately characterized as a failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted (i.e., Langer has failed to establish the required elements of his IRA appeal).\u201d); <em>Spruill v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>978 F.2d 679, 689 (Fed.Cir.1992) (\u201cWhen a nonfrivolous claim for relief has been asserted before the Board, and the outcome is determined by whether the facts support that claim, a decision by the Board that they do not is a failure to prove the claim, not a lack of jurisdiction in the Board.\u201d). The Board\u2019s incorrect characterization was harmless, however, for on the record before us, it is clear that the Board properly applied the correct standard in finding that Mrs. Gernert\u2019s reports did not constitute a protected disclosure under the WPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">While a protected disclosure may encompass any number of things, this court has held that the WPA was not intended to apply to disclosure of \u201ctrivial or de minimis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>matters.\u201d <em>Herman v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>193 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed.Cir.1999). The \u201cWPA was enacted to protect employees who report genuine violations of law, not to encourage employees to report minor or inadvertent miscues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1381. The Board found that \u201cDoyal\u2019s misuse of the government telephone was of a de minimis nature.\u201d <em>Gernert v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>No. DE-1221-99-0125-W-1, slip op. at 20 (M.S.P.B. Dec.13, 1999) (initial decision) <em>(\u201cGernert </em>/\u201d); <em>Gernert v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>No. DE-1221-99-0128-W-1, slip op. at 19 (M.S.P.B. Dec.15, 1999) (initial decision) <em>(\u201cGernert II\u201d). </em>This determination was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Mrs. Gernert alleged that Ms. Doyal was running a private real estate business on government time. However, the Board found that \u201c[t]here is no evidence to show that Doyal was running a private business out of her government office. I find that Doyal\u2019s use of the government telephones was limited to her personal time and involved just a few rental properties.\u201d <em>Gernert I </em>at 18; <em>Gernert II </em>at 18. This finding is supported by substantial evidence. Mrs. Gernert herself admitted that the number of calls ranged from only \u201cone or two\u201d in a day to \u201cseveral.\u201d Trial transcript at 81. She also alleged that she saw Ms. Doyal write business checks only \u201ca couple of times.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, Mrs. Gernert \u201c[couldn\u2019t] say whether [Ms. Doyal] did or didn\u2019t\u201d bring other paperwork related to the rental business with her to the office. <em>Id. </em>Lt. Col. Schillare, who undertook the formal investigation of Ms. Doyal\u2019s telephone usage, testified that such use of government telephones was \u201ca relatively common activity\u201d that should be stopped, but was not particularly serious. <em>Id. </em>at 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Mrs. Gernert\u2019s disclosure, which the administrative judge found to bear on relatively trivial actions, simply does not rise to the level of a protected disclosure within the meaning of the WPA. Because petitioners have failed to establish by preponderant evidence this element of a prima facie case of a violation of the WPA, we need not and do not consider whether the personnel actions alleged to have been taken against them were in reprisal for Mrs. Gernert\u2019s reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Our scope of review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is strictly limited by statute. Specifically, we must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we find it to be: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000), <em>Serrao v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>95 F.3d 1569, 1573 (Fed.Cir.1996). On the record before us, we find no basis to conclude that dismissal of petitioners\u2019 appeal by the Board was in error, and, accordingly, <em>affirm.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
