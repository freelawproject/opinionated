In response to defendants\u2019 motion for (1) summary judgment on all claims, (2) dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(5) as to unserved defendants McEntee, Seferian, Pepe, and AFSCME; (3) dismissal of the LMRDA \u00a7 101(a)(2) (free speech) claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as against defendants associated with Local 375; and (4) dismissal of the LMRDA \u00a7 501 claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for failure to comply with a condition precedent for asserting that claim and, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), for failure to state a claim, the district court dismissed Commer\u2019s complaint in its entirety. <em>See Commer v. McEntee, </em>145 F.Supp.2d 333 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">Judge Sweet dismissed the free speech claim against defendants associated with Local 375 because the last private sector employees associated with the local disaffiliated late in 1999, Commer complained of conduct occurring in 2000, and unions consisting solely of public employees are not subject to the LMRDA. <em>Id. </em>at 338 (citing <em>Brock v. So. Region, Region III of the CSEA, </em>808 F.2d 228, 230 n. 3 (2d Cir. 1987)). Dismissal of the Section 101(a)(2) retaliation/free speech claim against the remaining defendants pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) was premised on the court\u2019s finding that \u201cCommer has not alleged sufficient facts that his \u2018speech\u2019 was protected under the LMRDA or that the \u2018speech\u2019 was the cause of the union\u2019s action against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340. The court granted summary judgment dismissing Commer\u2019s Section 301 claim concerning the interpretation of Local 375\u2019s constitution because the union\u2019s interpretation was correct 'and Commer offered no evidence showing that it was arbitrary. <em>Id. </em>Finally, with respect to Commer\u2019s LMRDA \u00a7 501 claim, the court found both that (1) AFSCME and Local 37 were not proper defendants because Section 501 claims cannot be brought against unions themselves and (2) Commer failed to make an actual demand upon the union to initiate legal action against the officers. <em>Id. </em>at 338-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">This appeal followed. Commer argues that the dismissal of each of his claims was erroneous on various bases including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>district court\u2019s refusal to direct defendants to produce discovery Commer had previously requested and to order further discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Commer\u2019s LMRA Section 301 claim. Commer was disciplined, in part, because he sent out election notices in the local\u2019s name and at its expense without approval from any official body and thus, in the view of AFSCME\u2019s judicial panel, violated art. XIX \u00a7 3 of Local 375\u2019s constitution. Commer argues that the judicial panel misinterpreted art. XIX \u00a7 3. This section provides that \u201c[n]o literature shall be distributed in the name of the Guild or a chapter, unless authorized by the appropriate body.\u201d Commer conceded at his hearing that he did not seek or receive permission from any official body before sending the notices, but he argues that as the local\u2019s president, he had the authority to send out required notices without permission. We agree with the district court that art. XIX \u00a7 3 cannot be read to allow an individual union officer to send out materials in the local\u2019s name solely on his own initiative. Although Commer also alleges that the local did not enforce this provision against another of its officers who expressed his political opinions in letters to members without receiving official authorization, the union\u2019s allegedly discriminatory enforcement of the constitutional provision does not alter its plain meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Commer\u2019s LMRDA \u00a7 501 claim for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Commer, </em>145 F.Supp.2d at 338-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The district court dismissed Commer\u2019s claim that defendants disciplined him in retaliation for his exercise of free speech in violation of LMRDA \u00a7 101(a)(2) pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">In his complaint, Commer alleged a long sequence of events that he asserts are relevant to his claim that defendants retaliated against him for his exercise of free speech. Concerning the year 2000, he alleges that \u201cMcEntee and Seferian closefd] circle of placing chill on Member\u2019s freedom of speech and political dissent by suspension of plaintiff for sending Members notice of election/change of electors, after requesting defendant McEntee\u2019s administrator to do so.\u201d Compl. at 16. Commer also alleged that defendants had never used the constitutional provision used against him to discipline any other union officer. Compl. at 2. Commer clearly satisfied his minimal pleading burden of \u201cgivfing] the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiffs claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, N.A., </em>534 U.S. 506, 122 S.Ct. 992, 998, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002) (quoting <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). \u201cA court may dismiss a complaint only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.\u201d <em>Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding, </em>467 U.S. 69, 73, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 81 L.Ed.2d 59 (1984). If Commer is able to establish that his suspension was motivated by his speech rather than by his breach of a union rule, he may be able to obtain relief. Therefore, dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Because defendants moved for summary judgment on Commer\u2019s free speech claim, we also examine whether we can affirm on the alternative basis that summary judgment was justified. The basis of the district court\u2019s rejection of Commer\u2019s free speech claim was its finding that the real reason for his suspension was his use of union funds to send the postcard and not his speech. <em>Commer, </em>145 F.Supp.2d at 340 (citing <em>Commer v. McEntee, </em>121 F.Supp.2d 388, 396-97 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)). Although there is a substantial basis in the record for this conclusion, intent is controverted. Commer alleges that the judicial panel\u2019s decision was pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>textual as demonstrated by the use of union funds for similar purposes by another union president without subsequent discipline. Moreover, Commer requested that the court allow further discovery and require responses to certain requests he already had made before it ruled on this issue. The court did not rule on this request in its decision ordering dismissal. In light of the general principle that summary judgment ordinarily should not be awarded prior to discovery, <em>see, e.g., Hellstrom v. United States Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>201 F.3d 94, 97 (2d Cir.2000), and the court\u2019s failure to explain its reasons for not allowing Commer the discovery he requested, we will not reach the adequacy of Commer\u2019s proof to defeat a motion for summary judgment. We therefore simply vacate the dismissal of this claim, without prejudice to defendants\u2019 right to make a properly supported summary judgment motion after the completion of such discovery as the district court allows.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">We also vacate the grant of summary judgment on the Section 101 claim as it relates to defendants associated with Local 375. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of these defendants based on its finding that the last private employees had disaffiliated from Local 375 as of mid-December 1999 and therefore the local union defendants were not subject to the LMRDA with respect to actions taken in 2000. Commer had made discovery requests for any documentary materials evidencing the date of disaffiliation and, in response to defendants\u2019 motions, asked that defendants be required to furnish this evidence prior to the court\u2019s action on the summary judgment motion. The court did not rule on this request and Commer is entitled, at a minimum, to know whether any such documents exist and to receive copies if they do. We also note that Commer alleged certain acts by defendants associated with Local 375 in 1998 and 1999. <em>See </em>Compl. at 13-16. Although the district court may have found these allegations did not state a claim or were barred by one or more of Commer\u2019s prior lawsuits, the decision does not specifically address them. Therefore, even if the date of disaffiliation is clear and uncontroverted, the court should also determine whether Commer has any actionable claims for conduct prior to the disaffiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">On remand, the court may also wish to address the motion by certain of the defendants seeking dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(5).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
