This court held the district court erred by not imposing a two-level enhancement to the offense level for possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime. At resentencing, the district court added the two-level enhancement and sentenced Lloyd to the low end of the sentencing guideline range. Lloyd\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), claiming there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Lloyd was informed of his opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. The Government has not filed a brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-23\">Lloyd\u2019s term of imprisonment was within the proper sentencing guidelines range. In addition, it was less than the statutory maximum term of imprisonment. Accordingly, there is no error in Lloyd\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-24\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. We affirm the district court\u2019s amended judgment of conviction. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
