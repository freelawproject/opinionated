R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-18\">Appellant Deborah Norris appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of her counterclaims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, invasion of privacy, and abuse of process in a diversity suit brought by appellee Robert Charles Davis. Ms. Norris has also filed a motion to strike and for sanctions and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>motion for reconsideration of our order allowing Mr. Davis to file his response brief out of time. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we grant Ms. Norris\u2019s motions, reverse, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">I. Relevant facts and proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The litigation between the parties has a long and tortured history, beginning in 1987 when Ms. Norris alleged that Mr. Davis, who was her neighbor, sexually assaulted her on two different occasions in Salt Lake City, Utah. She brought a civil suit against him for assault in Utah state court in 1987. Mr. Davis claimed that their sexual encounters were consensual, and he filed a counterclaim for defamation of character, asserting that Ms. Norris had abused the justice system by pursuing a meritless lawsuit. The litigation was bitter, and Mr. Davis threatened to \u201cget\u201d Ms. Norris. Aplt.App. at 242. In 1988, Mr. Davis obtained an injunction in the state case prohibiting Ms. Norris from communicating information regarding the alleged sexual assault to the media pending the case\u2019s outcome. During discovery, Mr. Davis\u2019s attorneys obtained Ms. Norris\u2019s confidential psychiatric records. The state court ordered that they were to remain confidential and not to be disseminated beyond use by the experts in the Utah state case.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">In 1993, Mr. Davis was convicted of Medieare/Medicaid and insurance fraud in conjunction with his practice as a physician and was sentenced to federal prison. The parties apparently agreed to stay Ms. Norris\u2019s tort action until his release except for the taking of his deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">Mr. Davis had been the subject of news reports in Utah because of the fraud convictions and because three women besides Ms. Norris had sued him for sexual assault. Numerous articles were published about his alleged illegal activities between 1989 and 1994. In 1994, an article for which Ms. Norris was interviewed was published in a Salt Lake City, Utah, newspaper. In it, Ms. Norris discussed the fact that her suit for assault against Mr. Davis was pending and that she was aware of four other women who claimed he had sexually assaulted them.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">In June 1995, in federal district court in California, Mr. Davis sued Ms. Norris for libel and slander arising from the publication of this interview and for allegedly fraudulently conveying unspecified assets out of her name. Mr. Davis claimed that Ms. Norris sent a copy of the 1994 article to the federal prison where he was incarcerated and that he suffered loss of privileges and a transfer to a higher security prison as a result.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He had Ms. Norris served with process while she was attending a pretrial conference for the Utah state case in September 1995. One month later Mr. Davis filed a second federal suit in Arizona, asserting the same claims. He had this complaint served when Ms. Norris attended a pretrial hearing in the state case in October 1995. In November 1995, Ms. Norris moved for dismissal of the federal suits and for summary judgment, asserting lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction and improper venue. She also contended that Mr. Davis had already brought the same claims as counterclaims in the Utah state court case and that Mr. Davis failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. The California federal district court did not rule on the merits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the motion to dismiss, instead transferring the case to the federal district court in Utah in 1996. The Arizona case was dismissed in 1996 for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Ms. Norris moved from Utah in the 1990s and obtained unlisted phone numbers in what she alleges was an attempt to escape Mr. Davis\u2019s continuing harassment. While he was in prison, Mr. Davis used a federal subpoena issued without Ms. Norris\u2019s knowledge to obtain her private records from Delta Airlines going back fifteen years. He used a subpoena from the state court case without her knowledge to obtain private information from a former Florida landlord. He also acquired credit reports and social security records concerning Ms. Norris\u2019s location and employment history. In September 1995, Mr. Davis began calling and writing letters to various individuals, including Ms. Norris\u2019s ex-husband, her employers, landlords, attorneys, probation officer, attorneys representing other individuals in suits against Ms. Norris, the Internal Revenue Service, and the bankruptcy court in Knoxville, Tennessee. In these letters Mr. Davis alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Ms. Norris used false social security numbers to avoid tax liens and secure credit, committed fraud in the bankruptcy court, committed mail fraud, misrepresented her credentials for employment, committed crimes against various companies and individuals, had been married to her brother, and had violated her probation. He also sent copies of her twenty-year-old confidential psychiatric reports that had been sealed in the Utah state court proceeding to various individuals and attached them to his amended complaint in his California federal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">At her state trial on the 1987 assault claim in January 1997, Ms. Norris attempted to introduce into evidence the above-described letters written by Mr. Davis. The state court excluded the evidence as irrelevant to the alleged assault. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Mr. Davis on Ms. Norris\u2019s assault claims and in favor of Ms. Norris on Mr. Davis\u2019s counterclaims. On October 8, 1997, Mr. Davis moved to voluntarily dismiss his federal action in Utah.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">On October 10, 1997, Ms. Norris filed a counterclaim in Mr. Davis\u2019s federal suit in which she alleged intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, invasion of privacy, and abuse of process arising from Mr. Davis\u2019s letters and communications written in 1995-1996. Mr. Davis did not timely respond to the counterclaims and the court granted a default judgment in favor of Ms. Norris in November 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">Mr. Davis obtained counsel and moved to set aside the entry of default, claiming that he had not received service of the counterclaims. In a lengthy order entered August 25, 1998, the district court denied Mr. Davis\u2019s motion to voluntarily dismiss the suit and granted his motion to set aside the default judgment on Ms. Norris\u2019s counterclaims. The court also dismissed Mr. Davis\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim, concluding that (1) the amended complaint did \u201cnothing more than set forth a litany of allegations against the defendant that have no relevance to the case at hand\u201d; (2) his allegations were \u201cnowhere close to stating a cause of action\u201d for libel or slander; and (3) the complaint was deficient because it failed to state any cause of action with particularity under Rules 8 and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Aplt.App. at 270-71. Because Mr. Davis\u2019s claims that Ms. Norris lied about the alleged sexual assault had already been addressed in the Utah state court, the district court concluded that allowing him to amend his complaint a second time would not correct the defects of his complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 271-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>In December 1998, Ms. Norris moved to reinstate the default judgment on her counterclaims as a sanction for Mr. Davis\u2019s failure to comply with the court\u2019s order to submit to a deposition. Mr. Davis later filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaims, alleging that they were barred by the doctrine of res judicata and/or the statute of limitations. The court denied Ms. Norris\u2019s motion and granted Mr. Davis\u2019s, concluding that \u201c[t]he basis for the allegations in the counterclaim all arise out of the same transactions or series of events, that lead to the initial suit in state court between these parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258. The court also held that Utah law applied to the statute-of-limitations issue and concluded that the claim for defamation could not survive Utah\u2019s one-year limitations period. Ms. Norris appeals from both rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">A. Motion to strike appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">As a preliminary matter, we address Ms. Norris\u2019s motion to strike Mr. Davis\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal and her request for attorney fees and costs as a sanction. A review of the record shows that Ms. Norris filed her appellate brief on June 1, 2000, certifying that she mailed two copies of the brief to Mr. Davis on May 18, 2000. When this court had not received Mr. Davis\u2019s response brief by July 1, 2000, the clerk notified him on July 81, 2000, that no brief had been received and that he had ten days in which to file one. Mr. Davis did not timely file a response brief. Instead, on July 31, 2000, he filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. In the motion, Mr. Davis asserted that the appeal should be dismissed because he had filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Ms. Norris responded that she had never been included on a list of bankruptcy creditors as a party with claims against Mr. Davis or notice of the bankruptcy, but agreed that federal law required that the appeal be stayed pending termination of the bankruptcy proceedings. Accordingly, we abated the appeal on December 15, 2000, ordering the parties to submit status reports on the bankruptcy proceedings by February 15, 2001. Mr. Davis did not comply with this order. Ms. Norris submitted a timely report after discovering that the bankruptcy court had dismissed Mr. Davis\u2019s bankruptcy case on June 5, 2000, in response to his June 2, 2000 application for voluntary dismissal. The record shows that the bankruptcy court gave Mr. Davis written notice of that dismissal by mailing a notice to his home address on June 8, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Copies of Ms. Norris\u2019s February status report were sent to Mr. Davis at two addresses \u2014 his home address and a Mailboxes, Etc. facility where he purportedly received his business mail. Ms. Norris informed Mr. Davis in a cover letter attached to the status report that she would be filing a motion to strike the motion to dismiss and for sanctions the next week. After this court received the status report, the clerk\u2019s office entered an order on April 30, 2001, reactivating the appeal and informing Mr. Davis that his response brief was due May 30, 2001. That notice was sent to the Mailboxes, Etc. address.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">On May 4, 2001, Ms. Norris filed her motion to strike Mr. Davis\u2019s motion to dismiss, requesting this court disallow the filing of a response brief, to enter judgment in her favor on the appeal, and to award sanctions in the form of attorney fees and costs in the amount of $4,146.64 for having to respond to the motion. Ms. Norris\u2019s counsel submitted itemized bills and affidavits. Ms. Norris mailed a copy of the motion both to Mr. Davis\u2019s Mailboxes, Etc. address and to his home address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>on May 3, 2001. Mr. Davis did not respond to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Ms. Norris\u2019s motion is well-taken. The record clearly shows that Mr. Davis filed the motion to dismiss the appeal in this court after he knew that the bankruptcy court had already dismissed his bankruptcy case at his request. Mr. Davis therefore made material and fraudulent misrepresentations to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Mr. Davis attempts to excuse this misrepresentation by arguing that he signed the motion to dismiss on May 28, 2000, before his bankruptcy proceedings were dismissed. However, the motion to dismiss is clearly dated \u201cthis 23rd day of July, 2000\u201d above his signature and was filed in this court on July 31, 2000. Mr. Davis\u2019s motion to dismiss is stricken as frivolous, and sanctions in the amount of $4,146.64 are awarded to Ms. Norris. <em>See Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 767, 100 S.Ct. 2455, 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980) (noting court\u2019s inherent power to assess attorney fees as sanction against party who has conducted litigation in bad faith); <em>Christensen v. Ward, </em>916 F.2d 1462, 1469 (10th Cir.1990) (recognizing court of appeals\u2019 \u201cinherent power to impose sanctions that are necessary ... to deter frivolous filings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">B. Motion to strike response brief</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">On August 22, 2001, Mr. Davis filed a motion to file out of time his response brief to the original appeal. In his motion, he claimed that he had not received our April 30, 2001 order requiring that his brief be filed by May 30, 2001, until August 17, 2001. He attached an affidavit from one of his employees stating that on that date, Mailboxes, Etc. had placed a notice to pick up an oversized envelope in Mr. Davis\u2019s box. The affidavit states that the \u201cenvelope\u201d was in fact a stack of mail that had been \u201cmisplaced\u201d by Mailboxes, Etc. The affidavit states that Ms. Norris\u2019s \u201cappeal brief along with the Order ... filed April 30, 2001\u201d was in the stack.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">We note, however, that the notice states only that there was an envelope too large for the mailbox that Mr. Davis needed to pick up at the counter. The clerk\u2019s practice is to mail single or two-page orders in regular envelopes and not in oversized envelopes, and the clerk did not include Ms. Norris\u2019s brief, which was filed in June 2000 and separately mailed to him by Ms. Norris in May 2000, with that order. It is highly unlikely that (1) Mailboxes, Etc. would have held Ms. Norris\u2019s appeal brief for over a year before it gave him notice to pick it up; or (2) that our April 30, 2001 order was the \u201citem\u201d described in the August 17, 2001 Mailboxes, Etc. notice; or that (3) Mr. Davis would not inquire with this court whether filings of which he was unaware had been made, given Ms. Norris\u2019s notice to him that she had informed this court of the dismissal of the bankruptcy proceedings and that she was filing motions to strike and motions for sanctions. We further note that Mr. Davis never responded that he had not received Ms. Norris\u2019s appeal brief when this court first notified him in July 2000 that we had not received his response brief. We find it curious that Mr. Davis has so much difficulty receiving legal mail and observe that he has not rebutted the affidavit filed by his former employee stating that Mr. Davis regularly instructed his employees not to accept legal mail or service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">The panel that granted Mr. Davis\u2019s request to file his response brief out of time did not consider Ms. Norris\u2019s previously-filed motion to strike or her request that we disallow a response brief. We grant Ms. Norris\u2019s motion to reconsider our order allowing Mr. Davis to file the response brief out of time. We strike his response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>brief for failing to comply with our July 31, 2000 order to file a response brief within ten days, for failing to comply with our December 15, 2000 order to submit a status report on the bankruptcy proceedings by February 15, 2001, for failure to comply with our April 30, 2001 order instructing him to file a response brief by May 30, 2001, and as a sanction for having delayed the appeal proceedings for over a year by filing the fraudulent motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">We deny Ms. Norris\u2019s motion to file her reply brief out of time as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">C. Appeal of the order dismissing Ms. Norris\u2019s counterclaims</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">1. Res judicata. We next turn to the substantive issues in this case. The district court dismissed Ms. Norris\u2019s counterclaims by concluding that she could and should have brought all of her counterclaims in the 1987 Utah state court action. We review the court\u2019s application of <em>res judicata </em>de novo. <em>King v. Union Oil Co., </em>117 F.3d 443, 445 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">We look to Utah law to determine the preclusive effect to be given the judgment entered in the state civil-assault action. <em>See Marrese v. Am. Acad. of Orthopaedic Surgeons, </em>470 U.S. 373, 375, 105 S.Ct. 1327, 84 L.Ed.2d 274 (1985) (stating that a federal court of appeals must refer to state law to determine the preclusive effect of a prior state judgment between parties on the subsequent federal suit); <em>Fox v. Maulding, </em>112 F.3d 453, 456 (10th Cir. 1997) (same). Under Utah law,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">[cjlaim preclusion applicability ... requires that the claim, even though not decided in the prior action, could and should have been litigated, but was not raised by any of the parties. This \u201creflects the expectation that parties who are given the capacity to present their \u2018entire controversies\u2019 shall in fact do so.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24 comment a (1982).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-11\"><em>Ringwood v. Foreign Auto Works, Inc., </em>786 P.2d 1350, 1357 (Utah Ct.App.1990). Thus, it appears that Utah follows the transactional approach of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24. \u201cThe transactional test has been reartieulated by courts in a variety of ways, most of which focus upon whether the two suits are both based upon a discrete and unitary factual occurrence.\u201d <em>Yapp v. Excel Corp., </em>186 F.3d 1222, 1227 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">In <em>Schaer v. State ex rel. Utah Department of Transportation, </em>657 P.2d 1337 (Utah 1983), the Utah Supreme Court held that <em>res judicata </em>was not applicable to bar a subsequent suit between the same parties because it was based on a different claim than that of the previous litigation; the two causes of action rested on a different state of facts and occurred during completely different and separate time periods; and evidence of a different kind or character was necessary to sustain the two causes of action. <em>Id. </em>at 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">Ms. Norris argues that the district court improperly applied <em>res judicata </em>to dismiss her counterclaims because Mr. Davis\u2019s actions in making allegedly libelous and slanderous communications, invading her privacy, sending her confidential psychiatric records to individuals, abusing the federal judicial process by bringing frivolous and meritless suits against her for the sole purpose of harassment, and intentionally causing her emotional distress occurred in 1995-1996 and were not part of the alleged assault. We agree. Clearly, these subsequent tortious acts were not part of the alleged assault leading to Ms. Norris\u2019s civil suit in 1987. The events do not overlap in a single operative fact. Further, they are not related in time, space, origin, or motivation, as the events giving rise to Ms. Norris\u2019s counterclaims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>occurred at least seven years after Ms. Norris filed her state complaint. Because under Utah state law Ms. Norris\u2019s counterclaims would not be barred under the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>as applied in <em>Schaer, supra, </em>we hold that the court erred in dismissing those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">2. Statute of Limitations. Finally, we address Ms. Norris\u2019s argument that the district court erred in holding that Utah\u2019s one-year statute of limitations, rather than Florida\u2019s two-year statute of limitations, should apply to her defamation claims. We review the district court\u2019s choice of law determination de novo. <em>Rocky Mountain Helicopters, Inc. v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., </em>24 F.3d 125, 128 (10th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Below and on appeal, both parties assumed that Utah\u2019s choice of law rules would govern the determination of whether Utah or Florida law (or even the law of some other state) supplies the statute of limitation relevant to Ms. Norris\u2019s defamation claim. Ordinarily, the parties would have been quite correct in this assumption. <em>See Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., </em>313 U.S. 487, 496, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941) (\u201cThe conflict of laws rules to be applied by the federal court in [a particular State] must conform to those prevailing in [that State\u2019s] state courts.\u201d); <em>Rocky Mountain Helicopters, </em>24 F.3d at 128 (\u201cIn making choice of law determinations, a federal court sitting in diversity must apply the choice of law provisions of the forum state in which [the federal court] is sitting.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">In such a case, the choice of law determination would have been relatively straight-forward: \u201cUtah follows the majority position that limitation periods are generally procedural in nature. Therefore, as a general rule, Utah\u2019s statutes of limitation apply to actions brought in Utah.\u201d <em>Fin. Bancorp, Inc. v. Pingree &amp; Dahle, Inc., </em>880 P.2d 14, 16 (Utah Ct.App.1994) (internal citation omitted). Assuming that no particular exception applies, and we are unaware of one that would, Utah\u2019s choice of law rules dictate the use of Utah\u2019s one-year statute of limitations. This one-year statute of limitations would leave Ms. Norris\u2019s claim time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Here, however, the situation is somewhat more complex. This action was originally filed not in federal district court in Utah but in federal district court in California. In such a situation, we must look to the choice of law rules of that State in which the suit was originally filed (i.e., the choice of law rules of California), <em>unless </em>the federal court in which the suit was originally filed never enjoyed personal jurisdiction over the defendant. <em>See Van Dusen v. Barrack, </em>376 U.S. 612, 635-39, 84 S.Ct. 805, 11 L.Ed.2d 945 (1964) (\u201cWe conclude ... [that] the transferee district court must be obligated to apply the state law that would have been applied if there had been no change of venue.\u201d); <em>Trierweiler v. Croxton &amp; Trench Holding Corp., </em>90 F.3d 1523, 1532 (10th Cir.1996) (creating the lack of personal jurisdiction exception). Here, then, because Mr. Davis originally filed this suit in California, the parties should have been examining California choice of law rules, unless the federal district court in California never maintained personal jurisdiction over Ms. Norris.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">If the California federal district court indeed lacked personal jurisdiction over Ms. Norris, then the Utah federal district court was correct to look to Utah\u2019s choice of law provisions, choose Utah\u2019s one-year statute of limitations, and dismiss Ms. Norris\u2019s defamation claim. If, however, the California federal district court did maintain personal jurisdiction over Ms. Norris, then the Utah federal district court should have examined California\u2019s choice of law provisions for selection of the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>cable statute of limitation. Since determination of whether the California federal district court exercised proper personal jurisdiction over Ms. Norris appears to remain an open question, and one which will likely require certain factual findings, we remand to the Utah federal district court for a determination on that issue and thus also for a determination of the statute of limitations issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Utah is REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b699-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\">. Ms. Norris requested the district court take judicial notice of Mr. Davis\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit against the prison warden brought in 1994, in which he alleged that these disciplinary actions were due to retaliation by prison officials for his attempts to obtain medical treatment and because he protested restrictions upon his use of the telephones in prison.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\">.
