He was sentenced to life imprisonment on the conspiracy count and ten years imprisonment on the possession count, to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">In No. 01-4621, McKelvey contends that the Government presented insufficient evidence to prove he was involved in a conspiracy rather than a simple \u201cbuyer-seller\u201d relationship, and failed to prove he possessed five grams or more of cocaine base on March 22, 2000. Based on our review of the joint appendix, these claims are meritless. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Mills, </em>995 F.2d 480, 484-85 (4th Cir.1993) (discussing distinction between conspiracy and buyer-seller relationship); 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">In No. 01-4701, McKelvey filed a notice of appeal addressing the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). His counseled brief abandons this appeal as without merit. Moreover, Rule 59(e) does not apply to criminal proceedings. We therefore dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">We affirm Washington\u2019s convictions and sentences. We dismiss McKelvey\u2019s appeal of the motion for reconsideration. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">No. <em>01-4621 </em>\u2014 AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"Azt\">No. <em>01-4701 </em>\u2014 DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
