He appeals his conviction and sentence. Theirse\u2019s attorney has filed a brief citing <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), contending the district court failed to comply with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 and improperly sentenced Theirse, but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Theirse has filed a pro se supplemental brief contending his indictment was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-23\">Because Theirse neither sought to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court nor raised any issues concerning his sentence, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 529 (4th Cir.2002). Our review of Theirse\u2019s plea hearing convinces us that the district court fully complied with Rule 11 and did not commit plain error. We also find the district court properly imposed a sentence of 114 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-24\">We have reviewed the claim raised in Theirse\u2019s pro se supplemental brief regarding his indictment and find it merit-less. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Theirse\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
