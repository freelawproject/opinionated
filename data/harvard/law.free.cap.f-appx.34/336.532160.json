INS, </em>208 F.3d 725 (9th Cir.2000), and <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967 (9th Cir. 2000). First, at the calendar hearing during which the IJ was to inform Segovia that she had the option of being represented by counsel, the IJ did not make clear to her the role of counsel or how the hearing would proceed if she chose to represent herself. Instead he suggested that she had to choose between being represented by an attorney, and speaking on her own behalf as a witness. <em>See Jacinto, </em>208 F.3d at 734. Second, at the merits hearing, the IJ interrupted Segovia\u2019s examination of her witness several times to require that she put her questions in another form when they were already appropriate to elicit the required information. This improper interference resulted in Segovia\u2019s being unable to elicit the necessary testimony from her witness or to present it herself. <em>See id. </em>Third, the IJ failed to explain at any point to Segovia the standard upon which her asylum application would be judged. Therefore he did not provide her with a meaningful opportunity to present evidence on her behalf. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>Colmenar, </em>210 F.3d at 972; <em>Jacinto, </em>208 F.3d at 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">We also conclude that, because the IJ\u2019s conduct \u201cpotentially ... affect[ed] the outcome of the proceedings,\u201d Segovia was prejudiced by the denial of a full and fair hearing, and deprived of due process of law. <em>Campos-Sanchez v. INS, </em>164 F.3d 448, 450 (9th Cir.1999) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The conduct of the hearing did not afford her a fair opportunity to adduce the information necessary to establish that she was persecuted. The due process errors also underlay the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Accordingly, Segovia is entitled to a new hearing before an IJ.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Jacinto, </em>208 F.3d at 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">We reverse the BIA\u2019s decision, and remand to the BIA with instructions to remand for a new hearing before an IJ on Segovia\u2019s asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-12\">. We are unable to review the merits of Segovia\u2019s other claims because the IJ\u2019s conduct of the hearing prevented the full development of the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
