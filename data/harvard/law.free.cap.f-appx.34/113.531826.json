Mandamus is a drastic remedy only to be used in extraordinary circumstances. <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). Mandamus relief is available only when the petitioner has a clear right to the relief sought and there are no other means for obtaining the requested relief. <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 83, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980); <em>Beard, </em>811 F.2d at 826. Arawole has failed to make the requisite showing for such extraordinary relief. Our review of the district court docket sheet discloses that there has been no undue delay in considering Arawole\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion by the district court. Accordingly, we deny his mandamus petition without prejudice to Arawole\u2019s right to file another mandamus petition if the district court does not act expeditiously. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
