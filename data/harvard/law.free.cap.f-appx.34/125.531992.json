We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>Nos. CR-95-370; CA-02-152 (D.S.C. Jan. 16, 2002) . We also note that the Thomas\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion is successive and, thus, is unaffected by this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Hill v. Braxton, </em>277 F.3d 701 (4th Cir. 2002).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b173-18\"> A panel of this court recently heard argument in <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>No. 00-7578, on the issue of whether a district court must notify a pro se litigant that it intends to construe a filing that is not so labeled as a \u00a7 2255 motion and afford the movant the opportunity to withdraw the motion in order to avoid the restrictions on second or successive motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>under \u00a7 2255. This case will not be controlled by the decision in <em>Emmanuel, </em>however, because Thomas has previously filed a first \u00a7 2255 motion and, therefore was not prejudiced by the district court\u2019s failure to provide him notice and an opportunity to withdraw prior to construing his motion as one filed under \u00a7 2255. Thomas\u2019 recourse is a motion in this court under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2244 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2001), for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
