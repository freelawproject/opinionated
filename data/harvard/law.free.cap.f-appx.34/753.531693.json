On September 27, 2000, Hill-Rom, Inc., and Hill-Rom Services, Inc., (\u201cHill-Rom\u201d) brought suit against Ohmeda Medical and Datex-Ohmeda, Inc., (\u201cOhmeda\u201d) alleging infringement of claim 17 of Hill-Rom\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 5,453,077 (\u201cthe \u2019077 patent\u201d). On May 29, 2001, the district court granted a preliminary injunction, finding that Hill-Rom had established a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of its infringement claim and that Ohmeda had not presented a substantial question of invalidity of claim 17. Ohmeda appealed, arguing that under a proper claim construction, Ohmeda\u2019s accused device did not infringe. We affirmed in a nonprecedential opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">Prior to the issuance of that opinion, Ohmeda filed a motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction based on new evidence supporting Ohmeda\u2019s theory that a prior art incubator, the Isolette, anticipated claim 17. The district court denied Ohmeda\u2019s motion, finding that the Isolette lacked two limitations of claim 17: an \u201cair curtain\u201d and \u201ca canopy mounted over said support and adapted to be raised and lowered relative to said support.\u201d In a supplemental order, the district court amended the grounds for its denial of the motion to dissolve the injunction, basing the denial solely on the purported absence of the \u201ccanopy\u201d limitation and leaving open the question whether the Isolette included an \u201cair curtain\u201d or not. Ohmeda appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">The district court found that the Isolette canopy is not \u201cmounted over\u201d the support and is not \u201cadapted to be raised and lowered relative to said support,\u201d as recited in claim 17. The court based that finding on the fact that the Isolette canopy is connected to the support by a hinge, and that the canopy opens by swinging up above the support on the hinge. The court stated that being \u201cmounted over the support ... is different than being affixed to the support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">Based on the record before us, we conclude that the canopy limitation is not a sufficient basis for granting preliminary injunctive relief. When the canopy of the Isolette is closed, it is situated on and above the support. As such, the canopy of the Isolette would .appear to be \u201cmounted over\u201d the support. Nothing in the record to which we have been directed suggests that claim 17 includes a requirement that the canopy be detachable from the support.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">The district court based its finding that the Isolette canopy was not \u201craised or lowered relative to said support\u201d on the fact that the canopy did not \u201cascend\u201d above the support because it is connected by the hinge to one side of the support both when it is opened and when it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>closed. Nothing in the record before us suggests that the canopy is not \u201craised and lowered\u201d when it is rotated upward and downward about a pivot point that is attached to the support. It would appear that the canopy of the Isolette is capable of being raised and lowered relative to the support in much the same way an automobile hood is raised and lowered relative to the body of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">We therefore conclude that the district court erred in premising its refusal to dissolve the preliminary injunction on the operation of the Isolette canopy. Accordingly, we <em>vacate </em>the district court\u2019s order denying the motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction and <em>remand </em>for further proceedings. On remand, the district court should resolve the question whether Ohmeda has raised a substantial question of invalidity based on Ohmeda\u2019s assertion that the Isolette\u2019s contains an \u201cair curtain\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in claim 17. <em>See Amazon.com, Inc. v. Barnesandnoble.com, Inc., </em>239 F.3d 1343, 1358 (Fed.Cir.2001).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
