Kerby pleaded guilty to armed bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d), and to using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to the bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). At sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposed an obstruction-of-justice increase and, over Mr. Kerby\u2019s objection, denied him an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. The court sentenced him to 151 months imprisonment for the robbery, a consecutive term of 84 months imprisonment for the gun conviction, and concurrent supervised release terms (5 and 3 years respectively). The court also ordered Kerby to pay $46,012.50 in restitution. On appeal, counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the denial of the section 3E1.1 reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The district court did not clearly err. <em>See United States v. Ervasti, </em>201 F.3d 1029, 1043 (8th Cir.2000). Two -witnesses testified that Mr. Kerby threatened to harm, or solicited others to harm, a codefendant who had cooperated with the government. Further, Mr. Kerby stipulated that he had obstructed justice during the investigation of his case by destroying evidence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.4) (conduct supporting obstruction enhancement ordinarily indicates defendant should not receive \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction); <em>United States v. Honken, </em>184 F.3d 961, 967-69 (8th Cir.) (district court should consider totality of circumstances), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1056, 120 S.Ct. 602, 145 L.Ed.2d 500 (1999). Mr. Kerby carried the burden of establishing his entitlement to the reduction, <em>see Honken, </em>184 F.3d at 968, and \u201cthe determination of the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review,\u201d because \u201c[t]he sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility,\u201d <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Having reviewed the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\">. The Honorable Donald E. O\u2019Brien, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
