Green appeals his sentence, alleging that the district court erred in sentencing him as an armed career criminal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-20\">Section 924(e)(1) provides that a defendant convicted of a weapons offense under \u00a7 922(g) shall receive a minimum fifteen-year sentence if he \u201chas three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d A \u201cviolent felony\u201d is defined as an offense that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d or otherwise \u201cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). To determine whether a prior felony is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d when the offense is not one of those enumerated in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and does not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force, the sentencing court must use a categorical approach. That is, the court may consider only the fact and statutory definition of the prior offense, not the underlying facts, to decide whether the offense, by its nature, creates a serious risk of injury to another. <em>United States v. Hairston, </em>71 F.3d 115, 117 (4th Cir.1995). Green had prior felony convictions for breaking and entering, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and fleeing/eluding arrest with a motor vehicle, all of which occurred on separate occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-21\">We find first that the armed career criminal sentence did not violate the rule set out in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (holding that, except for the fact of a prior conviction, \u201cany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). <em>See United States v. Sterling, </em>283 F.3d 216 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-22\">Green also contends that the district court failed to use the required categorical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>approach in determining that his conviction for fleeing/eluding arrest with a motor vehicle was a violent felony because it did not take judicial notice of the statutory definition of the offense. We disagree. Because the offense is not one of those enumerated in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and does not have the use of force as an element,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the district court correctly proceeded under the \u201cotherwise\u201d clause of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). The court determined that the offense in the abstract creates a serious potential risk of injury to others. Green contends that the court erred in that it did not hear evidence concerning the statutory definition or take judicial notice of the statutory definition. While such evidence no doubt could be needed with respect to some offenses, in this case we find no error in the district court\u2019s method of determining that fleeing/eluding police with a motor vehicle presents a serious risk of injury to another. The risk is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">We therefore affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b977-8\"> Section 20-141.5(a) of N.C. Gen.Stat.
