Gross timely appeals from a judgment of conviction entered by the United States District Court for the Western District of New York on October 18, 2001. Gross argues that the District Court abused its discretion in upwardly departing during sentencing pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 4A1.3 from criminal history category IV to criminal history category V, and sentencing the defendant principally to a 50 month term of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, the District Court may depart from the otherwise applicable guideline range where the range \u201cdoes not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d During the sentencing hearing, the Court noted several facts which indicated that the guideline range did not reflect the seriousness of Gross\u2019 prior criminal conduct or his likelihood of committing future crimes, including the following: a guilty plea to one robbery charge in satisfaction for additional other charges for robbery and attempted robbery; a history of violence toward women; and at least four parole violations, several of which included criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that an upward departure was appropriate. See <em>United States v. Khalil, </em>214 F.3d 111, 124-26 (2d Cir.2000). Accordingly, we affirm for substantially the reasons stated by Judge Larimer in the October 12, 2001 sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"Aui\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
