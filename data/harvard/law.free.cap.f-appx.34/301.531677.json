SEC, </em>463 U.S. 646, 103 S.Ct. 3255, 77 L.Ed.2d 911 (1983). Randall\u2019s complaint alleged that Paul Levy, Rational\u2019s CEO, \u201ctipped\u201d material negative nonpublic information to Dain Rauscher Wessels (Wessels), a professional market analyst. Wessels then passed this information to its clients, who sold Rational stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-15\">Randall\u2019s complaint did not allege facts which showed any special relationship between Levy and Wessels. The complaint also did not allege facts showing that Levy received a personal benefit from tipping Wessels or that Wessels knew or should have known that Levy\u2019s disclosure was in breach of his fiduciary duty. Thus, the district court properly dismissed Randall\u2019s second amended complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-16\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
