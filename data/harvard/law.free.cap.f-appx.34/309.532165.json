The facts and prior proceedings are known to the parties; they are not cited herein, except as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-19\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in restricting Diaz\u2019s cross-exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ination of the County\u2019s witnesses about the contents of Exhibit 23. The exhibit covered the disciplinary records of 21 nurses and reports of those nurses\u2019 36 medication errors, and unlike Diaz, the vast majority of those nurses appear to have committed no misconduct (such as failure to report) beyond the medication errors themselves. Thus, these records were only marginally useful for purposes of establishing disparate treatment, and the district court reasonably concluded that allowing Diaz\u2019s counsel to explore all of the medication errors that the exhibit detailed would be more time-consuming than the prospective probative value could justify. Diaz was allowed to explore the County\u2019s treatment of two white nurses who committed multiple errors. Moreover, the exhibit itself was admitted into evidence and available to the jury, and other witnesses summarized its contents. The limitations on cross-examination do not justify reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in excluding the proffered Exhibit 36(B). The document was not self-authenticating, as it bore no indicia of origin or filing, such as an official letterhead, seal, or signature, and Diaz presented no certification from the custodian of records. Fed.R.Evid. 902(1), (4), (11). Diaz sought to authenticate the exhibit with Miles\u2019s testimony that she had obtained it from Vasquez. However, Vasquez was not the document\u2019s purported author or even a named addressee, although it did refer to her. Miles\u2019s ability to testify that she received the document from Vasquez does not make her a \u201cwitness with knowledge\u201d of its authenticity. Fed.R.Evid. 901(b)(1); <em>see United States v. Dibble, </em>429 F.2d 598, 602 (9th Cir.1970). Because Diaz submitted no evidence (other than the document itself) from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the document was authentic, the district court did not err in excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in rejecting Diaz\u2019s attempts to refer to the contents of Exhibit 36(B), ostensibly for impeachment purposes, in her redirect examination of Miles and her cross-examination of Nusbaum. (Diaz also argues that she should have been allowed to cross-examine Malkin about the allegations in the report, but she made no attempt to do so at trial.) Whatever relation the document bore to Miles\u2019s testimony, which touched only tangentially on Miles\u2019s role in the Vasquez complaint, it did not serve to impeach Miles. \u201cImpeachment is improper when employed as a guise to present substantive evidence to the jury that would be otherwise inadmissible.\u201d <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>57 F.3d 709, 711 (9th Cir.1995) (per curiam). Similarly, Diaz fails to identify any portion of Nusbaum\u2019s testimony that the document would have served to impeach; Nusbaum testified that she was aware of complaints by minority employees, and Diaz does not explain how the report\u2019s documentation of complaints about Nusbaum\u2019s management skills would have impeached Nusbaum\u2019s testimony. The district court\u2019s refusal to allow this line of questioning was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">We reach a similar conclusion with respect to the district court\u2019s refusal to allow Maldonado\u2019s testimony. \u201cTrial courts have broad authority to impose reasonable time limits.\u201d <em>Navellier v. Sletten, </em>262 F.3d 923, 941 (9th Cir.2001). When Diaz sought to call Maldonado, she was already near the end of her allotted time and she herself still faced cross-examination by the County. At that point the district court could reasonably have concluded that Maldonado\u2019s testimony would be sufficiently cumulative to warrant her exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The decision to bar Pierce from testifying also does not warrant reversal. Were the relevance rationale that the district court mentioned in its ruling the <em>only </em>reason to exclude her testimony, the question would be closer; although Pierce is not Hispanic, her testimony about the discipline she received could have been relevant to establishing a basis for comparison and supporting the inference of pretext. However, the court would also have been justified in precluding Pierce\u2019s testimony based on the County\u2019s lack of opportunity to depose her before trial. In any event, we conclude that the exclusion most likely did not affect the verdict: Pierce\u2019s offense, the discipline she received, and her ethnicity all came out in cross-examination of other witnesses, and Diaz was able to use Curtis as a comparator to support her assertions of disparate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b350-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
