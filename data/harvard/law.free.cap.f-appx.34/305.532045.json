He contends that the BIA erred by: (1) finding him ineligible for relief pursuant to \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c); and (2) failing administratively to close his deportation proceedings to allow him to apply for cancellation of removal under INA \u00a7 240A(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a). We deny the petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">Gonzalez concedes that he committed the deportable offense of entry without inspection in violation of \u00a7 241(a)(1)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(1)(B). Because this ground for deportation has no counterpart in the exclusion statute, <em>see Gutierrez v. INS, </em>745 F.2d 548, 550 (9th Cir.1984), he is ineligible for a waiver of deportation under INA \u00a7 212(c). <em>See Komarenko v. INS, </em>35 F.3d 432 (9th Cir. 1994) (finding an alien ineligible for INA \u00a7 212(c) relief for committing a firearms offense with no comparable exclusion provision); <em>Cabasug v. INS, </em>847 F.2d 1321 (9th Cir.1988) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">This denial of eligibility for INA \u00a7 212(c) relief did not violate Gonzalez\u2019s right to equal protection of the law under the Fifth Amendment. \u201cThe fundamental query in an equal protection claim that does not involve a suspect class is whether \u2018[a] classification [is] reasonable, not arbitrary, and [rests] upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.\u2019 \u201d <em>Komarenko, </em>35 F.3d at 435 n. 1 (quoting <em>Stanton v. Stanton, </em>421 U.S. 7, 14, 95 S.Ct. 1373, 43 L.Ed.2d 688 (1975) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>While we have extended INA \u00a7 212(c) relief to the deportation context where the \u201c \u2018basis upon which the INS seeks deportation <em>is identical to a statutory ground for exclusion </em>for which discretionary relief would be available\u2019 \u201d because the denial of relief solely on the basis of whether an alien had departed the country is arbitrary and irrational, <em>id. </em>at 434-35 (quoting <em>Gutierrez, 745 </em>F.2d at 550 (emphasis added)); <em>see also Cabasug, </em>847 F.2d at 1325-27, the same reasoning does not extend to the case at bench where the deportation ground at issue is not analogous to any ground in the exclusion statute. Here, the exclusion provisions and the deportation provision for aliens convicted of entry without inspection are \u201centirely dissimilar,\u201d so that the distinction being made between the two classes as to eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief is not arbitrary or unreasonable. <em>See Komarenko, </em>35 F.3d at 435 (\u201cWe cannot say that is absurd that for purposes of discretionary deportation review Congress chooses to treat different crimes differently.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Moreover, the denial of INA \u00a7 212(c) relief to aliens who have entered the United States without inspection is rationally related to the legitimate government interest in deterring illegal entry. The inspection process is essential to the ability of the INS to prevent the unmonitored and illegal entry of aliens into the United States and to keep track of aliens after their entry. The entry of aliens without inspection undermines enforcement efforts which are critical to the integrity of the immigration system. Thus, because deportation based on entry without inspection serves a legitimate governmental interest, we hold that the BIA did not err in concluding that Gonzalez was ineligible for INA \u00a7 212(c) <em>relief.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Gonzalez also contends that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) and the BIA erred by failing to \u201crepaper\u201d his case by administratively closing his deportation proceedings to allow him to apply for cancellation of removal under the new statutory provisions of INA \u00a7 240A(a). He argues that the INS\u2019 proposed regulations, which offer eligibility for repapering to those who would have qualified for \u00a7 212(c) relief \u201cbut for\u201d the passage of \u00a7 440(d) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAED-PA\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> violate his equal protection rights by giving those who commit \u00a7 440(d) crimes access to repapering where he is denied the option. Generally, when a petitioner fails to raise his claim below, as Gonzalez failed to raise this claim before the BIA, he has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and this court lacks jurisdiction to resolve the issue; however, where, as here, the petitioner challenges the constitutionality of the INA or the procedures of the INS, the exhaustion requirement does not apply. See <em>Farhoud v. INS, </em>122 F.3d 794, 796 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">According to the INS provisions, Gonzalez is ineligible for repapering not because he did not commit one of the criminal offenses that had been excluded from relief by AEDPA \u00a7 440(d), but because he committed a deportable offense that has no counterpart in the exclusion statute and makes him ineligible for INA \u00a7 212(c) relief. Because we have already concluded that this denial of INA \u00a7 212(c) relief does not violate equal protection, this claim must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-12\">. Because deportation proceedings were commenced against Gonzalez prior to April 1, 1997, and the final order of deportation was entered after October 30, 1996, we have jurisdiction over his petition pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a, as amended by \u00a7 309(c)(4) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. <em>Chand v.
