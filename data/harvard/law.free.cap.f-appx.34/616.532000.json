R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-21\">Petitioner Charles Winford Wooten seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to pursue his appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Determining that Mr. Wooten has not met the statutory requirements, we deny his application and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-22\">To be entitled to a COA, Mr. Wooten must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). He can make this showing by establishing that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-23\">We may grant habeas relief only if the state court entered a judgment that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQi\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In 1990, Mr. Wooten was found guilty by a jury of first degree rape and sentenced to fifty years in prison. His conviction was affirmed by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals. Mr. Wooten then commenced this \u00a7 2254 petition in which he raised twenty-one issues. He later withdrew ten of the issues as his state court petition for post-conviction relief concerning those issues was still pending. Mr. Wooten notified the district court that he wished to proceed only with the issues he had exhausted, and that he planned to file a second petition after exhausting those ten issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Thus, the district court considered the following eleven claims: (1) There was insufficient evidence to support his conviction as the examining physician\u2019s (Dr. Kendrick) testimony was insufficient corroboration of the victim\u2019s testimony; (2) the trial court failed to give an instruction on attempted rape; (3) Dr. Kendrick and Brenda Burris (the social worker who interviewed the victim) were improperly allowed to offer their opinions as to the victim\u2019s truthfulness; (4) Ms. Burris presented hearsay evidence; (5) evidence of other crimes Mr. Wooten had committed against the victim was improperly admitted; (6) the state should have been directed to prosecute the rape as occurring on an exact date rather than during a more generalized, though specified, period of time; (7) the trial court should have granted a mistrial due to an improper statement by Dr. Kendrick; (8) an unqualified juror was allowed to remain on the jury; (9) Ms. Burris should not have been allowed to testify as an expert that the victim was an abused child; (10) Mr. Wooten should have been allowed to cross-examine both Dr. Kendrick and the victim\u2019s half sister; and (11) Mr. Wooten should have been allowed to impeach the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">The district court, after consideration of Mr. Wooten\u2019s objections, adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s well-reasoned and in-depth discussion of the issues and denied relief. On appeal, Mr. Wooten argues specifically that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction as the victim\u2019s testimony was not corroborated and was inconsistent. He also argues that he was denied a fair trial because the state should have been directed to elect a particular date on which the rape occurred. He also seeks review of his remaining issues, although he did not argue these issues specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">Upon review of the record, the brief submitted to this court, and the applicable law, we conclude that Mr. Wooten has failed to meet the standards established in \u00a7 2254(d). Reasonable jurists could not debate whether his \u201cpetition should have been resolved in a different manner\u201d or whether \u201cthe issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">We DENY Mr. Wooten\u2019s application for a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b656-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
