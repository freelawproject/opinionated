See 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 91.119(a),(b) (2001); 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 91.13 (2001). We have jurisdiction under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110(a) (1994). The parties are familiar with the facts and procedural posture underlying this matter; therefore, because we write solely for the benefit of the parties we will proceed directly to High Exposure\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-21\">High Exposure asserts that the ALJ\u2019s findings were not supported by substantial evidence. We disagree. While alleging that the ALJ committed numerous errors, at bottom petitioner argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that it operated the aircraft in question below the permissible flight ceiling. In reviewing an appeal from an administrative body, we are bound by the agencies factual findings if supported by substantial evidence. See <em>Air East, Inc., v. NTSB, </em>512 F.2d 1227, 1233 (3d Cir.1975). We have throughly reviewed the record in this case and conclude that the record contains ample evidence that the plane was operated by petitioner, and that the plane flew below the permissible ceiling on the day in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-22\">For example, in regard to establishing that the plane was in fact operated by petitioner, the ALJ relied on the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>of two FAA inspectors who witnessed the plane on the day in question, as well as the testimony of the president of the High Exposure, who admitted that his company\u2019s plane was towing a banner in the vicinity on the day in question. Further, there was testimony from the advertising agency to the effect that it contracted with High Exposure to tow the banner, which the FAA inspectors observed on the day in question. With regard to the ALJ\u2019s finding that petitioner\u2019s plane flew below the permissible ceiling, there was testimony as to the altitude of High Exposure\u2019s plane from another pilot who passed the petitioner\u2019s plane. Based on the foregoing, we cannot say that the ALJ\u2019s findings were not based on substantial evidence. As a result, we will affirm the FAA\u2019s Order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
