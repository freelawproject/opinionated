The district court granted a certificate of appealability as to whether Dailey received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>see Hasan v. Galaza, </em>254 F.3d 1150, 1153 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-26\">Dailey raises three claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. Habeas relief may not be granted however, unless the state court\u2019s adjudication of these claims \u201cinvolved an unreasonable ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>plication of <em>[Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) ],\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. 2254(d); <em>Weighall v. Middle, </em>215 F.3d 1058, 1060 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that the relevant \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d referred to in section 2254(d) is <em>Strickland </em>when the petitioner\u2019s claim is ineffective assistance of counsel). To prevail, under <em>Strickland, </em>Dailey must show that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and it prejudiced the defense. <em>See Weighall, </em>215 F.3d at 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Dailey argues that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient because he: (1) improperly argued against Dailey\u2019s standing to challenge a search warrant used to seize evidence which lead to Dailey\u2019s arrest and conviction; (2) failed to object at trial to prejudicial evidence of other bad acts; and (3) failed to properly prepare for the defense of Dailey\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The state court found that: (1) the search warrant would have been upheld regardless of counsel\u2019s arguments, <em>see State v. Madden, </em>125 Ariz. 346, 609 P.2d 1046 (Ariz.Ct.App.1980); <em>State v. Buccini, </em>167 Ariz. 550, 810 P.2d 178 (Ariz.Ct.App. 1991); <em>State v. Lavers, </em>168 Ariz. 376, 814 P.2d 333 (Ariz.Ct.App.1991); (2) the evidence of other bad acts would have been admitted under Arizona Rules of Evidence 404(b)(1), <em>see State v. Robinson, </em>165 Ariz. 51, 796 P.2d 853 (Ariz.Ct.App.1990); and (3) Dailey failed to present any evidence that his counsel was inadequately prepared for trial. Based on these findings, the state court concluded that Dailey could not demonstrate prejudice as a result of counsel\u2019s alleged errors and denied relief. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (stating prejudice is established when a defendant shows there is \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of his proceedings would have been different.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Because the state court\u2019s decision was consistent with <em>Strickland </em>and reasonable in light of the evidence presented, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Dailey\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Weighall, </em>215 F.3d at 1062 (\u201c... for a state court\u2019s application of federal law to be unreasonable, it must have been clearly erroneous.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b287-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.

Because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 limits the scope of our review to issues specified in the COA, we decline to address the additional issues in Dailey\u2019s brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
