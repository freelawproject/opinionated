R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-24\">Petitioner seeks review of a final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming an order of deportation. Deportation proceedings were initiated in February of 1996, and the BIA order was entered May 12, 1999. While this appeal was pending, petitioner applied to this court for a stay of deportation, which was denied. Because petitioner has been deported, we lack jurisdiction to review the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-25\">The Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) \u201caltered the availability, scope, and nature of judicial review in INS cases.\u201d <em>Rivera-Jimenez v. INS, </em>214 F.3d 1213, 1215 n. 1 (10th Cir.2000). Here, because petitioner\u2019s deportation proceedings commenced before April 1, 1997, the permanent \u201cnew rules\u201d of IIRIRA do not apply. Although the new rules do not apply, because the BIA order was filed more than thirty days after IIRIRA\u2019s enactment date (September 30, 1996), the transitional rules apply. <em>Id.See also Berehe v. INS, </em>114 F.3d 159, 161 (10th Cir.1997). The transitional rules dictate that the provisions of the former statute providing for judicial review, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a, govern our jurisdiction. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4), <em>reprinted as amended in </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 note; <em>see also Woldemeskel v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1185, 1187, n. 1 (10th Cir.2001) (\u201cUnder the transition rules, \u00a7 1105a remains in effect but for minor procedural amendments.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c), \u201c[a]n order of deportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien ... has departed from the United States after the issuance of the order.\u201d Both the former provisions and the transitional rules required a petitioner to request a stay in order to preserve judicial review. <em>Tapia Garcia v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1216, 1217 (10th Cir.2001). <em>See also Moore v. Ashcroft, </em>251 F.3d 919, 922 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cUnder the former provisions of the INA as well as the transitional rules, judicial review was statutorily barred for aliens who had been deported from the United States or who voluntarily departed pending review of the removal order.\u201d) (citing <em>Tapia Garcia, </em>237 F.3d at 1217). Not only must petitioner request a stay of the deportation order, a stay must be obtained in order to preserve judicial review. <em>See Saadi v. INS, </em>912 F.2d 428 (10th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"AJL\">The Supreme Court has held that \u201c[o]nce an alien has been deported, the courts lack jurisdiction to review the deportation order\u2019s validity.\u201d <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 399, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). This court has also noted that the jurisdictional bar of \u00a7 1105a(c) is absolute. <em>See Saadi, </em>912 F.2d at 428 (stating that the language of \u00a7 1105a(c) is unequivocal: \u201conce petitioner departed the United States via deportation, a deportation order may not be reviewed by any court\u201d) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition for review is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b706-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
