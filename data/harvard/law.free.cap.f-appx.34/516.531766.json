We review de novo the district court\u2019s judgment that Cravens had \u201cprocedurally defaulted\u201d his claims, and that he failed to demonstrate \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d for the default. See <em>Washington v. Cambra, </em>208 F.3d 832, 833 (9th Cir.2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-23\">On this appeal, we consider only whether Cravens procedurally defaulted on his claims that the government violated his right to due process by mishandling and withholding exculpatory evidence at trial. As a preliminary matter, we note that Cravens\u2019s state habeas petition and Opening Brief to the Nevada Supreme Court put that court on notice of the federal claims now before this panel. Cravens, thus, exhausted his state remedies with respect to these claims and we may properly consider his petition. <em>See Picard v. Connor, </em>404 U.S. 270, 276, 92 S.Ct. 509, 30 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971) (requiring \u201cstate prisoner to present the state courts with the same claim he urges upon the federal courts\u201d); <em>Shumway v. Payne, </em>223 F.3d 982, 987 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-24\">Though Cravens\u2019s claims are properly before us, we cannot review them because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>they are proeedurally barred under Nevada law. The independent and adequate state ground doctrine \u201capplies to bar federal habeas when a state court declined to address a prisoner\u2019s federal claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 729-80, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991); <em>Zichko v. Idaho, </em>247 F.3d 1015, 1021 (9th Cir.2001). The Nevada Supreme Court dismissed Cravens\u2019s state habeas petition because he had run afoul of Nevada\u2019s procedural requirement by not bringing his claims earlier on direct appeal. <em>See </em>N.R.S. 34.810(1)(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Section 34.810(b)(l)(2) constitutes an \u201cindependent\u201d ground for the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s decision because the rule is not \u201cinterwoven\u201d with federal law \u2014 that is, the court did not rely on \u201cany aspect of federal procedural or substantive law\u201d in denying Cravens\u2019s federal claims. <em>Zichko, </em>247 F.3d at 1021. In addition, N.R.S. 34.810(b)(1)(2) provided an \u201cadequate\u201d ground for the state court decision because the rule was \u201cclear, consistently applied, and well-established at the time of petitioner\u2019s purported default.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Petrocelli v. Angelone, 248 F.3d </em>877, 886 (9th Cir.2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Our decision in <em>McKenna v. McDaniel, </em>65 F.3d 1483 (9th Cir.1995), does not compel a contrary conclusion. In <em>McKenna, </em>we considered a substantially similar procedural bar, N.R.S. 177.375 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and held that the Nevada courts did not apply that bar consistently. <em>See McKenna, 65 </em>F.3d at 1488-89; <em>Moran v. McDaniel, </em>80 F.3d 1261, 1270 (9th Cir.1996) (explaining <em>McKenna). </em>N.R.S. 177.375, thus, did not proeedurally bar the <em>McKenna </em>panel from considering the federal claims. <em>McKenna </em>does not govern here, however, because it was a capital case, \u201cand the Nevada courts are less strict in applying procedural bars to constitutional claims in capital cases than non-capital cases.\u201d <em>Petrocelli, </em>248 F.3d at 887; <em>see also Pellegrini v. State, 34 </em>P.3d 519, 536 (Nev.2001) (per curiam) (\u201c[W]e conclude that we have been consistent in requiring good cause and actual prejudice to overcome the statutory procedural bars [under N.R.S. 34.810].\u201d). Because the Nevada Supreme Court has applied N.R.S. 34.810(1)(b)(2) consistently in non-capital cases such as the one before us, we are barred from considering Cravens\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">We might still have considered the merits of Cravens\u2019s claims despite the procedural default, but he fails to provide any showing of the \u201ccause for the default and prejudice attributable thereto.\u201d <em>Harris v. Reed, </em>489 U.S. 255, 262, 109 S.Ct. 1038, 103 L.Ed.2d 308 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b556-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\">. <em>See, e.g., Standley v.
