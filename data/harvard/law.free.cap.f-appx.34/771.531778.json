Bochenski\u2019s application for disability retirement under the Federal Employees\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>Retirement System (FERS). <em>Bochenski v. Office of Personnel Mgmt. </em>No. CH-844E-00-0789-1-1 (Nov. 20, 2000). OPM denied Mr. Bochenski\u2019s application because he did not show that his medical condition disabled him from performing useful and efficient service for the agency. Because this court finds no error with the Board\u2019s decision under the limited scope of review available in this case, this court <em>affirms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Mr. Bochenski worked as a PS-05 mail carrier in Circle Pines, Minnesota. On November 11, 1999, he applied for FERS disability retirement. Mr. Bochenski claimed disability based on a right shoulder impingement that caused pain in his right shoulder, neck, right arm, and chest. Under his doctor\u2019s restrictions, Mr. Bochenski worked a light duty position of three hours per day. He was restricted also from any work requiring that he reach above his shoulders or push anything over twenty-five pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">After OPM denied Mr. Bochenski\u2019s application and request for reconsideration, Mr. Bochenski appealed to the Board. The administrative judge reviewed the medical evidence from two physicians who treated Mr. Bochenski for his right shoulder impingement and determined that the evidence did not show that Mr. Bochenski\u2019s condition was disabling. Mr. Bochenski timely appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">This court ordinarily reviews Board decisions under the Administrative Procedure Act to ensure they are not \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000). With respect to disability cases, however, Congress further provided that \u201cthe decisions of [OPM] concerning [questions of disability and dependency arising under this chapter] are final and conclusive and are not subject to review.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8461(d) (2000). Hence, this court may not review the factual underpinnings of physical disability determinations, but may consider whether there has been a \u201csubstantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination.\u201d <em>Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Mgmt. </em>470 U.S. 768, 791, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">Mr. Bochenski has not alleged, nor can this court find, any substantial departure from important procedural rights or a misconstruction of the governing legislation. This case also does not present any error going to the heart of the administrative determination. Rather, Mr. Bochenski argues that the Board did not consider all of the evidence demonstrating his entitlement to FERS disability benefits. No matter how compelling the evidence of a case, however, this court may not review the factual underpinnings of the Board\u2019s physical disability determinations. Accordingly, this court must affirm the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
