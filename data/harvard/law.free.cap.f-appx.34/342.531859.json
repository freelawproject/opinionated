Henry was the vice president-finance, chief financial officer, and a member of the board of directors of IMED Corporation. IMED provided stock options to Henry and other officers for their service to the corporation. The IMED option holders filed I.R.C. \u00a7 83(b) elections in which they reported the fair market value of the options as zero. The options were eventually sold to Warner-Lambert Company in 1982, and the taxpayers reported long-term capital gain from the sale of the options. In <em>Cramer v. C.I.R., </em>101 T.C. 225, 1993 WL 369030 (1993), <em>aff'd, </em>64 F.3d 1406, 1412 (9th Cir.1995), the court held that I.R.C. \u00a7 83 required such proceeds to be treated as ordinary income because the options did not have a \u201creadily ascertainable market value\u201d as defined in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.83-7(b)(2). As a result, the three officers in <em>Cramer </em>understated their income by long-term capital gain treatment of the sale of the options to Warner-Lambert. In the present dispute, Petitioners stipulated they would be bound by the holding of <em>Cramer </em>with respect to the treatment of the options.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">However, in the Tax Court, the Petitioners asserted the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) improperly claimed a notice of deficiency alleging they owed more than $2 million in 1982 income on proceeds from the sale of the stock options. The parties stipulated as to the notice of deficiency. The Petitioners also challenged the IRS\u2019s assessment of two penalties: a negligence penalty and a substantial understatement penalty. The Tax Court found for Petitioners as to the substantial understatement penalty, but found for the IRS on the negligence penalty. <em>Henry v. C.I.R., </em>Nos. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>27188-91, 1987-92, 1997 WL 14456 (U.S.Tax Ct. Jan.16, 1997). This court affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s finding as to the substantial understatement penalty, but reversed the negligence penalty. <em>Henry v. C.I.R., </em>170 F.3d 1217 (9th Cir.1999) (hereinafter <em>\u201cHenry I\u201d). </em>In addressing the negligence penalty, we held \u201cthat petitioners\u2019 reliance on their experienced and long-time accountant\u2019s tax treatment of the stock option proceeds was reasonable\u201d and the Tax Court \u201cfail[ed] to provide more than speculative inferences that Henry was aware of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.83-7 and negligently disregarded it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1223. The case was then remanded to the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">On remand, Petitioners sought costs and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in defending against the addition to tax for substantial understatement and negligence. The Commissioner initially argued that the Petitioners did not meet the net worth test, did not substantially prevail, and failed to prove the Commissioner\u2019s position was not substantially justified, and that the amount of fees and costs claimed were not proven to be reasonable. The Commissioner later conceded the net worth test was met. The Tax Court found Petitioners were \u201cultimately successful with respect to all of the issues presented, and, accordingly, substantially prevailed.\u201d <em>Henry v. C.I.R., </em>Nos. 27188-91, 1987-92, slip op. at 2 (U.S.Tax Ct. Nov.30, 2000). The Tax Court also found the Commissioner\u2019s position as to the addition to tax for substantial understatement was not substantially justified; however, it held the Commissioner was substantially justified in defending the determination that Petitioners were hable for an addition to tax for negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Petitioners have appealed the Tax Court\u2019s denial of costs and fees under the negligence penalty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the issue before the court is whether the Commissioner\u2019s position as to the addition to tax for negligence was substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">The Tax Court\u2019s determination of whether to grant costs and attorneys\u2019 fees associated with the defense of the addition to tax for negligence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Huffman v. C.I.R., </em>978 F.2d 1139, 1143 (9th Cir.1992); <em>Estate of Merchant v. C.I.R., </em>947 F.2d 1390, 1393-94 (9th Cir.1991); <em>Bertolino v. C.I.R., </em>930 F.2d 759, 761 (9th Cir.1991). Costs and attorneys\u2019 fees are properly denied when the IRS\u2019s assertion of a negligence penalty is substantially justified. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430(c)(4)(A)(i) (2001). A petitioner bears the burden of establishing that the Commissioner\u2019s position was not substantially justified. <em>Dixson Int'l Service Corp. v. C.I.R., </em>94 T.C. 708, 714-15, 1990 WL 64041 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">A position is substantially justified, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430, when it is justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person and has a reasonable basis in law and fact. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988); <em>Norgaard v. C.I.R., </em>939 F.2d 874, 880 (9th Cir.1991); <em>see also Lennox v. C.I.R., </em>998 F.2d 244, 248 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Powers v. C.I.R., </em>100 T.C. 457, 1993 WL 175413 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">On appeal of the Tax Court\u2019s determination that an addition to tax for negligence was warranted, we applied the clearly erroneous standard to the Tax Court\u2019s factual findings. <em>Henry I, </em>170 F.3d at 1219. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>We held, contrary to the Tax Court\u2019s finding, Petitioners satisfied their obligation to independently verify the proper income tax liability for the sale of the options by consulting with their long-term tax accountant. <em>Id. </em>at 1220. The accountant was provided with the requisite information. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the Petitioners acted reasonably in relying on their accountant\u2019s treatment of the sale of the options. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the Tax Court\u2019s finding that the Petitioners\u2019 reliance was unreasonable was clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The second issue addressed in <em>Henry I </em>was the Tax Court\u2019s finding that, through Henry\u2019s involvement at the top level of IMED and in the negotiations of their sale, the Petitioners\u2019 plea of ignorance with regard to their knowledge of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.83-7 was unsubstantiated. We held the Tax Court\u2019s determination was based \u201con pure speculation and conjecture that is not supported by the record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In our review of the record in <em>Henry I, </em>we found clear error in the Tax Court\u2019s findings. Based upon our finding, we held that Petitioners\u2019 reliance on their tax accountant\u2019s advice was reasonable and Henry\u2019s alleged knowledge of the treasury regulation was pure speculation. This leads to the conclusion that the Commissioner\u2019s position was not substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The erroneous interpretation of the law of the case infected the application of the case law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Heasley v. C.I.R., </em>967 F.2d 116 (5th Cir.1992), the Tax Court held that moderate income investors did not present a sufficient case to demonstrate that the IRS\u2019s position was unreasonable. The court of appeals reversed, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">The [petitioners] demonstrated that they are moderate income investors with a limited education and minimal investment experience. They relied on the expertise of their financial advisor, whom they believed to be knowledgeable and trustworthy. Although the [petitioners] had always prepared their own tax returns in the past, they hired a C.P.A. to handle the more complicated tax matters created by their ill-fated investment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 121. Based upon such a finding, the court of appeals held that a reasonable person would not \u201chave been satisfied with the IRS\u2019s position on the negligence penalty.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">From <em>Heasley, </em>the Tax Court extrapolated that \u201c[u]nlike Mr. or Mrs. Heasley, petitioner was vice president in charge of finance for the very corporate entity that was giving options to all of its officer/directors, including petitioner.\u201d <em>Henry v. C.I.R., </em>Nos. 27188-91, 1987-92, slip op. at 5 (U.S.Tax Ct. Nov.30, 2000). The Tax Court held that therefore the IRS was substantially justified in defending the Commissioner\u2019s determination that the Petitioners were liable for an addition to tax based upon negligence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">As stated in <em>Henry I, </em>the parties\u2019 \u201csophistication\u201d is not the operative determination; rather, it is whether reliance upon the opinion rendered by the accountant was reasonable. <em>Henry I, </em>170 F.3d at 1220-21; <em>see also United States v. Boyle, </em>469 U.S. 241, 251, 105 S.Ct. 687, 83 L.Ed.2d 622 (1985) (\u201cWhen an accountant or attorney <em>advises </em>a taxpayer on a matter of tax law, such as whether a liability exists, it is reasonable for the taxpayer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>rely on that advice .... To require the taxpayer to challenge the attorney, to seek a \u2018second opinion,\u2019 or to try to monitor counsel on the provisions of the Code himself would nullify the very purpose of seeking the advice of a presumed expert in the first place.\u201d). <em>Henry I </em>preclusively established that the Petitioners\u2019 reliance was reasonable, irrespective of whether Henry was \u201csophisticated.\u201d Moreover, as previously demonstrated in <em>Henry I, </em>Henry was not aware of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.83-7, and the Tax Court\u2019s determination, following the IRS\u2019s assertion, that he was aware of the regulation was pure speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">In light of the findings in <em>Henry I </em>and the impact the determinations have upon an analysis with existing case law, the Petitioners have shown the Commissioner\u2019s position as to the addition to tax for negligence was not substantially justified. Therefore, the Petitioners are granted reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The cause is remanded for determination as to the reasonable amount of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b383-15\"> xhis disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-6\">. The Commissioner cross-appealed the Tax Court's determination that the Commissioner was not substantially justified in the pursuit of the substantial understatement penalty. The Commissioner has stated in its brief it is not pursuing the cross-appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-8\">. In addressing whether the Commissioner was substantially justified in pursing an addition to tax for negligence, the Tax Court cited <em>Heasley v. C.I.R., </em>967 F.2d 116 (5th Cir.1992), and <em>United States v. Sam Ellis Stores, Inc., </em>768 F.Supp. 286 (S.D.Cal.1991). <em>Sam Ellis </em>was cited in support of the Commissioner\u2019s reasonable investigation. The court does not find error in this analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b386-10\">. The Tax Court instructed the parties to attempt to reach a conclusion as to the reasonable amount of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees associated with the defense of the substantial understatement penalty. If an agreement could not be reached, the Tax Court would make the necessary findings. In an order dated December 1, 2000, the Tax Court awarded costs and fees totaling $150,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
