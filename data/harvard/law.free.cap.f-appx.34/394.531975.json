Appellant also asserts that certain events described in <em>Riding the Bullet </em>are based directly on the actual hospitalization and emergency surgery of appellant\u2019s mother. Based on the foregoing, appellant claimed copyright infringement and invasion of privacy. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>claims fail, as a matter of law, for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">1. <em>Copyright Infringement. </em>It is plain from a review of both works that they are not \u201csubstantially similar.\u201d <em>See </em>4 Melville B. Nimmer <em>&amp; </em>David Nimmer, <em>Nimmer on Copyright </em>\u00a7 13.01[B], at 13-8 to 13-9 (2001) (to state an actionable copyright claim, a plaintiff must show that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s work is substantially similar to [the] work [in question] such that liability may attach\u201d). In particular, neither the sequence of events nor the development of the characters in <em>Robert Adams </em>have been replicated in <em>Riding the Bullet. See id. </em>\u00a7 13.03[A][1][b], at 13-32. Further, and despite appellant\u2019s allegations to the contrary, she has failed to identify <em>any </em>matter in <em>Riding the Bullet </em>which was quoted directly from <em>Robert Adams. See id. </em>\u00a7 13.03[A][2], at 13-45. Appellant therefore has no copyright claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">2. <em>Invasion of Privacy. </em>A tort action for the following four kinds of conduct may be brought as a claim for invasion of privacy: (1) \u201cunreasonable intrusion upon the seclusion of another\u201d; (2) \u201cappropriation of the other\u2019s name or likeness\u201d; (3) \u201cunreasonable publicity given to the other\u2019s private life\u201d; and (4) \u201cpublicity that unreasonably places the other in a false light before the public.\u201d <em>See Nelson v. Maine Times, </em>373 A.2d 1221, 1223 (Me.1977) (quoting the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 652A (1977); internal quotation marks omitted). However, \u201c[e]xcept for the appropriation of one\u2019s name or likeness, an action for invasion of privacy can be maintained <em>only by a living individual whose privacy is invaded.\u201d Id. </em>at 1225 (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 6521; internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis added). Appellant has failed to demonstrate a claim for any of the above.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">First, her allegation that she has been under surveillance for years is completely conclusory and is not supported by specific facts. Second, because neither she nor her mother possibly could be identified from anything in <em>Riding the Bullet, </em>the defendants have not engaged in any misappropriation of name or likeness. Finally, there is absolutely no evidence that anything in <em>Riding the Bullet </em>concerns appellant\u2019s private life nor places appellant in a false light. That is, appellant has not shown that anything in the novella pertains to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\"><em>Affirmed. </em>Appellant\u2019s motion to hold this appeal in abeyance until the University of Maine and the Maine Division of Mental Health file briefs is <em>denied </em>as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
