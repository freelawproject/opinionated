Boone\u2019s single claim on appeal is that the district court abused its discretion in refusing, on relevancy grounds, to admit into evidence Boone\u2019s pro se motion to dismiss the case that gave rise to the order to surrender. Boone claims that his filing of the motion evidences that his failure to surrender was not knowing. We are unpersuaded by Boone\u2019s argument. In fact, Boone filed the pro se motion <em>after </em>he was supposed to surrender and nothing in the record, including the motion itself, evidences Boone\u2019s motivation or expectations regarding the motion. The decision to exclude the motion was squarely within the district court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
