Poehlman, </em>217 F.3d 692, 698 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-25\">Agent Walker\u2019s requests that Johnson arrange meetings between him and Shirley do not rise to inducement, because they did not \u201cgo[] beyond providing an ordinary opportunity to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 701 (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor does Walker\u2019s description of the adverse consequences that could befall Shirley if he were audited constitute inducement, because the audit would not have affected Johnson. Walker\u2019s conduct therefore did not \u201ccreatfe] a substantial risk that an otherwise law-abiding citizen would commit an offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>36 F.3d 1424, 1430 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-26\">The evidence also supports a finding that Johnson was predisposed to commit bribery. Walker testified that Johnson bragged to him about charging taxpayers for free services and that Johnson was the first to hint at a possibility of a bribe from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Shirley. A reasonable jury could conclude from \u201cthe fact that the initial suggestion of bribery came from [Johnson that] she was predisposed to commit the crime.\u201d <em>United States v.
