Reed, </em>2001 WL 92225 (E.D.N.Y. Feb.1, 2001). He also appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to correct its July 18, 2001, judgment. For the reasons given below, we vacate and remand in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-17\">This is Reed\u2019s second appeal from the February 1, 2001, opinion and order. His first appeal was limited to a review of the injunction granted by the district court enjoining him from interfering with plaintiffs\u2019 use of The Platters name and limiting Reed\u2019s right to use The Platters name to the terms of a 1987 Stipulation. We affirmed the injunction. <em>Marshak v. Reed, </em>13 Fed.Appx. 19 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-18\">More than thirty years after the Platters\u2019 heyday, members of the group, their survivors and a management company are still litigating the question: who owns the name \u201cThe Platters?\u201d The district court thoroughly described the convoluted history between the parties, and familiarity with that opinion is assumed. <em>Marshak, </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-19\">Reed is one of The Platters\u2019 founding members. Reed quit the group in 1969, but he continued performing, both under The Platters name and as \u201cHerb Reed and the Platters.\u201d In 1984, FPI sought an injunction to prevent Reed from perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>ing under the Platters\u2019 name. Reed and FPI entered into a stipulation settling the lawsuit in 1987. The stipulation provided, in pertinent part, that while the agreement remained in effect, Reed would not use the name \u201cThe Platters\u201d but could use \u201cHerb Reed of the Original Platters,\u201d or other similar billing. It also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\">In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction enters a final order with all appeals being exhausted that provides that The Five Platters, Inc. has no right in the name \u201cThe Platters,\u201d then nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit Herbert Reed\u2019s rights in the name \u201cThe Platters\u201d and this agreement shall not inure to any party other than The Five Platters, Inc. and its successors and assigns or Herb Reed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Reed argued below that this reservation clause was triggered a number of times between 1988 and 1999, by the court decisions in <em>Robi v. Five Platters, Inc., </em>838 F.2d 318, 324 (9th Cir.1988), <em>Robi v. Five Platters Inc., </em>918 F.2d 1439, 1441-42 (9th Cir.1990), and <em>Robi v. Reed, </em>173 F.3d 736, 739-40 (9th Cir.1999). The district court found none of the eases held FPI had no right in the Platters, thus none triggered the reservation clause. <em>Marshak, </em>2001 WL 668656, * 19. It then entered summary judgment in favor of appellees. <em>Id. </em>at *20-21, 2001 WL 668656. The district court also issued an injunction, described above, and cancelled Reed\u2019s registration of the Platters\u2019 mark. <em>Id., Marshak v. Reed, </em>2001 WL 799571 (E.D.N.Y. July 11, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">On appeal, Reed argues the district court erred in finding the reservation clause had not been triggered. Further, he argues, even if the previous cases did not trigger the clause, then <em>FPI v. Monroe Powell, </em>7 Fed.Appx. 794 (9th Cir.2001) did because in <em>Powell </em>the Ninth Circuit determined FPI had no rights. The district court did not consider <em>Powell </em>because <em>Powell </em>issued after the district court\u2019s February 1, 2001, decision. In <em>Powell, </em>FPI sued Powell for breach of contract and trademark infringement of the Platters\u2019 mark. The Ninth Circuit held the district court erred in failing to give preclusive effect to earlier cases, which:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An\">established that FPI presented and continued to present its group as \u201cThe Platters\u201d even though the group no longer includes any of the five people who made the name famous and that FPI used the trademark with the intention of misleading the public into believing that FPI\u2019s group is the original group. As a result, the plaintiffs may not assert any common law trademark in \u201cThe Platters\u201d based on their prior use of the mark to the extent that the plaintiffs\u2019 use has been false and misleading in suggesting that their group is the original Platters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-8\"><em>The Five Platters, </em>2001 WL 389453 at *1. After the ease was remanded to the district court, FPI voluntarily abandoned its infringement claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">On appeal, appellees argue that our previous summary order encompassed both the summary judgment decision and the injunction. However, our summary order clearly limits its review to the issuing of the injunction. <em>Marshak, </em>2001 WL 668656, at *2. Thus, the summary judgment decision is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">The district court did not have the benefit of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s teachings in <em>Powell </em>when it issued its opinion. We think the district court should consider Powell\u2019s impact on its summary judgment and service mark cancellation holdings in the first instance. Accordingly, we vacate those decisions below and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">Reed also argues the district court\u2019s July 18, 2001, judgment wrongly implied that the Second Circuit affirmed both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>injunction and the summary order. In its judgment, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">The Court having entered judgment on February IB, 2001 for plaintiffs, against defendant, Herb Reed, pursuant to the Court\u2019s Memorandum and Order and the Injunction, dated February 1, 2001 and entered on February 6, 2001, which granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs and dismissed the defendant\u2019s counterclaims, affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by Summary Order filed June 12, 2001 ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Reed moved to correct the judgment to reflect that only the injunction was affirmed by the Second Circuit. The district court denied the motion. Because the judgment incorrectly states that the Second Circuit affirmed the grant of summary judgment, we reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Reed\u2019s motion and order the judgment corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">This panel retains jurisdiction over this appeal if it becomes necessary to consider further arguments. <em>See United States v. Jacobson, </em>15 F.3d 19, 21-22 (2d Cir.1994). Accordingly, the Clerk is directed to issue the mandate noting our retention of jurisdiction, in compliance with a <em>Jacobson </em>order filed contemporaneously with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-14\">. Plaintiff Larry Marshak filed a petition under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on October 22, 2001. The automatic stay prevents Reed from pursuing his claims against Marshak at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
