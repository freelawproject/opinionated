We find that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal because the district court\u2019s denial is not a final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Accordingly, we dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we recite here only those necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">S.O.C., a business that provides \u201cadult entertainment,\u201d (a female stripper service), filed a complaint against Clark County, alleging a pattern of activity in violation of, <em>inter alia, </em>the First and Fourth Amendments and numerous state and federal laws. The complaint alleged that various employees of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department had violated, and were continuing to violate, the constitutional rights of S.O.C. and its employees and independent contractors, by subjecting them, variously, to unlawful detentions, searches, interrogations, and arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">After defendants filed their answer, discovery commenced, and no dispositive motions were filed in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">With the help of a federal magistrate, the parties entered into a settlement agreement. The agreement itself provides for no payment of damages, contains no admission of any wrongdoing, and offers no specific relief to S.O.C. The agreement states that the defendants will not engage in any unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful conduct. The defendants also acknowledge that S.O.C. has an internal policy forbidding their workers from authorizing any search or seizure of S.O.C.\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-15\">The district court maintained jurisdiction over the matter for three years from the date of entry of the agreement (filed, in effect, as a consent decree).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-16\">Roughly six months after entry of the settlement agreement, S.O.C. filed in the district court a \u201cMotion for Enforcement of Agreement,\u201d alleging that defendants had violated the terms of the agreement. Specifically, S.O.C. alleged that Detective Rector, of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, caused an unauthorized and illegal search of its premises, with the design to vex, harass, and annoy S.O.C.\u2019s president and his business.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-17\">Following a hearing, the district court denied S.O.C.\u2019s motion. The court found no pattern of behavior in violation of the agreement, and noted that the parties should have been able to resolve a \u201csingle incident\u201d in an informal manner. S.O.C. appeals the denial of the motion arguing that the settlement agreement should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-18\">S.O.C. contends that we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>\u00a7 1291, which provides that \u201c[t]he courts of appeals ... shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States . .-\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Typically, \u201ca party is entitled to a single appeal, to be deferred until final judgment has been entered, in which claims of district court error at any stage of the litigation may be ventilated.\u201d <em>Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., </em>511 U.S. 863, 868, 114 S.Ct. 1992, 128 L.Ed.2d 842 (1994). Known as the \u201cfinal judgment rule,\u201d this rule serves the purposes of showing deference to pre-judgment decisions of the district court, promotes efficient judicial administration, and avoids costs and delay. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber, Co., v. Risjord, </em>449 U.S. 368, 374, 101 S.Ct. 669, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981). A \u201cfinal decision\u201d is one that \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">It is clear to this court that S.O.C.\u2019s appeal is not from a decision that \u201cends the litigation on the merits.\u201d The district court\u2019s denial of S.O.C.\u2019s motion to enforce the agreement is simply a way point in the parties\u2019 continuing dispute. Although the parties and the district court may have agreed on a mechanism for ongoing monitoring of the Police Department\u2019s conduct, the agreement cannot grant access to our court for review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">For these reasons, we hold that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal, and dismiss.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-5\">. It is not disputed by the parties that the district court itself maintains \"ancillary jurisdiction\u201d over the settlement agreement, since the agreement explicitly provided for the court\u2019s retention of jurisdiction to enforce the settlement, and the court signed and entered the agreement. <em>See Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins., Co., </em>511 U.S. 375, 381, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994); <em>Hagestad v. Tragesser, </em>49 F.3d 1430, 1433 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-6\">. The Supreme Court has made clear that a party may, under \u00a7 1291 and pursuant to the \"collateral order doctrine,\" appeal not only from a decision ending the litigation entirely, but also from \"a narrow class of decisions that do not terminate the litigation, but must, in the interest of 'achieving a healthy legal system,\u2019 nonetheless be treated as 'final.\u2019 \u201d <em>Digital Equip., </em>511 U.S. at 867, 114 S.Ct. 1992 (citing <em>Cobbledick v. United States, </em>309 U.S. 323, 326, 60 S.Ct. 540, 84 L.Ed. 783 (1940)). Such interim decisions will be considered final if they (1) \"conclusively determine the disputed question,\u201d (2) \"resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,\u201d and (3) are \"effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 468, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978); <em>Cunningham v. Hamilton County, Ohio, </em>527 U.S. 198, 202, 119 S.Ct. 1915, 144 L.Ed.2d 184 (1999); <em>Cunningham v. Gates, </em>229 F.3d 1271, 1283-84 (9th Cir.2000). These conditions for collateral order appeal are stringent, <em>Digital Equip., </em>511 U.S. at 868, 114 S.Ct. 1992, and are not met in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
