We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-24\">Whether or not the Magistrate Judge properly found sua sponte that Sanders had failed to exhaust his jury instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>claim in state court and that the claim was procedurally defaulted, Sanders\u2019 jury instruction claim fails on the merits because Sanders points to no constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Sanders contends that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses by not allowing him to question a key State\u2019s witness, Kenneth Agan, concerning Agan\u2019s prior drug activity, Agan\u2019s relationship with gang members, and Agan\u2019s possession of a laser sight for a gun. As noted by the state appeals court, defense counsel was allowed on cross examination to question Agan regarding his prior drug use, his involvement in the drug trade, his familiarity with guns and laser sights, and the immunity he was offered for his testimony. Only in one area, which was a collateral matter regarding gang connections of a person known as \u201cG Mike,\u201d did the court limit the scope of cross-examination of Agan. Although Sanders has quoted Supreme Court cases on witness bias, the state trial court\u2019s rulings did not violate the clearly established principles therein. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 379, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). The state trial court did not abuse its discretion in reasonably limiting the scope of cross examination, and no constitutional violation was caused thereby. <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b417-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
