We also held that the multiplier should not have been applied to hours spent on the fee application. <em>Kelly v. City of Oakland, </em>198 F.3d 779, 786-87 (9th Cir. 1999). We remanded for the district court to redetermine the fee award. On remand, the district court rejected all of the factors newly proffered by the plaintiff as justifying a multiplier, and this rejection is not appealed. Rather, the plaintiff now contends on appeal, that the \u201cundesirability\u201d of the case justifies a multiplier. It is clear to this court that the \u201cundesirability\u201d of the case was subsumed in the original district court ruling on the \u201cnovelty and complexity\u201d of the case and in our court\u2019s rejection of that factor in the first appeal. This is because the claimed \u201cundesirability\u201d in this case stems from the fact that the law at the time was adverse to the plaintiffs position. This goes to the novelty and complexity of the case, not to what we term \u201cundesirability.\u201d <em>Compare Guam Soc\u2019y of Obstetricians and Gynecologists v. Ada, </em>100 F.3d 691, 695-99 (9th Cir.1996) (case undesirable because of extreme unpopularity of the cause within the political environment of Guam and resulting in death threats); <em>with Harmon v. San Die</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number><em>go County, </em>736 F.2d 1329, 1331 (9th Cir. 1984) (rejecting claims of undesirability based on unpopularity of the cause because there was no danger of ridicule or condemnation).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">There was no error in the district court\u2019s reliance on federal law; plaintiff prevailed on federal claims as well as on a state claim. <em>See Carreras v. City of Anaheim, </em>768 F.2d 1039, 1050 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
