We dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-23\">In civil actions where the United States is a party, parties are accorded sixty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-24\">The district court\u2019s order denying \u00a7 2241 relief was entered on the docket on November 8, 2001, and Saunders filed his notice of appeal on January 25, 2002. Because Saunders failed to file a timely notice of appeal or obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s November 8 order denying \u00a7 2241 relief. We therefore dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-25\">With regard to the denial of Rule 60(b) relief, we have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order and find no abuse of discretion. We therefore affirm the denial of Rule 60(b) relief on the reasoning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the district court. <em>Saunders v. United States, </em>No. CA-01-737-5-H (E.D.N.C. filed Jan. 10, 2002 &amp; entered Jan. 11, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
