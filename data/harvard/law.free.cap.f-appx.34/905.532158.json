Gantt argues the Government\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove he violated the terms and conditions of his supervised release. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-20\">We review a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. Un<em>ited States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). The district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 1994 &amp; Supp.2001). We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find the evidence sufficient to prove Gantt violated the terms and conditions of his supervised release by committing a new crime and by failing to notify his probation officer, as required, within seventy-two hours of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-22\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order revoking Gantt\u2019s supervised release. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
