The Honorable J. Garvan Murtha, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Vermont, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b854-6\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">The United States appeals the decision of the District Court to suppress a firearm seized from defendant Marion Frampton on the grounds that the firearm was seized during a detention of the defendant that violated the Fourth Amendment. Possession of the suppressed firearm is the basis for this prosecution pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), 924(a)(2), and we review the suppression of evidence at this time pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">After careful consideration of the arguments advanced by both parties, we affirm the District Court\u2019s suppression of the weapon substantially for the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s thoughtful Memorandum Decision and Order dated August 29, 2001. We note that the factors cited by the government as providing a basis for probable cause, even when viewed in tandem, <em>see U.S. v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 122 S.Ct. 744, 751-52, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002), do not provide such a basis. None of the factors pointed to by the government here (unlike in Arvizu) relate to the defendant\u2019s behavior.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the words of the District Court, \u201cthere was nothing about Defendant\u2019s demeanor or his behavior sufficient to warrant a reasonable suspicion that Defendant [was], ha[d] been, or [was] about to be engaged in criminal activity.\u201d The factors relied upon by the government amount to little more than guilt by reputation and association, and do not amount to \u201ca reasonable, particular suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b854-11\">. The government does point to the law enforcement officer\u2019s impression that the defendant was being overly polite as a factor supporting a probable cause finding. However, a careful review of the officer\u2019s testimony reveals that the behavior that the officer deemed overly polite occurred only after the officer had detained the defendant by retaining the defendant\u2019s driver's license while running file checks.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
