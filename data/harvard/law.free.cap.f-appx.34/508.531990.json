Hamilton served a prison sentence after he entered an Alford<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> plea to a charge of terrorizing. In the instant complaint, Hamilton claimed that one of defendant\u2019s attorneys \u2014 Hamilton\u2019s former criminal defense attorney, a contract public defender named Mark Beauchene \u2014 violated his constitutional rights and committed legal malpractice by conducting the victim\u2019s deposition outside his presence and ignoring his written instructions on what to do in the criminal case. For reversal, Hamilton argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment without granting his numerous discovery requests, and that the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was substantatively erroneous. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">We need not consider Hamilton\u2019s arguments relating to the denial of his discovery requests, as he did not appeal the magistrate judge\u2019s<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> orders denying these requests. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a) (party may object to magistrate\u2019s nondispositive order within 10 days, or forfeit objection). We find, moreover, that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining the claims were ripe for summary judgment. <em>See Dulany v. Carnahan, </em>132 F.3d 1234, 1238 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, including its interpretation of state law. <em>See Adams ex rel. Harris v. Boy Scouts of Am.-Chickasaw Council, </em>271 F.3d 769, 775 (8th Cir.2001); <em>Kunferman v. Ford Motor Co., </em>112 F.3d 962, 965 (8th Cir.1997). Having carefully reviewed the record before the district court, we agree with the court that Hamilton\u2019s \u00a7 1983 and state-law claims failed. Hamilton could not state a \u00a7 1983 claim against the Wold Johnson Law Firm unless Wold Johnson Attorney Beauchene conspired with state actors. <em>See Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981) (public defender does not act under color of state law for purposes of \u00a7 1983 when performing traditional functions as counsel to defendant in criminal proceedings); <em>Deck v. Leftridge, </em>771 F.2d 1168, 1170 (8th Cir.1985) (per curiam) (public defender is not immune from \u00a7 1983 liability if attorney conspired with other state actors to violate plaintiffs constitutional rights). Hamilton, however, failed to submit evidence that there was any conspiracy to violate his constitutional rights. As for his legal-malpractice claim, Hamilton failed to submit evidence (beyond his conclusory allegations) showing that if Beauchene had followed his instructions, and had refused to accept the prosecutor\u2019s condition that the victim be deposed without Hamilton being present, the criminal proceeding would have terminated more favorably to him. <em>See Dan Nelson Constr., Inc. v. Nodland &amp; Dickson, </em>608 N.W.2d 267, 271 (N.D.2000) (when it is alleged that attorney negligently failed to perform some act on behalf of client, plaintiff must allege and prove performance of act would have benefitted client).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm. We deny Hamilton\u2019s motion to amend his complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\">. The Honorable Patrick A.
