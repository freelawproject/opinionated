Williams\u2019 motion, which was filed in June 2001, attempted to add parties after the expiration of the statute of limitations. That motion does not relate back to the original complaint, and is thus barred by the statute of limitations. <em>See Intown Properties Management, Inc. v. Wheaton Van Lines, Inc., </em>271 F.3d 164, 170 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-23\">We affirm the order of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b980-18\"> This appeal was interlocutory when filed. However, because the district court entered final judgment prior to our consideration of this appeal, we have jurisdiction under the doctrine of cumulative finality. <em>Equipment Fin. Group, Inc. v. Traverse Computer Brokers, </em>973 F.2d 345, 347 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
