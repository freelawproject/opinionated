Although McGauran submitted evidence of having been paid wages during that period, the SSA determined that they were not paid by a U.S. employer but by a foreign affiliate of a U.S. company. Having further found that this foreign affiliate had no \u201ccoverage agreement\u201d pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(Z), the SSA denied McGauran social security benefits for this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">\u201cThe absence of a record of wages is evidence that the alleged wages in fact were not paid, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(3), and when the record stands uncorrected for a sufficient period of time as here, the absence of a record of wages creates a presumption that \u2018no such alleged wages were paid to such individual in such period.\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(4)(B).\u201d <em>Duenas v. Shalala, </em>34 F.3d 719, 722 (9th Cir.1994); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.803(c)(2) (\u201cIf SSA records show no entry of wages for an employer for a period in that year, our records are conclusive evidence that no wages were paid to you by that employer ____\u201d); 1 <em>Social Security Law and Practice </em>\u00a7\u00a7 12:31-12:34 (Melvin C. Cole &amp; Dag E. Ytreberg eds., 1997) (same). \u201cA claimant seeking to rebut th[is] presumption ... must prove his ... case by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d 1 <em>Social Security Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 12:35, at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">McGauran must therefore show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that during the period in question, he was employed by, and received wages from, \u201can Ameri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>can employer,\u201d rather than a foreign affiliate (or subsidiary) of a U.S. corporation. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(b); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In support of his claim, McGauran testified that the person who hired him was an employee of a U.S. company, and that during his employment in Guatemala, McGauran often received instructions from the company\u2019s office in New Jersey. McGauran also submitted two letters from his manager in Guatemala: one to the U.S. consular officials stating that McGauran was \u201cemployed by an [AJmerican concern,\u201d and another to the company\u2019s office in New Jersey, urging that McGauran be offered another position \u201cwithin our organization.\u201d He also submitted evidence that a corporate entity named \u201cProductos Adams, Inc.\u201d was incorporated under the laws of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The SSA concluded that this evidence was insufficient to \u201cestablish that [McGauran] was working for an American employer.\u201d Instead, the SSA determined that the evidence showed that McGauran was working for Productos Adams, S.A., a division of Chicle Adams, C.A., a Venezuelan subsidiary \u201cof an American corporation. Based on the evidence presented, the SSA further concluded that McGauran\u2019s employer, Productos Adams, S.A., was not an American employer, but a foreign subsidiary (or affiliate) of an American corporation with no social security coverage agreement: McGauran\u2019s payroll was in Guatemala; a letter from McGauran\u2019s manager certifying his employment in Guatemala identified his company as a division of a Venezuelan subsidiary of a U.S. corporation; and a letter from the U.S. company by which McGauran claims to have been employed stated instead that he was employed by its \u201cforeign affiliate in Guatemala.\u201d McGauran presented no evidence to show that \u201cProductos Adams, S.A., a division of Chicle Adams, C.A.,\u201d was the same entity as \u201cProductos Adams, Inc.,\u201d the New York corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Where \u201cthe evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation,\u201d we must affirm the decision of the Social Security Administration \u201cif it is supported by substantial evidence,\u201d which is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Sandgathe v. Chater, </em>108 F.3d 978, 980 (9th Cir.1997) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1039-40 (9th Cir.1995)). Because the record contains substantial evidence to support the SSA\u2019s determination that McGauran was employed not by Productos Adams, Inc., a U.S. employer but by a different, foreign affiliate of Warner Lambert called \u201cProductos Adams, S.A., a division of Chicle Adams, C.A.,\u201d we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the SSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts - of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-17\">. As McGauran concedes, there is no evidence that the foreign affiliate here had a \"coverage agreement\u201d with the SSA. McGauran therefore does not qualify for social security coverage under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
