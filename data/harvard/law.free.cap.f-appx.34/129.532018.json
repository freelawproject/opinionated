The indictment, which included Walsh\u2019s co-conspirators, did not specify a quantity of controlled substances. As the Government correctly notes, Walsh\u2019s plea agreement provided that Walsh waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence. After an amended criminal judgment was entered to enable Walsh to note a timely appeal, he appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-24\">In this appeal, Walsh contends that the district court erred in imposing sentence because the quantity of marijuana employed to calculate his sentence was not treated as an element of the offense. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), drug quantity must be treated as an element of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>an aggravated drug trafficking offense and be alleged in the indictment and submitted to the jury to allow a charge and conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), or in the case of marijuana, \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). <em>United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150, 152 (4th Cir.2001) (en banc). Because no specific drug quantity was charged in the indictment or submitted to a jury, the maximum term of imprisonment that may be imposed upon Walsh for his marijuana offense is sixty months under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D). <em>See id. </em>at 156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The Government urges this court to enforce the waiver provision contained in Walsh\u2019s plea agreement. However, a waiver of appellate rights does not bar review of a sentence imposed in excess of the statutory maximum. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 403 (4th Cir.2000). Because neither the indictment <em>nor </em>the plea agreement made a specific allegation or finding regarding drug quantity, the district court exceeded the sixty-month statutory maximum provided in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D) by imposing a sentence of 120 months. Accordingly, we find that Walsh\u2019s waiver of appellate review does not prevent this court from noticing the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In light of the foregoing, Walsh\u2019s sentence is plain error that this Court will notice and correct. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Walsh\u2019s sentence is hereby vacated and this cause remanded to the district court for imposition of a sentence not to exceed the statutory maximum set out in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Government\u2019s motion to strike Walsh\u2019s brief is denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-18\">. Although the district court\u2019s judgment states that Walsh was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute quantities of cocaine and cocaine base, Walsh's plea agreement, presentence report, and factual basis all demonstrate that Walsh was involved only with distribution of marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b178-6\">. In light of this holding, we decline to consider the merits of Walsh\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in this direct appeal. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
