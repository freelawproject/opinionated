(\u201cJCI\u201d) against Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-22\">ARC originally filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Thereafter, the parties stipulated to transfer the case to the Central District of California pursuant to 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a). The district court granted Jackson\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss on the ground that ARC\u2019S claims were barred by California\u2019s statute of limitations. We agree that California\u2019s statute of limitations applies, rather than New Jersey\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In determining which state\u2019s laws to apply, \u201cit is necessary to look to the law of the transferee state ...,\u201d in this case, California. <em>Nelson v. Int\u2019l Paint Co., </em>716 F.2d 640, 648 (9th Cir.1983). In analyzing choice-of-law questions, California applies a three-step \u201cgovernmental interest\u201d approach. <em>Abogados v. AT&amp;T, </em>223 F.3d 932, 934 (9th Cir.2002). The court must first determine whether the laws of the jurisdictions differ. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSecond, if the laws do differ, the court must determine whether a \u2018true conflict\u2019 exists in that each of the relevant jurisdictions has an interest in having its law applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf only one jurisdiction has a legitimate interest in the application of its rule of decision, there is a \u2018false conflict\u2019 and the law of the interested jurisdiction is applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The court will only move to the third step \u201cif more than one jurisdiction has a legitimate interest.\u201d <em>Id,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">New Jersey\u2019s statute of limitations on \u201crecovery upon a contractual claim or liability,\u201d is six years, N.J. Stat. \u00a7 2A:14-1, as compared to California\u2019s four-year statute, California Civil Procedure Code \u00a7 337 for written contracts, or two-year statute under \u00a7 339 for oral contracts. Thus, step one in the three-step approach is satisfied because these laws do differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">However, no true conflict exists because California is the only interested state. Applying California\u2019s statute of limitations advances the policy underlying California\u2019s statute. <em>Ashland Chem. Co. v. Provence, </em>129 Cal.App.3d 790, 794, 181 Cal.Rptr. 340 (1982).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvN\">Statutes of limitation are designed to protect the enacting state\u2019s residents and courts from the burdens associated with the prosecution of stale cases.... California courts and a California resident would be protected by applying California\u2019s statute of limitations be- - cause California is the forum and the defendant is a California resident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-9\"><em>Nelson, </em>716 F.2d at 644 (quoting <em>Ashland, </em>129 Cal.App.3d at 794, 181 Cal.Rptr. 340).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">In contrast, New Jersey has little interest in having its statute of limitations applied because there are no New Jersey defendants and New Jersey is not the forum. <em>Id. </em>Our analysis need not go beyond step two. The district court properly applied the \u201cgovernmental interest\u201d analysis of California choice-of-law rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b634-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
