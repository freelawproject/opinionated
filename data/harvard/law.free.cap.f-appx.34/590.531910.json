At sentencing, the district court increased Tran\u2019s offense level by 2 levels, based on Tran\u2019s alleged role as an organizer, leader, manager or supervisor in the drug conspiracy. Tran appeals his sentence. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We vacate Tran\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-22\">The district court\u2019s finding that Tran was an organizer or supervisor is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Maldonado, </em>215 F.3d 1046, 1050 (9th Cir.2000). Under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) of the sentencing guidelines, the district court may apply a 2-level enhancement if it finds that the defendant acted as an \u201corganizer, leader, manager or supervisor\u201d of a criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c) (2000). In order for \u00a7 3B1.1 to apply, however, there must be some evidence that the defendant exercised \u201csome degree of control or organizational authority over others.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares-Molina, </em>913 F.2d 770, 773 (9th Cir.1990). The fact that the defendant was more culpable than other participants or played an important role in the criminal activity is insufficient to justify the enhancement in the absence of evidence that the defendant supervised or organized other persons. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number><em>States v. Harper, </em>33 F.3d 1143, 1150-51 (9th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Hoac, </em>990 F.2d 1099, 1110-1111 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In the present case, the record is devoid of any evidence that Tran organized or exercised authority over other participants. One participant, Marjory Horman, was apprehended with Tran\u2019s business card, but later indicated that someone else had recruited her. Another participant, Einar Lisborg, said that he worked for the \u201cTran brothers\u201d but indicated that Tran\u2019s brothers, not Tran, were his supervisors. The government did not argue in the district court that Tran organized or supervised anyone; it argued that Tran was a \u201csecond-level\u201d manager who distributed drugs on behalf of his brothers, who supervised the entire operation <em>from </em>Canada. Although it is clear that Tran played a significant role in the distribution operation, that alone is insufficient to justify the enhancement. Because there is no evidence that Tran organized or exercised authority over other participants, the district court clearly erred in adjusting Tran\u2019s sentence upward under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b630-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
