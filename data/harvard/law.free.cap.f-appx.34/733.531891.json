We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b774-18\">Maintaining a constant body temperature is critical to the health of underweight or premature infants. To that end, neonatal care units have traditionally used two types of infant warming devices, incubators and radiant warmers. Incubators circulate heated air through an enclosed compartment, using convective heat transfer to maintain the infant\u2019s body temperature. Caregivers have access to the infant either through hand ports or through one or more entry doors. Radiant warmers, on the other hand, are not enclosed. As a result, they provide greater access to the infant by caregivers. Radiant warmers typically consist of infrared heaters mounted over a support on which the infant rests. They control the infant\u2019s body temperature through the use of radiative energy that is emitted by the heaters and absorbed by the infant\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-19\">Both types of warming devices have shortcomings. Incubators that provide access to the infant through hand ports or small entry doors have the disadvantages of limited access to the infant and limited mobility for the caregiver. Incubators with larger entry doors have the disadvantage that opening the entry door causes a rapid temperature drop inside the incubator. Thus, access to an infant in such an incubator is limited because it is undesirable to open the entry door frequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-20\">Radiant warmers have their own drawbacks. The form of heat transfer employed in radiant warmers causes infants to experience more fluid loss than in incu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>bators, which typically use humidification systems. Also, because warmers are not enclosed, they expose infants to ambient nursery conditions such as noise and unfiltered air.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Hill-Rom is the owner of U.S. Patent No. 5,453,077 (\u201cthe \u2019077 patent\u201d), which is directed to a warming device that functions both as an incubator and as a radiant warmer. Claim 17 of the \u2019077 patent provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">17. A combination infant radiant warmer and incubator thermal support device comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">an infant support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">a canopy mounted over said support and adapted to be raised and lowered relative to said support, said canopy when lowered to a lowermost position substantially enclosing said support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-9\">an infrared heater mounted over said support and adapted to be raised and lowered relative to said support along with said canopy; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-10\">at least one fan and at least one heater providing heated air from said infant support traveling over an infant on said support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-11\">whereby said device is operable to function as a radiant warmer with said canopy raised above said support and said heater activated, and is operable to function as an incubator with said canopy lowered onto said support and said fan and heater providing a heated air curtain activated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">By combining certain functions of radiant warmers and conventional incubators, the apparatus of claim 17 seeks to achieve the advantages of both types of prior art devices while avoiding the disadvantages of each.</p>\n<p id=\"A69\">On September 27, 2000, Hill-Rom brought suit against Ohmeda, alleging that Ohmeda\u2019s accused device, known as the OmniBed, infringes claim 17 of the \u2019077 patent. Ohmeda counterclaimed, asserting that the \u2019077 patent is invalid and that the OmniBed does not infringe. Hill-Rom moved for a preliminary injunction, which was granted on May 29, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">In its opinion accompanying the order granting the preliminary injunction, the district court found that the OmniBed functions as an incubator when its canopy is lowered and as a radiant warmer when the canopy is raised. When operating as an incubator, the court found, the OmniBed directs heated air from the support upward through a passage formed by the inner and outer walls of the access doors of the incubator compartment. The evidence before the court showed that as the heated air rises and exits from the passage within the double-walled doors, it follows the shape of the sloped canopy toward the top of the compartment. The court found that the heated air then travels over the infant. Based on those findings, the court concluded that Hill-Rom had shown a likelihood of success on its infringement claim. In addition, the court held that Hill-Rom was threatened with irreparable harm, that the balance of hardships tipped in favor of Hill-Rom, and that the public interest favored granting preliminary injunctive relief. Ohmeda appeals from the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b775-16\">The grant of a preliminary injunction is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Hybritech Inc. v. Abbott Labs., </em>849 F.2d 1446, 1449, 7 USPQ2d 1191, 1194 (Fed.Cir.1988). Ohmeda argues that the district court abused its discretion in this case because the preliminary injunction was based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>erroneous legal conclusions and factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Ohmeda argues that the district court\u2019s finding that Hill-Rom would likely succeed on the merits of its case was flawed because of two claim construction errors. The disputed portion of claim 17 reads as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">at least one fan and at least one heater providing <em>heated air from said infant support </em>traveling over an infant on said support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">whereby said device ... is operable to function as an incubator with said canopy lowered onto said support and said fan and heater providing <em>a heated air curtain </em>activated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Ohmeda\u2019s first contention is that the district court should have interpreted the term \u201cheated air,\u201d as used in claim 17, to mean the same thing as \u201cheated air curtain,\u201d a phrase that is used later in the same claim. Ohmeda admits that the terms \u201cheated air\u201d and \u201cheated air curtain\u201d ordinarily have different definitions, but it contends that in the \u2019077 patent the term \u201cheated air\u201d has the same meaning that the district court gave to the term \u201cheated air curtain\u201d \u2014 an air flow that protects the infant from ambient conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Looking to the language of claim 17, Ohmeda contends that the \u201cheated air curtain\u201d provided by \u201csaid fan and heater\u201d is necessarily the same as the \u201cheated air\u201d previously referred to as being provided by the \u201cat least one fan and at least one heater.\u201d While the phrase \u201csaid fan and heater\u201d in claim 17 finds its antecedent basis in the phrase \u201cat least one fan and at least one heater,\u201d the fact that the same \u201cfan and heater\u201d provide both \u201cheated air\u201d and a \u201cheated air curtain\u201d does not mean that the latter two terms are simply two different ways of referring to the same airflow. On the contrary, the use of the indefinite article \u201ca\u201d and the phrase \u201cheated air curtain,\u201d which was not previously used in the claim, suggests that that the two terms are not the same. Moreover, the specification does not support Ohmeda\u2019s argument that \u201cheated air\u201d and \u201cheated air curtain\u201d are synonymous, because on at least one occasion it uses the term \u201cheated air\u201d to refer to air that is not in the form of a curtain. <em>See </em>\u2019077 patent, col. 6, II. 51-53 (\u201cHeated air from the air curtains 21 and 22 will be drawn into opening 141 and will pass downwardly through passages 140, 143, and into return or intake 63.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">Significantly, most of the independent claims of the \u2019077 patent other than claim 17 recite a \u201cheated curtain of air\u201d traveling over the infant. Claim 17 is the only claim that varies from that formula and recites \u201cheated air\u201d traveling over the infant. The difference in language suggests a difference in meaning; otherwise, there would be no reason for the patentee to have departed from the formulation consistently used in the other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">Ohmeda argues that all <em>of </em>the embodiments described in the written description portion of the patent use heated air curtains to warm the infant and that any assertion that claim 17 uses a different system \u2014 heated air rather than a heated air curtain \u2014 fails because such a system lacks support in the specification. In light of the fact that most of the claims recite a \u201cheated curtain of air,\u201d it is not surprising that the embodiments described in the patent employ heated air curtains. Nonetheless, the absence of any discussion of an embodiment using heated air rather than a heated air curtain is not fatal. The original claims of the application are part of the specification, <em>Hyatt v. Boone, </em>146 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>1348, 1352, 47 USPQ2d 1128, 1130 (Fed. Cir.1998), and from the outset claim 17 recited the use of heated air to warm the infant. Accordingly, claim 17 itself provided a sufficient written description of the claimed invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Notwithstanding the difference in the language used in claim 17 and in the other independent claims, Ohmeda points to an amendment made during prosecution to support its argument that \u201cheated air\u201d means the same thing as \u201cheated air curtain.\u201d As originally filed, claim 5 referred to a \u201cheated curtain of air traveling over an infant,\u201d while claim 17 referred to \u201cheated air traveling over an infant.\u201d The examiner rejected both claims for anticipation and obviousness. In response, Hill-Rom amended both claims by adding the language \u201cfrom said infant support\u201d to each. In explaining the amendment, Hill-Rom commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">In both the anticipation and obviousness rejections, the Examiner stated that the teaching of a heated air curtain traveling over the infant was supplied from ... [the purportedly anticipating reference]. However, an examination of ... [that reference] shows that the heated curtain of ah\u2019 is directed from the canopy of the device, and not from the infant support as is now more clearly recited in claims 5 and 17. Thus, it is submitted that the Examiner\u2019s \u00a7 102(b) rejection has been overcome, ... as there is no teaching or suggestion in the art for providing such a combination infant radiant warmer and incubator thermal support device as is now recited in claims 5 and 17 wherein the heated curtain of air which travels over the infant on the infant support is from the infant support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">According to Ohmeda, Hill-Rom\u2019s reference to both claims 5 and 17 as having a \u201cheated curtain of air\u201d constitutes a concession that the term \u201cheated air\u201d in claim 17 refers to a \u201cheated air curtain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">An examination of the context in which Hill-Rom\u2019s statement was made undercuts Ohmeda\u2019s contention that \u201cheated air\u201d was meant to be equivalent to \u201cheated curtain of air.\u201d The examiner rejected claims 5 and 17, as originally filed, in view of a reference allegedly teaching a \u201cheated air curtain.\u201d In so doing, the examiner characterized the amended portions of claims 5 and 17 as having a \u201cheated air curtain\u201d when only the amended portion of claim 5 had such a reference. Despite that characterization, Hill-Rom nevertheless began its remarks accompanying the amendment by distinguishing between the \u201cheated curtain of air\u201d of claim 5 and the \u201cheated air\u201d of claim 17. The portion of Hill-Rom\u2019s remarks immediately preceding the passage quoted by Ohmeda is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-10\">The Examiner rejected claims 5 and 17 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) as being anticipated .... In response applicants have amended claims 5 and 17 to clearly define over the cited references. In particular, applicants have amended claim 5 to recite means for providing a heated curtain of air \u201cfrom said infant support,\u201d and have amended claim 17 to recite at least one fan and at least one heater providing heated air \u201cfrom said infant support\u201d traveling over an infant on the support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">The statement on which Ohmeda relies on as proof that Hill-Rom regarded \u201cheated air\u201d as equivalent to \u201cheated curtain of air\u201d \u2014 Hill-Rom\u2019s reference to claim 17 as having a \u201cheated curtain of air\u201d \u2014 appears to be a simple error, perhaps brought on by the examiner\u2019s initial reference to claim 17 as having a \u201cheated ah\u2019 curtain.\u201d That error does not constitute a clear disclaimer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>of subject matter, particularly in view of the plain language of the claim and a contrary statement in the same prosecution document. <em>See Biotec Biologische Naturverpackungen GmbH &amp; Co. KG v. Biocorp, Inc., </em>249 F.3d 1341, 1348, 58 USPQ2d 1737, 1741-42 (Fed.Cir.2001). Accordingly, because neither the written description nor prosecution history contradicts the ordinary meaning of \u201cheated air,\u201d the district court did not err in construing that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Ohmeda argues that the district court made a second claim construction error that undercuts the court\u2019s finding on likelihood of success on the merits. Specifically, Ohmeda contends that the district court did not consider the ramifications of Hill-Rom\u2019s addition of the phrase \u201cfrom said infant support\u201d to claim 17 during prosecution. In Ohmeda\u2019s view, Hill-Rom gave up a construction of claim 17 in which heated air strikes the canopy before \u201ctraveling over\u201d the infant. Ohmeda therefore asserts that because the OmniBed operates in that manner, it does not infringe claim 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The relevant portion of original claim 17 recited \u201cat least one fan and at least one heater providing heated air traveling over an infant on said support.\u201d The examiner rejected that claim under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b), citing a 1974 Japanese patent. Because the version of the Japanese patent that the examiner cited was not translated, the rejection was based solely on one of the drawings in the patent. The examiner stated: \u201cJapanese T84 discloses a support (7), a canopy (14) that is raised or lowered and has a warming heater in the support and a means for providing a heated air curtain traveling over the subject on the support (see Figure 3).\u201d The figure in issue is shown below:</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">amended claim 17 to recite \u201cat least one fan and at least one heater providing heated air from said infant support traveling over an infant on said support.\u201d Hill-Rom explained the amendment as follows: \u201cHowever, an examination of Fig. 3 shows that the heated curtain of air is directed from the canopy of the device, and not from the infant support as is now more clearly recited in claims 5 and 17.\u201d Ohmeda and Hill-Rom have different views as to the meaning of that statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Ohmeda argues that the statement has two important implications. First, Ohmeda contends that the statement constitutes an agreement with the examiner\u2019s assertion that the \u201cwarming heater\u201d disclosed by the Japanese reference was located in the support (numeral 7 in Fig. 3). Second, Ohmeda contends that the statement reflects an understanding by Hill-Rom that the Japanese device operated by generating heated air within the support, directing it upwards toward the canopy, and deflecting it over the infant. Ohmeda thus argues that Hill-Rom was seeking to distinguish claim 17 over the cited reference by specifying that the support itself, rather than some other structure (e.g., the canopy), gave the airflow its ultimate direction over the infant. In other words, Ohmeda argues that \u201cdirected from\u201d in Hill-Rom\u2019s remarks refers to the structure that deflects heated air over the infant rather than the point of origin of the heated air. Ohmeda thus asserts that Hill-Rom surrendered embodiments of claim 17 in which heated air originates from the support but is deflected toward the infant by another part of the device, and that the OmniBed is therefore not within the scope of claim 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Hill-Rom takes a different view of the prosecution history. Hill-Rom contends that in making the statement that the \u201cheated curtain of air is directed from the canopy of the device [pictured in the Japanese patent],\u201d it was disagreeing with the examiner\u2019s contention that the heat source in the device depicted in the Japanese reference was located in the support. Rather, Hill-Rom asserts that it was pointing out that the \u201cheated curtain of air\u201d in the device shown in the reference was \u201cdirected from,\u201d that is, it originated from, the canopy of the device. Accordingly, Hill-Rom argues that when it amended claim 17 by adding the phrase \u201cfrom said infant support,\u201d it was specifying that the heated air originated from the support as opposed to some other location such as the canopy. Therefore, Hill-Rom contends, it did not surrender embodiments of its invention in which heated air is directed upward from the support, strikes the canopy of the incubator, and is deflected over the infant.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">We agree with Hill-Rom\u2019s view of the prosecution history. Hill-Rom characterized the prior art device as having a heated air flow \u201cdirected from the canopy of the device,\u201d unlike the device claimed in amended claim 17, in which the heated air is recited as being provided \u201cfrom said infant support.\u201d Ohmeda\u2019s argument that this statement refers to the structure that ultimately directs the heated air over the infant in making the amendment is not convincing. Figure 3 of the Japanese reference gives no indication that an airflow is generated in the support, rises upward toward the canopy, and is deflected over the infant, as Ohmeda claims. Instead, Figure 3 appears to depict a downward flow of air originating in the canopy of the device. Accordingly, Hill-Rom\u2019s amendment is properly viewed as specifying the origin of the heated airflow.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Because the district court did not commit legal error in construing the terms \u201cheated air\u201d and \u201cfrom said infant support,\u201d it did not clearly err in finding that Hill-Rom would likely succeed on the merits of its infringement claim. Ohmeda also argues that the district court erred in evaluating the balance of hardships between the parties and the harm to the public interest. We have considered Ohmeda\u2019s arguments on those points but cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in weighing those factors. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order granting the preliminary injunction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
