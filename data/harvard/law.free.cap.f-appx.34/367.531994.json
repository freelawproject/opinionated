He contends that his prolonged detention is a violation of his due process rights and international law. We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">As an \u201cexcludable\u201d alien from Cuba found deportable for criminal activity and being detained pending his deportation, Perez \u201chas no constitutional right to immigration parole and, therefore, no right to be free from detention pending his deportation.\u201d <em>See Barrera</em>\u2014Echavarria <em>v. Rison, </em>44 F.3d 1441, 1448 (9th Cir.1995) (en banc). While aliens who have \u201centered\u201d the United States \u201c \u2018may be expelled only after proceedings conforming to traditional standards of fairness encompassed in due process law,\u2019 \u201d excludable aliens have never legally \u201ceffected entry into this country\u201d and have \u201cno procedural due process rights regarding [their] admission or exclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1448-49 (quoting <em>Shaughnessy v. Mezei </em>345 U.S. 206, 212, 73 S.Ct. 625, 97 L.Ed. 956 (1953)). Therefore, \u201c[w]hatever the procedure authorized by Congress is, it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1449 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Furthermore, \u201c[b]ecause excludable aliens are deemed under the entry doctrine not to be present on United States territory, a holding that they have no substantive right to be free from immigration detention reasonably follows.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1450. Perez\u2019s detention is therefore constitutional under <em>Barrera-Echavarria </em>and <em>Mezei.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">The district court also did not err in holding that Perez\u2019s continued detention, authorized under valid Congressional enactments displaced the rules of international law against prolonged and arbitrary detention. \u201c[W]e are bound by a properly enacted statute, provided it be constitutional, even if that statute violates international law.\u201d <em>Alvarez-Mendez v. Stock, </em>941 F.2d 956, 963 (9th Cir.1991). Therefore, where, as here, valid Congressional enactments, such as 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(6),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> cannot be fairly reconciled with provisions of international law, the Act of Congress su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>percedes the rule of international law. <em>See Barrera\u2014Echavarria, </em>44 F.3d at 1450-51; <em>see also Kim Ho Ma v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1095, 1114 n. 30 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court denying Perez\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b408-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided in Ninth Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-11\">. Also, as in <em>Barrera-Echavarria, </em>44 F.3d at 1450, Perez is not subject to indefinite or permanent detention because his case is subject to annual review under the Cuban Review Plan. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b408-14\">. This principle applies with equal force to the \"combination of 'controlling acts\u2019 of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches\u201d that were found to authorize continued detention of a similarly undeportable, excludable alien for an extended period of time in <em>Barrera-Echavarria, </em>44 F.3d at 1451. The relevant legislative enactments were 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1225(b), 1227(a)(1), 1182(d)(5)(A), and 1226, as they existed prior to IIRIRA\u2019s implementation. <em>See Barrera-Echavarria, </em>44 F.3d at 1445-48.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
