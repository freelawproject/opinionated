Russell, United States District Judge for the Western District of Kentucky, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b201-22\">David Channels, a Michigan prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals a district court judgment dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-23\">On September 6, 1990, a jury found Channels guilty of breaking and entering an occupied dwelling with the intent to commit a larceny. Following the jury verdict, Channels pled guilty to being a fourth offense habitual offender. On October 2, 1990, Channels was sentenced to serve twenty-eight to sixty years of imprisonment. The Michigan Court of Appeals reversed Channels\u2019s conviction. However, in lieu of granting leave to appeal and while retaining jurisdiction, the Michigan Supreme Court remanded the case to the court of appeals for a harmless error analysis. Upon remand, the court of appeals vacated its earlier decision and affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Channels\u2019s conviction on February 13, 1995. On April 18, 1995, the Michigan Supreme Court denied Channels\u2019s application for leave to appeal the February 13, 1995, decision of the court of appeals. Channels\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied by the supreme court <em>on June </em>30, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">On April 17, 1997, Channels signed a motion for relief from judgment, which was denied by the trial court on November 19, 1997. The Michigan Court of Appeals denied Channels\u2019s delayed application for leave to appeal on October 23, 1998. On May 25, 1999, the Michigan Supreme Court denied Channels\u2019s application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In his \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus, signed on March 29, 2000, and filed on May 3, 2000, Channels raised five grounds for relief. McLemore filed a motion for summary judgment, to which Channels responded. A magistrate judge filed.a report recommending that McLemore\u2019s motion be granted and Channels\u2019s petition be dismissed as barred by the applicable statute <em>of </em>limitations. Over Channels\u2019s objections, the district court accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, granted McLemore\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and dismissed Channels\u2019s habeas corpus petition. The district court subsequently granted Channels\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability, certifying all five asserted grounds for relief for appeal. The case has now been fully briefed by the parties. Channels requests appointment of counsel and continuance of his in forma pauperis status.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Initially, we note that the district court in the instant case granted a certificate of appealability without providing \u201cany analysis to indicate that it had engaged in the two-pronged inquiry set forth in <em>Slack [v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) ].\u201d <em>Porterfield v. Bell, </em>258 F.3d 484, 486 (6th Cir.2001). In fact, neither the district court nor the magistrate judge addressed or ruled upon the merits of the grounds for relief asserted by Channels in his petition. However, rather than remand this case to the district court for a <em>Slack </em>analysis, we will limit our review to the limitations issue since the statute of limitations is a plain procedural bar that is present on the face of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s disposition of a habeas corpus petition. <em>Payton v. Brigano, </em>256 F.3d 405, 407-08 (6th Cir.2001). We also review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Kincaid v. Gibson, </em>236 F.3d 342, 346 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) contains a one-year statute of limitations period during which a \u00a7 2254 federal habeas corpus petition must be filed. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The AEDPA statute of limitations begins to run from the latest of four circumstances, one of which is \u201cthe date on which the [state court] judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). The one-year period of limitations is tolled, however, by the amount of time that \u201ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Habeas corpus petitioners, whose state convictions were concluded by direct review prior to the effective date of the AEDPA, are afforded a one-year grace period, until April 24, 1997, in which to file a \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>Austin v. Mitchell, </em>200 F.3d 391, 393 (6th Cir. 1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>530 U.S. 1210, 120 S.Ct. 2211, 147 L.Ed.2d 244 (2000). This one-year grace period is tolled by any time spent pursuing properly filed state post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>conviction or other collateral review proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Channels\u2019s habeas corpus petition as untimely. Channels\u2019s state court convictions became final prior to the effective date of the AEDPA. Thus, Channels is allowed one year from the effective date of the AED-PA, or until April 24, 1997, to file his habeas corpus petition. <em>See id. </em>Channels\u2019s habeas corpus petition was not signed until March 29, 2000, <em>see Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), well beyond the one-year grace period for filing such a petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Although the one-year grace period was tolled during the pendency of Channels\u2019s post-conviction proceedings, his petition remains time-barred. When Channels filed his motion for relief from judgment in the trial court on April 17, 1997, 358 days of the grace period had elapsed. The post-conviction proceedings concluded on May 25,1999, when the Michigan Supreme Court denied Channels\u2019s application for leave to appeal the denial of his motion for post-conviction relief. The statute of limitations began to run again on May 26, 1999, and expired seven days later. Since Channels did not file his habeas corpus petition within those seven days, or by June 2, 1999, his petition is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Despite Channels\u2019s argument to the contrary, there is no basis upon which to invoke the doctrine of equitable tolling under the circumstances of this case. <em>See Dunlap v. United States, </em>250 F.3d 1001, 1008 (6th Cir.2001) (habeas corpus petition filed pursuant to \u00a7 2255). Furthermore, even if the AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations could be excused because of a petitioner\u2019s actual innocence, Channels has not submitted any new evidence demonstrating his innocence. <em>See Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 327-30, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Accordingly, all pending motions are denied and the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
