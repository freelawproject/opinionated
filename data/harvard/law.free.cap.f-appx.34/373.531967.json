Hill, </em>252 F.3d 1066, 1068 (9th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-21\">To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Ezell must show 1) that his counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient and 2) that that deficiency prejudiced him. <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 390-91, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Here, Ezell claims that his counsel was deficient both in failing to object to the state\u2019s use of polymerase chain reaction (\u201cPCR\u201d) DNA testing evidence and in failing to hire an independent expert to evaluate the state\u2019s PCR DNA evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-22\">If Ezell has not established prejudice, we need not evaluate deficiency. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The Supreme Court has defined prejudice for us: \u201cTo establish prejudice [a petitioner] must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 391, 120 S.Ct. 1495 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Ezell argues that, at the time of his Washington state rape trials in January and February 1995, PCR DNA evidence was relatively new and that, had his counsel objected, PCR DNA evidence may not have been admitted under state scientific evidence standards. He also argues that a defense expert may have identified flaws in the state\u2019s testing procedures and that his counsel then could have avoided admission of the state\u2019s evidence or successfully attacked it before the jury. Neither argument has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The admissibility of PCR DNA evidence was established in Washington before Ezell\u2019s two rape trials. <em>See State v. Gentry, </em>125 Wash.2d 570, 888 P.2d 1105 (1995); <em>State v. Russell, </em>125 Wash.2d 24, 882 P.2d 747 (1994). Moreover, Ezell identifies no problems with the state\u2019s evidence in the two rape cases that would have rendered the evidence inadmissible or subject to a persuasive attack. \u201cSpeculation about what an expert could have said is not enough to establish prejudice.\u201d <em>Grisby v. Blodgett, </em>130 F.3d 365, 373 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">We conclude that Ezell has failed to establish prejudice. The district court properly denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b413-18\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-23\">.
