We <em>reverse </em>and <em>remand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Employees of the federal government are eligible for a special retirement program if they qualify as law enforcement officers or firefighters. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8836(c) (2000). In particular, federal law enforcement officers and firefighters may receive a full retirement annuity when they reach fifty years of age and complete twenty years of service. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8336(c)(1). Status as a firefighter is determined by an employee\u2019s position or duties. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.902 (1997). It was not until January 19, 1988, however, that the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) issued regulations setting forth the method for obtaining retirement credit for law enforcement and firefighter service.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">From August 1, 1967, until Canoles retired on August 24, 1990, he was employed by the Department of Air Force (\u201cAir Force\u201d). <em>Canoles v. Dep\u2019t Air Force, </em>0831-00-0446-1-1, at 1 (\u201cFinal Decision\u201d). Prior to May 21, 1990, the Air Force requested the OPM determine if Candes was entitled to service credit as a firefighter under \u00a7 8336(c). <em>Id. </em>at 2. On May 21, 1990, the OPM found that Candes was not entitled to such credit. <em>Id. </em>Candes timely requested reconsideration, and on July 2, 1992, the OPM again denied Canoles service credit as a firefighter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Candes appealed the OPM\u2019s decision to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">In a decision dated October 16,1997, the administrative judge found that the Board did not have jurisdiction over the OPM\u2019s reconsideration decision. <em>Canoles v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>AT-0831-97-0581-I-1 (MSPB October 16, 1997) (\u201cInitial Decision\u201d). In particular, the administrative judge held that 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.910 does not grant the Board jurisdiction over an agency initiated determination regarding firefighter retirement service credit. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The administrative judge, however, informed Canoles that 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.906 provides a procedure for an individual to request a determination regarding such service credit. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, she noted, \u201cI find nothing in those regulations to divest the appellant <em>o\u00ed </em>his right <em>to avail </em>himself of those procedures, including the right to present evidence at the initiation of the process, merely because the agency has initiated a determination from the OPM.\u201d Initial decision at 9. Following the administrative judge\u2019s suggestion, on March 4, 1999, Canoles requested firefighter service credit from the Air Force for his years of service from 1967 through 1990. Final Decision at 3. On February 25, 2000, the Air Force denied Ca\u00f1\u00f3les\u2019 request because it was not timely. Ca\u00f1\u00f3les appealed the decision to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">On March 12, 2001, the administrative judge affirmed the Air Force\u2019s decision. The administrative judge found that (1) Canoles had not made a request for service credit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8336(c) in late 1989 or early 1990; (2) Canoles\u2019 May 21, 1990, request to the OPM for reconsideration was not a valid request for service under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.906; and (3) Canoles had not shown that he was prevented by circumstances beyond his control from making a timely request.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The administrative judge\u2019s decision became final on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>April 16, 2001, and Candes filed a timely appeal to this court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295 and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The Board\u2019s decision must be sustained unless it is found to be \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rale or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. 7703(c) (2000). The substantial evidence standard requires this court to determine whether a reasonable person might be able to conclude that the evidentiary record supports the Board\u2019s decision. <em>On-Line Careline v. Am. Online, Inc., </em>229 F.3d at 1080, 1085, 56 USPQ2d at 1471, 1475 (Fed.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">This case does not involve whether Candes qualifies for firefighter service credit for positions he held from 1967 until his retirement in 1990, but rather only whether he is time barred from seeking review of whether his service in fact qualified. It appears it was the administrative judge\u2019s view that if Ca\u00f1\u00f3les initiated his request to the agency within one-year of her 1997 decision, that request would not be time-barred as to a determination of whether his years of service between 1967-1990 qualified for firefighter service.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the specific issue before this court is whether the fact that Candes took 15 rather than 12 months to initiate his action following the 1997 decision bars review.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">According to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.906(f) an agency head or the OPM may extend the time limit for filing if an individual shows that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit. The circumstances in this particular case support such an outcome. In 1997, when the administrative judge issued her decision, she informed Ca\u00f1\u00f3les that 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.906 provided a procedure for Ca\u00f1\u00f3les to request a determination regarding service credit. Based on the regulation Candes, in order to file a new request, was required to compile information regarding positions he had held decades earlier on military bases long since closed. This decision was based on an appeal to the OPM by Candes dating back to 1990. Thus, we conclude that, under the particular circumstances in this case, Ca\u00f1\u00f3les\u2019 1999 request to his agency head is not time barred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Elias v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>114 F.3d 1164 (Fed.Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">For the foregoing reasons we reverse the administrative judge\u2019s decision and remand for a determination of whether Ca\u00f1\u00f3les\u2019 service or duties with the Air Force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>qualified for firefighter service retirement credit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-8\">. Although the decision was issued on July 2, 1992, Candes did not appeal until 1997. Candes maintains that he did not receive the decision until 1997. The issue of whether he made a timely appeal in 1997 is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b720-12\">. The administrative judge denied Ca\u00f1\u00f3les' request for a hearing because she concluded that there was no factual dispute regarding the timeliness issue. Final Decision at 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\">. In fact, the government, at oral argument, appears to agree with this view.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b721-9\">. The government argues, and the dissent agrees, that the appellant was required to file a new claim within twelve months of the 1997 dismissal by the MSPB. There was no such time limit. The only existing time limit required appellant to make his initial filing within twelve months of retirement. The Air Force did so on his behalf when it requested that OPM make a service credibility determination. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.905 (1989). That satisfied the original statutory time limit. <em>Henry v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>157 F.3d 863, 865 (Fed.Cir. 1998). To be sure, appellant could properly be required to continue to pursue his claim, as he did until the 1997 dismissal. But he received no notice from the government, until this proceeding commenced fifteen months later, that the government believe he was obligated to refile thereafter within twelve months of the (improper) 1997 dismissal for lack of jurisdiction by the Board. The Defense Department\u2019s refusal to receive appellant\u2019s 1999 filing was an abuse of discretion under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b722-4\">MICHEL, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A6S\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In her March 2001 decision, the Administrative Judge found that petitioner was aware of the regulations requiring him to file a request with the agency at least as early as his receipt of her previous, 1997, decision, and therefore that his failure to timely do so was fatal because he \u201cwas not prevented by circumstances beyond his control from requesting service credit in a timely manner.\u201d We may set aside this determination only if it is unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The majority holds, however, that petitioner\u2019s 1999 request to the Air Force for service credit \u2014 15 months after he became aware of a 12-month time limit \u2014 is nevertheless not time-barred because of the onerous burden on Ca\u00f1\u00f3les to collect evidence to support his claim: \u201c[I]n order to file a new request, [Ca\u00f1\u00f3les] was required to compile information regarding positions he had held decades earlier on military bases long since closed.\u201d But the burden on Ca\u00f1\u00f3les, irrespective of how great it may have been initially, was not nearly so onerous <em>after </em>the 1997 ruling as the majority supposes \u2014 and that plainly is the relevant time period to which \u00a7 831.906(f) applies. <em>See, e.g., Davis v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>82 M.S.P.R. 347 at \u00b6\u00b67-9, 1999 MSPB LEXIS 709 at **6-8 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The majority\u2019s suggestion in a footnote that there was no time limit in 1997 is unpersuasive, in view of (1) its acknowledgement of \u201cthe administrative judge\u2019s view that if Ca\u00f1\u00f3les initiated his requested to the agency within one-year of her 1997 decision, that request would not be time-barred,\u201d and (2) its announcement that <em>\u201cthe specific issue before this court is whether the fact that Ca\u00f1\u00f3les took 15 months rather than 12 months to initiate his action following the 1997 decision bars review.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Moreover, the majority\u2019s citation to <em>Henry v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>157 F.3d 863 (Fed.Cir.1998) is unavailing because the initial request for service credit in that case was, in fact, timely. <em>Id. </em>at 865 (\u201cThe Board\u2019s finding necessarily relies on the implicit regulatory interpretation that an employee\u2019s behavior <em>can render untimely an otherwise timely prior request. </em>We disagree.\u201d) (emphasis added). Here, by contrast, the majority implicitly acknowledges that the 1990 request was untimely; otherwise, it would have no occasion to determine that \u201c[t]he circumstances in this particular case support\u201d its conclusion that Ca\u00f1\u00f3les \u201cwas prevented by circumstances beyond his control from making the request within the time limit.\u201d <em>Contra </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.906(f) (\u201cAn agency head ... or OPM ... may <em>extend the time for filing </em>when ... the individual shows that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request <em>within the time limit\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">In light of petitioner\u2019s resignation in August 1990, little (if any) creditable service time could have accrued between the 1990 OPM decision and the 1997 Board decision that would make collection of \u201cinformation regarding positions he held\u201d unduly onerous. Indeed, petitioner submitted an affidavit to the Board in July 2000 suggesting that much of the \u201cinformation\u201d already had been submitted to OPM: \u201cI had previously provided the Office of Personnel Management with the statement of Dennis M. Cassidy, dated August 23,1990, <em>in support of my 1990 request for the benefit at issue. </em>Effectively, the March 4, 1999 submission made on my behalf <em>served to supplement my timely 1990 request.\u201d </em>(emphases added) Petitioner offers no explanation \u2014 and the majority divines none \u2014 why he could gather his evidence in 15 months, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>could not do so in the 12 months allotted by the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">It is true that we are uncertain about the substance of the 1990 statement referred to in the affidavit, for it was not made part of the record on appeal. But in any event, petitioner was on notice that he needed to demonstrate entitlement to the service credit he sought \u2014 which would require that he provide \u201cinformation regarding positions he had held decades earlier on military bases long since closed\u201d \u2014 as early as June 1990. J.A. at 28 (\u201cYour request [for reconsideration to OPM] is considered timely filed and, as I advised you in our telephone conversation of June 14, 1990, you have been granted an extension of 90 days <em>to gather evidence you believe mil support your claim for credit </em>under 5 USC 8336(c).\u201d)(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Furthermore, petitioner had the opportunity to present to the Board any evidence that he was prevented by circumstances beyond his control from making a timely request; but he did not, instead arguing only that the \u201cone-year rule\u201d was inapplicable. J.A. at 6 (\u201cIn response to the inquiry of whether the appellant was prevented by circumstances beyond his control from making the request within the time limit, the appellant states that given that he requested service credit in 1989, his efforts to receive firefighter service credit are covered by the 1987 version of [the regulations] and he is, therefore, not limited by the one-year rule.\u201d). Despite this failure of proof, and in the face of petitioner\u2019s admission that in 1990 he submitted evidence supporting his claim for service credit under \u00a7 8336(c), the majority reverses the Board\u2019s dismissal for untimeliness and remands the case for a determination on the merits whether Ca\u00f1\u00f3les\u2019 service through 1990 qualified for firefighter service retirement credit. The majority reaches this result without explaining (much less citing in the record) exactly what additional \u201cinformation\u201d was necessary that was not already submitted in 1990 or why the rest was so difficult to obtain within one year; nor does it offer so much as a single sentence discussing why the Board decision is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The agency rejected petitioner\u2019s request as untimely, but it apparently made no determination regarding whether petitioner was prevented by circumstances beyond his control from timely filing. The Board conducts <em>de novo </em>review of this determination; we do not. <em>Elias v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>114 F.3d 1164, 1167 (Fed.Cir.1997). In this case, the Board found he was not so prevented. Because, to my eyes, the evidence plainly compels this result, I cannot conclude that the evidence supporting the Board\u2019s decision was less than substantial. Nor has the majority explained how it is. Instead, the majority seems to assume excusable delay, as if we are the fact-finder. Therefore, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
