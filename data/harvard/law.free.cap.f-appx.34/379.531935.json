Newman interlocutorily appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motion to dismiss a complaint filed by Cisco Systems, Inc., and Margaret M. Lynch, a Cisco employee. Cisco\u2019s action arose from a WCAB award to a Cisco employee and was brought pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, <em>et.seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">We review the decision to grant or deny declaratory relief de novo. <em>See Crawford, v. Lungren, </em>96 F.3d 380, 384 (9th Cir. 1996). \u201cAlthough the decision to grant or deny declaratory relief ... is a matter initially committed to the discretion of the district court, on appeal, we exercise our own \u2018sound discretion\u2019 to determine the propriety of the district court\u2019s grant or denial of declaratory relief.\u201d <em>Ablang v. Reno, </em>52 F.3d 801, 803 (9th Cir.1995) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The underlying WCAB award is not final. In the meantime, WCAB, in an en banc decision, held that California Labor Code \u00a7 132a is preempted by ERISA when the employee\u2019s \u00a7 132a claim is premised upon the employer\u2019s discontinuation of group health plan benefits to the employee pursuant to the terms of an ERISA plan. <em>Alonso Navarro v. A &amp; A Farming, </em>2002 WL 236699 (Cal.W.C.A.B. Feb.13, 2002). This en banc decision of the WCAB is binding on all WCAB three-member panels and on all workers\u2019 compensation administrative law judges. W.C.A.B. Policy &amp; Procedure Manual, Index No. 6.16.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Because of WCAB\u2019s intermediate ruling, we exercise our discretion and remand to the district court for entry of judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\">.
