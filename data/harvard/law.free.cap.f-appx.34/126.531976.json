Wills argued he qualified for a sentence reduction under Sentencing Guidelines Amendment 599, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>App. C (Supp.2000), which amended the application notes of USSG \u00a7 2K2.4. The district court found Wills was not entitled to a reduction of sentence as a matter of law. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">The district court\u2019s legal interpretation of Amendment 599 is reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>59 F.3d 481, 484 (4th Cir.1995). Commentary interpreting or explaining a guideline is authoritative unless it violates federal law or is inconsistent with or a plainly erroneous reading of the guideline. <em>See Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">Amendment 599 clarified \u201cunder what circumstances defendants sentenced for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in conjunction with convictions for other offenses may receive weapon enhancements contained in the guidelines for those other offenses.\u201d USSG App. C, Amendment 599, comment, (backg\u2019d). We have reviewed the record and the language of the amended guideline and find Wills is not entitled to a reduction of sentence under a plain reading of the text. <em>See United States v. Dixon, </em>273 F.3d 636, 643-44 (5th Cir.2001), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>- U.S.L.W. - (U.S. Apr. 3, 2002) (01-9579).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-17\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
