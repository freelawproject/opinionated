Latorre was arrested in the Borough of Glen Rock. Two summonses were issued to him by a Borough police officer at the time of his arrest. Summons No. A131135 cited him for a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50, driving while intoxicated (DWI). Summons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>No. A131136 charged him with violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-129, leaving the scene of an accident. Both were filled out by the same police officer; both indicated a court return date of April 28, 1987. On No. A131135 (DWI) however, the officer did not append his signature but he did write in all of the other pertinent information including his \u201cOfficer\u2019s I.D. No.\u201d which he indicated to be \u201c64.\u201d On A131136, he affixed his signature, (which was hardly legible), and again indicated his identification number.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">A few hours later, at 3:50 a.m., Latorre was again arrested by another Glen Rock police officer, who issued two summonses properly charging him with another DWI offense and speeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Latorre\u2019s attorney entered an appearance for him on April 24, 1987 and requested an adjournment of the scheduled court date in order to \u201creceive discovery, [and] investigate the matter.\u201d Thereafter he entered pleas of not guilty on defendant\u2019s behalf by mail and acknowledged a new trial date of June 9, 1987. In a letter brief filed on June 12, 1987 he confirmed that he had appeared in court on June 9, 1987 and had the opportunity at that time to talk to both of the complainant officers who had issued the four summonses. In that letter he also briefed the legal issue concerning the lack of a signature on the DWI summons. On June 23, 1987 defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the one DWI summons due to the lack of the officer\u2019s signature was considered by the municipal court judge. After hearing oral arguments, the court reserved decision. On July 17, 1987 it notified defendant\u2019s attorney that the motion had been denied. The matter was scheduled for trial on August 4, 1987, at which time defendant was allowed to enter a plea of guilty to the other three charges and a \u201cconditional \u201cplea of guilty\u201d to the first DWI charge, reserving the right to appeal from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>denial of his motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The defendant appealed the denial to the Law Division of the Superior Court which upheld the municipal court judge\u2019s decision, reasoning that the issuing police officer had \u201cappropriately issued a summons by physically writing out, stamping his badge number if you will ... and handing it to a defendant as they tuck him in the police car, to drive him home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">On this appeal defendant urges that we find that the DWI summons was so defective because of the officer\u2019s failure to sign it that it deprived the court of both \u201cpersonal and subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d The State contends that such an omission \u201cis merely a technical insufficiency that does not affect jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Jurisdiction to try motor vehicle violations (including DWI) is conferred upon the municipal courts pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:8-21a and their decisions are reviewable by <em>de novo </em>review in the Superior Court. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:3-6; <em>R. </em>3:23-1 <em>et seq. </em>When a police officer observes a violation of any motor vehicle law he may issue and serve a summons upon the alleged violator instead of physically arresting him. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:5-25. The form of the summons to be so issued has been made uniform by the Administrative Director of the Courts pursuant to <em>R. </em>7:3-1 and <em>R. </em>7:6-1. That approved form calls for the signature of the \u201ccomplainant\u201d as well as an \u201cofficer\u2019s I.D. No.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">With respect to traffic offenses, <em>R. </em>7:6-l(b) provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">The complaint may be made and signed by a law enforcement officer, or by any other person, but the summons shall be signed and issued only by such officer, or the judge, clerk or deputy clerk of the court in which the complaint is, or is to be filed. <em>R. </em>7:3 relating to warrants and summons in respect of nonindictable offenses generally, shall be applicable to cases involving a traffic offense, except as otherwise herein provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Our court rules have also addressed the related question of the allowable procedure in case of the issuance of a defective summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\"><em>R. </em>3:3-4 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">(a) Amendment. No person arrested under a warrant or appearing in response to a summons shall be discharged from custody or dismissed because of any technical insufficiency or irregularity in the warrant or summons, but the warrant, or summons may be amended to remedy any such technical defect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">(b) Issuance of New Warrant or Summons. If prior to or during the hearing as to probable cause, it appears that the warrant executed or summons issued does not properly name or describe the defendant, or the offense with which he is charged, or that although not guilty of the offense specified in the warrant or summons there is reasonable ground to believe that he is guilty of some other offense, the court shall not discharge or dismiss the defendant but shall forthwith cause a new complaint to be filed and thereupon issue a new warrant or summons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Relating specifically to municipal court matters, <em>R. </em>7:10-2 provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">The court may amend any process or pleading for any omission or defect therein, or for any variance between the complaint and the evidence adduced at the trial but no such amendment shall be permitted which charges a different substantive offense (other than a lesser included offense). If the defendant is surprised as a result of such amendment, the court shall adjourn the hearing to some future day, upon appropriate terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">We have recently reiterated the principle that the issuance of a summons carries with it a constitutional imperative that a determination of probable cause be made by the issuing officer. <em>State v. Ross, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>67, 74 (App.Div.1983). In this case that requirement presumably has been met and, indeed, defendant does not raise the issue. Rather, he argues that the absence of the signature of the officer renders the summons fatally defective as though it had never been issued at all, citing <em>Grauzauskas v. State, </em>2 <em>N.J.Misc. </em>307 (Sup.Ct.1924); <em>Brewster v. Wilson, </em>3 <em>N.J.Misc. </em>526 (Sup.Ct.1925) and <em>Grosky v. McGovern, </em>133 <em>N.J.L. </em>277 (Sup.Ct.1945) for support of that proposition. However, we regard these authorities as being inapposite to the situation presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">The general subject matter of the effect of the omission of a signature on court process has been the subject of discussion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>by various authorities with mixed results depending upon the nature of the process and its importance in achieving compliance with certain statutory and other prerogatives. <em>See </em>62 <em>Am.Jur.2A, Process, </em>\u00a7 9, at 792-793 (1972) and Annotation, \u201cProcess\u2014Omission Of Signature,\u201d 37 A.L.R.2d 928 (1953). Some courts have held that the absence of the signature of the issuing official is fatal to its efficacy while others have determined that it constitutes an amendable defect depending upon the factual circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Here defendant received ample and fair notice of the nature of the charge against him and obviously was aware of when and where it was alleged that the violation had occurred. He also should have been aware of the identity of the complainant officer. In the absence of such direct knowledge he, or someone on his behalf, could have gleaned that information simply by looking at the second sequential summons that had been issued at the same time by the same officer and also by reference to the officer\u2019s identification (or badge) number which had been inscribed on both summons. Given the fact that he was or should have been aware of these essential facts, under these circumstances the cited provisions of our court rules, which liberally allow amendments, were particularly applicable. Indeed, had the State moved timely to cure the defect even at the trial date (notwithstanding that the 60 day limitation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:5-3 had expired) such relief would have been appropriate. <em>R. </em>3:3-4; <em>R. </em>7:10-2. <em>See also State v. Bierilo, </em>38 <em>N.J.Super. </em>581 (App.Div.1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Thus, while we refuse to adopt a <em>per se </em>rule concerning whether such an omission is or is not fatally defective, we hold that such a decision necessarily depends on the circumstances of each case involving considerations such as whether fundamental fairness has been satisfied or a defendant has been truly prejudiced by the asserted omission in the summons. As we have noted, no such prejudice has been demonstrated here. In sum, while we do not consider the improper execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>of such a summons always to amount to \u201ca minor technical insufficiency\u201d as urged by the State, in the circumstances presented here the omission of the officer\u2019s signature did not deprive defendant of any constitutional, statutory or other imperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Hence, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss the summons for DWI and confirm defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-11\">The State has not challenged defendant's right to enter such a conditional plea at the municipal court level and we elect not to consider that issue at this time. <em>Cf. R. </em>3:9\u20143(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
