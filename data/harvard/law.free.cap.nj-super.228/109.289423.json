For the reasons which follow, we hold they should not and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">Defendant Eric Salzman was convicted in the Township of Montclair Municipal Court for permitting his dogs to bark late at night and early in the morning on six occasions in violation of Township Ordinance Art. III, \u00a7 166-11 (1947). He was fined $6,000 plus $50 costs. Upon his <em>de novo </em>appeal to the Law Division he was again found guilty but the fines were reduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>to $2,600. Defendant has appealed. We now reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The proceedings were initiated on February 20, 1986 when Policeman Kurt Reinhardt issued Summons # 3355 alleging that Karin M. Salzman of 10 Waterbury Road, Montclair had violated Montclair Ordinance Art. Ill, \u00a7 166-11 (1947) on February 20,1985. Before trial, Eric Salzman was substituted as the defendant. The offense was described as \u201cnoise\u2014dog barking.\u201d The summons which was issued and signed by K. Reinhardt stated that the officer would file a complaint charging defendant with the described offense. A complaint was filed by Officer Reinhardt. (See copy of Complaint and Summons attached). The copy of the complaint which is annexed to this opinion was submitted to us directly at our request by Gloria DiMiro, Clerk of the Montclair Municipal Court Clerk. Eric Salzman was found guilty of violating the ordinance. On the <em>de novo </em>appeal, defendant\u2019s $1,000 fine was reduced to $500 on this complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Even though defendant does not directly argue before us that the complaint issued by Officer Reinhardt was defective, we are constrained to raise it <em>sua sponte. </em>As we observed in <em>State v. Ross, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>67, 73 (App.Div.), certif. den., 95 <em>N.J. </em>197 (1983), an alleged violation of a noise abatement ordinance by a barking dog is quasi-criminal in nature and the rules of criminal practice must be strictly followed. In <em>Ross </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">Because of the nature of the proceedings here, process was required generally to conform to the requirements applicable to indictable offenses. See <em>R. </em>7:3-1. Among those requirements is the mandate that process issue only by a judge or clerk or deputy clerk of his court and only if the official issuing process is satisfied from the complaint that there is probable cause to believe that defendant has committed an offense. <em>R. </em>3:3-1(a), 3:3-2. In lieu of the primary process of a warrant, a summons may issue if the official is satisfied that the accused will appear in response thereto and none of the other warrant-mandating criteria of <em>R. </em>3:3-1(b) is present. The only modification in this procedure in respect of nonindictable criminal offenses within the municipal court jurisdiction is the authorization of <em>R. </em>7:3\u20141(b), <em>permitting a summons to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number><em>be issued by a law enforcement officer where the Administrative Director of the Courts has prescribed the form of summons and complaint.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 73 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Officer Reinhardt utilized the form of summons and complaint prescribed by the Administrative Director of the Courts pursuant to <em>R. </em>7:3\u20141(b) and <em>R. </em>1:32-3. This form of summons and complaint which may be issued by a law enforcement officer for nonindictable offenses is a set of four differently colored pages: the summons (white), the complaint (blue), the officer\u2019s copy of the complaint (yellow) and the police copy of the complaint (pink). <em>(See </em>Complaints and Summonses attached). The white summons is to be served on the accused which contains a printed notification that \u201cthe undersigned will file a complaint in this court, charging you with the offense(s) set forth above.\u201d The complaint must be signed and sworn to by the officer issuing the summons before a person authorized by <em>R. </em>3:3-l(a) and it must be filed without unnecessary delay. The prescribed form complaint contains a statement by the officer that he or she has a just and reasonable basis to believe and does believe the person named committed the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">It is clear on the face of the complaint filed in connection with Summons # 3355 that Officer Reinhardt did not sign and swear to the complaint in the presence of a person as required by <em>R. </em>3:3-1(a) and <em>R. </em>3:3-2. <em>Ross </em>instructs that a law enforcement official who utilizes the form of complaint and summons authorized by <em>R. </em>7:3-l(b) must nonetheless have his or her oath taken on the complaint by a judicial officer, court clerk or deputy court clerk who must also make a probable cause determination that an offense has been committed. <em>State v. Ross, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 74. The form of complaint used by the officer required him to sign and swear to the complaint in the presence of such authorized person who was to make a probable cause determination. The officer enjoyed the advantage permitted by <em>R. </em>7:3-1(b) of issuing an unsworn to summons before a complaint had been filed and before a probable cause determination had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>been made. But where, as here, there has been no determination of probable cause respecting this complaint, the summons and complaint become fatally defective. Therefore, the judgment of conviction is reversed and the summons quashed. The $500 fine or any portion thereof which has been paid is to be remitted to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The second summons was issued on March 1, 1985 when Jacqueline Levinson had Summons # 2970 issued alleging that three dogs, located at 10 Waterbury Road, Montclair, were allowed \u201cto bark for prolonged periods of time\u201d on \u201cthe 22nd day of Dec. and other days, 1984.\u201d That summons and the complaint were sworn to on March 1, 1985 before Therese Fusco, Deputy Court Clerk who also made a determination of probable cause. In the <em>de novo </em>appeal defendant was again found guilty of committing five offenses under this complaint: December 22, 23, 24, 25, 1984 and March 16, 1985. He was fined $500 for December 22, 1984 and $400 for each of the remaining four convictions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">The ordinance under which defendant was convicted provides: \u00a7 166-11. Declaration of nuisance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">It is hereby declared to be a nuisance, and it shall be unlawful, for any person to make or cause, or suffer or permit to be made or caused, upon any premises owned, occupied or controlled by him, or upon any public street, alley or thoroughfare in the town, any unnecessary noises or sounds by means of the human voice or by any other means or methods, which are physically annoying to persons, or which are so harsh or so prolonged or unnatural, or unusual in their use, time and place, as to occasion physical discomfort, or which are injurious to the lives, health, peace and comfort of the inhabitants of the town or any number thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Under point heading I of his <em>pro se </em>brief, defendant contends that the \u201cevidence adduced at trial was insufficient to find defendant guilty of charges.\u201d Defendant does not expressly raise lack of notice as an argument under Point I. He does state, however, under \u201cIncident # 2, December 23, 1984, Fine $250\u201d that he \u201cnever had received notice of the charge until well into the trial for all the incidents. His lack of notice as to the other charges is chronicled on TT Pg 10:\u201d (referring to the transcript of the proceedings in the Municipal Court). Defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>ant referenced the following colloquy which occurred in the Municipal Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">ME. SALZMAN: Your Honor, I wasn\u2019t informed of these other dates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">THE COUET: Well, it says on the complaint, Mr. Salzman, the 22nd and other days, so the complaint is not limited to one day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">ME. SALZMAN: So it is unlimited to any days that she chooses to add at this point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">THE COUET: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Still under Point I, \u201cIncident #3, December 24, 1984, fine $250,\u201d defendant states \u201c[o]nce again a date that of which the defendant had no notice____\u201d Finally, defendant states under \u201cIncident # 5, March 16,1985, fine $250,\u201d that this was \u201cone of the \u2018other days\u2019 for which the defendant had no notice. Not only had he no notice of the Summons, the Summons was issued nine (9) days <em>before </em>the alleged incident.\u201d Based on the foregoing assertions by defendant we are completely satisfied that this <em>pro se </em>defendant has raised an issue of constitutional dimensions, namely, that he has been deprived of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">As we observed earlier in this opinion, this is a quasi-criminal case and the rules of criminal practice control. In criminal matters, a complaint is supposed to inform a defendant of the charges he must defend against. The Constitution of this State requires no less. <em>N.J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. 1, par. 10. The complaint must contain enough information to enable the accused to defend himself and to avoid the risk of successive prosecutions for the same transgressions. <em>See State v. Wein, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>491, 497 (1979). Due process requires that the charging instrument not only inform a defendant respecting the nature of the charge, but it must also inform an accused of how many charges he or she faces and when they occurred. <em>Compare State in Interest of K.A.W., </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>112 (1986). The charging instrument such as a complaint cannot be a blank warrant to be filled in only at the time of trial as the evidence unfolds in the court room. <em>See State v. Henry, </em>56 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 14 (App.Div.1959); <em>McCooey v. Megill, </em>135 <em>N.J.L. </em>217, 219 (Sup.Ct.1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Defendant was put on trial without any idea as to how many charges he was facing. He learned he was facing multiple charges only after he was shown a copy of the complainant\u2019s trial notes. At that point he was not allowed time to review the dates and alleged events before proceeding. Under this complaint and the judge\u2019s interpretation thereof, defendant could have been found guilty for each day between December 22, 1984 and the March 21, 1985 trial date, if the evidence warranted. A substantial monetary fine could have been imposed for each conviction. Proceeding in this manner clearly violated significant procedural safeguards. Where, as here, there has been a violation of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process prejudice will be presumed. <em>See State v. Czachor, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>392, 404 (1980); <em>State v. Wagner, </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>564, 567 (App.Div.1981). The impact of violating defendant\u2019s rights to procedural due process cannot be measured by or weighed against the quantum of evidence bearing upon his guilt. <em>State v. Simon, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>191, 206 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">We are convinced that the complaint issued in # 2970 did not inform defendant that he was facing five charges. This complaint except as to December 22, 1984, was a blanket complaint which was filled in for four additional offenses at the conclusion of the proofs. Significantly, defendant was even found guilty of an offense which occurred <em>after </em>the summons and complaint had been issued. We fail to discern any reasonable way of determining that probable cause existed on March 1, 1985 for the offense that allegedly occurred on March 16, 1985. We conclude that except for December 22, 1984, this summons and complaint were fatally defective. The convictions for December 23, 24, 25, 1984 and March 16, 1985 are reversed. One thousand six hundred dollars ($1,600) in fines assessed for those dates or any portion thereof which has been paid is to be remitted to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Defendant has also raised the following additional contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>POINT II THE DEFENDANT WAS FETTERED IN THE EXERCISE OF HIS RIGHT TO APPEAL IN THAT A MORE SEVERE SENTENCE WAS IMPOSED UPON DEFENDANT AFTER THE TRIAL DE NOVO.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">POINT III THE TRIAL JUDGE\u2019S PARTICIPATION IN QUESTIONING OF MR. RUDNICKI AND MRS. MOORE WAS INCONSISTENT WITH HIS ROLE AS AN IMPARTIAL ARBITRATOR AND WAS REVERSIBLE ERROR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">POINT IV THE MUNICIPAL ORDINANCE IS PRE-EMPTED BY STATE STATUTE AND UNENFORCEABLE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">POINT V MONTCLAIR ORDINANCE \u00a7 166-11 IS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VOID FOR VAGUENESS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">We have considered these contentions raised in light of the record and applicable law and find they are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). Finally, we observe that pursuant to <em>State v. Ross, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 74-75 the waiver provision of <em>R. </em>3:23-8(c) does not apply to the unique facts of this case which demonstrate sufficient good cause. <em>See State v. Del Fino, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>154 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">The convictions for December 23, 24, 25, 1984; February 20, 1985 and March 16, 1985 are reversed. The conviction for December 22, 1984 and the $500 fine are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
