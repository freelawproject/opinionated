Suit opposing the initiative was brought by plaintiffs, comprised of an association of beverage distributors known as the Clean Capital County Committee, a beverage retailer, and an individual who is a resident of Mercer County. Although the trial judge rejected most of plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, and concluded that in other circumstances a county might enact a bottle bill deposit ordinance, he held that a deposit program had to be enacted as part of Mercer County\u2019s comprehensive solid waste management plan and also held that the Bottle Bill had been preempted by the Clean Communities and Recycling Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-99.1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">We are advised that Mercer County has not yet developed and obtained approval from the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) of its own solid waste management plan. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-1 <em>et seq. </em>Nor has it adopted a district recycling plan as required by the Laws of 1987, chapter 102 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-99.11 <em>et seq. </em>and amending certain other statutes).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Clean Communities and Recycling Act mandates statewide source separation and recycling of solid waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The trial judge concluded that the container deposit bill would not conflict with the Solid Waste Management Act, but that it would have to be part of a comprehensive recycling plan. Since there was no such plan then in effect for Mercer County he reasoned that the Bottle Bill ordinance could not be adopted prior thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">On this appeal defendants argue, among other things, that there was no preemption and that it was premature for the trial court to rule on the validity of the proposed ordinance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have considered the matter on an accelerated basis, and now reverse and remand with direction that the injunction be set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>aside. The question is to be put on the ballot for consideration by the electorate of Mercer County.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Ordinarily, the court\u2019s review of the validity of an initiative ordinance prior to its enactment is limited to whether it is defective on its face, or the petitioners have failed to follow the statutory requirements. See <em>McCrink v. West Orange, </em>85 <em>N.J.Super. </em>86, 90-91 (App.Div.1964). We recognize that an initiative proposing an ordinance which is invalid on its face would result in useless effort and expenditures. <em>City of Newark v. Benjamin, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. 58, </em>66-67 (Ch. Div.1976), aff\u2019d 144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>389 (App.Div.1976), aff\u2019d 75 <em>N.J. </em>311 (1978). There is, however, a strong public policy favoring the right of the voters to exercise their power of initiative. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:41A-104 and <em>Concerned Citizens of Wildwood Crest v. Pantalone, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>37, 43 (App.Div.1982) (liberal construction favored).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">We agree with the judge below that there is no clear or facial preemption of such county legislation by the Solid Waste Management Act, particularly in light of the adoption of the various recycling statutes. However, the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that a container ordinance cannot validly be adopted unless it is part of the enactment of Mercer County\u2019s district recycling plan and comprehensive solid waste management plan does not necessarily invalidate this initiative. We note that the proposed ordinance states that it is to be deemed part of the District Recycling Plan required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-99.13. While we recognize that under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:41A-116 an initiative or referendum approved by the voters is binding on the county, nonetheless, the question presented in this instance would be subject to review and approval by the DEP before final implementation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-24b.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Some municipal solid waste regulations have been preempted as a duplication of state regulation. See <em>South Ocean Landfill, Inc. v. Mayor &amp; Council, Tp. of Ocean, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>190 (1974); <em>Chester Tp. v. Environmental Protection Dept., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>445, 452 (App.Div.1981). A county solid waste management plan, however, is not duplicative of the State plan because each county is required by statute to devise its own plan. Hence, eases dealing with municipal action are inapposite. A separate and distinguishable area of preemption may be seen with respect to the handling of toxic wastes. See, <em>e.g., Rollins Environmental Services (N.J.), Inc. v. Logan Township, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>556 (App.Div.1986), certif. den. 105 <em>N.J. </em>510 (1986). Preemption does not occur unless there is a clear legislative intent to preempt, and this has not been demonstrated here. See <em>Ringlieb v. Tp. of Parsippany-Troy Hills, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>348, 351 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">We find no facial preemption by operation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-99.1a which provides for certain taxes to support waste disposal efforts. Under the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-99.2 the tax collected is to be distributed in part to eligible municipalities to provide for litter pickup and removal programs. Section 2e recites that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">The Department of Environmental Protection shall develop model municipal and county litter control programs. To be eligible for a grant, a municipality or county must certify to the Department of Environmental Protection the adoption of one of the programs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The tax is not levied if a state or federal container deposit law is enacted. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-99.6. The statute thus encourages local litter control programs. This purpose appears to be furthered by the Legislature\u2019s failure to revoke the tax and its distribution where a county bottle ordinance is enacted. While we recognize that a county deposit ordinance raises a possibility of an additional burden, such possibility does not render the ordinance facially invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">It goes without saying that it is not our function to consider the environmental merits of the Bottle Bill or the advisability of Mercer County adopting a container deposit law. We consider the proposed ordinance on its face, in light of the criteria in <em>Overlook Terrace Mgmt. v. Rent Control Bd. of West New York, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>451, 461-462 (1976). There is no clear or facial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>invalidity in the proposed ordinance or conflict with state law or policy; there is no clear intention by the State to preempt counties from entering the field; there is no indication of a requirement for uniformity of handling anti-litter regulations; and there is yet no pervasive or comprehensive state scheme. Nor does it appear that the proposal would be an obstacle to accomplishing the legislative purpose set forth in the Solid Waste Management Act or the recycling legislation. <em>Id. </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>at 462. To the extent that uniformity and coordination is deemed desirable, we again note that the proposed ordinance, if adopted, must be approved by the DEP (as a part of Mercer County\u2019s plan) before it can be implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Each county is designated as a Solid Waste Management District. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-19. Indeed, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-23e states that a county\u2019s governing body \u201cshall by resolution, adopt or reject, in whole or in part, the solid waste management plan for the solid waste management district.\u201d Thus, the Legislature not only anticipated, but mandated, that each county adopt its own solid waste management plan, with the assistance and approval of the DEP. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-6 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-24. Hence, we cannot conclude that there is state preemption. <em>Inganamort v. Boro, of Fort Lee, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>521, 538 (1973); <em>Schmoll v. Creecy, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>194, 203 (1969). It is no distinction that this delegation is to the county\u2019s governing body, rather than the county generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">It is premature to consider other arguments raised about the proposed initiative. See <em>In re Judges in Chancery, </em>101 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>9 (Ch. 1927). All the parties recognize that even if the initiative is approved by the voters it would not take effect for 180 days and there would still have to be certain additional proceedings and requirements, including submission to the DEP for approval, modification or rejection. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-24(b); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-99.13(d); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-99.16(e). See also <em>A.A. Mastrangelo, Inc. v. Environmental Protection Dept., </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>666, 687 (1982); <em>In re Application Combustion </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>Equipment Assoc., </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>305, 316 (App.Div.1979). It appears from the face of the ordinance proposed by the initiative that there is recognition of the DEP\u2019s supervisory authority in this field. Hence, we do not consider the other issues raised, including claims of unconstitutionality, as ripe for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Accordingly, the order appealed from is reversed. The injunction is discharged, and the County Clerk of Mercer County is directed to include the proposed ordinance on the forthcoming November election ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">An Ordinance Requiring a. Deposit on All Beverage Containers Sold or Offered for Sale In Mercer County</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">1. Whereas the proliferation and accumulation of carelessly discarded beverage containers is a growing problem for local governments and may pose a threat to the public health and safety of the citizens of Mercer County; and the haphazard disposal of cans and bottles creates a hazard to vehicular traffic, a potential source of physical injury to pedestrians and animals, and constitutes an unsightly accumulation of litter which must be disposed of at increasing public expense; and discarded beverage containers constitute a significant portion of the County\u2019s solid waste stream, taxing the already limited solid waste disposal options available to Mercer County; and the random littering of beverage containers represents a profligate waste of energy and raw materials which are used in producing them:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">It is hereby found that it serves the public interest to provide that all beverage containers sold or offered for sale in Mercer County have a refund value, and to provide for the convenient return and payment of the refund value of empty beverage containers; and that the deposit and refund value system hereinafter provided is an efficient and cost effective means by which Mercer County may achieve solid waste reduction, sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>ration, recycling and litter control goals established by the state under the \u201cSolid Waste Management Act, as amended\u201d [N.J.S.A. 13:1E-1 et seq.] and \u201cMandatory Recycling\u201d [P.L. 1987 c. 102].</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">2.
