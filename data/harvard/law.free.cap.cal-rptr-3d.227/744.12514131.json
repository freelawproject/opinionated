Code, \u00a7 6250 et seq. )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the need for confidentiality in the deliberative process of drafting legislation as safeguarded by the deliberative process privilege under section 6255 and as attorney work product under Code of Civil Procedure section 2018.030. A Public Records Act request in this case was made on behalf of Fowler Packing Company, Inc. (Fowler) and Gerawan Farming, Inc. (Gerawan) in response to the 2015 enactment of Assembly Bill 1513 (AB 1513) codified in Labor Code section 226.2 (Stats. 2015, ch. 754, \u00a7 5 (2015-2016 Reg. Sess.) eff. Jan. 1, 2016). AB 1513 addresses the issue of minimum wages for employees paid on a piece-rate basis (i.e., paid per task) and includes safe-harbor provisions that provide employers with an affirmative defense against wage and hour claims based on piece-work compensation so long as back pay is timely made. ( Lab. Code, \u00a7 226, subds. (b) - (f).) However, the safe-harbor provisions contained carve-outs that place the safe-harbor provisions out of reach for several California companies including Fowler and Gerawan. ( Lab. Code, \u00a7 226.2, subds. (g)(2) &amp; (g)(5).) The Public Records Act request sought in pertinent part: \"Any and all public records referring or relating to communications between\n   the California Labor &amp; Workforce Development Agency, its officers, and its staff and the United Farm Workers of America regarding AB 1513;\" \"Any and all public records referring or relating to the statutory carve out for any 'claim asserted in a court pleading filed prior to March 1, 2014,' as codified in AB 1513 section 226.2(g)(2)(A) ;\" and, \"Any and all public records referring or relating to AB 1513\" and Fowler and Gerawan. The responsive documents would necessarily include the identities of parties who communicated\n   confidentially with the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency (Agency) that took the lead in formulating the policies enacted in AB 1513.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court ordered the Agency to produce \"an index identifying the author, recipient (if any), general subject matter of the document, and the nature of the exemption claimed\" to justify withholding information in response to a request for documents under the Public Records Act. The Agency petitioned for writ relief in this court to prevent disclosure of the identities of the parties with whom the Agency communicated confidentially in formulating AB 1513, the substance of these communications, and communications with the Office of Legislative Counsel (Legislative Counsel) during the drafting process. We granted a stay and issued an alternative writ to allow us to consider the matter. Based on the California Supreme Court's guidance in\n   <em>\n    Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (1991)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2358590\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/53/1325/\">\n    53 Cal.3d 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=283%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20893\">\n    283 Cal.Rptr. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=813%20P.2d%20240\">\n    813 P.2d 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Times Mirror\n   </em>\n   ), we conclude the trial court's order errs in requiring disclosure of matters protected by the deliberative process and attorney work product privileges.

The Agency thus assumed a key role in formulating and drafting AB 1513, and in coordinating with the Governor's office and members of the Legislature. In preparing legislative proposals for AB 1513, the Agency communicated with Legislative Counsel. The Agency also sought confidential input from key stakeholders including representatives of business and labor. In a declaration, the Agency's director of legislation explained the need for confidentiality on grounds that \"at times a stakeholder's representative would share an opinion or take a negotiating position at odds with the opinions and objectives of the stakeholder's rank-and-file members or of its legislative allies. Indeed, some representatives spoke on behalf of multiple stakeholders, each with potentially divergent views. [If disclosed] these communications would very likely cause retaliation in the form of harassment and ostracization\n   from the representatives'\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   supporters. Or for others, it may cause an attorney or lobbyist to lose clients who come to learn about their agent's private advocacy on a controversial issue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2015, the Legislature enacted AB 1513 that added section 226.2 to the Labor Code. (Stats. 2015, ch. 754, \u00a7 5.) Subdivision (a) of Labor Code section 226.2 provides that employers must adhere to specified wage and compensation standards for piece rate employees. Subdivision (b) of that section provides employers with an affirmative defense to enumerated types of claims for underpayment due to a piece-work compensation formula in place between July 1, 2012 to December 31, 2015, provided the employers make timely back payments and take other actions specified in subdivisions (b) through (f) of Labor Code section 226.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Subdivision (g) of Labor Code section 226.2 constitutes a carve-out of the safe harbor provisions by making certain employers ineligible for the affirmative defense. The carve-out exempts a handful of companies from the safe-harbor provisions. As pertinent to this case, subdivision (g)(2) of Labor Code section 226.2\"makes Gerawan ineligible to assert the safe harbor as an affirmative defense in a class action suit filed against it by the General Counsel of the United Farm Workers of America (UFW) on February 3, 2014 ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Fowler Packing Co. v.

(\n   <em>\n    Fowler v. Lanier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176920\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/809/#p813\">\n    844 F.3d 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The federal court action is based on Fowler and Gerawan's claims the AB 1513 \"carve-outs violated the Bill of Attainder Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, as well as [a]rticle IV, [s]ection 16 of the California Constitution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 811-812.) The federal district court dismissed the action, and Fowler and Gerawan appealed the dismissal of their federal constitutional claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 814.) The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the Bill of Attainder claims but reversed the dismissal of the Equal Protection claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 812.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As to the Equal Protection claims, the Ninth Circuit relied on assertions in Fowler and Gerawan's complaint that set forth \"allegations relating to AB 1513's legislative history. According to the complaint, late in the 2014 legislative term, a bill that established the safe harbor, but one without any of the carve-outs, was proposed to the California legislature. That bill was never formally introduced. On March 5, 2015, an initial version of AB 1513 was introduced. This initial version did not address piece-rate compensation or the\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Bluford\n   </em>\n   decisions; it instead addressed an unrelated labor issue. On August 27, 2015, a new version of AB 1513 was reintroduced. Bearing no resemblance\n   to its initial version, the new AB 1513 contained the carve-out provisions challenged here. The new AB 1513 was a result of 'closed negotiations' between the [Agency], labor unions including the United Farm Workers of America, and employer groups. Assembly member Das Williams presented the bill to the legislature with sixteen days left in the 2015 session, a fact that prompted one Senator to comment that 'not only is the ink wet, there's no ink on the paper on some of these issues that have been surfaced that are ... core, fundamental issues.' [Fowler and Gerawan] allege, based on a September 30, 2015, article published in the\n   <em>\n    Sacramento Bee\n   </em>\n   , which they attached to their complaint, that the carve-outs were demanded by the UFW as necessary conditions to obtain UFW's support for the safe harbor provision. [Fowler and Gerawan] also allege that UFW sought the carve-outs as retribution for Gerawan's resistance in contractual negotiations with the union.\" (\n   <em>\n    Fowler v. Lanier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 844 F.3d at pp. 813-814.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Ninth Circuit held the assertions in Fowler and Gerawan's complaint stated colorable claims under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The Ninth Circuit determined the rational basis standard of review applied because \"AB 1513 implicates no suspect class or fundamental\n   right.\" (\n   <em>\n    Fowler v. Lanier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 844 F.3d at p. 814.) Under that standard, Fowler and Gerawan argued \"that AB 1513 fails to satisfy rational basis review because the only reason the carve-outs were included in the final bill was to procure the support of the UFW.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 815.) The Ninth Circuit held that \"if that is the only justification for the carve-outs, that justification alone does not survive constitutional scrutiny. [Fowler and Gerawan] have plausibly alleged that the cut-off dates in sections (g)(2) and (g)(5) were included in AB 1513 for only that illegitimate purpose. Each cut-off date corresponds, within a matter of weeks (or even a matter of days), to the corresponding filing dates of the cases against Fowler, Gerawan, and Delano [Farms Company, another agricultural company]. Accepting [Fowler and Gerawan's] allegations as true, as we must at this stage of the litigation, we can conceive of no other reason why the California legislature would choose to carve out these three employers other than to respond to the demands of a political constituent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Fowler v. Lanier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at p. 815.) Based on this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit reversed the trial court's dismissal and remanded for further proceedings on Fowler and Gerawan's Equal Protections claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 814-816, 819.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Public Records Act Request by Fowler and Gerawan\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 30, 2015, Fowler and Gerawan's legal counsel submitted a request for documents from the Agency under the Public Records Act. In pertinent part, Fowler and Gerawan's attorney requested: \"Any and all public records referring or relating to communications between the [Agency], its officers, and its staff and the United Farm Workers of America regarding AB 1513;\" \"Any and all public records referring or relating to the statutory carve out for any 'claim asserted in a court pleading filed prior to March 1, 2014,' as codified in AB 1513 section 226.2(g)(2)(A) ;\" and \"Any and all public records referring or relating to AB 1513\" and Fowler and Gerawan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The parties engaged in communications about the scope of the request. On January 20, 2016, the Agency produced 119 pages\n   in response to the Public Records Act request. Some of the produced documents were redacted as to the identity and content of e-mail communications. The Agency also indicated it was withholding additional unspecified documents on grounds of privileges-including official information under Evidence Code section 1040, the deliberative process privilege under section 6255, and attorney work product under Code of Civil Procedure section 2018.030. On March 16, 2016, the Agency stated it did not intend to produce any additional documents under the Public Records Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 24, 2016, Fowler and Gerawan filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court to seek compliance with the Public Records\n   Act. The Agency opposed the petition, arguing it had properly complied with the Public Records Act in disclosing nonprivileged documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On August 11, 2016, the trial court issued a ruling on submitted matter granting Fowler and Gerawan's petition in part and denying the petition in part. In its ruling, the trial court noted the Agency had withheld \"responsive records-allegedly about three banker boxes worth of materials.\" The trial court allowed that \"intra-agency documents reflecting the mental processes of Agency attorneys are protected attorney work product,\" but stated the \"Agency has failed to meet its burden to show that communications between Agency staff and attorneys for Legislative Counsel fall within the scope of the doctrine.\" The trial court reasoned: \"An attorney-client relationship exists between Legislative Counsel and the members of the Legislature or Governor. (See Gov. Code \u00a7 10207.) There is no attorney-client relationship between Legislative Counsel and the Agency.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As to the claim of privilege under Evidence Code section 1040, the trial court found that \"the Agency has produced evidence establishing the threshold determination that it solicited input from 'stakeholders' on a 'confidential basis.' \" The trial court further found \"that the Agency's interest in preserving the confidentiality of communications regarding the legislative proposal outweighs the public interest in disclosure. If the Agency were compelled to disclose its confidential communications with stakeholders, its ability to have candid discussions with stakeholders would be greatly diminished, and the quality of its decisionmaking would be reduced.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The trial court \"acknowledge[d] that some of the materials withheld by the Agency likely fall within the scope of the privilege as deliberative materials. As to these materials, for the same reasons articulated above, the court finds that the public interest in nondisclosure outweighs the public interest favoring disclosure, so the deliberative process privilege applies.\" Nonetheless, the trial court stated that \"not all of the documents at issue are 'deliberative.' For example, communications made by the Agency to third parties are not 'deliberative.' Likewise, communications by interested parties seeking to influence Agency decisions generally cannot be considered part of the deliberative process, which is the internal process by which government policy is processed and formulated by senior (policymaking) officials.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The trial court ordered that, \"[t]o the extent the Agency continues to withhold documents based on the deliberative process privilege, the Agency is directed to prepare and submit to Petitioners an index identifying the author, recipient, and general subject matter of the document.\" The trial court concluded by directing counsel for Fowler and Gerawan to prepare a formal\n   order, submit it to opposing counsel for approval as to form, and then to the court.\n   The parties were unable to agree on a formal order. Fowler and Gerawan sent a letter to the trial court to request clarification regarding the scope of the privileges to which the Agency was entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On September 19, 2016, the trial court issued a minute order stating: \"It is clear to the court that significant differences of opinion remain regarding the scope of the Agency's production, and the court is persuaded that these disputes should be resolved before the court issues its Order in this case.\" Thus, the trial court directed that \"[t]o the extent the Agency continues to withhold responsive documents, the Agency is directed to prepare and submit to Petitioners an index identifying the author, recipient (if any), general subject matter of the document, and the nature of the exemption claimed. The parties are directed to then meet and confer and attempt to resolve any remaining disputes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On September 21, 2016, the Agency requested clarification about the trial court's order. On September 30, 2016, the trial court sent a letter to the Agency. In pertinent part, the letter stated: \"The court intended its most recent Minute Order to require an index of all of the responsive records withheld by the Agency. As you correctly noted, this is a change from the court's August Ruling-a change the court has deemed necessary based on the significant differences of opinion that remain regarding the scope of the Agency's production. The court finds the Agency's concerns about divulging the identities of 'stakeholders' to be unfounded. In general, the identities of the stakeholders already are known. And to the extent they are unknown, the court is not persuaded that divulging the identities for purposes of a 'privilege log' will have any significant 'chilling effect' on the Agency's ability to have candid discussions with future stakeholders. ... [\u00b6] ... The Agency is directed to ... prepare an index of all responsive records that are being withheld by the Agency, so that this case may progress to a final disposition.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On October 6, 2016, the Agency filed an ex parte application in the trial court to seek a stay of the court's orders and an enlargement of time to file a writ petition with this court.

To this end, the Agency worked with key staff in the Governor's office and the Legislature. The Agency also engaged in confidential communications with third parties regarding the issues relating to piece-work compensation that were to be addressed in AB 1513. These third parties had diverse and conflicting views regarding the proposed substance of AB 1513. Indeed, some individuals who communicated in confidence with the Agency represented constituencies that themselves had divided views on the aims of the legislation. The information the Agency acquired in confidence was relied upon in its decisionmaking process and influenced the substantive choices of language for AB 1513. However, in the absence of confidentiality, the Agency would have received less candid input into the proposed legislation and may not have heard the viewpoints of persons who were knowledgeable about the issues but represented divided constituencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The trial court's initial ruling on submitted matter determined the Agency properly withheld records as official information protected under\n   Evidence Code section 1040. In support of the ruling, the trial court found that \"the Agency has produced evidence establishing the threshold determination that it solicited input from 'stakeholders' on a 'confidential basis.' \" The trial court further found \"that the Agency's interest in preserving the confidentiality of communications regarding the legislative proposal outweighs the public interest in disclosure. If the Agency were compelled to disclose its confidential communications with stakeholders, its ability to have candid discussions with stakeholders would be greatly diminished, and the quality of its decisionmaking would be reduced.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Although the trial court did not change its factual findings regarding the confidential nature of third party communications with the Agency during the predecisional phase, the court's September 30, 2016 letter order nonetheless required the Agency \"to prepare and submit to Petitioners an index identifying the author, recipient (if any), general subject matter of the document, and the nature of the exemption claimed\" for every document withheld as official information. The trial court acknowledged the requirement of the index constituted a material change from its prior ruling and gave two reasons for the change: (1) \"the Agency's concerns about divulging the identities of 'stakeholders' to be unfounded,\" and (2) \"[i]n general, the identities of the stakeholders already are known.\" We are not persuaded by either reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As to the first reason, we hearken back to the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Cal. First\n   </em>\n   where this court observed candor is likely to be threatened when a party knows communications will be revealed to the public. As this court noted, \" 'Human experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances ... to the detriment of the decisionmaking process.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Cal.

As in\n   <em>\n    Times Mirror\n   </em>\n   , disclosing the identity of persons with whom the Agency \"has met and consulted is the functional equivalent of revealing the substance or direction\" of the Agency's \"judgment and mental processes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Times Mirror\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 53 Cal.3d at p. 1343,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=283%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20893\">\n    283 Cal.Rptr. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=813%20P.2d%20240\">\n    813 P.2d 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Just as revealing the substance of the Agency's confidential communications with third parties would run afoul of the deliberative process privilege, so too disclosure of the identities of the persons with whom the Agency communicated implicates the same concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As to the second reason regarding whether the third parties' identities are generally known, we discern no support for this finding in the record. In\n   opposing Fowler and Gerawan's writ petition in the trial court, the Agency's director of legislation declared the third party communications were received in confidence and disclosure of the communicating parties \"would very likely cause retaliation in the form of harassment and ostracization from the representatives'\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   supporters.\" Although Fowler and Gerawan filed a reply to the Agency's opposition, their reply does not contradict the assertion that the parties' communicated confidentially. And none of the parties' communications with the trial court prior to its September 30, 2016 letter order asserted that any identities of the third parties were known. Consequently, the record does not support the trial court's finding that the identities of the persons with whom the Agency communicated confidentially were already known.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We reject as inapposite Fowler and Gerawan's reliance on the California Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    City of San Jose v.

(\u00a7 15556.) The materials submitted by Legislative Counsel to the Agency regarding AB 1513 comprised \"impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories\" that are protected by the attorney work product privilege.

The separation of the executive branch into agencies and departments is for the convenience of the Governor and does not warrant the denial of the attorney-client privilege for communications with Legislative Counsel made at the request of the Governor. Section 15556 expressly\n   vests the authority of the Governor in the Agency's secretary when coordinating with other governmental agencies. Thus, the Agency received communications and documents from Legislative Counsel regarding AB 1513 in the context of an attorney-client relationship that gives rise to the work product privilege. ( \u00a7 10207, subd. (b)(1) ; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2018.030, subd. (a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The trial court erred in concluding the Agency waived any attorney work product privilege by sharing documents with Legislative Counsel. The record does not show the Agency submitted documents to Legislative Counsel. Instead, the record shows Legislative Counsel sent drafts of AB 1513, legal opinions, and recommendations to the Agency on a confidential basis. There is no indication the Agency forwarded the documents received from Legislative Counsel to third parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the trial court's finding of waiver depends solely on Legislative Counsel's submission of documents to\n   the Agency.

Unlike\n   <em>\n    OXY Resources\n   </em>\n   , which involved the question of documents exchanged between co-defendants, this case involves the receipt of work product by the client from the client's legal counsel.

The record does not indicate conduct that can be construed as a waiver of the work product privilege in the absence of a showing Legislative Counsel disclosed the work product to any person or entity other than its client, the Agency.
