In connection with the briefs that the parties will file in this matter, the parties are directed to include and address the following: (1) If, on remand and in conjunction with continuing pretrial proceedings, the prosecution lists the victim as a witness who will testify at trial (see Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1054.1, subd. (a) ; 1054.7) and if the materiality of the sought communications is shown, does the trial court have authority, pursuant to statutory and/or inherent power to control litigation before it and to insure fair proceedings, to order the victim witness (or any other listed witness), on pain of sanctions, to either (a) comply with a subpoena served on him or her, seeking disclosure of the sought communications subject to in camera review and any appropriate protective or limiting conditions, or (b) consent to disclosure by provider Facebook subject to in camera review and any appropriate protective or limiting conditions? (2) Would a court order under either (1)(a) or (1)(b) be valid under the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C., section 2702(b)(3) ? (3) Assuming orders described in (1) cannot properly be issued and enforced in conjunction with continuing pretrial proceedings, does the trial court have authority, on an appropriate showing during trial, to issue and enforce such orders? (4) Would a court order contemplated under (3) be proper under the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C., section 2702(b)(3) ? With regard to questions (1)-(4), see, e.g., O'Grady v. Superior Court (2006) <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4005941\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/139/1423/\">139 Cal.App.4th 1423</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2072\">44 Cal.Rptr.3d 72</extracted-citation> ; Juror Number One v.

(5) As an alternative to options (1) or (3) set forth above, may the trial court, acting pursuant to statutory and/or inherent authority to control the litigation before it and to insure fair proceedings, and consistently with 18 U.S.C. section 2702(b)(3), order the prosecution to issue a search warrant under 18 U.S.C. section 2703 regarding the sought communications?
