Finding no error, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On November 18, 2016, the People filed a complaint against defendant Adam Arter, alleging two counts: Count 1, a misdemeanor violation of Harbors and Navigations Code section 655(b), operating a vessel while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, Count 2, a misdemeanor violation of section 655(c), operating a vessel at .08 BAC or above, and Count 3, a misdemeanor violation of section 655.2, for speeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 20, 2017, defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence, which the trial court denied on March 16, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 29, 2017, defendant filed a timely notice of appeal from the denial of the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the facts adduced at the suppression hearing:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 24, 2016, Officer Sergeant (\"officer\") Sam Machado detained the occupants of a boat on the Sacramento River in Yolo County, including defendant Adam Arter, for speeding. Mr. Arter initially denied having consumed any alcohol. The officer asked if he could see defendant's eyes and saw smooth pursuit and max deviation (nystagmus) in defendant's left eye. Defendant continued to deny consuming alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During this detention, the officer asked if Mr. Arter would submit to a breath test, to which Mr. Arter agreed and provided a sample of .079% blood alcohol content (BAC) at around 4:00 p.m. After obtaining this initial breath sample, the officer requested that Mr. Arter perform field sobriety tests to ensure that he was safe to operate the vessel. Defendant performed the finger to nose test, hand pat, and finger count test in a manner that suggested that he was impaired. The officer detected an odor of alcohol coming from\n   defendant's person, and then defendant admitted consuming two pints of beer 45 minutes to one hour before that. The officer asked defendant if defendant thought he could drive a vehicle under his condition, and he replied that he could not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As part of the field sobriety tests, the officer requested that Mr. Arter submit to another preliminary breath test, explaining that it would be another field sobriety test. The officer explained that if Mr. Arter were arrested, the preliminary breath test would not be in place of an evidentiary breath test. Mr. Arter submitted to the preliminary breath test with a reading of .094% BAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the administration of the preliminary alcohol screen test, the officer placed Mr. Arter under arrest and obtained two evidentiary breath samples from him. In requesting that Mr. Arter provide evidentiary samples, the officer read him an advisement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-17\">\n   You have been arrested for a BUI. I'm requesting that you submit to a chemical test of your breath or blood. You have the right to refuse, but that refusal may be used against you in a court as an admission of guilt. If you refuse, I will submit a blood warrant affidavit to a judge. If approved, I will then forcefully take a sample of your blood for evidentiary analysis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   These samples came back at .08% and .09%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the conclusion of the motion to suppress hearing, defendant's counsel argued that there was no legal justification for three warrantless searches: the preliminary breath sample of .094% obtained before arrest as part of the field sobriety tests and the two evidentiary breath samples obtained after arrest. When the preliminary breath test came back at .079%, the court stated that \"everything after that was an appropriate investigation in to [sic] whether he was at .08 or above.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Regarding the two evidentiary breath tests, the court reasoned, \"there is no question that he was going to give the blood test, whether he was coerced in to [sic] it by a bad advisement or he was-a chemical test, I should say, whether he was coerced in to [sic] it by a bad advisement or coerced in to [sic] it by way of a search warrant for blood, it was going to happen, at that point, because there was probable cause to arrest by then.\" When asked by defendant's counsel if the court's ruling was that the doctrine of inevitable discovery applied, the court responded, \"he's going to submit anyway, whether it was by a bad advisement or by warrant. The chemical test was going to be conducted.\" The court declined to opine whether the legal doctrine of inevitable discovery applied, merely stating, \"I don't know what else that means except they were going to get a chemical sample out of him. They could coerce by a bad advisement or they can coerce him by a search warrant that says, here the judge says you have to do it. They were going to get it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Defendant filed an opening brief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    The People filed a respondent's brief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Defendant filed a reply brief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      DISCUSSION\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <strong>\n     A.

In the first step the trial court must \"find the facts\" relating to the challenged search or seizure: e.g., it must decide what the officer actually perceived, or knew, or believed, and what action he took in response. These are traditional questions of fact, and the statute vests the superior court with the power to decide them. ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5, subd. (i).) Accordingly, we reaffirmed in\n    <em>\n     Lawler\n    </em>\n    ( at p. 160 [\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2013\">\n     107 Cal.Rptr. 13\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=507%20P.2d%20621\">\n     507 P.2d 621\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ] ) that for the purpose of finding those facts \"the power to judge the credibility of the witnesses, resolve any conflicts in the testimony, weigh the evidence and draw factual inferences, is vested in the trial court. On appeal all presumptions favor the exercise of that power, and the trial court's findings on such matters, whether express or implied, must be upheld if they are supported by substantial evidence.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    No less important, however, is the second step of the process. As we observed in\n    <em>\n     Lawler\n    </em>\n    , \"The trial court also has the duty to decide whether, on the facts found, the search was unreasonable within the meaning of the Constitution.\" (\n    <em>\n     Ibid\n    </em>\n    . ) Because \"that issue is a question of law,\" the appellate court is not bound by the substantial evidence standard in reviewing the trial court's decision thereon. Rather, we explained, in such review it is \"the ultimate responsibility of the appellate court to measure the facts, as found by the trier, against the constitutional standard of reasonableness.\" (\n    <em>\n     Ibid\n    </em>\n    . ) On that issue, in short, the appellate court exercises its independent judgment.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    An appellate court implies \"all findings necessary to support the judgment, and [its] review is limited to whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support these implied findings.\" (\n    <em>\n     People v. Francis\n    </em>\n    (2002)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1079941\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/98/873/#p878\">\n     98 Cal.App.4th 873\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 878,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2090\">\n     120 Cal.Rptr.2d 90\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) The doctrine of implied findings requires the appellate court to infer the trial court made all factual findings necessary to support the judgment. (\n    <em>\n     Sammis v. Stafford\n    </em>\n    (1996)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6045254\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/48/1935/#p1942\">\n     48 Cal.App.4th 1935\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1942,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20589\">\n     56 Cal.Rptr.2d 589\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) The doctrine is a natural and logical corollary to three fundamental principles of appellate review: (1) a judgment is presumed correct; (2) all intendments and presumptions are indulged in favor of correctness; and (3) the appellant bears the burden of providing an adequate record affirmatively proving error.

As in all cases involving reasonable searches incident to arrest, a warrant is not required. (\n    <em>\n     Birchfield v.

One motorist agreed to a roadside breath test but, after his arrest, refused a blood test, and was convicted of a misdemeanor under a state statute making refusal to take a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) test a crime under the state's implied consent law. A second motorist refused to take a breath test at the police station after his arrest, and was charged with test refusal in the first degree. A third motorist was arrested and taken to a hospital where he consented to have his blood drawn, but later argued that his consent to the blood test was coerced by the officer's warning that refusal to consent would be a crime. The Supreme Court held: (a) a warrantless breath test conducted as a search incident to arrest does not violate the Fourth Amendment; (b) a warrantless blood test conducted as a search incident to arrest violates the Fourth Amendment, absent exigent circumstances; and (c) a driver cannot be subjected to a criminal penalty for refusal to take a blood test.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Breath tests do not \"implicat[e] significant privacy concerns,\" even though they involve putting a mouthpiece into the mouth and blowing out air\n    from deep in the lungs. Like using swabs to obtain DNA samples or scraping under fingernails, these tests involve a negligible intrusion. (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    ., at p. 2176.) They take only one bit of information and do not leave any biological sample in the possession of the police. (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at p. 2177.) And they do not increase the embarrassment inherent in an arrest. They are usually administered in a police station, a patrol car, or otherwise out of public view. In any event, one under arrest has a diminished expectation of privacy.

Defendant\n    takes the position that\n    <em>\n     Birchfield\n    </em>\n    does not apply to this case because it is a boating under the influence case, not a driving under the influence case. We found an Iowa Supreme Court case which rejects defendant's contention. (\n    <em>\n     State v.

We follow it as persuasive authority and uphold the constitutionality of the two breath samples.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The Iowa Supreme Court considered a defendant's argument that\n    <em>\n     Birchfield\n    </em>\n    's holding should not apply to boating under the influence cases:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    Pettijohn argues applying the balancing test the Birchfield Court used to determine whether the search-incident-to-arrest exception applies to arrests for drunk driving yields a different result in the context of drunk boating for two reasons. First, he argues the individual interest at stake in the boating context is more significant than in the driving context because a person has a natural right to navigate state waterways and does not need a license to operate a boat. Second, he argues the government interest in preventing drunk boating is far less compelling than the government interest in preventing drunk driving. (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at p. 19.)\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Pettijohn\n    </em>\n    court rejected the defendant's arguments:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n    We reject this analysis. First, in determining whether the search-incident-to-arrest exception to the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches applies, the individual interest to be assessed is the degree to which a warrantless search will intrude upon his or her privacy interests. Second, though government statistics indicate drunk boating causes far fewer annual fatalities than drunk driving, we conclude the government interest in preventing and deterring injuries and fatalities is similar in the drunk driving and the drunk boating contexts. Though we acknowledge government statistics suggest drunk boating causes far fewer annual fatalities than drunk driving, alcohol is the leading known contributing factor in both fatal boating accidents and fatal motor vehicle accidents.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    Applying Birchfield, we conclude the Fourth Amendment permits the administration of a warrantless breath test to determine the BAC of an\n    individual lawfully arrested on suspicion of boating while intoxicated. The BAC test at issue in this case was a breath test rather than a blood test, and Officer Drish administered it after reading an implied-consent advisory to Pettijohn following his lawful arrest. Therefore, we conclude the breath test constituted a search incident to arrest excepted from the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement under Birchfield.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    While the court in\n    <em>\n     Pettijohn\n    </em>\n    concluded that the breath test was not constitutional under the Iowa state constitution, its reasoning still applies here because we are concerned here with whether the breath samples implicate constitutional concerns under the Fourth Amendment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The two breath tests were constitutionally obtained under\n    <em>\n     Birchfield\n    </em>\n    .
