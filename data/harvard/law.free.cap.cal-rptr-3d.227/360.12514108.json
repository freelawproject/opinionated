BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 5, 2015, San Pablo Police Department Officer Niemi was patrolling the 1600 block of 16th Street in San Pablo and determined that an Acura parked on the street had been stolen. Appellant, who was driving the Acura, pulled it away from the curb and into the middle of a caravan of three cars. Officer Niemi followed in his marked patrol car as the cars in the caravan each stopped at a stop sign and turned right onto Bush Avenue, travelling westbound. The cars stopped again at a stop sign at the intersection of Bush Avenue and Rumrill Boulevard. Niemi pulled his patrol car into the eastbound lane of Bush Avenue facing against traffic so he could get a better visual of the stolen Acura, and stopped next to the third (last) car of the caravan. He got out and stood next to his driver's side door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Officers Hearn and Dimercurio arrived on the scene in separate marked patrol cars. Traveling in the opposite direction in the eastbound lane of Bush Avenue, Hearn stopped his patrol car parallel to the first of the three vehicles in the caravan, a red SUV, then got out and stood inside his open driver's side door. There appeared to be about seven to eight feet of space between Hearn's patrol car and the red SUV. Dimercurio parked behind Hearn's vehicle and got out, and all of the officers activated the lights of their patrol cars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Hearn pointed his gun at appellant and shouted commands at him. Appellant looked to the left and right, turned his steering wheel to the left, stepped on the gas pedal and, accelerating to about 20 to 25 miles per hour, drove the Acura through the gap between Officer Hearn's patrol car and the SUV. Officer Niemi saw the left front fender of the Acura strike the driver's door of Hearn's patrol car as Hearn \"turned his back towards the vehicle and pushed himself up against the frame of the car as the driver door closed on his body.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Hearn fired several shots at appellant, and the Acura came to rest after driving over a curb and hitting a chain link fence. One of the shots hit appellant in the head and appellant lost an eye as a result. Hearn was not injured during the incident, and no documented repairs were made to the patrol car he was driving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district attorney filed a petition under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602, subdivision (a), alleging appellant should be continued as a ward of the juvenile court based on his commission of three offenses: (1) assault with a deadly weapon upon a peace officer under section 245, subdivision (c) ; (2) assault upon a peace officer by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury under section 245, subdivision (c) ; and (3) taking or driving a vehicle without the owner's permission under Vehicle Code section 10851, subdivision (a). Both assault counts were based on the act of driving the stolen Acura toward Officer Hearn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the contested jurisdictional hearing, appellant presented evidence designed to show there was no assault against Officer Hearn because the Acura did not actually strike the door of his patrol car and because there had been \"ample room\" for the Acura to safely pass between the patrol car and the red SUV. The trial court found all three counts true, stating \"[t]he evidence is abundantly clear that [appellant] jerked the steering wheel to the left and\n   accelerated, and there's no way that action could point at anything else but directly at Officer He[a]rn as he accelerated. [\u00b6] He then adjusted, it appears, and may have tried to go through the gap, but in that first second, he was pointed directly at officer He[a]rn with a weapon that is a deadly weapon and\n   with [the] ability to cause great bodily injury. In that moment, the assault was committed. [\u00b6] .... [\u00b6] I don't know whether he struck that door, and there's different arguments that can be made. But I'm absolutely convinced that he came very close to the door the officer was behind.\" Appellant was committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice for a maximum period of six years eight months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Section 245(c) Describes a Single Offense\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Section 245, subdivision (c), provides, \"Any person who commits an assault with a deadly weapon or instrument, other than a firearm, or by any means likely to produce great bodily injury upon the person of a peace officer or firefighter, and who knows or reasonably should know that the victim is a peace officer or firefighter engaged in the performance of his or her duties, when the peace officer is engaged in the performance of his or her duties, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for three, four, or five years.\" Appellant was found to have committed one count of assault with a deadly weapon under section 245, subdivision (c), and one count of assault by means of force likely to cause great bodily injury under section 245, subdivision (c), based on the same act of driving the stolen Acura toward Officer Hearn. Appellant argues that only one count should have been found true because section 245, subdivision (c), defines a single offense of aggravated assault, which is committed when the defendant uses a deadly weapon other than a firearm\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   some other means likely to produce great bodily injury. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Section 954 provides in relevant part, \"An accusatory pleading may charge two or more different offenses connected together in their commission, or different statements of the same offense or two or more different offenses of the same class of crimes or offenses, under separate counts. ... The prosecution is not required to elect between the different offenses or counts set forth in the accusatory pleading, but the defendant may be convicted of any number of the offenses charged.\" Recently, our Supreme Court held \"[t]he most reasonable construction of the language in section 954 is that the statute authorizes multiple convictions for different or distinct offenses, but does not permit multiple convictions for a different statement of the same offense when it is based on the same act or course of conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

The court considered whether he could be properly convicted of both oral copulation of an unconscious person under\n   section 288a, subdivision (f), and oral copulation of an intoxicated person under section 288a, subdivision (i). The court concluded the answer was yes.

Key to this result was the structure of section 288a, in which subdivision (a) defined oral copulation in general terms and the remaining subdivisions \"define various ways the act may be criminal. Each subdivision sets forth all the elements of a crime, and each prescribes a specific punishment. Not all of these punishments are the same. That each subdivision of section 288a was drafted to be self-contained supports the view that each describes an independent offense, and therefore section 954 is no impediment to a defendant's conviction under more than one such subdivision for a single act.\" (\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   , at p. 539,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=179%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%201\">\n    179 Cal.Rptr.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=335%20P.3d%201083\">\n    335 P.3d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    People v.

(Stats. 2011, ch. 183, \u00a7 1.) The reason for the change was to make it easier going forward to determine whether a defendant's prior convictions for aggravated assault under section 245, subdivision (a), involved conduct subjecting the defendant to certain recidivist provisions, because enhancements such as the Three Strikes law applied to prior assault convictions only when those convictions involved the use of a deadly weapon.
