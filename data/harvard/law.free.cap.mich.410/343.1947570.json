The objects in this class are not only exclusively weapons, but are weapons used almost exclusively in perpetration of crime. Finding the language at issue in a statute dealing with such a narrow class of weapons is a strong indication that the Legislature intended to reach only gas-ejecting <em>weapons.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">This impression is bolstered by examining related statutes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> When the Legislature amended the statute to include the language dealing with gas-ejecting devices, it was faced with the choice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>including it in 1927 PA 372, \u00a7 3, which made the manufacture, sale or possession of the listed objects a strict-liability offense, or in \u00a7 4, which required an intent to use the objects there listed \"unlawfully against the person of another\u201d. MCL 750.226; MSA 28.423. The Legislature chose to include the language in the section making possession a strict-liability offense. Its choice indicates that it thought of gas-ejecting devices not only as weapons, but as weapons of such danger as to merit their prohibition regardless of the intent of the possessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Further, the title to the 1929 statute adding the gas-ejecting-device language indicates that the Legislature was concerned with weapons:<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">\"An Act to regulate and license the selling, purchasing, possessing and carrying of certain firearms; to prohibit the buying, selling or carrying of certain firearms without a license therefor; to prohibit the possession, manufacture or sale of certain <em>weapons, </em>including gas ejecting or emitting <em>weapons, </em>and attachments, except by certain persons licensed to manufacture, sell or possess any gas ejecting or emitting weapon, cartridge or device * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Contemporaneous construction of the statute is also of assistance. A 1931 decision, <em>People v Brown,</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>considered a constitutional challenge to the statute. While that challenge was based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>right to bear arms and was asserted by a defendant convicted of carrying a blackjack, this Court found it necessary to assess the nature of the items which the Legislature intended to prohibit to decide whether the provision was within the police power of the state. That characterization of the intended subject matter of the statute is of precedential significance here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">\"The list of weapons in [1929 Compiled Laws] \u00a7 16751 * * * is significant and demonstrates a definite intention of the legislature to protect society from a recognized menace. It does not include ordinary guns, swords, revolvers, or other weapons usually relied upon by good citizens for defense or pleasure. It is a partial inventory of the arsenal of the 'public enemy\u2019, the 'gangster\u2019. It describes some of the particular weapons with which he wars on the State and reddens his murderous trail.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">It was thus decided in 1931 that the statute dealt with weapons \u2014 weapons of such danger and malevolent associations as to merit total eradication from society, with narrow, licensed exceptions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We see no reason to depart from that decision today.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Lynch was carrying in his pocket \"some spray stuff like the mailman would carry\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\"make people cough\u201d.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> These facts, adduced by the trial judge during Lynch\u2019s plea-taking proceeding, are such as would allow a trier of fact to reasonably draw the inference that Lynch was attempting to carry a gas-ejecting weapon. There was therefore an adequate factual basis for accepting his guilty plea.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">An indication that such small, hand-held gas-ejecting weapons are within the intended prohibition of the statute is provided by an opinion issued by the Attorney General in 1932.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> That opinion states that a \"gas pen\u201d could be licensed only to equip certain premises or vehicles and not to be carried on one\u2019s person as a concealed weapon.

A separate question would be presented, however, if circumstances occurring since the statute\u2019s en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>actment have added a gloss to the literal meaning of the statute\u2019s terms so that a reasonable citizen might doubt that gas-ejecting weapons of the kind Lynch attempted to carry were in fact within the compass of the statute\u2019s prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">I write separately to suggest that had the record been developed with evidence establishing such circumstances, which appear to be present in this case, there would be a substantial question whether Lynch had fair notice of the statute\u2019s prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The statute focuses on weapons in the arsenal of the professional criminal, weapons used primarily to commit crimes. While gas-ejecting weapons may have been of this character in 1929 when the pertinent provision was enacted, it is not at all clear that they are of this character today. It may be that they are currently as likely to be found in a woman\u2019s purse or a mailman\u2019s pouch as in the hands of a criminal bent on mayhem.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">This change in the character of a device cannot, of course, create an exception to a valid statute. Where, however, the device takes on a character unlike that of the devices prohibited so that a citizen might doubt that his device is of the kind the statute intended to prohibit, and where that doubt is reinforced, or indeed caused, by lack of prosecution in the face of the open and common sale and possession of the device, the doubt a reasonable citizen might feel as to whether his device is actually one which the statute prohibits may be such that the citizen is deprived of the clear warning that due process requires. A criminal statute must give fair notice to an ordinary citizen that his contemplated conduct is forbidden,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>for \"[n]o one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\">\"A penal enactment which is linguistically clear, but has been notoriously ignored by both its administrators and the community for an unduly extended period, imparts no more fair notice of its proscriptions than a statute which is phrased in vague terms. Though the language of a desuetudenal act may be clear, 'the hardened gloss life has written upon it\u2019 will seem to the individual a 'tougher and truer law than the dead words of the written text.\u2019 In this situation, a rational choice between statute and the 'living law\u2019 of both community and state becomes insuperably difficult and dangerous for the spectator.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">I have not been able to discover any record of a prosecution, before Lynch, for the sale or possession of a gas-ejecting device since the provision was enacted over 50 years ago.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">1 do not suggest that prosecutorial non-use, changed circumstances or pervasive public disobedience may operate to repeal or modify a valid enactment. Repeal or modification is the province of the Legislature. If circumstances and public opinion have changed so as to make it now appropriate that citizens be allowed to carry gas-ejecting weapons for self-defense, it is for the Legislature to so declare, as it recently has in limited fashion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The question suggested here is not whether nonenforcement can cause a statute to lapse into desue<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>tude and thereby become constitutionally unenforceable, but rather whether a combination of the circumstances described can operate to deprive a person of the requisite clarity of notice that his conduct is forbidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The statute appears to be drawn to reach a narrow class of particularly dangerous and crime-oriented weapons. The device Lynch carried might not appear, in the minds of today\u2019s populace, to be part of that narrow class. The common public sale of these devices without response from law enforcement officials would naturally add to the doubt that these devices are such as the statute prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">This situation is similar to that presented to the United States Supreme Court in <em>Poe v Ullman.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In that case, the plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment of the unconstitutionality of two Connecticut statutes which made it illegal to use contraceptives or to be an accessory to such use. A majority of the Court concluded that the question was not ripe for decision, with three Justices joining an opinion by Justice Frankfurter basing that conclusion on the almost complete lack of prosecutions during the statutes\u2019 75-year existence despite the open sale of contraceptives throughout the state. Justice Frankfurter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">\"We were advised by counsel for appellants that contraceptives are commonly and notoriously sold in Connecticut drug stores. Yet no prosecutions are recorded; and certainly such ubiquitous, open, public sales would more quickly invite the attention of enforcement officials than the conduct in which the present appellants wish to engage \u2014 the giving of private medical advice by a doctor to his individual patients, and their private use of the devices prescribed. The undeviating policy of nullification by Connecticut of its anti-contra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>ceptive laws throughout all the long years that they have been on the statute books bespeaks more than prosecutorial paralysis. What was said in another context is relevant here. 'Deeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy * * *\u2019 \u2014 or not carrying it out \u2014 'are often tougher and truer law than the dead words of the written text.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">As the circumstances in <em>Poe </em>went beyond mere prosecutorial paralysis to suggest a truer law than the dead letter of the statute, so the circumstances which appear to be present here might have added a gloss to the words of the statute, giving them a truer meaning than literalism would convey, and creating doubt in the minds of ordinary persons sufficient to obfuscate an otherwise fair warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Moreover, the apparent increased acceptance and use of gas-ejecting devices by law-abiding citizens precludes reliance upon the nature of the offense itself to provide notice of the probable illegality of the conduct. This would distinguish <em>United States v </em>Elliott,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> where the court found that the 50-year non-use of a statute was not a defense to prosecution under the statute for conspiring to destroy a bridge in Zambia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">\"However, [the] statute does not penalize conduct which, through a long period of non-enforcement, has acquired the status of customary usage, nor has opprobrium for the act been suddenly revived. Conspiring to destroy a bridge is not, and never has been, permitted by community mores.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Here, there appears to have been a shift in \"community mores\u201d: the tool of the \"gangster\u201d may well have become a weapon \"usually relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>upon by good citizens for defense\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The shift has apparently been encouraged or at least reinforced by a uniform lack of prosecution in the face of open and widespread availability. A combination of these factors, if proven, could have deprived Lynch of the requisite clarity of notice that his conduct was prohibited. The failure to develop the record with such evidence, however, precludes us from granting relief on this basis.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-9\"> <em>United States v Harriss, </em>347 US 612, 617; 74 S Ct 808; 98 L Ed 989 (1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\"> <em>Lanzetta v New Jersey, </em>306 US 451, 453; 59 S Ct 618; 83 L Ed 888 (1939).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\"> Bonfield, <em>The Abrogation of Penal Statutes by Nonenforcement, </em>49 Iowa L Rev 389, 416 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b449-9\"> At least two prosecutions have been brought since Lynch was charged. <em>People v Guy, </em>84 Mich App 610; 270 NW2d 662 (1978); <em>People v Stinson, </em>88 Mich App 672; 278 NW2d 715 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b449-10\"> See footnote 8 of the opinion of the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b450-9\"> Poe <em>v Ullman, </em>367 US 497; 81 S Ct 1752; 6 L Ed 2d 989 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b451-8\"> <em>Id., </em>p 502, quoting <em>Nashville C &amp; SL R Co v Browning, </em>310 US 362, 369; 60 S Ct 968; 84 L Ed 1254 (1940).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b451-9\"> <em>United States v Elliott, </em>266 F Supp 318 (SD NY, 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b451-10\"> <em>Id., </em>p 326.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b452-6\"> <em>People v Brown, </em>253 Mich 537, 542; 235 NW 245 (1931).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
