The trial judge issued a written opinion on the motion on July 14, 1977. On August 24, 1977, a judgment was entered giving effect to the July 14th decision which provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">\"The court further finds that no proofs have been submitted by plaintiffs other than the decedent\u2019s gross pay, as to the amount of contributions of tangible things of economic value that dependents of the deceased at the time of his death would have received for support during their dependency from the deceased if he had not suffered the accidental bodily injury causing death, and finds that as a matter of law defendant under the provisions of its policy and \u00a7 3108 of the no-fault act owes said dependents the sum of $806 per month, said sum being the gross pay of decedent at the time of his death, no deduction being allowable for taxes or personal consumption of the deceased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">\"The court further finds as a matter of law that after the remarriage of the widow on June 25, 1976, and until January 10, 1979, said defendant shall pay to each dependent child the sum of $403 per month.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The foregoing provisions of the August 24 judgment were subsequently incorporated into the trial court\u2019s final judgment which was entered on January 24, 1978, after a trial on other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">State Farm appealed to the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>which affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling that, on the record presented in this case, survivors\u2019 loss benefits were to be calculated solely on the basis of the decedent\u2019s gross income, there having been no evidence offered by the plaintiffs as to other sources of \"contributions of tangible things of economic value\u201d to their support by their decedent. However, the Court of Appeals disagreed with the trial court\u2019s ruling that no \"personal consumption factor\u201d should be deducted from the decedent\u2019s gross pay in determining the amount of survivors\u2019 loss benefits payable under \u00a7 3108 and reversed on that point. The Court of Appeals did not discuss the trial court\u2019s ruling concerning the effect of the decedent\u2019s widow\u2019s remarriage on the amount of survivors\u2019 loss benefits which would thereafter be payable to the decedent\u2019s remaining surviving dependents, <em>Miller v State Farm Ins Co, </em>88 Mich App 175; 276 NW2d 873 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">Both the plaintiffs and the defendant then filed separate applications for leave to appeal in this Court.

The benefits payable for survivors\u2019 loss in connection with the death of a person in a single 30-day period shall not exceed $1,000.00 and is <em>[sic] </em>not payable beyond the first 3 years after the date of the accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">It is clear that survivors\u2019 loss benefits consist of two distinct elements:</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">(1) a loss, after the deceased\u2019s death, of contributions of tangible things of economic value, not including services, that the deceased\u2019s dependents would have received for support had he not died; and</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">(2) expenses not exceeding $20 per day, reasonably incurred by the deceased\u2019s dependents after his death, in obtaining ordinary and necessary services in lieu of those that the deceased would have performed for his dependents\u2019 benefit had he not died.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">The issue here concerns the correct method of calculation of the first of these elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">There is no dispute that the plaintiffs were dependents of the deceased at the time of his death,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and therefore entitled to survivors\u2019 loss benefits. It is also undisputed that Carl Saltzman\u2019s entire contribution to his dependents\u2019 support of \"tangible things of economic value\u201d was from his income from wages alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">State Farm contends that, in this case, survi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>vors\u2019 loss benefits should equal the deceased\u2019s after tax \"take home\u201d (or net) pay less the amount of the deceased\u2019s personal expenses which are avoided by reason of his death, since it is that amount which the surviving dependents actually would have received for their support from Mr. Saltzman had he lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">The plaintiffs respond that the trial court was correct in ruling that in this case the total survivors\u2019 loss benefits is an amount equal to the deceased\u2019s gross pay, without any adjustment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The Court of Appeals held that the survivors\u2019 loss benefits in this case should be based on the decedent\u2019s gross pay, without adjustment for taxes that would have been paid, less an amount characterized as a \"consumption factor\u201d reflecting the decedent\u2019s personal expenses that are avoided by the surviving dependents by reason of their insured\u2019s death. 88 Mich App 175; 276 NW2d 873 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">We disagree with the lower courts\u2019 analyses and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">\n<em>In the calculation of survivors\u2019, loss benefits under \u00a7 3108, what is to be considered in determining the amount of \"contributions of tangible things of economic value\u201d that the surviving dependents of the deceased would have received for support had the deceased lived?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>In answering that question, our obligation is to discover and give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intention in enacting \u00a7 3108 as best we can determine it from the language employed in \u00a7 3108 and the no-fault act as a whole, and in light of such legislative history as is available. See <em>Production Credit Ass\u2019n of Lansing v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>404 Mich 301, 311; 273 NW2d 10 (1978); <em>Lansing v Lansing Twp, </em>356 Mich 641; 97 NW2d 804 (1959). It is therefore necessary to examine that history in order to determine how the Legislature intended no-fault \u201csurvivors\u2019 loss\u201d benefits to be measured. See <em>Ballinger v Smith, </em>328 Mich 23, 30-31; 43 NW2d 49 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">We turn first to an analysis of the language of the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Of primary significance in the analysis is the determination of what is meant by the expression \"contributions of tangible things of economic value\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 3108.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Assigning to the words used in \u00a7 3108 their primary and generally understood meaning, it would appear uncontrovertible that the dollar amount of survivors\u2019 loss benefits must include the amount the survivors \u201cwould have received for [their own individual] support\u201d had Mr. Saltzman not died. That suggests that the amount to be paid them is determined merely by ascertaining first of all the total amount of \u201ctangible things of economic value\u201d which constituted the family\u2019s gross \"income\u201d for a stated period and deducting therefrom such amounts as were required to be expended for all purposes other than their support and which, by reason of such requirement, would not have been available for their support. Nothing in the language of \u00a7 3108 suggests that the fund of \"tangible things of economic value\u201d is limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>wages. In today\u2019s complex economic system, the \"tangible things of economic value\u201d which many persons contribute to the support of their dependents include hospital and medical insurance benefits, disability coverage, pensions, investment income, annuity income and other benefits. Had it been the intent of the Legislature to limit survivors\u2019 benefits to a sum equal to what eligible dependents would have received from wages and salary alone, it could be expected to have said so. It chose instead the far broader category of \"contributions of tangible things of economic value\u201d which, on its face, suggests the inclusion of benefits derived for family support from other and different sources. Our conclusion to that effect is fortified by consideration of the history of the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Section 3108 was derived from Senate Bill No. 782 of 1971<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the corresponding House Substitute for Senate Bill No. 782.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is apparent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the relevant provisions of those bills were based, in turn, upon provisions contained in the Motor Vehicle Basic Protection Insurance Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (MVBPIA) and the Uniform Motor Vehicle Accident Reparations Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (UMVARA) respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>In view of the Legislatur\u00e9\u2019s obvious reliance upon the relevant sections of the model acts, it is evident that it was cognizant of, and in agreement with, the policies which underlie the model acts\u2019 language.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The authors\u2019 comments on \u00a7 1.9(e) of the MVBPIA, which is in substance identical to \u00a7 9 of Senate Bill 782, are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">\"In paragraph [\u00a7 1.9](e), 'survivors\u2019 loss\u2019 is defined in a way somewhat similar to standards for damages under death acts, but with a more rigorous adherence to genuine economic loss than under most death acts. For example, loss of services of the deceased is not an allowable item itself; rather, the allowable item of this general nature is limited to 'expenses reasonably incurred * * * in obtaining ordinary and necessary services in lieu of those that the deceased would have performed for their [the survivors\u2019] benefit had he not suffered the injury causing death.\u2019 \u201d Keeton &amp; O\u2019Connell, Basic Protection for the Traffic Victim: A Blueprint for Reforming Automobile Insurance (Little, Brown &amp; Co, 1965), p 400.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Similarly, the pertinent portion of Commissioners\u2019 Comments to \u00a7\u00a7 l(a)(5)(iv) and l(a)(5)(v) of the UMVARA, which are in substance identical to \u00a7 3106(2) of the House Substitute, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">\" 'Survivor\u2019s economic loss\u2019 and 'survivor\u2019s replacement services loss\u2019 are defined in a way analogous to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>standards for damages for wrongful death except that, as is the case for 'work loss\u2019 and 'replacement services loss,\u2019 allowable items are more rigorously limited to genuine economic loss. As under typical wrongful death statutes, the measure of damages is loss to the survivors which results from death. Thus, in calculating benefits, the decedent\u2019s probable life expectancy had he not been injured and the extent to which the survivors would have received contributions of things of economic value or the extent to which the decedent would have performed services for his survivors must be taken into account.\u201d 14 ULA, Civil Procedural and Remedial Laws, Uniform Motor Vehicle Accident Reparations Act, p 55.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Thus, it appears that the Legislature\u2019s use of the language \"contributions of tangible things of economic value\u201d in \u00a7 3108 indicates an intent that survivors\u2019 loss benefits should at least roughly correspond to <em>economic loss </em>damages recoverable under our wrongful death act. MCL 600.2922; MSA 27A.2922.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Under our wrongful death act, a survivor\u2019s recoverable economic losses include, at a minimum, the loss of financial support from the deceased and the loss of services that the survivor would have received from the deceased had he lived. See Wade, ed, The Michigan Law of Damages (Ann Arbor: ICLE, 1978), Part 2, pp 2-4 \u2014 2-11. These elements of damages are clearly contemplated by \u00a7 3108 of the no-fault act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>To the extent that survivors\u2019 loss benefits are intended to be analogous to wrongful death act economic loss damages, it is important to keep in mind that wrongful death act damages focus upon the financial loss actually incurred by the survivors as a result of their decedent\u2019s death. See 1 Speiser, Recovery for Wrongful Death (2d ed), \u00a7 3:5, pp 136-140. Certainly, the deceased\u2019s wage or salary income is almost always a significant factor in calculating the actual financial loss incurred by the survivors. However, the amount of the loss incurred is not limited to, much less based solely upon, the deceased\u2019s wage or salary income, but includes as well the myriad employment-related fringe benefits and other \"tangible things of economic value\u201d available for dependants\u2019 support described hereinbefore which are not always reflected in wage or salary \"take home pay\u201d. See 1 Speiser, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 3:8, 3:20, pp 147-150, 212-215.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Accordingly, it is our conclusion that the Legislature intended that the measurement of \u00a7 3108 survivors\u2019 loss benefits should include the value of tangible things other than, and in addition to, wages and salary. The dollar value of such items as employer-provided health insurance coverage, pensions, disability benefits, and other tangible things of economic value that are lost to the surviving dependents by reason of the insured\u2019s death must be taken into account. It is apparent then, that in many cases, the total amount of \"contributions of tangible things of economic value\u201d will exceed wage or salary income.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">In the present case, however, the plaintiffs made no allegation and offered no evidence of any contributions to their support made by their decedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>other than his income from wages. We find therefore that, on the pleadings and evidence before us, the lower court properly limited the calculation of the aggregate of the deceased\u2019s contribution of tangible things of economic value to his gross wage income.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">It is next necessary to decide whether the aggregate figure reached with respect to \"contributions of tangible things of economic value\u201d should be reduced by the amount of taxes that would have been paid by the deceased, and further reduced by an amount relating to the deceased\u2019s \"personal consumption factor\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">\n<em>Should the calculation of survivors\u2019 loss bene\u00f1ts under \u00a7 3108 include consideration of the amount of income-related taxes that the deceased would have paid had he lived?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">On this question, the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-11\">\"The defendant contends that since the above statute directs that 'a survivors\u2019 loss * * * consists of * * * contributions * * * that dependents of the deceased * * * <em>would have received for support\u2019 </em>(emphasis supplied), it is properly read to require that the plaintiffs be awarded only the amount of the decedent\u2019s gross wage which would have been available to support the plaintiffs prior to the decedent\u2019s death. While a literal reading of the statute provides some support for the defendant\u2019s construction of \u00a7 3108, a brief analysis of 1972 PA 294, of which \u00a7 3108 was a part, indicates the fallacy in defendant\u2019s argument with respect to the deduction of taxes. Section 3107(b) of the no-fault act, also a part of 1972 PA 294, explicitly provides that 15 percent may be deducted from personal protection in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>surance benefits in certain situations where such benefits 'are not taxable income\u2019. Given the fact that both sections were contained in the same piece of legislation, it is reasonable to assume that had the Legislature intended, in \u00a7 3108, to limit benefits to after-tax income, it would have adopted language similar to that used in \u00a7 3107.\u201d 88 Mich App 180-181.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">We find that the Court of Appeals reliance on the language of \u00a7 3107(b)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the no-fault act was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Section 3107(b) provides for the payment of \"work loss\u201d benefits to an insured who suffers nonfatal injury. The section defines \"work loss\u201d as \"consisting of loss of income from work an injured person would have performed * *</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Thus, work loss benefits are limited, by definition, to the loss of wage or salary income. Work loss benefits are not taxable, while the lost income they replace would be. The tax adjustment language in \u00a7 3107(b) therefore presumably operates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>equitably in all cases where taxable wage or salary income is replaced by \u00a7 3107(b) benefits. As has been discussed in Part II, survivors\u2019 loss benefits encompass the value of items apart from, and in addition to, wage and salary income. In many instances, items that will be included in survivors\u2019 loss benefits will have non-taxable origins. In some cases, the survivors\u2019 loss may involve <em>only </em>nontaxable items. Since survivors\u2019 loss benefits will, in many cases, include the value of items other than taxable wage or salary income, while work loss benefits are limited to wage or salary income, reliance on the language of \u00a7 3107(b) in the construction of \u00a7 3108 is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Of greater significance to the present issue is the language of \u00a73108 that \"a survivors\u2019 loss * * * consists of a loss * * * of contributions of tangible things of economic value * * * that dependents of the deceased * * * <em>would have received </em>for support * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Tax liability associated with income is an inescapable fact of our modern economic life. In measuring the financial loss actually incurred by surviving dependents, it would be unrealistic to fail to acknowledge that surviving dependents would <em>not </em>have received for their support that portion of the deceased\u2019s income that he would have been required to pay in taxes. Moreover, the adjustment for such taxes can be accurately based on readily ascertainable information, without unnecessary administrative delays or time-consuming factual disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">We find that the language of \u00a7 3108 establishes that the Legislature intended that the amount of survivors\u2019 loss benefits should reflect an adjustment made for taxes that the deceased would have paid on taxable items included in the \u00a7 3108 benefit calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>We therefore hold that the lower courts erred in ruling that the calculation of survivors\u2019 loss benefits pursuant to \u00a7 3108 should not include consideration of taxes that the deceased would have paid had he lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">\n<em>Should the calculation of survivors\u2019 loss bene\u00f1ts under \u00a7 3108 include consideration of a \"personal consumption factor\u201d relating to purely personal expenses of the deceased that are avoided by reason of his death?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Relying upon the provision of \u00a7 3l08 that survivors\u2019 loss benefits are payable to a dependent for the loss of such \"tangible things\u201d as the dependent \"would have received for support\u201d but for the decedent\u2019s death, the defendant makes a forceful argument that such fund does not include either the taxes discussed in the previous section or such sums as would have been consumed by the decedent himself for food, recreation, clothing and personal expenses. The bare language of the statute does indeed suggest that meaning. Certainly, if it was the intent of the Legislature, in employing the language chosen, to require that the dollar amount of survivors\u2019 loss benefits be computed by deducting from the \"tangible things of economic value\u201d a \"consumption factor\u201d attributable to the deceased\u2019s personal expenses, we must require application of such a formula. However, there are at least two persuasive indications that despite the apparently plain and simple language of the statute to the effect suggested by defendant, the Legislature did not intend such a \"consumption factor\u201d to be deducted in calculating survivors\u2019 loss benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>The first is the legislative history of the adoption of \u00a7 3108, and the second is the declared purpose of the no-fault act as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">We are aided in discovering legislative intent in enacting any statute by examining the proposed legislation it considered and rejected, contrasted with the provisions as finally adopted. That approach is particularly useful in this instance since there is no record of committee hearings or floor debate available to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">As has been indicated, \u00a7 3108 was enacted after consideration of at least two alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">One alternative was Senate Bill No. 782, which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">\"Sec. 8. Personal protection insurance benefits are payable for a survivors\u2019 loss which consists of a loss, after the date on which the deceased died, of contributions of tangible things of economic value, not including services, that persons who are dependents of the deceased at the time of his death would have received for support during their dependency from the deceased if he had not suffered the accidental bodily injury causing death and expenses reasonably incurred by these dependents during their dependency and after the date on which the deceased died in obtaining ordinary and necessary services in lieu of those that the deceased would have performed for their benefit if he had not suffered the injury causing death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">The other alternative, contained in the House Substitute for Senate Bill No. 782, provided in pertinent part (\u00a7\u00a7 3106[2] and 3106[3]):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-11\">\" 'Survivor\u2019s economic loss\u2019 means after decedent\u2019s death loss of contributions of things of economic value, not including services to his survivors, that his survivors would have received from the decedent had he not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>suffered the injury causing death, <em>less expenses of the survivors avoided by reason of decedent\u2019s death.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\">\" 'Survivor\u2019s replacement services loss\u2019 means expenses reasonably incurred by survivors after decedent\u2019s death in obtaining ordinary and necessary services in lieu of those that decedent would have performed for their benefit had he not suffered the injury causing death, <em>less expenses of the survivors avoided by reason of the decedent\u2019s death </em>and which were not subtracted in calculating survivor\u2019s economic loss.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 5 Mich House J (1972) 1418-1419.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The myriad activities that attend the legislative process having run their course, 1972 PA 294 was enacted containing language consistent with that of Senate Bill No. 782 and <em>without </em>the clause \"less expenses of the survivors avoided by reason of the decedent\u2019s death\u201d which appeared in the House substitute bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">It is logical to conclude that the Legislature eliminated the italicized clause for a reason, and most likely the reason was that it wished to preclude reduction of the amount of' survivors\u2019 loss benefits by the decedent\u2019s \"consumption factor\u201d. We are asked, however, to hold, as did the Court of Appeals, that the Legislature meant in \u00a7 3108 not only what it did not say explicitly, but what it explicitly rejected. We are not inclined to do so. See <em>Wayne County v Auditor General, </em>250 Mich 227, 235-236; 229 NW 911 (1930); <em>People v Adamowski, </em>340 Mich 422, 429; 65 NW2d 753 (1954). See also 2A Sutherland\u2019s Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 48.18, pp 224-225.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The second reason we think the Legislature did not intend that a \"consumption factor\u201d for the decedent\u2019s personal expenses be calculated and deducted from the fund of \"things of tangible value\u201d that the decedent\u2019s dependents would otherwise have received is found in our understand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>ing of the purpose of the no-fault act itself and the manner in which it is intended to be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">In <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 578-579; 267 NW2d 72 (1978), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">\"The goal of the no-fault insurance system was to provide victims of motor vehicle accidents assured, adequate, and prompt reparation for certain economic losses\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The act is designed to minimize administrative delays and factual disputes that would interfere with achievement of the goal of expeditious compensation of damages suffered in motor vehicle accidents. These ends are served, for example, by the act\u2019s provisions for conclusive presumptions of dependency status, MCL 500.3110; MSA 24.13110; for a \"safe\u201d method of payment of benefits by insurers, MCL 500.3112; MSA 24.13112; and for prompt access to earnings records of an injured person in order to facilitate determination of the amount of benefits due, MCL 500.3158; MSA 24.13158. Additionally, while \u00a73108 does not provide for. a deduction for personal expenses of the decedent avoided by reason of his death, it does contain an absolute ceiling on the amount of survivors\u2019 loss benefits for any 30-day period. Thus, \u00a7 3108 itself, and the act as a whole, presumably reflect a balance struck by the Legislature between absolute factual precision in the calculation of benefits and the goal of \"assured, adequate, and prompt reparation for certain economic losses\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Calculation, in every case, of a \"consumption factor\u201d attributable to the decedent\u2019s personal expenses would be inconsistent with the declared legislative purposes of expeditious settlement of survivors\u2019 claims without complex factual controversy;</p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>A family is not run like a commercial enterprise. Family finances are not allocated or their expenditure accounted for as in a business. Accounting procedures are rarely, if ever, followed to account for the precise dollars-and-cents expenses in cash and in kind attributable to each member of the family. How, for example, would the deceased breadwinner\u2019s \"consumption factor\u201d for family meals, use of the family automobile, household maintenance, and hundreds of personal expenses be calculated? And if calculable at all, one can envision the interminable controversy and disproportionate expense such a factual determination would involve. As the plaintiff so aptly put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-4\">\"A legislative purpose of rapid, efficient and uniform claims adjustment is not advanced by a ponderous examination of every family expenditure.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Brief, p 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">In view of the no-fault act\u2019s goal of expeditious reparation of motor vehicle accident injuries, and minimization of potential factual disputes, we conclude that the Legislature\u2019s explicit rejection of the language in the House substitute bill concerning the reduction of survivors\u2019 loss benefits by the decedent\u2019s \"personal consumption factor\u201d evidences an intent that survivors\u2019 loss benefits not be so adjusted. The amount of such a personal consumption factor is likely to be small in most cases, and the administrative delays and factual controversies that might be engendered by such a calculation would unjustifiably interfere with the above-discussed goals of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">We hold that the legislative history of \u00a7 3108, and consideration of the goals of the no-fault act as a whole, lead to the conclusion that the Legislature did not intend that the calculation of \u00a7 3108 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>benefits should include adjustment for the deceased\u2019s \"personal consumption factor\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">We reverse the Court of Appeals ruling and reinstate the judgment of the trial court on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">In summary, we conclude that the Legislature intended that \u00a7 3108 survivors\u2019 loss benefits should be calculated:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">(1) to include all demonstrable \"contributions of tangible things of economic value\u201d including, but not limited to, wages that would have been received as support by the surviving dependents from the deceased but for his death;</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">(2) reduced by an adjustment for the income-related taxes that would have been paid by the decedent on items contributed by him to his dependents\u2019 support;</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">(3) without adjustment for the decedent\u2019s \"personal consumption factor\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">\n<em>Does the remarriage of an insured decedent\u2019s spouse reduce the amount of survivors\u2019 bene\u00f1ts due other dependents under \u00a7 3108?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\">As has been indicated previously, survivors\u2019 loss benefits are payable \"for a survivors\u2019 loss * * * of contributions of tangible things of economic value * * * that <em>dependents of the deceased at the time of his death </em>would have received for support <em>during their dependency * * </em>(Emphasis added.) Such benefits are payable for three years after the date of the accident. MCL 500.3108; MSA 24.13108.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-15\">The emphasized language in \u00a7 3108 and that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>\u00a7 3110(l)(a), which is set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> establishes that dependency status for purposes of survivors\u2019 loss benefits is to be determined by reference to the survivors\u2019 dependency relationship to the deceased at the time of the deceased\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Section 3110(3) establishes that the act contemplates the termination of dependency status upon the occurrence of specified events.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Section 3110(4) declares that survivors\u2019 loss benefits accrue not when the injury occurs, but as the survivors\u2019 loss is incurred.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">When a survivor\u2019s status as a dependent terminates pursuant to \u00a7 3110(3), that survivor\u2019s individual loss is no longer incurred. Accordingly, upon the occurrence of an event specified in \u00a7 3110(3) terminating a survivor\u2019s dependency status, it is necessary to consider an adjustment to the amount of survivors\u2019 loss benefits payable thereafter to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>remaining surviving dependents. This conclusion is buttressed by reference to \u00a7 3112 which expressly considers individual apportionment of, and entitlement to, survivors\u2019 loss benefits, and which provides a mechanism for the resolution of disputes concerning the amount of survivors\u2019 loss benefits due to individual surviving dependents.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">We find that the above-discussed provisions of the no-fault act manifest a legislative intent that survivors\u2019 loss benefits should be appropriately adjusted in the event of the disqualification of a survivor from dependency status. The relevant provisions indicate that the proper method of adjusting survivors\u2019 loss benefits to reflect the termination of a survivor\u2019s dependency status is to recalculate the amount of contributions of tangible things of economic value that the remaining dependents would have received for support from the deceased at the time of his death. That is, the aggregate of survivors\u2019 loss benefits being paid for the benefit of all of the decedent\u2019s survivors prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>to the disqualification of one of them should be reduced only by the amount equal to the contributions of tangible things of economic value that the deceased would have made solely for the benefit of the disqualified dependent. Contributions which benefit the family unit as a whole, as opposed to the disqualified dependent only, would not be affected. For example, the contributions that the deceased would have made toward the family\u2019s shelter in the way of house payments or rent, property taxes, household utility costs, the family car and similar expenses which do not inure to the sole benefit of the disqualified dependent should not be adjusted. Further, the adjustment should be made with reference to the aggregate of contributions of tangible things of economic value at the time of the deceased\u2019s death \u2014 before application of the \u00a7 3108 ceilings. Thus, in a case where the initial determination of survivors\u2019 loss was an amount in excess of the \u00a7 3108 ceilings, and the amount of benefits payable was therefore reduced to the statutory maximum, it will be necessary to determine whether the later disqualification of one of the dependents would result in a reduction of total original survivors\u2019 loss to an amount below the applicable statutory maximum. If not, the insurer would continue to be liable for the statutory maximum after the termination of a survivor\u2019s dependency status.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling concerning the effect of Linda Miller\u2019s remarriage on the amount of survivors\u2019 loss benefits due to the remaining dependent survivors.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In conclusion, to the extent that the lower courts\u2019 decisions are contrary to the foregoing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>analysis, they are reversed. This case is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b664-4\">Fitzgerald and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b664-5\">Williams, J.

The plaintiffs have not alleged or offered evidence of contributions from sources other than wages, and therefore the question is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The no-fault motor vehicle liability act provides for reimbursement of income lost by the injured person or his family as a result of injury. If the injured person survives the accident, the act provides for reimbursement of his own income loss, measured by the amount of wages he loses while he is disabled (\"work loss\u201d). If he does not survive the accident, the act provides for reimbursement of the income lost by his family, measured by the amount they would have received from him for their support.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">The Legislature thus used two different measures for two different situations, work loss consist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>ing of income from work the injured person is unable to perform because of his injury where he survives his injury, and lost contributions to the family\u2019s support where he dies. The primary difference between the two is that wages committed exclusively to the personal expenditures of the injured person are part of work loss but are not part of the amount that would have been contributed for the support of the family. What the injured person would have spent on himself could not have been contributed to his family\u2019s support.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The opinion of the Court concludes that these personal expenditures need not be subtracted from total wages in calculating the amount that the injured person who dies would have contributed to his family\u2019s support. Since this subtraction is typically, and in this case, the only difference between the two measures, the Court effectively erases the distinction drawn by the statute and makes lost wages the measure of income loss in both situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">I dissent because I can see no basis for construing out of the statute a distinction that is clearly there. Had the Legislature intended that lost wages be the measure in both situations, it would not have used two different measures for the two different situations. The rationales advanced by the Court for construing this distinction out of the statute are not persuasive. An analysis of the purposes and antecedents of the survivors\u2019 loss provision indicates that the Legislature intended that the different language result in a different measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The first rationale advanced by the Court is based on the legislative history of the act, namely the adoption of the Senate version of the act rather than the substitute offered by the House. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Both bills defined survivors\u2019 loss as the loss of \"contributions\u201d that the deceased would have made to his family, with the House substitute adding the clause \"less expenses of the survivors avoided by reason of decedent\u2019s death\u201d. The Court concludes that in adopting the version without a subtraction for expenses of the survivors avoided by the death, the Legislature indicated that no subtraction should be made for the personal expenditures of the deceased in computing survivors\u2019 loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The Court acknowledges that we have no evidence of the legislative give and take that led to adoption of the Senate bill rather than that of the House, or of whether this particular difference between the two bills was a factor in that choice, or, if this difference was a factor, what the Legislature intended to accomplish by not including the clause. With so much in doubt, I question whether the mere choice of one bill over another is an adequate basis for negating a distinction clearly present in the language of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Moreover, the language of the \"deleted\u201d clause must be strained to make it mean what the Court asserts. Only by straining can the personal expenditures of the <em>deceased </em>be considered \"expenses of the <em>survivors </em>avoided by reason of decedent\u2019s death\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">The correct meaning of the clause, one which indicates that it was not intended to refer to the deceased\u2019s personal expenditures, is revealed in the comments to the model act from which the clause was drawn. The example there given is that the clause would require the subtraction from a deceased child\u2019s financial contributions to the family of the family\u2019s expenses in rearing the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">The Court recognizes that the measure of survi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>vors\u2019 loss under the no-fault act was patterned after the measure of survivors\u2019 loss under wrongful death acts. Under wrongful death acts compensating survivors\u2019 loss, however, the measure of recovery is not total earnings. A reduction must be made for the personal expenditures of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Further, the comments to both model acts on which the no-fault act was based state that recovery was intended to be more rigorously confined to actual pecuniary loss than under most wrongful death acts. Failing to subtract the amount of wages the deceased would have spent exclusively on himself, rather than contributed to his family for their support, defeats this intent by allowing recovery of an amount not actually lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The second rationale offered by the Court is that the difficulty and disproportionate expense of calculating the reduction for the decedent\u2019s personal expenditures is inconsistent with the legislative purpose of expeditious settlement of claims without complex, time-consuming factual controversies. The use of such a purpose to negate a distinction clearly drawn in the statute establishes a troublesome precedent. Is this Court to review all factual determinations arguably called for under the \u00e1ct on the basis of their cost effectiveness? That is clearly not the Court\u2019s role.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Moreover, I have difficulty understanding how the Court can reject this calculation as inconsistent with the act\u2019s purpose, when the Court concludes that the act requires a virtually identical calculation when a surviving spouse loses her dependency status upon remarriage. In the latter situation, the Court concludes that the act requires a reduction of survivors\u2019 loss payments by the amount of contributions that the deceased \"would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>have made solely for the benefit of the disqualified dependent\u201d. This calculation is analogous to the calculation of the amount that would have been spent solely for the benefit of the deceased, and surely will be no less difficult or time-consuming.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">We all agree that the act requires such a calculation as to the disqualified dependent. Such a calculation as to the deceased cannot, consistent with that conclusion, be rejected as contrary to the purposes of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">A detailed analysis of the Court\u2019s legislative history argument illustrates its weaknesses. The language of the Senate bill was substantially the same as the language enacted: \"contributions * * * that * * * dependents of the deceased * * * would have received for support\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The House substitute bill provided, in part: \"contributions * * * that his survivors would have received from the decedent * * *, less expenses of the survivors avoided by reason of decedent\u2019s death\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court imputes significance to the adoption of the Senate bill rather, than the House substitute, which had the effect of failing to enact the clause \"less expenses of the survivors avoided by reason of decedent\u2019s death\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">A court is on insecure ground when it attempts to derive legislative intent from the enactment, without explanation, of one bill rather than another.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A court is on somewhat firmer, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>not solid, ground when it reasons from the express defeat of a bill or amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, however, we do not have an express rejection of the alternative by vote. Nor do we have any evidence that the attention of the Legislature was focused upon this particular difference between the two bills, much less evidence of why the Legislature deleted the clause if indeed the deletion was intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">The Court recognizes the lack of explicative floor debate and committee reports, and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">\"The myriad activities that attend the legislative process having run their course, 1972 PA 294 was enacted containing language consistent with that of Senate Bill No. 782 and <em>without </em>the clause * * * which appeared in the House substitute bill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">As the United States Supreme Court has observed, \"[t]he interpretation of statutes cannot safely be made to rest upon mute intermediate legislative maneuvers\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Assuming that some legislative intent can be gleaned from the choice of the Senate bill rather than the House substitute, the construction adopted by the Court is not persuasive. First, it requires a strained construction of the clause the Court concludes was purposely deleted. That clause would have required a reduction for \"expenses of the survivors avoided by reason of the decedent\u2019s death\u201d. To conclude that, by deleting this clause, the Legislature intended to preclude a reduction for the wages spent on decedent\u2019s personal expenses requires concluding that the Legislature considered the decedent\u2019s personal expenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>to be \"expenses of the survivors\u201d. This is an unwarranted construction, particularly in light of the more reasonable construction, expressly confirmed by the commentary to the model act from which the clause was apparently drawn,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that \"expenses of the survivors\u201d was intended to refer to such things as a parent\u2019s cost in raising a child, which is generally subtracted from the parent\u2019s recovery for lost contributions upon the wrongful death of his or her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Second, both bills defined survivors\u2019 loss as the loss of \"contributions\u201d that the decedent would have made to his dependents. It is this part of the definition that is critical to the question of whether a subtraction for the decedent\u2019s personal expenditures is required. When consideration of the \"less expenses\u201d clause drops out as being irrelevant to this question, the two bills must be seen as virtually identical in their critical language.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Where the decedent had lived apart from his dependents and had made contributions to their support in the form, for example, of monthly checks, the amount of his earnings devoted to his own expenses could not have been a part of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>contributions. The application of the statutory language in such a situation is clear \u2014 the survivors are entitled only to what would actually have been contributed. The Court concludes, however, that when the decedent had been sharing a household with his dependents, the statutory language is to have a different meaning. In such a case, the survivors are entitled not only to what would have been contributed, but also to what would have been devoted to the decedent\u2019s own personal expenses. The statute does not provide for such differential treatment according to whether the decedent had been- living with his dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">Third, construing the act to compensate survivors for contributions they would not actually have received is inconsistent with the intent of the act, as evidenced by its antecedents, to rigorously confine the measure of loss to actual pecuniary loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The drafters of the Motor Vehicle Basic Protection Insurance Act (MVBPIA)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Uniform Motor Vehicle Accident Reparations Act (UMVARA),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the two model acts relied upon by the Legislature in drafting the Michigan act, had similar goals in defining \"survivors\u2019 loss\u201d. The authors\u2019 comments on \u00a7 1.9(e) of the MVBPIA state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">\" '[S]urvivors\u2019 loss\u2019 is defined in a way somewhat similar to standards for damages under death acts, but <em>with a more rigorous adherence to genuine economic loss </em>than under most death acts.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The Commissioners\u2019 Comments to \u00a7\u00a7 1(a)(5)(iv) and 1(a)(5)(v) of the UMVARA state:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>\" 'Survivor\u2019s economic loss\u2019 and 'survivor\u2019s replacement services loss\u2019 are defined in a way analogous to standards for damages for wrongful death except that, as is the case for 'work loss\u2019 and 'replacement services loss,\u2019 <em>allowable items are more rigorously limited to genuine economic loss.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Fourth, although the Court acknowledges that the Legislature\u2019s reliance on the model acts, as explained by the authors\u2019 comments quoted above, indicates \"an intent that survivors\u2019 loss benefits should at least roughly correspond to economic loss damages recoverable under our wrongful death act\u201d, the Court\u2019s construction is clearly at odds with the measure of survivor\u2019s loss under the wrongful death act.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">To clarify this point, it is useful to contrast the historical differences between recovery under the survival act and recovery under the wrongful death act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under the survival act, the plaintiff claimed as the representative of the deceased. Since the plaintiff was entitled to recover what <em>the deceased </em>would have received had death not occurred, no reduction for the personal consumption of the deceased was required.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Under the wrongful death act, the focus shifted to the loss suffered by <em>the survivors </em>by reason of the decedent\u2019s death. This focus on the survivors\u2019 loss is replicated in \u00a7 3108. When determining the survivors\u2019 loss, it has long been the law in Michigan, and elsewhere, that the personal expenditures of the decedent must be subtracted. As was explained in <em>Sipes v Michigan CR </em>Co:<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>\"This is not a suit to recover the loss to decedent\u2019s estate of his prospective earnings, but only to recover the pecuniary loss sustained by his widow and child. Such loss, in no event, could approximate his earnings, for the expense of his own needs would have to be met along with the needs of his family.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">The plain language of the act indicates that a survivor cannot recover what would have been spent on the decedent\u2019s personal expenditures, since such amount could not be contributed to dependents for their support. I would not depart from the most plausible reading of the language in favor of an alternative reading based on \"mute intermediate legislative maneuvers\u201d, especially where an analysis of the model act antecedents of \u00a7 3108 indicates that the clause at issue had nothing to do with a reduction for the personal expenditures of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The Court\u2019s reading of the legislative history requires concluding that the Legislature intended to define survivor\u2019s loss in a manner inconsistent with the standard of damages under wrongful death actions, in spite of the Court\u2019s recognition that the act was patterned after such standards. The most plausible reading of the statutory language, as requiring a reduction for the decedent\u2019s personal expenditures, is consistent with those standards and with the goal, expressed in the commentary to both model acts, to more rigorously confine recovery to genuine economic loss._</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The second reason offered by the Court for its conclusion that the Legislature did not intend a reduction for the decedent\u2019s personal expenditures is the general goal of the no-fault act to provide for the expeditious settlement of claims without complex factual controversies.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">I am in full sympathy with the Court\u2019s recognition of the difficulties inherent in such calculation, and of the disproportionate cost of the calculation in light of the small amounts that will normally be subtracted. Since I do not consider the use of statistical evidence of average personal consumption of family members to be consistent with the act\u2019s requirement that the genuine economic loss of individual survivors be determined, I must recognize that the construction of \u00a7 3108 which I think correct will often necessitate a time-consuming and difficult factual inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Expeditious reparation is indeed one of the general purposes of the act. Such general purposes, however, much less our assessment of the wisdom or cost-effectiveness of the Legislature\u2019s choice, cannot justify our reading out of the act a factual determination required by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Further, while the Court cites as examples several provisions designed to expedite resolution of claims, it also recognizes that a factual determination of precisely the same character as is involved in determining the amount of income allocable to the decedent\u2019s personal expenditures is required by the act when a spouse loses his or her dependency status upon remarriage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-10\">\"[T]he aggregate of survivors\u2019 loss benefits being paid for the benefit of all the decedent\u2019s survivors prior to the disqualification of one of them should be reduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>only by the amount equal to the contributions of tangible things of economic value that the deceased would have made solely for the benefit of the disqualified dependent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The factual determination required by such a reduction is equivalent to that required in calculating the personal expenditures of the deceased, with the personal expenditures of the disqualified dependent substituted for those of the deceased. One cannot, therefore, properly conclude that such a factual determination is necessarily inconsistent with the act\u2019s general purpose of expediting the settlement of claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">I am persuaded that the Legislature intended that income that would have been committed to the personal expenditures of the decedent should not be considered as an economic loss of the survivors. Indeed, the Court does not argue that the loss of wages that would have been spent on the decedent is actually an economic loss of the survivors. Obviously, the survivors cannot be considered to have lost what they never would have received. To construe \u00a7 3108 otherwise defeats the general goal of reducing the cost of no-fault insurance through rigorously confining damages to genuine economic loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Where the injured person survives the automobile accident, the Legislature expressly provided for full recovery of lost wages.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Where the injured person dies, the Legislature did not use lost wages as the measure of damages but, rather, shifted to the survivors\u2019 loss of contributions to their support. The Court in effect rewrites the statute in those cases where the decedent had lived with the dependents to shift the measure back to lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>wages. This is simply not what the Legislature has provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">I would hold that survivors\u2019 loss under \u00a7 3108 does not include income spent on personal expenditures of the decedent and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b676-5\">Coleman, C.J., and Kavanagh, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-11\"> The pertinent section of the Senate bill is quoted in full in fn 5 of the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b668-12\"> The pertinent section of the House substitute is quoted in full in fn 6 of the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b668-13\"> <em>Jefferson v United States, </em>178 F2d 518, 520 (CA 4, 1949), <em>aff'd sub nom Feres v United States, </em>340 US 135; 71 S Ct 153; 95 L Ed 152 (1950).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\"><em> Liquor Control Comm v Fraternal Order of Eagles, Aerie No 629, </em>286 Mich 32, 43-44; 281 NW 427 (1938).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b669-9\"> <em>Trailmobile Co v Whirls, </em>331 US 40, 61; 67 S Ct 982; 91 L Ed 1328 (1947).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\"> The official comments to UMVARA \u00a7\u00a7 1(a)(5)(iv) and 1(a)(5)(v), which define \"survivor\u2019s economic loss\u201d and \"survivor\u2019s replacement services loss\u201d and which use the clause \"less expenses of the survivors avoided by reason of decedent\u2019s death\u201d, state:</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">\"It is also necessary to subtract expenses which the survivors avoided by reason of the decedent\u2019s death, although the same avoided expenses cannot be subtracted twice from both survivor\u2019s economic loss and survivor\u2019s replacement services loss.
