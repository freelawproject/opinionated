On December 1, 1976, O\u2019Brien and his wife filed suit against Hazelet &amp; Erdal, an engineering firm which allegedly contracted with the Michigan State Highway Department in 1954 to serve as consulting engineer for construction of the road<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>way in question. Construction of the highway was apparently completed sometime in 1961. The O\u2019Briens alleged that Hazelet &amp; Erdal had negligently permitted the highway to be built with a number of defects and hazards that proximately caused the accident that injured Mr. O\u2019Brien.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Hazelet &amp; Erdal moved for accelerated judgment, claiming that the suit was barred by the statute because it had not been commenced within six years after Hazelet &amp; Erdal had completed its work on the highway construction project.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The trial judge denied the motion, ruling that \"the statute is unconstitutional and deprives persons of their cause of action\u201d. The Court of Appeals reversed, declaring that the statute was one of abrogation rather than of limitation and that the Legislature may abrogate a cause of action before it vests without denying due process of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">In <em>Muzar v Metro Town Houses, Inc, </em>Metro contracted with Dembs Building Company in 1964 for the construction of a town house complex in Mount Clemens, Michigan. Dembs subcontracted for the design of the drainage system for the town house buildings with Lehner Associates, Inc., a professional engineering firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">In 1965 plaintiffs Charlotte Muzar, Carrie Led-better and Agatha Malinowski each purchased one of several town house units which shared a common building. State Farm Fire and Casualty Company insured plaintiffs\u2019 town houses against property damage, including collapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">On January 3, 1973, the building which included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 town houses collapsed, allegedly due to defects in the construction of the drainage system. The plaintiffs sued Metro and State Farm for breach of warranty in July, 1973, and after Metro was found to be defunct, State Farm settled the plaintiffs\u2019 suit for $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\">In December, 1975, State Farm brought a third-party complaint against Dembs, claiming that State Farm was subrogated to the original plaintiffs\u2019 right to seek recovery of the $40,000 from Dembs. Subsequently, Dembs filed a third-party action for indemnity against Lehner, alleging that the collapse was caused by defective design of the drainage system.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Lehner\u2019s motion for accelerated judgment on the basis of the statute was opposed by Dembs on the ground that the statute denied equal protection by irrationally omitting general contractors, builders, owners, and tradesmen from its protection. The trial court granted accelerated judgment. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding the classification in the statute \"arbitrary and without reasonable relation to the object of the legislation\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">On August 26, 1976, Margaret and William Bouser filed suit alleging that, while walking in the City of Lincoln Park on April 9, 1975, Mrs. Bouser had tripped on a curb constructed higher than an adjoining sidewalk, causing her to fall and suffer injuries. The Bousers\u2019 complaint named as defendants the city; G. A. Morrison Company, the construction firm which installed the curb and sidewalk; and Pate, Hirn and Bogue, Inc., the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>architectural firm which designed the curb and sidewalk. The work was apparently completed in 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Pate, Hirn and Bogue, Inc., was granted accelerated judgment on the basis of the statute. The Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Anne and John Oole and James Carpenter filed suit on January 31, 1975, alleging that they were injured when a wooden deck attached to the home of defendants Oosting gave way on July 10, 1973. The Oosting home, complete with deck, was occupied on or before January 1, 1967. Defendants Knapp and Terzes, registered architects; Newhof, a registered engineer; and Moss and Casemier, contractors, were added by an amended complaint filed June 26, 1975. The added defendants moved for accelerated judgment on the basis of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The trial judge denied the motions, holding that the statute only applied to persons who had dealt directly with the architects and engineers. The Court of Appeals reversed in part, ruling that the statute is one of abrogation and could validly be applied to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint against the architects and engineer, although its protection did not extend to the contractors.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">We granted leave to appeal in these four cases to resolve whether MCL 600.5839(1); MSA 27A.5839(1) \u201dviolate[s] equal protection of the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>or due process guarantees (a) in denying a cause of action to persons allegedly injured from negligent design or supervision of construction by state-licensed architects or professional engineers completed more than six years before the injury; and (b) by limiting the tort responsibility of licensed architects and professional engineers but not licensed contractors.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\"><em>Shavers v Attorney </em>General<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> summarized the scope of judicial review of equal protection and due process challenges to socioeconomic legislation:</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\"The test to determine whether legislation enacted pursuant to the police power comports with due process is whether the legislation bears a reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective. See <em>Michigan Canners &amp; Freezers Ass\u2019n, Inc v Agricultural Marketing &amp; Bargaining Board, </em>397 Mich 337, 343-344; 245 NW2d 1 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">\"The test to determine whether a statute enacted pursuant to the police power comports with equal protection is, essentially, the same. As the United States Supreme Court declared in <em>United States Dep\u2019t of Agriculture v Moreno, </em>413 US 528, 533; 93 S Ct 2821; 37 L Ed 2d 782 (1973):</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">\" 'Under traditional equal protection analysis, a legislative classification must be sustained, if the classification itself is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">For purposes of resolving either a due-process or an equal-protection challenge, we must first iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>tify the objective the challenged statute seeks to achieve.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The instant legislation was enacted in 1967 in response to then recent developments in the law of torts. The waning of the privity doctrine as a defense against suits by injured third parties<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and other changes in the law<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> increased the likelihood that persons taking part in the design and construction of improvements to real property might be forced to defend against claims arising out of alleged defects in such improvements, perhaps many years after construction of the improvement was completed. The Legislature chose to limit the liability of architects and engineers in order to relieve them of the potential burden of defending claims brought long after completion of the improvement and thereby limit the impact of recent changes in the law upon the availability or cost of the services they provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The power of the Legislature to determine the conditions under which a right may accrue and the period within which a right may be asserted is undoubted. Statutes enacted in the exercise of that power serve the permissible legislative objective of relieving defendants of the burden of defending claims brought after the time so established.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">It is claimed that this legislation violates due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>process because a statute of limitations cannot constitutionally bar a cause of action before all necessary elements constituting the cause of action are present, and must afford the potential plaintiff a reasonable time within which to bring suit.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\">This Court has previously recognized that the Legislature\u2019s constitutional power to change the common law authorizes it to extinguish common-law rights of action.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> If the Legislature can entirely abrogate a common-law right, surely it may provide that a particular cause of action can no longer arise unless it accrues within a specified period of time. As one Court of Appeals panel explained, the instant statute is both one of limitation and one of repose.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For actions which accrue within six years from occupancy, use, or acceptance of the completed improvement, the statute prescribes the time within which such actions may be brought and thus acts as a statute of limitations.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> When more than six years from such time have elapsed before an injury is sustained, the statute prevents a cause of action from ever accruing. The plaintiff is not deprived of a right to sue a state-licensed architect or engineer because no such right can arise after the statutory period has elapsed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>By enacting a statute which grants architects and engineers complete repose after six years rather than abrogating the described causes of action <em>in toto, </em>the Legislature struck what it perceived to be a balance between eliminating altogether the tort liability of these professions and placing no restriction other than general statutes of limitations upon the ability of injured plaintiffs to bring tort actions against architects and engineers. The Legislature could reasonably have concluded that allowing suits against architects and engineers to be maintained within six years from the time of occupancy, use, or acceptance of an improvement would allow sufficient time for most meritorious claims to accrue and would permit suit against those guilty of the most serious lapses in their professional endeavors.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The opponents of the statute argue that it violates equal protection (1) by singling out the victims of the negligence of architects and engineers for a burden not imposed upon the victims of other tortfeasors, and (2) by failing to extend the same protection to others who may be responsible for defects in improvements to real property \u2014 particularly contractors, who may be contractually obligated to follow the directives of architects and engineers, yet after six years find themselves the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>only available target for plaintiffs alleging injury resulting from latent defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Acts of the Legislature enjoy a presumption of constitutionality and the legislative judgment must be accepted if it is supported by \" 'any state of facts either known or which could reasonably be assumed\u2019 \u201d.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In reviewing equal protection challenges to socioeconomic legislation, the United States Supreme Court has said that the Constitution \"is offended only if the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the [legislative] objective\u201d and that a \"statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it\u201d.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The Legislature could rationally determine that state-licensed architects and engineers possess characteristics which reasonably distinguish them with respect to the object of the legislation. The design of improvements to real estate is primarily the province of architects and engineers, while the construction of improvements and the realization of designs is primarily the function of contractors. Architects and engineers are required by law to be licensed, while non-residential contractors are not.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Legislature might have concluded that the different education, training, experience, licensing and professional stature of architects and engineers made it more likely that a limitation on their tort liability would not reduce the care with which they performed their tasks than would be the case with contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The Legislature may also have thought it necessary to reduce the potential liability of architects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>and engineers in order to encourage experimentation with new designs and materials. Innovations are usually accompanied by some unavoidable risk. Design creativity might be stifled if architects and engineers labored under the fear that every untried configuration might have unsuspected flaws that could lead to liability decades later.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The statute is not invalid because contractors, as well as architects and engineers, may supervise construction. While this overlap of function may mean that a contractor\u2019s potential liability will endure longer than an architect\u2019s or engineer\u2019s potential liability for a similar breach, a statutory classification is not constitutionally invalid merely because its application results in hardship or injustice in some cases.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Legislature may have believed that the supervision provided by architects and engineers and that provided by contractors is qualitatively different in a manner which would render it less appropriate to limit the duration of the contractor\u2019s tort liability. For example, a contractor may have better access to the details of ongoing construction and thus be in a superior position to assure that the improvement is built safely.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The Legislature need not treat all phases of a problem at once, and it may proceed to address an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>area one step at a time.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The expansion of potential tort liability in the construction industry is of recent vintage, and the consequences of placing limits on that liability could not be determined with certainty in advance. The Legislature can decide to proceed cautiously by extending qualified protection to a distinguishable professional group.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">It is claimed that this statute not only fails to extend a benefit to contractors but also unfairly burdens them with liability that should properly be assumed, or at least shared, by architects and engineers. At this stage, however, those arguments are only prophecies; how the statute will work in operation remains to be seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">These four cases are the first involving the statute to reach the Michigan appellate courts in the 13 years since its enactment. Only time and experience will tell whether juries tend to unfairly hold contractors liable for the defaults of others and whether contractors are left to shoulder alone the burden of judgments for which, but for the statute, they might have had a right to indemnity or contribution. There is now no reason to suppose that a properly instructed jury will hold an innocent contractor responsible for injury caused by a defect resulting from an architect\u2019s or engineer\u2019s breach of duty. Trial judges should carefully scrutinize claims against contractors to assure, that a case is submitted to the jury only where there is evidence that the contractor has himself acted or failed to act in such a way as to subject him to liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">At present, the statute remains experimental social legislation and is entitled to the deference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>usually given enactments of that type. After it \"has been enforced for a sufficiently long period of time that all the rationales likely to be advanced in its support have been developed, a court should fully examine those rationales and determine whether they are sound\u201d.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">We affirm the Court of Appeals in <em>O\u2019Brien, Bouser, </em>and <em>Oole, </em>and reverse in <em>Muzar. </em>In all four cases this disposition requires remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b110-6\">Coleman, C.J., and Kavanagh, Williams, Fitzgerald, Ryan, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Levin, J._</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-7\"> MCL 600.5839(1); MSA 27A.5839(1).'</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-8\"> <em>O\u2019Brien v Hazelet &amp; Erdal, Bouser v Lincoln Park, </em>and the appeals of plaintiffs Oole and Carpenter in <em>Oole v Oosting, </em>Docket Nos. 61500 and 61501.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b98-9\">\n<em> Muzar v Metro Town Houses, Inc.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b98-10\"><em> Oole v Oosting, </em>Docket Nos. 61498 and 61499, appeals of defendants Moss and Casemier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b98-11\"> US Const, Am XIV, Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b98-12\"> US Const, Am XIV, Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b100-11\"> <em>O\u2019Brien v Hazelet &amp; Erdal, </em>84 Mich App 764; 270 NW2d 690 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\"> <em>Muzar v Metro Town Houses, Inc, </em>82 Mich App 368, 379-380; 266 NW2d 850 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b102-11\"> <em>Bouser v Lincoln Park, </em>83 Mich App 167; 268 NW2d 332 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b102-12\"> <em>Oole v Oosting, </em>82 Mich App 291; 266 NW2d 795 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b103-11\"> 403 Mich 828-829 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b103-12\"><em> Shavers </em>v <em>Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 612-613; 267 NW2d 72 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b104-9\"> See <em>Spence v Three Rivers Builders &amp; Masonry Supply, Inc, </em>353 Mich 120; 90 NW2d 873 (1958).
