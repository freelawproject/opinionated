When a State elects to participate in the Medicaid program, it is required to develop, and submit for federal approval by the Health Care Financing Administration (hereinafter \u201cHCFA\u201d), the federal agency that administers the Federal Medical Assistance Program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396, a State Medicaid Plan for the provision of medical assistance that complies with the Medicaid Act and the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396; 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 430-456. If HCFA approves the State plan, then the State qualifies for federal funding. After the plan receives federal approval, alteration of it without federal approval, would jeopardize its federal funding. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Maryland has chosen to participate in the Medicaid program. It does so through the Maryland Medical Assistance Program, operated by the appellant. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1982, 2000 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 15-103 of the Health General Article. The Medical Assistance program provides reimbursement for the cost of health care services provided to certain indigent persons, i.e. \u201cfor indigent individuals or medically indigent individuals.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7 15-103(a)(2)(i). <em>See </em>COMAR 10.09.24.01 (including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>aged, blind or disabled persons within the category of persons for whom eligibility may be determined); COMAR 10.09.24.08D(4) (including \u201can aged, blind or disabled person\u201d in the list of the \u201cMedically Needy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Thus, in Maryland, an individual who is aged, blind, or disabled, COMAR 10.09.24.03D(4),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and has an income that does not exceed $ 2500, Health Gen. \u00a7 15 \u2014 109(b)(1), COMAR 10.09.24.08L and M, qualifies for Medical Assistance benefits. An individual with assets that exceed the resource limit, but whose income is insufficient to meet the cost of care, may enter a long-term care facility, such as a nursing home. Such an individual is required to contribute all of his or her \u201cavailable income\u201d to the nursing facility to pay for the cost of care, with the program making up the difference. COMAR 10.09.24.10D (3);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> see 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.832(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The Maryland Medical Assistance Program regulations do not define \u201cavailable income.\u201d COMAR 10.09.24.10D(2), however, prescribes how to determine \u201cavailable income.\u201d And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the regulations define income as \u201cany property or service received by a person in cash or in-kind which can be applied directly, or by sale or conversion, to meet basic needs for food, shelter, and medical expenses.\u201d COMAE 10.09.24.02B(23)(a). Thus, available income is the difference between total income and any allowable deductions. <em>See id. </em>For institutionalized recipients, the following deductions are allowed from the recipient\u2019s total income to determine available income: (1) a personal needs allowance<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; (2) a spousal or family allowance; (3) a residential maintenance allowance for a single person; and (4) incurred medical expenses that are not subject to payment by a third party. <em>See </em>COMAR 10.09.24.10D(2)(a)-(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Arthur L. Drager is the guardian of the property<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>of seven Medicaid recipients (the appellees).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Each appellee is a resident of a nursing facility and receives Medicaid benefits to help pay for his or her care. The present controversy began when Mr. Drager requested that the Maryland Medical Assistance Program (\u201cProgram\u201d) of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the appellant) deduct his guardianship commissions with respect to his wards from their available incomes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He sought commissions in the following amounts: $522.78 for Minnie Campbell, $294.62 for Lillian Cheatham, $416.27 for Melster Dystart, $ 689.04 for Mahalia LaCruze, $263.42 for Thomas Roundtree, $925.36 for Vivian Tazewell, and $829.37 for Daisy Watts. These requests were denied by the Medicaid Program, which advised Mr. Drager that the Department has \u201cno provisions in [the] regulations to allow for such deductions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Mr. Drager, on behalf of the appellees, appealed to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH), arguing that the commissions should be permitted as part of the personal needs allowance of each Medicaid recipient, that the Administrative Law Judges should follow prior OAH, Board of Review, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Circuit Court decisions that permitted the deduction of such commissions, and that public policy considerations required a ruling favorable to the appellees. In each case, the ALJ affirmed the appellant\u2019s decision, concluding that it had correctly held that the guardianship commissions are not a part of the personal needs allowance and, thus, are not a permissible deduction in calculating a Medicaid recipient\u2019s available income.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The appellees\u2019 other arguments were also rejected. The Board of Review, to which the decisions were appealed, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The appellees sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, and the cases were consolidated for hearing. Pressing the same arguments they had made before the AL Js, the appellees sought, in the Circuit Court, not just the deduction of the guardianship commissions, but attorneys\u2019 fees to be paid on the same basis. Accepting their argument that guardianship commissions should be deducted from a recipient\u2019s income as a part of the personal needs allowance, the Circuit Court reversed. As to the guardianship commissions, the court ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">\u201cthat the guardianship commissions calculated in accordance with the Annotated Code of Maryland, Estates and Trusts Article Sections 13-218 and 14-103, and approved by the Trust Clerk for the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for services rendered on behalf of [the named appellee] shall not be considered as \u2018available income\u2019 as set forth in COMAR 10.09.24.10D and shall be deducted prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>calculation of available income for [the named appellee]....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4s\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">\u201cThat the Baltimore City Department of Social Services Long Term Medical Assistance Unit be and is hereby directed to allow guardianship commissions in [a stated amount] to be paid unto Arthur L. Drager for services rendered by him in his capacity as Guardian of the Property of [the named appellee].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The trial court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">\u201c[I]n our guardianship docket, a lot of indigent people would be out on the street but for our appointing guardians and having Counsel represent the guardian, and then be able to get the benefits that they\u2019re entitled to under the law. So, I don\u2019t view it as sort of gilding the lily, I view it as essential to life and to living, and, therefore I will sign the Orders authorizing the fees be paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The court also granted the appellee\u2019s request for, and ordered the Department to allow, a counsel fee of $600, for each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">We issued the writ of certiorari on our own motion, while this case was pending in the Court of Special Appeals. We now reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Our review of a decision by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, an administrative agency of the State, is governed by Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article, section (h) of which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">\u201c(h) In a proceeding under this section, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">\u201c1. remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-13\">\u201c2. affirm the decision of the agency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6\">\u201c3. reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision of the agency:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-14\">\u201cc) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\u201cd) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">\u201ce) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201cf) is arbitrary or capricious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Thus, the issue for the reviewing court is whether the administrative agency committed an error of law, or whether its decision ig supported by substantial evidence, or is \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r of State of Md. v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y of U.S., </em>339 Md. 596, 614-15, 664 A.2d 862, 871-72 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The question whether guardianship commissions are an allowable deduction from a Medical Assistance recipient\u2019s available income under COMAR 10.09.24.10D(2)(d), as a \u201cpersonal needs allowance,\u201d is solely one of law. As to the review of questions of law, we have pointed out, see <em>Office of People\u2019s Counsel v. Maryland Public Service Comm\u2019n, </em>355 Md. 1, 14, 733 A.2d 996, 1003 (1999) (quoting <em>Commissioners of Cambridge v. Eastern Shore Public Serv. Co., </em>192 Md. 333, 339, 64 A.2d 151, 154 (1949)) and citing <em>Mayor &amp; Council of Crisfield v. Public Serv.

Dep\u2019t of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>284 Md. 216, 230-31, 395 A.2d 1174, 1181 (1979), that \u201c[questions of law ... are \u2018completely subject to review by the courts,\u2019... although the agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute may be entitled to some deference.\u201d <em>See also, Total Audio-Visual Systems, Inc. v. Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, </em>360 Md. 387, 394, 758 A.2d 124, 128 (2000); <em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 69, 729 A.2d 376, 381 (1999). We have noted also that the deference under these circumstances is by no means dispositive, nor otherwise as great as that applicable to factual findings or mixed questions of law and fact. <em>See Baltimore Bldg. and Constr. Trades Council v. Barnes, </em>290 Md. 9, 14, 427 A.2d 979, 982 (1981). Accordingly, this Court is not bound by the agency\u2019s legal conclusions; we are, in short, \u201cunder no constraints in reversing an administrative decision which is premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Peo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>ple\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v. Maryland Marine Mfg. Co., </em>316 Md. 491, 497, 560 A.2d 32, 38 (1989); <em>See also Board of Physician Quality Assurance v.

Other than the policy arguments that the trial court specifically rejected as \u201cfor a legislative body or regulatory body,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the only basis for relief offered by the appellees in their written memorandum was that the commissions were a part of the \u201cpersonal needs allowance.\u201d We must assume, therefore, that the \u201cpersonal needs allowance\u201d is the basis on which the court decided the case, and we review its judgment with that in mind.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">By statute, Maryland prescribes the eligibility requirements for the Medical Assistance Program \u2014 as relevant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>case <em>sub judice, </em>indigence or medical indigence, \u00a7 15-103(a)(2)(l), and an income, for one person, of $2500, \u00a7 15-109(b)(1). These requirements have been elucidated and further refined by regulations, the validity of which, substantively and procedurally, have not been, and are not now being, challenged.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As noted, COMAR 10.09.24.04D (4) defines \u201cMedically Needy\u201d as including \u201can aged, blind, or disabled person\u201d and COMAR 10.09.24.08L and M confirm the eligibility limitation for the Medical Assistance Program. COMAR 10.09.24.10D, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">\u201cD. Current Eligibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">\u201c(1) Excess Resources. When the countable resources are greater than the medically needy resource level, eligibility does not exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">\u201c(2) Determination of Available Income. The following amounts shall be deducted from total income in the following order:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">\u201c(a) A personal needs allowance of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">\u201c(i) $40 a month for an institutionalized person other than a person who meets the requirements of \u00a7 D(2)(a)(iii) of this regulation.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\u201cPersonal needs allowance\u201d is not further defined in the regulations. Insight into meaning may be obtained from perusal of the pertinent sections of the federal statute and the accompanying regulations. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(50) provides for a monthly personal needs allowance for certain institutionalized individuals and couples. Section 1396a (q)(l)(A) elaborates. In pertinent part, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201c(q) Minimum monthly personal needs allowance deduction; \u2018institutionalized individual or couple\u2019 defined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">\u201c(1)(A) In order to meet the requirement of subsection (a)(50), the State plan must provide that, in the case of an institutionalized individual or couple described in subparagraph (B), in determining the amount of the individual\u2019s or couple\u2019s income to be applied monthly to payment for the cost of care in an institution, there shall be deducted from the monthly income (in addition to other allowances otherwise provided under the State plan) a monthly personal needs allowance\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">\u201c(i) which is reasonable in amount for clothing and other personal needs of the individual (or couple) while in an institution, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">\u201c(ii) which is not less (and may be greater) than the minimum monthly personal needs allowance described in paragraph (2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">\u201c(B) In this subsection, the term \u2018institutionalized individual or couple\u2019 means an individual or married couple\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">\u201c(i) who is an inpatient (or who are inpatients) in a medical institution or nursing facility for which payments are made under this title throughout a month and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At\">\u201c(ii) who is or are determined to be eligible for medical assistance under the State plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-11\">\u201c(2) The minimum monthly personal needs allowance described in this paragraph [subsection] is $ 30 for an institutionalized individual and $ 60 for an institutionalized couple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>(if both are aged, blind, or disabled, and their incomes are considered available to each other in determining eligibility).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">As the federal regulations, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.882(c)(1), confirm, the deduction is for \u201cclothing and other personal needs of the individual while in the institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">As noted above, the Administrative Law Judges determined that the appellant\u2019s reading of the applicable regulation was the correct one, that \u201cthe personal needs that are contemplated by the statutory personal needs allowance are incidental items used for clothing or for grooming one\u2019s body,\u201d items such as \u201chaircuts, pedicures, shampoos and chewing gum, and not guardian\u2019s commissions or other legal fees\u201d and, accordingly, concluded that such fees could not be designated as a part of the \u201cpersonal needs allowance\u201d and excluded from available income. We agree. Guardianship commissions are not clothing, and they are not the kind of personal needs contemplated by the COMAR 10.09.24.10D. The amount of the \u201cpersonal needs allowance\u201d is $40.00. That amount will accommodate, to be sure, the cost of personal items necessary for grooming and even some entertainment. It will not accommodate the cost of an item such as guardianship fees, which, as in this case, is likely to exceed, by far, the maximum amount of the allowance. Again, we agree with the appellant when it argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">\u201c... Maryland\u2019s regulatory scheme demonstrates that the Maryland regulation does not include guardianship commissions within the personal needs allowance. While the $40 provided for in the regulation may be sufficient to pay for toiletries, clothing and other small items, it clearly is not sufficient to pay for larger and more expensive items such as guardianship commissions, which, as this case demonstrates, can be hundreds of dollars. If the regulation were intended to permit payments for such items, it would have provided for a deduction larger than $40 per month. CO-MAR 10.09.24.10D (2)(a)(i).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">For the first time in the Circuit Court, the appellees requested reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees of $ 600 per case, plus court costs. The trial court granted the request and signed an order directing the appellant \u201cto allow a counsel fee in the amount of six Hundred Dollars ($600,00) to be paid unto Arthur L. Drager for services rendered by him in his capacity as Guardian of the Property.\u201d We agree with the appellant that the trial court erred in so ordering for any one of several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The appellant is correct; the attorneys fee order is ambiguous. It is not clear from the order whether, as was the case with the guardianship commissions, the court considered the fees as a part of the \u201cpersonal needs allowance\u201d and, as such, deductible from the appellees\u2019 income to determine their \u201cavailable income,\u201d or whether the court awarded the attorneys\u2019 fees in respect to the prosecution of the appeal. In either event, the award can not withstand review.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 10-222(a) of the State Government Article provides that \u201ca party who is aggrieved by the final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review of the decision.\u201d Thus, it is the final decision of the final decision maker at the administrative level, not that of the reviewing court, that is subject to judicial review. Accordingly, the reviewing court, restricted to the record made before the administrative agency, see <em>Cicala v. Disability Review Bd. for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>288 Md. 254, 260, 418 A.2d 205, 209 (1980), may not pass upon issues presented to it for the first time on judicial review and that are not encompassed in the final decision of the administrative agency. Stated differently, an appellate court will review an adjudicatory agency decision solely on the grounds relied upon by the agency. <em>See County Council of Prince George\u2019s County v. Brandywine Enterprises, Inc., </em>350 Md. 339, 349, 711 A.2d 1346, 1350-51 (1998) and cases cited in note 1, supra. <em>See also Md. State Retirement Pension Sys. v. Martin, 75 </em>Md.App. 240, 246-48, 540 A.2d 1188, 1190-92 (1988). Because the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>of the attorneys\u2019 fees were presented to the Circuit Court for the first time and never raised in, or decided by the Administrative Law Judges, that court erred in awarding them.</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">Similarly, if the fees were intended to reimburse the appellees for the cost of litigating the judicial review proceedings, the court still erred in awarding them. The \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d is the name given the principle that costs awarded to a prevailing party in litigation ordinarily do not include the counsel fees of the prevailing party. <em>Blitz v. Beth Isaac Adas Israel Congregation, </em>352 Md. 31, 39, 720 A.2d 912, 916 (1998); <em>Collier v. MD-Individual Practice Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>327 Md. 1, 13, 607 A.2d 537, 543 (1992). <em>See Talley v. Talley, </em>317 Md. 428, 438, 564 A.2d 777, 782 (1989). We have pointed out that \u201c[t]he power to award attorney\u2019s fees, being contrary to the established practice in this country, may be expressly conferred but will not be presumed from general language.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>317 Md. at 438, 564 A.2d at 782, citing <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 759-63, 100 S.Ct. 2455, 2460-62, 65 L.Ed.2d 488, 499 (1980). This principle is no less applicable in the administrative context. Section 10-222(h) empowers the reviewing court to remand the case for further proceedings, affirm the decision, or reverse or modify it; there is no provision for the reviewing court to award attorneys\u2019 fees. If general language will not suffice as a predicate for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, then certainly the absence of language will not suffice.

In their brief in this Court, the appellees argue that the commissions and attorneys\u2019 fees qualify as \u201cincurred medical expenses,\" see COMAR 10.09.24.10D(2)(d), that are not subject to payment by a third party, abandoning the \u201cpersonal needs allowance\" argument they had heretofore made. At each prior stage of the proceedings, however, before the Administrative Law Judges, before the Review Board and before the Circuit Court, the only basis argued by the appellees was the \"personal needs allowance.\u201d We have said time and time again, that we will review an adjudicatory agency decision solely on the grounds relied upon by the agency. <em>See County Council of Prince George\u2019s County v.

Maryland Code (1974, 2001 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 13-705 of the Estates and Trusts Article addresses the appointment of guardians of the property of disabled persons.

The Medicaid recipients and the date on which the guardian of the person was appointed are: Minnie Campbell, May 1996; Lillian Cheat-ham, September 1993 Melster Dysart, September, 1993; Mahalia LaCruze, May, 1996; Thomas Roundtree, August, 1995, Vivian Tazewell, February 1996; and Daisy Watts, April, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b149-8\">. These cases were not consolidated until the judicial review proceedings in the Circuit Court for Baltimore.

Nevertheless, we will refer to the proceedings, except where necessary to do otherwise, as if there was but one proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\">. The ALJ that decided the Campbell and Cheatham cases, which were consolidated for argument, found that \"the personal needs that are contemplated by the statutory personal needs allowance are incidental items used for clothing or for grooming one\u2019s body.\u201d Similarly, in the case of Vivian Tazewell, the ALJ determined that the personal needs allowance was intended to cover items such as \"haircuts, pedicures, shampoos and chewing gum, not to pay guardian's commissions or other legal fees.\u201d In the cases of Melster Dysart, Mahalia LaCruze and Daisy Watts, the ALJs found that the Department\u2019s reading of the regulation at issue was correct, and \"bolstered by the State\u2019s need to comply with federal requirements.... \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\">.

The appellant also addressed the issue of whether guardianship commissions may be deducted from total income to determine \u201cavailable income,\u201d the threshold for assessing whether an individual is medically needy. In the cases of appellees Cheatham and Campbell, the Administrative Law Judge decided the issue, concluding that \"the court-ordered obligation for [those appellees] to ... support [themselves] by paying a guardian of the property to protect [their] property, is ... a court-ordered support obligation that can not be excluded from available income.\u201d In support, the ALJ relied on cases holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>available income is not reduced by court-ordered support payments or mandatory withholdings. <em>See Himes </em>v. <em>Shalala, </em>999 F.2d 684, 689 (2d Cir.1993); <em>Peura by Herman v.
