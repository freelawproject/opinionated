Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">On October 30,1991, appellant Garnell Graves was arrested in the District of Columbia based on charges of carnal knowledge and indecent acts on a minor, pursuant to D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 22-3501 (1994)(Repealed May 23, 1995, D.C. Law 10-257, \u00a7 501(b)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The charges filed against Graves alleged that he had taken criminal and improper liberties with a ten year old child. The victim, Graves\u2019s ten year old daughter, had reported to a social worker that between August 17 and August 30, 1991, Graves entered her bedroom at night in his apartment in the District of Columbia, where he engaged in vaginal intercourse with her. Graves pled guilty to the charge of indecent acts on a minor and was sentenced in 1992 to a term of two to six years imprisonment. Graves served four years in the Lorton Prison of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections, and he was paroled on May 1, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Following his release from Lorton and prior to the expiration of his parole term, Graves began residing with Leslie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Horton and her eight-year old sister in an apartment in Suitland, Maryland. The younger sister subsequently reported that Graves forced her to have vaginal intercourse with him on approximately eighteen occasions in 1997. A Prince George\u2019s County Grand Jury indicted Graves, charging him with child abuse in violation of Article 27, \u00a7 35C,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> second degree rape in violation of \u00a7 463,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and third degree sex offense in violation of \u00a7 464B.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>On June 23, 1998, the State filed a notice of intent to request the trial court to determine before sentencing whether defendant was a sexually violent predator pursuant to \u00a7 792(b)(4)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by virtue of his prior conviction for indecent acts on a minor in the District of Columbia. On October 27, 1998, after the jury had been empaneled, Graves entered an <em>Alford </em>plea<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to count three of the indictment which charged him with a third degree sexual offense in violation of Article 27, \u00a7 464B.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>On November 20, 1998, the sentencing judge in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County was called upon to determine whether Graves was a sexually violent predator based in part on Graves\u2019s 1992 conviction for indecent acts on a minor in the District of Columbia. After reviewing the Pre Sentence Investigation Report, hearing arguments of both counsel and Graves\u2019s allocution, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\">I\u2019m going to accept the definition that the Legislature provided for sexual and violent offenses. A sexually violent predator is somebody who commits two or more sexually violent offenses. And under the definition of a sexually violent offense, they included a violation of 462, 463, 464(a), 464(b) and 467(f).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">So there is nothing anywhere that requires the violence that you are talking' \u2014 'that you seem to imply was included in that definition. Particularly when we know like we have before us today a violation of 464(b) can be any contact and sexual contact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">And I believe that your client under the charge of indecent acts to a minor in the District of Columbia would \u2014 the equivalent charge in this case would be in fact 464(b). So, I believe he has in fact committed a subsequent offense and is in fact comes [sic] under the definition. And I find him in fact to be a sexually violent predator under the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The trial court sentenced Graves to ten years imprisonment on the third degree sex offense count, with all but seven years suspended, credit for time served of 238 days, and a five year parole period with supervision. The sentencing judge emphasized the repetitive nature of Graves\u2019s crime to support the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">On February 18, 1999, Graves filed a Motion for Modification and Reduction of Sentence, wherein he asserted that the trial court improperly considered his 1991 out-of-state conviction as a basis for finding him to be a sexually violent predator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>under \u00a7 792(a)(ll), as well as unnecessarily exceeding the sentencing guidelines for third degree sex offense in imposing the maximum penalty, a ten year sentence. On March 10, 1999, the sentencing judge entered an order denying the modification or reduction of Graves\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s determination that Graves was a sexually violent predator under \u00a7 792 and upheld the sentence imposed. In affirming the trial court\u2019s decision, the Court of Special Appeals held that \u201cout-of-state convictions may be considered in determining whether an individual is a sexually violent predator.\u201d <em>Graves v. State, </em>133 Md.App. 97, 114, 754 A.2d 493, 502 (2000). In so doing, the Court of Special Appeals recognized that the statutory section concerning sexually violent predators specifically excluded reference to out-of-state convictions, but reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">It is clear that the legislature intended a broad and sweeping registration of sexual offenders. In addition, a sexually violent predator is, in essence, a sexually violent offender who has committed a second sexually violent offense and who has been determined to be at risk of committing a subsequent sexually violent offense. Accordingly, we decline to read the statute as prohibiting a sentencing court from considering out-of-state convictions when it determines if an individual is a sexually violent predator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 114, 754 A.2d at 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">The Maryland Legislature enacted Article 27, \u00a7 792 entitled \u201cRegistration of Offenders\u201d pursuant to the requirements of the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Program enacted by the United States Congress as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Pub.L. No. 103-322, 108 Stat. 1796 (1994), codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14071 (1995).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>statute, which was originally entitled \u201cThe Maryland Crimes Against Children and Sexual Offender Registration Law,\u201d was enacted as Chapter 142, of the 1995 Laws of Maryland. <em>See </em>Gregory G. Gillette, <em>The Maryland Survey: 1994-1995: Recent Development: The Maryland General Assembly: Criminal Law, </em>55 Md. L.Rev. 847, 852-856 (1996). The 1995 Act provided for sexual offenders, upon release from prison, to notify local law enforcement of his/her presence in the county where he/she intended to live. The statute defined a \u201cchild sexual offender\u201d as someone who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">(2)(i) Has been convicted of violating \u00a7 35C of this article for an offense involving sexual abuse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">(ii) Has been convicted of violating any of the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 462 through 464B of this article for an offense involving an individual under the age of 15 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>(iii) Has been granted probation before judgment after being found guilty of any of the offenses listed in items (i) and (ii) of this paragraph and has been ordered by the court, as a condition of probation, to comply with the requirements of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">(iv) Has been convicted of, or granted probation before judgment after being found guilty of, violating \u00a7 464C of this article and has been ordered by the court, as a part of a sentence or condition of probation, to comply with the requirements of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">(v) Has been found not criminally responsible for any of the offenses listed in items (i) and (ii) of this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">(vi) Has been convicted in another state of an offense that, if committed in this state, would constitute one of the offenses listed in items (i) and (ii) of this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Article 27, \u00a7 692B (1975, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1995 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">In 1997, the General Assembly enacted a more expansive sexual offender registration statute which complied with the 1996 amendments to the Federal Wetterling Act, and established additional classifications of offenders subject to the statutory registration requirements. The provisions of the 1995 Act were incorporated and reworked into the 1997 law, as codified in Art. 27, \u00a7 792. The 1997 version of \u00a7 792, which originated as Senate Bill 605, passed by an unanimous vote of the Senate\u2019s Judicial Proceedings Committee on March 20, 1997. The final version of Senate Bill 605 was approved on May 22, 1997, and went into effect on October 1, 1997. <em>See </em>1997 Md. Laws, ch. 754.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This version was the Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>sexual offender registration law in effect at the time of Graves\u2019s conviction for third degree sexual offense in 1998.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>The definition of \u201cchild sexual offender\u201d contained in \u00a7 792(a)(2) of the 1997 version of the statute retains its reference to individuals who had been convicted in other jurisdictions of offenses comparable to the Maryland crimes enumerated in the statute. In addition to child sexual offenders, the registration provisions of \u00a7 792 apply to offenders, sexually violent offenders, and sexually violent predators. Article 27, \u00a7 792(a)(6) of the Maryland Code defines \u201coffender\u201d by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">(6) \u201cOffender\u201d means a person who is ordered by the court to register under this section and who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">(i) Has been convicted of violating \u00a7 1, \u00a7 2, or \u00a7 338 of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">(ii) Has been convicted of violating \u00a7 337 of this article if the victim is under the age of 18 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">(iii) Has been convicted of the common law crime of false imprisonment if the victim is under the age of 18 years and the offender is not the victims\u2019 parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">(iv) Has been convicted of violating \u00a7 464C of this article if the victim is under the age of 18 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">(v) Has been convicted of soliciting a minor to engage in sexual conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-12\">(vi) Has been convicted of violating \u00a7 419A of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-13\">(vii) Has been convicted of violating \u00a7 15 of this article or any of the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 426 through 433 of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>article if the intended prostitute is under the age of 18 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\">(viii) Has been convicted of a crime that involves conduct that by its nature is a sexual offense against an individual under the age of 18 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">(ix) Has been convicted of an attempt to commit a crime listed in items (i) through (viii) of this paragraph; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">(x) Has been convicted in another state of an offense that, if committed in this State, would constitute one of the offenses listed in items (i) through (ix) of this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">A \u201csexually violent offender\u201d is defined in Article 27, \u00a7 792(a)(10) as a person who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">(i) Has been convicted of a sexually violent offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">(ii) Has been convicted of an attempt to commit a sexually violent offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">(iii) Has been convicted in another state of an offense that, if committed in this State, would constitute a sexually violent offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">Section 792(a)(ll) defines a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d as a person who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-12\">(i) Is convicted of a second or subsequent sexually violent offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-13\">(ii) Has been determined in accordance with this section to be at risk of committing a subsequent sexually violent offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">The statute defines a \u201csexually violent offense\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-15\">(i) A violation of any of the provisions of \u00a7 462, \u00a7 463, \u00a7 464, \u00a7 464A, \u00a7 464B, or \u00a7 464F of this article; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-16\">(ii) Assault with intent to commit rape in the first or second degree or a sexual offense in the first or second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>degree as previously proscribed under former \u00a7 12 of this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Article 27, \u00a7 792(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Under the statutory framework, classification as a sexually violent predator requires the trial court to engage in a two-step analysis. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(b)(1). The statute states that \u201cif a person is convicted of a second or subsequent sexually violent offense, the State\u2019s Attorney may request the court to determine before sentencing whether the person is a sexually violent predator.\u201d \u00a7 792(b)(1). This language mirrors the language of \u00a7 792(a)(ll)(i) which also limits consideration of status as a sexually violent predator to those cases where the individual in question has committed more than one sexually violent offense. To determine whether the accused has committed more than one sexually violent offense, the trial court must look to the language of \u00a7 792(a)(9), which establishes the criminal offenses designated as sexually violent under Maryland law. Once the trial court has made a finding that the accused has committed more than one sexually violent offense, it may proceed to the second step of its analysis, which requires the trial court to evaluate whether the person is at risk for committing additional sexually violent offenses. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(a)(ll)(ii). Section 792(b)(3) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">In making a determination under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court shall consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">(i) Any evidence that the court considers appropriate to the determination of whether the individual is a sexually violent predator, including the presentencing investigation and sexually violent offender\u2019s inmate record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-10\">(ii) Any evidence introduced by the person convicted; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-11\">(iii) At the request of the State\u2019s Attorney, any evidence presented by a victim of the sexually violent offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">Once the trial court has concluded that a person qualifies as a sexually violent predator, that person will be subject to the registration requirements attendant to such classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>The statute, effective in 1997, requires registrants who are residents of Maryland at the time they are released, receive probation, or sentenced in cases where the sentence does not include imprisonment, to register no later than the time of release, probation, or sentencing. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(c)(2)(i). Registrants who are not residents of Maryland must register within seven days of establishing a temporary or permanent residence in Maryland or applying for a Maryland driver\u2019s license. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(c)(2)(ii). Individuals classified as child sexual offenders also must register in person with the local law enforcement agency of the county in which they reside. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(c)(3). The registrant must provide the supervising authority with a signed statement which includes the individual\u2019s name including any aliases used, address, place of employment, social security number, and a description and the location of the criminal conduct which brings them within the purview of the sex offender registration statute. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services maintains a central registry containing the signed statement as well as photographs and fingerprints of the registrant. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(d)(3). All information maintained by the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services is also forwarded to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for its national database of sex offenders. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The duration of an individual\u2019s registration period varies with that person\u2019s classification under the statute. Sexual offenders and sexually violent offenders must register annually for a ten year period. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(h)(3). Those individuals found to be sexually violent predators are required to register every ninety days for a ten year period. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(h)(4). After the sexually violent predator has registered quarterly for a minimum of ten years, a petition may be filed with the court requesting a termination of that status as a sexually violent predator. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(k). Therefore, while it is possible to petition a court to have the sexually violent predator status removed, the registration period accorded to individuals who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>are classified as sexually violent predators is of a potentially infinite duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">When Congress designed the Wetterling Act, it afforded the states wide latitude in fashioning their sex offender registration statutes and the criteria for which a person .may be classified as a sexually violent predator. <em>See </em>Final Guidelines for the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, as Amended, 64 Fed. Reg. 572 (1999). As a result, the various state sex offender registration statutes take different approaches in setting forth the rules and requirements of registration. The majority of states use language which refers to comparable criminal acts committed in other jurisdictions when defining which individuals are subject to the registration requirements as sexual offenders and sexually violent predators, as well as in defining the meaning of a sexually violent offense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>nine states, including Maryland, specifically exclude reference to convictions in other states in their definitions of sexually violent predators and/or sexually violent offenses.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For a discussion of the varied legal and medical approaches for handling sex offenders, <em>see </em>Samuel Jan Brakel, J.D. <em>&amp; </em>James L. Cavanaugh, Jr., M.D., <em>Of Psychopaths and Pendulums: Legal and Psychiatric Treatment of Sex Offenders in the United States, </em>30 N.M. L.Rev. 69 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Graves interprets the definition of \u201csexually violent predator\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 792(a)(ll), to exclude consideration of sexually violent offenses committed in jurisdictions other than Maryland. The State concedes that the definition of \u201csexually violent predator\u201d does not include specific language regarding consideration of convictions for sexual offenses committed in other states. Nevertheless, the State asserts that there could be no doubt that the legislature intended to encompass out-of-state offenses within the definitions of \u201csexually violent offense\u201d and \u201csexually violent predator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">This Court has often stated that the \u201cparamount goal of statutory interpretation is to identify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute(s) at issue.\u201d <em>Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 335, 748 A.2d 478, 483 (2000)(citing <em>Robinson v. State, </em>353 Md. 683, 694, 728 A.2d 698, 703 (1999); <em>Blondell v. Baltimore Police, </em>341 Md. 680, 690, 672 A.2d 639, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>644 (1996)). To ascertain the legislative intent of the scope of the definitions of \u201csexually violent predator\u201d and \u201csexually violent offense,\u201d we must look first to the ordinary and plain meaning of the words of the statute. <em>See Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 672, 659 A.2d 1347, 1350 (1995); <em>In re Arnold M., </em>298 Md. 515, 520, 471 A.2d 313, 315 (1984). The language of \u00a7 792 must be viewed from a commonsensical perspective to avoid a farfetched interpretation. <em>See Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106, 112 (1994); <em>Dickerson v. State, </em>324 Md. 163, 171, 596 A.2d 648, 652 (1991). We have explained that \u201call parts of a statute are to be read together to find the intention as to any one part, and all parts are to be reconciled and harmonized if possible.\u201d <em>See Wheeler v. State, </em>281 Md. 593, 596, 380 A.2d 1052, 1055 (1977), <em>cert. denied, Maryland v. Wheeler, </em>435 U.S. 997, 98 S.Ct. 1650, 56 L.Ed.2d 86 (1978)(citing <em>Thomas v. State, </em>277 Md. 314, 317, 353 A.2d 256, 258 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">When considering the definition of a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d in the context of the statute as a whole, the plain meaning of the words selected by the General Assembly in crafting Maryland\u2019s Registration of Offenders statute yields the conclusion that the legislature specifically excluded reference to out-of-state convictions from the realm of criminal conduct to be taken into account in determining whether someone qualifies as a sexually violent predator and the imposition of enhanced registration requirements attendant to such classification. There simply is no reference to convictions in other jurisdictions in the definition of a sexually violent predator, as opposed to the explicit inclusion of out-of-state convictions in the definition of a sexually violent offender in \u00a7 792(a)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In the present case, our interpretation of the plain meaning of the definition of \u201csexually violent predator\u201d as excluding reference to out-of-state convictions also finds support in the legislative history of Senate Bill 605, the predecessor to \u00a7 792. Ordinarily, where the language of the statute is not ambiguous or obscure, this Court need not look beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the plain language of the statute to discern legislative intent. <em>See Wheeler, supra, </em>281 Md. at 596, 380 A.2d at 1054. Nevertheless, consideration of the background and procedural process of the enactment of \u00a7 792 assists us in understanding the statutory construction and context of the enactment of the legislation within the framework of Maryland criminal law. <em>See State v. Hernandez, </em>344 Md. 721, 726, 690 A.2d 526, 529 (1997)(explaining that \u201c[w]hen engaging in the interpretive process, however, the purpose, aim or policy of the legislature cannot be disregarded\u201d); <em>Cunningham v.

In this original version, the definition of a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d was a person who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">A(7) (I) 1. Has been convicted of a sexually violent offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">2. Has been convicted of an attempt to commit a sexually violent offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">3.

Has been found not criminally responsible for a sexually violent offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">5. Has been convicted in another state of an offense that, if committed in this state, would constitute a sexually violent offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">(II) Suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to commit a sexually violent offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Similarly, the same proposal contained the following definition of a \u201csexually violent offense\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">A(6) (I) A violation of any of the provisions of \u00a7 462, \u00a7 468, \u00a7 464, \u00a7 464A, \u00a7 464B, or \u00a7 464F of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">(II) Assault with intent to commit rape in the first or second degree or a sexual offense in the first or second degree as previously proscribed under former \u00a7 12 of this article; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">(III) An offense in another state that, if committed in this state, would constitute a violation described in items (I) or (II) of this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The legislative history for Senate Bill 605 supported the inclusion of extraterritorial criminal acts in the definitions of \u201csexually violent offense,\u201d \u201csexually violent offender,\u201d and \u201csexually violent predator.\u201d Both the Bill Analysis and the Floor Report for\u2019 Senate Bill 605 defined the term \u201csexually violent predator\u201d by reference to sexually violent offenses committed in Maryland as well those committed in other jurisdictions. The Bill Analysis provided the following description of a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">[A] person who has been: (1) convicted of a sexually violent offense, convicted of an attempt to commit a sexually violent offense, granted probation before judgment for a sexually violent offense, found not criminally responsible for a sexually violent offense, or convicted in another state of a crime that is considered a sexually violent offense in this State; and (2) found to suffer from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to commit a sexually violent offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Bill Analysis of Senate Bill 605 (1997). Whereas, the Floor Report defined a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-11\">[A] person who has been: (1) convicted of a sexually violent offense, convicted of an attempt to commit a sexually violent offense, granted probation before judgment for a sexually violent offense, found not criminally responsible for a sexually violent offense, or convicted in another state of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>crime that is considered a sexually violent offense in this State; and (2) has been determined by the court to be at risk of committing a subsequent sexually violent offense for the primary purpose of victimization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Floor Report, Senate Bill 605 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee proposed eight amendments to Senate Bill 605 after its first reading. One of the amendments required the removal of the term \u201cmental abnormality\u201d from the definition of a sexually violent predator, and required the additional finding that a person classified as a sexually violent predator must be one who is found to be at risk of committing a subsequent sexually violent offense. None of these amendments, however, concerned the removal of language referring to out-of-state convictions from the definition of a \u201csexually violent predator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services submitted a report to the Judicial Proceedings Committee which stressed the importance of having parallel state laws to enhance the effectiveness of the sex offender registration requirements when parolees move from state to state. The committee also received comments from several local and state law enforcement agencies which emphasized the importance of this legislation in preventing recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Senate Bill 605, however, appears to have been completely rewritten prior to enactment. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 792(a)(11) <em>with </em>1997 Md. Laws, ch. 754 at 4271. In the finalized amendments to Senate Bill 605 dated April 7, 1997, the General Assembly removed from the definitions of \u201csexually violent offense\u201d and \u201csexually violent predator\u201d all references to substantially similar offenses committed in other states which would qualify as sexually violent offenses in Maryland. <em>See </em>1997 Md. Laws, ch. 754. Instead, the statute requires that a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d be convicted of \u201ca second or subsequent sexually violent offense\u201d and be at risk of committing additional sexually violent offenses. \u00a7 792(a)(ll). The General Assembly revised the definition of \u201csexually violent offense\u201d in the final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>version of the statute by eliminating all reference to offenses committed in other jurisdictions which would be comparable to the Maryland offenses enumerated in \u00a7 792(a)(9). The General Assembly did, however, continue to define a \u201csexually violent offender\u201d by including a reference to those persons who have been \u201cconvicted in another state of an offense that, if committed in this state would constitute a sexually violent offense.\u201d \u00a7 792(a)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The State argues that the definition of \u201csexually violent offender\u201d includes extraterritorial criminal conduct, which eliminates the need to include specific language referring to convictions committed in other jurisdictions within the definition of sexually violent predator. We disagree. To read \u00a7 792(a)(11) to include convictions of sexually violent offenses committed in other jurisdictions as urged by the State would require an interpretive insertion of words and phrases into the statutory language which the General Assembly consciously and deliberately removed from the definitions of \u201csexually violent predator\u201d and \u201csexually violent offense\u201d in the legislation\u2019s final form. <em>See Wheeler, supra, </em>281 Md. at 596, 380 A.2d at 1054 (quoting <em>In Re Appeals Nos. 1022 &amp; 1081, </em>278 Md. 174, 178, 359 A.2d 556, 559 (1976))(\u201cwe. must confine ourselves to the statute as written, and may not attempt, under the guise of construction, to supply omissions or remedy possible defects in the statute.\u201d)(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Similarly, the provision of \u00a7 792(b)(3)\u00a9 which allows the trial court to consider \u201c[a]ny evidence that the court considers appropriate to the determination of whether the individual is a sexually violent predator\u201d is only triggered after the trial court has determined that the accused has committed a second or subsequent sexually violent offense under Maryland law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(a)(ll)(i). Once the trial court has determined that the defendant has' not committed a second or subsequent sexually violent offense, then the court\u2019s inquiry as to whether the individual may be classified as a sexually violent predator terminates.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>The General Assembly did not include language referring to out-of-state convictions in the legislation\u2019s final form other than in defining \u201csexually violent offender.\u201d We cannot add such language to the definitions of \u201csexually violent predator\u201d or \u201csexually violent offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">The General Assembly manifested its intent to limit the classification of sexually violent offenses, and therefore the predicate for determination of status as a sexually violent predator to criminal acts committed under specific provisions of Maryland law, by expressly deleting reference to comparable criminal acts committed in other jurisdictions. Where the legislature has \u201cexplicitly raised, considered, and then explicitly jettisoned\u201d particular statutory phrasing or framework, this Court must consider the statute as is, without adding to or deleting from the express language provided therein. <em>See Garnett v. State, </em>332 Md. 571, 585-587, 632 A.2d 797, 804-05 (1993)(finding that the absence of a <em>mens rea </em>requirement in the statutory provision for second degree rape resulted from \u201clegislative design\u201d). Furthermore, even if one were to hypothesize that the General Assembly had inadvertently or accidentally omitted the references to out-of-state offenses in the definitions of \u201csexually violent offense\u201d and \u201csexually violent predator\u201d in the final version of the legislation, we have held that this Court \u201ccould not invade the function of the legislature\u201d by reading missing language into a statute thus rendering it incapable of correcting \u201can omission in the language of a statute even though it appeared to be the obvious result of inadvertence.\u201d <em>Coleman v. State, </em>281 Md. 538, 547, 380 A.2d 49, 55 (1977)(discussing <em>Birmingham v. Board of Public Works, </em>249 Md. 443, 449-50, 239 A.2d 923, 926 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The State argues that \u201cit is inconceivable that the General Assembly intended to exclude sex offenders of the most serious classification based on their out-of-state convictions.\u201d Nevertheless, the General Assembly managed to do just that by redacting the references to out-of-state convictions from the definitions of \u201csexually violent offense\u201d and \u201csexually violent predator.\u201d If the General Assembly had intended for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>the reference to out-of-state convictions listed in the definition of \u201csexually violent offender\u201d at \u00a7 792(a)(10) to apply to the definition of \u201csexually violent predator,\u201d the General Assembly would have cross-referenced the definition of \u201csexually violent offender\u201d within its definition of a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d in \u00a7 792(a)(ll).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">We decline to read into \u00a7 792(a)(ll) the ability to base a person\u2019s status as a sexually violent predator on convictions or guilty pleas for offenses occurring and charged in other jurisdictions. Graves pled guilty to third degree sexual offense, a violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 464B. A conviction for a violation of \u00a7 464B qualifies as a sexually violent offense for purposes of the sex offender registration statute. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(a)(9). The trial judge, however, considered Graves\u2019s 1992 conviction in the District of Columbia for indecent acts on a minor in finding Graves to be a sexually violent predator under the sex offender registration statute. While \u00a7 792(b)(3) permits the trial court to consider the evidence of the 1992 conviction in evaluating the likelihood of Graves\u2019s recidivism pursuant to the second prong of the sexually violent predator analysis set forth in \u00a7 792(a)(ll)(ii), the plain language of the statute limits the definition of a sexually violent offense to specific offenses under Maryland law. Thus, the definition of \u201csexually violent offense\u201d bars the trial court\u2019s consideration of Graves\u2019s out-of-state conviction in establishing his 1998 conviction as a \u201csecond or subsequent sexually violent offense\u201d for purposes of classification as a sexually violent predator. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(a)(9) and (11). Accordingly, Graves does not meet the requirements of the enhanced registration prescribed for sexually violent predators in \u00a7 792(h)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO VACATE THE SENTENCE IMPOSED BY THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY FOR NEW SENTENCING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION.

H.R.Rep. No. 103-392, at 3 (1993). The Wetterling Act established guidelines for registering sex offenders and providing notification for persons convicted of sexually violent offenses or criminal offenses against minors, or who were determined to be sexually violent predators. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14071. Each state had until September 13, 1997, to enact legislation implementing a sex offender registration statute in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the Federal Act, or risk losing federal funding apportioned to the states for crime fighting programs. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14071(g); H.R.

The public outrage associated with the murder of Megan Kanka prompted the states and the federal government to reexamine the structure of their respective sex offender registration statutes. Congress responded by amending the Wetterling Act in May 1996, renaming it Megan's Law, to require the states to add language to their statutes mandating the release of relevant sex offender registrant information necessary to protect the public. <em>See </em>H.R. 2137, 104th Cong. (1996), reprinted in 110 Stat. 1345 (1996). Presently, all fifty states have adopted some form of sex offender registration laws or established community notification programs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\">. The Registration of Sexual Offenders Act has been subsequently amended by Chapters 473 and 521, Acts 1998; Chapters 317 and 402, Acts 1999; and Chapter 314, Acts 2000. The effects of these amendments, however, do not change the substance of the provisions under consideration in Graves's appeal before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b373-5\">. The Prince George's County Grand Jury indictment charged Graves with criminal acts committed from a period of January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1997. The State never provided any specific dates during 1997 in which the criminad events allegedly took place. The amendments to the Registration of Sexual Offenders statute which created the classifications of \"sexually violent predator\u201d and \u201csexually violent offense\u201d requiring enhanced registration for those individuals found by the trial court to be sexually violent predators did not take effect until October 1, 1997. Thus, from the facts contained in the record in this case it is impossible to determine which of the criminal acts Graves was charged with took place prior to the statutory amendments, and which acts took place after the amendments went into effect. Ordinarily, a criminal defendant will not be entitled to a windfall from the amendment, revision, or repealing of a statute where the legislature altered the statute during the course of the litigation. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>285 Md. 339, 346, 402 A.2d 876, 880 (1979). Unless a statute specifically states an intent to the contrary, the provisions of Maryland's general savings clause, Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.) Article 1, \u00a7 3, operate to uphold \"any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under a statute which is subsequently repealed or amended.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 345, 402 A.2d at 879. The general savings clause provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">The repeal, or the repeal and reenactment, or the revision, amendment or consolidation of any statute, or of any section or part of a section of any statute, civil or criminal, shall not have the effect to release, extinguish, alter, modify or change, in whole or in part, any penalty, forfeiture or liability, either civil or criminal, which shall have been incurred under such statute, section or part thereof, unless the repealing, repealing and reenacting, revising, amending or consolidating act shall expressly so provide; and such statute, section or part thereof, so repealed, repealed and reenacted, revised, amended or consolidated, shall be treated and held as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any and all proper actions, suits, proceedings or prosecutions, civil or criminal, for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture or liability, as well as for the purpose of sustaining any judgment, decree or order which can or may be rendered, entered or made in such actions, suits, proceedings or prosecutions imposing, inflicting or declaring such penalty, forfeiture or liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.) Article 1, \u00a7 3. Where the effective date of a statute abrogating a prior statutory or common law provision falls within a window of time during which an alleged criminal offense took place, the State must prove that the conduct complained of actually took place during the appropriate period of time, either pre- or post-effective date of the statute depending on the facts and circumstances of the conduct and statutory provisions which the State seeks 1o invoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>through prosecution. <em>See Robinson v.
