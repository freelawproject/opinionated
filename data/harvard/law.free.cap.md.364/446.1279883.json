Glendening, </em>349 Md. 660, 709 A.2d 1230 (1998), in which this Court upheld the authority of the Attorney General of Maryland to enter into a contingent fee contract with the Law Offices of Peter G. Angelos, P.C., for the purpose of representing the State in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>litigation against the tobacco industry. The present appeal involves a dispute over legal fees and expenses following the settlement of the tobacco litigation. The primary question decided by the trial court and debated by the parties on appeal is whether the Attorney General\u2019s authority to hire private legal counsel is subject to Maryland\u2019s general procurement law, Maryland Code (1988, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 11-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Finance and Procurement Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For reasons set forth later in this opinion, we shall not reach this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In 1996, with the approval of the Governor and the Board of Public Works, the Attorney General entered into a contingent fee contract with the Firm to \u201cprovide legal counsel, representation, and litigation services to the Attorney General and the State of Maryland in connection with the litigation against the tobacco industry.\u201d The contract provides for the Firm to be paid a fee of 25% of the State\u2019s recovered funds in addition to reasonable expenses incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u2022 The State\u2019s litigation against the tobacco industry eventually settled in November 1998. The form of that settlement was a \u201cMaster Settlement Agreement\u201d that disposed of the claims of the states that had sued the tobacco industry. The settlement agreement created a mechanism for private counsel to be paid their fees from the tobacco industry. The Attorney General requested that the Firm initially seek its fee under the settlement agreement\u2019s reimbursement mechanism. The Firm, however, submitted three separate contract claims to the Attorney General. Each claim asserted that the Firm is entitled to 25% of the State\u2019s estimated $4.4 billion recovery from the settlement. The Attorney General denied the Firm\u2019s contract claims. The Attorney General also concluded that the contract at issue is not a procurement contract and thus is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>not subject to the jurisdiction of the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals. The Firm administratively appealed the Attorney General\u2019s denials by filing a complaint with the Board of Contract Appeals. That action is still pending before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">On December 8, 1999, before any action by the Board and after the denials of the Firm\u2019s contract claims, the State and the Attorney General filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against the Firm. The State alleged that the Firm breached its contractual and fiduciary duties by failing to seek an award of its legal fees and expenses directly from the tobacco industry. The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief including a declaration that the Firm\u2019s 25% contingent fee is unreasonable, excessive, and in violation of Rule 1.5 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Firm denied that the State was entitled to relief and filed a two count counterclaim seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>specific performance of the contract. The case proceeded through discovery, and the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The Attorney General also filed a motion with the Board of Contract Appeals to dismiss the Firm\u2019s appeal to the Board on the ground that the Board lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the disputed contract. The Attorney General argued that Maryland\u2019s general procurement law does not apply to the Attorney General\u2019s authority to hire outside counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Instead, the Attorney General argued, the employment of private counsel is governed solely by the provisions of Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 6-105 of the State Government Article.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Board denied the Attorney General\u2019s motion to dismiss in a written opinion in which the Board determined that the Firm \u201cis an independent contractor whose Contract is covered by the General Procurement Law and thus subject to the dispute resolution jurisdiction of this Board\u201d pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u00a7 15-211 of the State Finance and Procurement Article.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">After the Board\u2019s interlocutory decision that it had jurisdiction, the Attorney General filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City challenging the Board\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over the contract dispute. The Firm intervened in that case and filed a motion to dismiss the petition, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Board had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In a written memorandum opinion and order, the Circuit Court held that the contract between the Attorney General and the Firm is a procurement contract pursuant to the general procurement law and that, therefore, the Board of Contract Appeals has primary jurisdiction to resolve the dispute. Because of its conclusion that the Board has jurisdiction over the dispute, the Circuit Court declined to issue a writ of certiorari. Accordingly, the court entered a final judgment in the certiorari action for the Board of Contract Appeals and the Firm and against the Attorney General. The Circuit Court simultaneously dismissed, without prejudice, the declaratory judgment action filed by the Attorney General and the State against the Firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The State filed notices of appeal in both the declaratory judgment action and in the certiorari action, and the Firm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>filed a notice of cross-appeal in the declaratory judgment case. Prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, the State filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review of the Circuit Court\u2019s decisions in both cases, and we granted the petition. <em>State et al. v. Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals and Law Offices of Peter G. Angelos, P.C., </em>361 Md. 433, 761 A.2d 932 (2000). The State presents two questions for review, which we re-state as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">1. Is the contract for legal representation that the Attorney General entered into with the Law Offices of Peter G. Angelos, P.C., pursuant to Maryland Code, \u00a7 6-105 of the State Government Article, subject to the State procurement law, \u00a7\u00a7 11-101 <em>et seq., </em>of the State Finance and Procurement Article, such that the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals has jurisdiction over disputes under that contract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">2. Did the Circuit Court err in dismissing, without prejudice, the State\u2019s action against the Firm for declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that the Board of Contract Appeals and not the Circuit Court has jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 fee dispute?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Additionally, the Firm asks us to consider whether the State lacks standing to bring the declaratory judgment action because, according to the Firm, the Board of Public Works effectively transferred or disposed of the State\u2019s interest in the 25% share of the settlement pursuant to the Board\u2019s authority under \u00a7 10-305 of the State Finance and Procurement Article, thereby extinguishing any claim by the State.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">We shall first address the certiorari action filed in the Circuit Court. Recently, in <em>Board of License Commissioners v. Corridor Wine, </em>361 Md. 403, 761 A.2d 916 (2000), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>this Court reviewed the three distinct uses of a writ of certiorari under current Maryland practice. We stated (361 Md. at 410-412, 761 A.2d at 920):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\"><em>\u201cFirst, </em>pursuant to statute, the writ is issued by the Court of Appeals in the exercise of the Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 through 12-203 and 12-305 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\"><em>\u201cSecond, </em>when there is no statutory provision for judicial review of final adjudicatory decisions by administrative agencies, either a certiorari or a mandamus action in the appropriate circuit court is normally available for ordinary \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 judicial review of the adjudicatory administrative decisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\"><em>\u201cThird, </em>\u2018it has long been the common law rule in Maryland that a circuit court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari to a lower court for the purpose of inquiring into that tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\u2019 <em>Kawamura v. State, </em>299 Md. 276, 283, 473 A.2d 438, 442 (1984).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The second use of a writ of certiorari applies only where there is no statutory authorization for judicial review. With regard to the case at bar, \u00a7 15-223 of the State Finance and Procurement Article authorizes any party, including a unit of state government, to bring a circuit court action for judicial review of a final decision of the Board of Contract Appeals. The third use of a writ of certiorari is for the purpose of examining the jurisdiction of an inferior tribunal, even in the absence of a final decision by that tribunal. The Attorney General\u2019s certiorari action purportedly fell within this third category. The Attorney General sought a circuit court determination of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction even though there was no final decision by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">The certiorari action brought by the Attorney General, challenging the Board of Contract Appeals\u2019 jurisdiction over the contract dispute, does not lie under the circumstances of this case. In <em>Corridor Wine, supra, </em>we held that a circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>court\u2019s authority to issue a writ of certiorari to an inferior tribunal, for the purpose of inquiring into that tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over a case pending before the tribunal, does not apply to an action pending before an administrative agency in the executive branch of state government or local government. Administrative agencies like the Board of Contract Appeals, we explained, are not inferior tribunals in relation to the circuit courts; rather they are independent units of the executive branch of state government. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-206 of the State Finance and Procurement Article. <em>See also Shell Oil Co. v. Supervisor, </em>276 Md. 36, 44-47, 343 A.2d 521, 525-527 (1975) (administrative agencies are not courts of limited jurisdiction and are generally not within the judicial branch of government). Furthermore, circuit courts do not exercise appellate or oversight jurisdiction in regard to such administrative agencies. Oversight of state administrative agencies is generally vested in the executive branch of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Therefore, the authority of a circuit court to issue a writ of certiorari to determine whether an inferior tribunal has jurisdiction over a matter pending before that tribunal is limited to matters pending before the District Court of Maryland or one of the orphans\u2019 courts. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City was not authorized to review, by certiorari, the interlocutory jurisdiction decision of the Board of Contract Appeals. The court should have declined to issue the writ of certiorari on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The State, in its appeal from the dismissal of the declaratory judgment action, argues that a contract entered into by the Attorney General for outside legal services is not a procurement contract and thus is not within the jurisdiction of the Board of Contract Appeals. The State contends that the Circuit Court erred in holding that the contract was a procurement contract and in holding that the Board of Contract Appeals had jurisdiction over the matter. In our view, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>er, the more appropriate question is whether, under all of the circumstances, the parties are entitled to a judicial decision concerning the nature of the contract prior to a final decision by the Board of Contract Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Where an administrative agency has primary or exclusive jurisdiction over a controversy, the parties to the controversy must ordinarily await a final administrative decision before resorting to the courts for resolution of the controversy. <em>Board of License Commissioners v. Corridor Wine, supra, </em>361 Md. at 418, 761 A.2d at 924, and cases there cited. <em>See also Furnitureland South, Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>364 Md. 126, 771 A.2d 1061 (2001). Furthermore, in <em>Driggs Corp. v. Md. Aviation, </em>348 Md. 389, 406-408, 704 A.2d 433, 442-443 (1998), we held that the Board of Contract Appeals has either primary or exclusive jurisdiction over government contract matters encompassed by \u00a7 15-211 of the State Finance and Procurement Article and that, consequently, any judicial resolution of the matter, before a final decision by the Board of Contract Appeals, would be premature.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The State argues, however, that where the administrative agency has no jurisdiction over a controversy, the parties need not wait for a final administrative decision but are entitled to an immediate judicial resolution of the matter. In situations where a controversy or matter is pending before an adjudicatory administrative agency, we have assumed, without deciding, that a party need not await a final administrative decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>where the administrative \u201c \u2018agency is palpably without jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Comm\u2019n On Human Relations v. Mass Transit, </em>294 Md. 225, 235, 449 A.2d 385, 390 (1982), quoting Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise, </em>Ch. 20, \u00a7 20.01 at 56 (1958). <em>See Board of License Commissioners v. Corridor Wine, supra, </em>361 Md. at 418, 761 A.2d at 924; <em>Montgomery County v. Ward, </em>331 Md. 521, 527, 629 A.2d 619, 622 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Regardless of how the \u201cprocurement contract\u201d issue is ultimately resolved, it is obvious that the Board of Contract Appeals is not \u201cpalpably without jurisdiction.\u201d The contract at issue is a government contract for the procurement of legal services to be rendered to the State of Maryland. It was submitted by the Attorney General to the Board of Public Works for approval by that Board. <em>See </em>\u00a7 12-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Finance and Procurement Article. While it may or may not technically be a \u201cprocurement contract\u201d within the meaning of the state procurement law, the issue is obviously a reasonably debatable one. As the agency charged with making final administrative adjudications under the procurement law, the Board of Contract Appeals\u2019 determination of the issue, embodied in a final decision by the Board, would be helpful prior to a judicial resolution of the issue. This is clearly not a situation where the Board of Contract Appeals is \u201cpalpably without jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Accordingly, the Circuit Court erred in deciding that the contract was a \u201cprocurement contract\u201d and in dismissing the declaratory judgment action on this ground. Instead, the Circuit Court should have refrained from reaching the issue at this stage, and should have stayed the declaratory judgment action pending a final decision by the Board of Contract Appeals. <em>See, e.g., McCullough v. Wittner, </em>314 Md. 602, 613, 552 A.2d 881, 886 (1989); <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. Comm\u2019n v. Crawford, </em>307 Md. 1, 18, 511 A.2d 1079, 1087-1088 (1986); <em>Bd. of Ed. for Dorchester Co. v. Hubbard, </em>305 Md. 774, 792-793, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>506 A.2d 625, 634 (1986); <em>Offutt v. Montgomery Co. Bd. of Ed., </em>285 Md. 557, 562, 404 A.2d 281, 284 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">We now turn to the Firm\u2019s cross-appeal. Essentially, the Firm contends that the Board of Public Works\u2019 authority to transfer or dispose of State property effectively extinguished the State\u2019s right or interest in the 25% share of the funds recovered from the tobacco industry. The Firm relies on the language in \u00a7 10-305(a)(l) of the State Finance and Procurement Article which provides that \u201c[a]ny real or personal property of the State or unit of the State government may be sold, leased, transferred, exchanged, granted or otherwise disposed of\u2019 to \u201cany person ... for a consideration the Board decides is adequate.\u201d In other words, the Firm argues that, when it entered into the contingent fee contract with the Attorney General, a property right was immediately vested on its behalf in 25% of any funds which might be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The Firm\u2019s argument is completely without merit. We know of no case which stands for the proposition that, upon entering a contingent fee contract, the contract creates an immediate property right in the possible future fee. Rather, a contingent fee contract between an attorney and client, providing for a fee to be paid based on the recovered damages, is simply a contract and as such gives rise to a breach of contract action. <em>See, e.g., Post v. Bregman, </em>349 Md. 142, 707 A.2d 806 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\n<em>IN THE CERTIORARI ACTION, THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY IS AFFIRMED.
