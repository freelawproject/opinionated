The trial judge sentenced Petitioner to twenty years imprisonment for first degree assault, ten years for attempted voluntary manslaughter (to be served concurrent with the sentence for first degree assault), and twenty years for the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence (to be served consecutively to the sentence for first degree assault). On appeal, in an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgments and remanded the case for a new trial. <em>Dixon v. State, </em>No. 203, Sept. Term, 1998, unreported, 123 Md.App. 797, filed 30 October 1998, <em>cert. denied, </em>352 Md. 619, 724 A.2d 21 (1999) <em>(Dixon I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">On remand, trial was commenced anew on the same charges, but presided over by a different trial judge. At the conclusion of the evidence, the State was permitted, over Petitioner\u2019s objection, to enter a nolle prosequi<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the attempted voluntary manslaughter count. A jury again convicted Petitioner of first degree assault and the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. The judge sentenced Petitioner to twenty years imprisonment for the first degree assault and twenty years for the handgun violation, to be served consecutive to the sentence on the assault conviction. The Court of Special Appeals, on direct appeal, affirmed. <em>Dixon v. State, </em>133 Md.App. 325, 755 A.2d 560 (2000) <em>(Dixon II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>We granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, <em>Dixon v. </em>State, 361 Md. 433, 761 A.2d 932 (2000), to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">Was Petitioner illegally sentenced to twenty years for first degree assault where in a prior trial he was convicted of attempted voluntary manslaughter and first degree assault and sentenced to concurrent terms of ten and twenty years, respectively, and the Court of Special Appeals, upon reversing the convictions, concluded for the trial court\u2019s guidance on remand that first degree assault should have merged into attempted voluntary manslaughter, and on retrial the State was allowed, over objection, to nol pros the attempted voluntary manslaughter charge?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The crime in this case occurred during the early morning hours on 23 May 1997. According to the evidence, the victim, Edward Johnson, and his friend, Senee Paquita Waiters, after consuming their supply of crack cocaine, went in search of more. At approximately 2:00 a.m., they drove to the intersection of Virginia Avenue and Forest Terrace in Prince George\u2019s County. Johnson had purchased drugs in this area before. Johnson pulled the car over to where two men were standing with Petitioner and asked the group if they had any drugs. Petitioner responded affirmatively and told Johnson to drive the car to the other side of the street. Johnson complied and, after exiting the car, began talking with Petitioner. An altercation ensued, and Petitioner fired five shots, striking Johnson four times in the lower back and hip, and striking a bystander, Michael Prioleau, once in the eye. All of the charges upon which Petitioner was tried in the present case related to the acts against Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">A <em>Dixon I </em>\u2014 The <em>First Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9x\">A jury, on 12 December 1997, convicted Petitioner of attempted voluntary manslaughter, first degree assault, and the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. At the same time, the jury found Petitioner not guilty of attempt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>ed first degree murder, attempted second degree murder, and reckless endangerment. At sentencing, Petitioner\u2019s attorney argued that the first degree assault conviction merged into the attempted voluntary manslaughter conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial judge apparently disagreed<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and ordered separate sentences for each of Petitioner\u2019s convictions \u2014 twenty years imprisonment for first degree assault, ten years concurrent for volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>tary manslaughter, and twenty years for the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence conviction, to be served consecutive to the assault conviction sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><em>B. Dixon I </em>\u2014 The <em>Court of Special Appeals \u2019s Opinion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The intermediate appellate court\u2019s unreported opinion of 30 October 1998, directed vacation of the Circuit Court\u2019s judgments and remanded the case for a new trial. The Court of Special Appeals considered five questions in its opinion. With regard to the third question, the holding as to which served as the reason the intermediate appellate court vacated the trial court\u2019s judgments, the court determined that the Circuit Court failed to make a sufficient inquiry into a reported violation during trial of its sequestration order. The appellate court, however, proceeded to volunteer to address the remaining four questions presented by Petitioner \u201cfor the court\u2019s guidance on remand.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">The fifth question<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the court addressed was whether \u201cthe trial court err[ed] by imposing separate sentences upon the convictions for first degree assault and attempted manslaughter.\u201d Petitioner argued that, under the required evidence test,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the first degree assault conviction merged into the attempted voluntary manslaughter conviction. On the merger issue, the intermediate appellate court responded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>First degree assault is a relatively new statutory crime which only took effect on October 1, 1996, and the question of whether it would merge into a manslaughter conviction is a matter of first impression. The first degree assault crime appears as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">(a) <em>Serious physical injury; use of a firearm. </em>\u2014 (1) A person may not intentionally cause or attempt to cause serious physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">(2) A person may not commit an assault with a firearm .... <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 12A-1. On the other hand, attempted voluntary manslaughter<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is a common law crime which requires the specific intent to kill and a substantial step toward the perpetration of a homicide in the heat of passion in response to legally adequate provocation. <em>See Cox v. State, </em>69 Md.App. 396 [, 518 A.2d 132] (1986), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>311 Md. 326 [, 534 A.2d 1333] (1988).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">An examination of the first prong of the first degree assault crime makes clear that there are no elements present which cannot be found as elements of attempted voluntary manslaughter. A conviction based on the first prong of first degree assault, therefore, would merge into a convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>tion for voluntary manslaughter under the required evidence test. The second prong of first degree assault, however, contains at least the additional element of the use of a firearm. Thus, ... to determine whether [Petitioner\u2019s] first degree assault conviction should merge into the voluntary manslaughter conviction, we must know which prong of the first degree assault crime was used to convict [Petitioner]. (Footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded, however, that it was unable to make this latter determination as the record was ambiguous. The intermediate appellate court noted that the Circuit Court instructed the jury that it could convict Petitioner of first degree assault under either modality, (a)(1) or (a)(2), of the first degree assault statute <em>(see supra </em>note 6), and \u201cthe jury returned a verdict of guilty on the first degree assault charge without indicating which alternative it used to convict\u201d Petitioner.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">The Court of Special Appeals then turned to the legislative history of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 12A-1, but determined that it did not shed light on whether the Legislature intended the statutory crime to be separate from attempted voluntary manslaughter. The court next considered the \u201crule of lenity,\u201d which the court described as \u201cproviding] that any ambiguity concerning whether the legislature intended multiple punishments for the same transaction will be resolved against creating multiple offenses out of the single transaction.\u201d (Citing <em>White v. State, </em>318 Md. 740, 744, [569 A.2d 1271, 1273] (1990)); <em>see infra </em>note 38. The intermediate appellate court explained further:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">The Court of Appeals has applied the rule of lenity when one offense is statutory and the other common law. <em>See White, </em>318 Md. at 745-47, [ 569 A.2d at 1273-72]. That is the situation which confronts us. [Petitioner\u2019s] shooting of Johnson was a single transaction from which both first degree assault, a statutory offense, and attempted manslaughter, a common law offense, resulted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals concluded that under <em>Snowden v. State, </em>321 Md. 612, 583 A.2d 1056 (1991), <em>supra </em>note 5, due to the ambiguity regarding the exact basis of the jury\u2019s verdict and the lack of guidance in the legislative history, the court must give Petitioner the benefit of the doubt and merge the sentence for first degree assault \u201cinto the greater sentence of attempted voluntary manslaughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><em>C. Dixon II </em>\u2014 The <em>Second Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">On remand, Petitioner was tried again on the charges of attempted voluntary manslaughter, first degree assault, and the use of a handgun. At the conclusion of the evidence, the State was permitted, over objection by Petitioner\u2019s attorney, to enter a nolle prosequi as to the attempted voluntary manslaughter count.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The jury found Petitioner guilty of first degree assault and of the use of a handgun. At the sentencing hearing on 19 May 1999, a trial judge different than the one who presided in <em>Dixon I </em>considered the import of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion in <em>Dixon I. </em>The colloquy was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">THE COURT: There\u2019s one wrinkle in this, but I think that the wrinkle can be explained away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">[PETITIONER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I\u2019m sorry. What is that? THE COURT: The wrinkle is this. Judge Rymer [the trial judge in <em>Dixon I </em>] sentenced him to 10 years for the involuntary\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">[PETITIONER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: The attempted involuntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">THE COURT: \u2014 manslaughter, which was the maximum. He then sentenced him to 20 years for the first degree assault. The Court of Special Appeals said that the first degree assault actually merged into the involuntary man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>slaughter. I think that\u2019s what they said. If that is what they said, although it merges \u2014 see, he ran them concurrent. [PETITIONER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-4\">THE COURT: Although it merges, I think it really reduces, in effect, the maximum sentence for first degree assault down to 10 years. I could be wrong. But I think it does. And if you look at it that way, then the first degree assault, instead of being 20 years, would be 10 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">Although that might be the legal effect, and although I allowed the State to enter as nolle prosequi the involuntary manslaughter, I think the 20 years is still possible, because, see normally you can\u2019t allow the State to enter nolle prosequi on something that\u2019s going to be detrimental to the Defense in retrial....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">And I allowed [the State] to nol pros that because it made sense to do that. So then that raises the issue, does that limit the first degree assault to 10 years, as opposed to 20 years, because the original sentence would have merged the 20-year sentence of the first degree assault into the 10 year sentence of the involuntary manslaughter, and would have resulted in a 10 year sentence. I think that\u2019s the law. It\u2019s peculiar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">THE COURT: I thought about this all during the trial. And I especially thought about it when I allowed you to nol pros involuntary manslaughter, because, normally, you cannot \u2014 you had a right to nol pros it because it was not a lesser included offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-8\">On the other hand, I don\u2019t think you have a right to nol pros it to the detriment of the Defendant. I think the thought there is the same; that that goes through my mind. [Prosecution has not] mentioned this, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ace\">[PROSECUTION]: I will address it, but I\u2019ll wait till [Petitioner\u2019s attorney] finishes his allocution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll understand what your position is going to be, and you may be 100 percent correct. But I want Annapolis to know that it has at least been considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Petitioner\u2019s attorney asked the trial judge, in light of the foregoing remarks, to sentence Petitioner to no more than ten years for the first degree assault conviction and to sentence him to a concurrent sentence, within the sentencing guidelines, on the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence conviction. The State responded that the trial judge was not limited to the ten year sentence on the involuntary manslaughter in <em>Dixon I </em>as to the first degree assault conviction in <em>Dixon II </em>because \u201c[gjiven that in the posture with which this trial was brought before us now, most recently, there was no \u2014 well the attempted manslaughter was not a lesser included anything. And as Your Honor has said, that\u2019s why you allowed me to nol pros that charge.\u201d The State argued- that the judge should follow the intent of the trial judge in <em>Dixon I, </em>which was to sentence Petitioner to twenty years for first degree assault, notwithstanding the ten year concurrent sentence for attempted voluntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The State further asserted that the intent of the judge in the first trial, that Petitioner serve a total of forty years\u2014 twenty years for first degree assault (the ten concurrent years for voluntary manslaughter being inconsequential to the sentencing in the second trial due to the nol pros) and twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>consecutive years for the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence \u2014 should be followed in <em>Dixon </em>II.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The judge responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">I agree with [the State]. I think that\u2019s the intent of 12-702(b);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that you do not exceed the sentence; not that you do not exceed the sentence for any particular offense, but that the overall sentence will not be exceeded in a retrial. I really believe that that is the intent of the Court\u2019s Article, Item 702(B) [sic]. I really do. And I have thought about that very, very seriously.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The judge then sentenced Petitioner to twenty years imprisonment for the first degree assault conviction and twenty years consecutive for the conviction of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>D. Dixon II </em>\u2014 The <em>Court of Special Appeals\u2019s Second Opinion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Petitioner appealed again to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court addressed, among other issues, the question of whether, in the sentences resulting from the second trial, the twenty year sentence for first degree assault violated Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-702(b) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (CJP). Petitioner argued, employing CJP \u00a7 12-702(b), \u201cthat the merger of the first degree assault into attempted voluntary manslaughter alluded to by [the unreported Court of Special Appeals\u2019s] opinion in <em>Dixon I </em>should compel a sentencing \u2018cap\u2019 of ten years, the maximum penalty for attempted manslaughter, at the retrial where an attempted manslaughter count was never submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>Dixon, </em>133 Md.App. at 336, 755 A.2d at 566. The Court of Special Appeals disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The intermediate appellate court reasoned that the sentence resulting from the second trial did not result in a greater sentence than imposed in <em>Dixon I </em>in violation of CJP \u00a7 12-702(b). <em>Dixon, </em>133 Md.App. at 338, 755 A.2d at 567. The court began by reasoning that because the Circuit Court in the first trial actually did not sentence Petitioner to ten years for the attempted voluntary manslaughter/f\u00edrst degree assault conviction, regardless of whether the court should have for the purposes of CJP \u00a7 12-702(b) and the federal Due Process Clause, \u201cit is beyond dispute that the standard against which we measure any subsequent sentence is the original sentence that actually WAS, not the sentence that arguably SHOULD HAVE BEEN.\u201d <em>Dixon, </em>133 Md.App. at 337, 755 A.2d at 566 (emphasis in original). Disregarding the twenty-year consecutive sentences imposed at both trials for the unlawful use of a handgun as inconsequential to the present discussion, the court concluded that because no attempted voluntary manslaughter conviction resulted from the second trial, the ten year sentence imposed for attempted voluntary manslaughter at the first trial was not a factor to be considered at the second sentencing; the trial judge at the second trial was not limited in sentencing for the first degree assault by a ten year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>cap. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court reasoned that the twenty year sentence imposed at the second trial for first degree assault was the same sentence imposed at the first trial for first degree assault; there was no increase in sentence \u201cwithin the contemplation of <em>North Carolina v. Pearce </em>[, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), <em>(see infra </em>pp. 223-25) ] or [CJP] \u00a7 12-702(b)\u201d <em>(see supra </em>note 12). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The Court of Special Appeals then discussed Petitioner\u2019s \u201calternative theory for a sentencing cap.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court explained its interpretation of the difference between Petitioner\u2019s alternative arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">Whereas the earlier subcontention, involving the risk of vindictive resentencing, can only be triggered by the sequence of 1) an original conviction and sentence, 2) an appellate reversal followed by a retrial, and 3) a reconviction and resentencing, this second subcontention is unconcerned with any trial sequence. [Petitioner\u2019s] argument would be precisely the same if there had never been an earlier trial. Even in the limited, present-tense context of a single trial, however, [Petitioner\u2019s] argument does rely on the <em>dicta </em>from our opinion reviewing the first trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-7\"><em>Dixon, </em>133 Md.App. at 338, 755 A.2d at 567. The intermediate appellate court determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">If the first degree assault in this case should turn out to have been a lesser included offense within the greater inclusive charge of attempted manslaughter, the ten-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>penalty \u201ccap\u201d should, indeed, have been applied. If, on the other hand, the first-degree assault in this case was not a lesser included offense, then there never was a penalty \u201ccap\u201d and the twenty-year sentence for the assault was properly imposed. What remains for us to consider, therefore, is the senior/junior relationship between those two offenses under the circumstances of this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><em>Dixon, </em>133 Md.App. at 343, 755 A.2d at 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In determining this alternative argument, and thus focusing on the second trial rather than on the first, the court resolved, relying primarily upon <em>Nightingale v. State, </em>312 Md. 699, 542 A.2d 373 (1988), <em>Vogel v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 56, 543 A.2d 398 (1988), <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 373 A.2d 262 (1977), and <em>State v. Frye, </em>283 Md. 709, 393 A.2d 1372 (1978), that unlike the first trial, as discussed in dicta in the unreported Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion in <em>Dixon I, </em>there was no ambiguity in the second trial \u201cas to the basis for the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty on the charge of first degree assault,\u201d and thus there was no need to call upon the \u201crule of lenity\u201d to clarify any vagueness regarding the basis for the first degree assault conviction. Rather, \u201c[t]he hypothetical possibility discussed in the <em>dicta </em>never came to pass.\u201d <em>Dixon, </em>133 Md.App. at 343-53, 755 A.2d at 570-75. The court reasoned that it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">clear [in the second trial] that the variety of first-degree assault that would merge into a conviction for attempted voluntary manslaughter was NOT REQUIRED to sustain the first-degree assault conviction here. That conviction rested, albeit redundantly, on an independent basis. That independent rationale, moreover, had a unique element, the use of a firearm, NOT REQUIRED to prove attempted voluntary manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-8\"><em>Dixon, </em>133 Md.App. at 353, 755 A.2d at 575 (emphasis in original) (applying <em>Nightingale v. State, </em>312 Md. 699, 542 A.2d 373 (1988)). Thus, the court concluded that first degree assault conviction in the second trial was not the lesser included offense of attempted voluntary manslaughter and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\u201cwas not, therefore, subject to any penalty \u2018cap.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dixon, </em>133 Md.App. at 354, 755 A.2d at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">We disagree with the Court of Special Appeals. We conclude that convictions for attempted voluntary manslaughter and first degree assault of the (a)(1) variety merge under the required evidence test, while the (a)(2) variety does not. At Petitioner\u2019s first trial, the jury was instructed as to both theories of first degree assault, and the record was uncertain as to which basis, (a)(1) or (a)(2), of the statute the jury relied on in rendering its conviction of first degree assault. In sentencing at the second trial, the trial judge should have been restricted in his sentence for the first degree assault conviction by the ten year sentence for attempted voluntary manslaughter imposed at the trial in <em>Dixon I. </em>The sentence of ten years for attempted voluntary manslaughter, with twenty concurrent years for first degree assault, was an illegal sentence. Because the sentence from the first trial was illegal, the trial court was bound in its sentencing in the second trial by what would have been the legal sentence of ten years, regardless of the nolle prosequi for attempted voluntary manslaughter at the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">A. <em>Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-702(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-702(b) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, <em>supra </em>note 12, states, in pertinent part, that, at a new sentencing following a successful appeal, re-trial, and conviction, \u201cthe lower court may impose <em>any sentence authorized by law to be imposed as punishment for the offense.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).

Thus, \u201cthe sentence previously imposed\u201d [, pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12 \u2014 702(b),] for first degree assault was 10 years, the sentence that was imposed for attempted voluntary manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Petitioner\u2019s Br., at 11. According to Petitioner, the Circuit Court in the second trial was required to base its sentencing for first degree assault on the \u201clawful\u201d sentence of ten years for attempted voluntary manslaughter that should have been imposed. The State avers though that Petitioner\u2019s logic has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>taken a \u201cwrong turn\u201d and that Petitioner\u2019s twenty year sentence for first degree assault resulting from the second trial was not an illegal increase in a sentence following appeal because there was no net increase in his original sentence. The State argues that because it nol prossed the attempted voluntary manslaughter charge, in the second trial, and the Circuit Court judge sentenced Petitioner to two consecutive terms of twenty years for first degree assault and the use of a hand gun charges, the Circuit Court judge \u201cimposed precisely the same sentence of [twenty] years for first-degree assault that was originally imposed.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Br., at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We agree with Petitioner\u2019s interpretation of CJP \u00a7 12-702(b) that the statute mandates that the sentencing following the second trial be circumscribed by a lawful sentence resulting from the first trial. It is clear that, in CJP \u00a7 12-702(b), the sentence imposed on remand must be one that is \u201cauthorized by law.\u201d Again, the court \u201cmay not impose a sentence more severe than <em>the sentence previously imposed for the offense\u201d </em>(withstanding the three conditions, <em>supra </em>note 12). Therefore, as it must be \u201cauthorized by law,\u201d the new sentence must be based on a sentence that was legal when \u201cpreviously imposed.\u201d Our analysis then turns to whether the initial sentence of twenty years for first degree assault, with ten concurrent years for attempted voluntary manslaughter, was legal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The Court of Special Appeals, in its reported opinion in <em>Dixon II, </em>incorrectly concluded otherwise; the court should have followed what it pejoratively described as Petitioner\u2019s \u201cOrwellian revision of history.\u201d Instead, the intermediate appellate court concluded that CJP \u00a7 12-702(b), regarding \u201cthe sentence previously imposed for the offense,\u201d means <em>only </em>that sentence \u201coriginally imposed,\u201d without considering whether that originally imposed sentence was lawful. <em>Dixon, </em>133 Md.App. at 337, 755 A.2d at 567. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>For purposes of both the Maryland Rule and the federal Due Process Clause, it is beyond dispute that the standard against which we measure any subsequent sentence is the original sentence that actually WAS, not the sentence that arguably SHOULD HAVE BEEN.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">The \u201csentence previously imposed\u201d is the sentence that first came from the mouth of the sentencing judge \u2014 right or wrong, lawful or unlawful, constitutional or unconstitutional \u2014 and not the subsequent fate of that sentence, as it may have been cut or trimmed or shaped or in any way reformed by <em>ex post facto </em>appellate analysis. When Judge Rymer pronounced his sentences on December 12, 1997, that sentencing event, was for purposes of <em>North Carolina v. Pearce </em>and Md. Rule 12-702(b) [sic], locked immutably into history. No <em>dicta </em>of ours can change what Judge Rymer did. We may alter the effect of what he did, but cannot change the fact that he did it. Neither may a leap of logic by [Petitioner]. \u201cThe moving finger writes and, having writ, moves on....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). It is incorrect, however, to reach the conclusion that the Legislature intended that CJP \u00a7 12-702(b), if the original sentence imposed was unlawful, authorized the sentencing court, on remand, to impose an unlawful sentence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals was quick in its reasoning to cite to the purpose of <em>Pearce </em>and of CJP \u00a7 12-702(b); however, it also implicitly must have imagined that the authors of <em>Pearce </em>or of CJP \u00a7 12-702(b) apparently meant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>that, although intending to avoid vindictiveness, they would permit the outer limit of a defendant\u2019s sentence on retrial and conviction to include a previous unlawful sentence.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Petitioner, in his reply brief to this Court, provides a hypothetical that demonstrates and exemplifies the error of the limits identified in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s interpretation of CJP \u00a7 12-702(b). He writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">A defendant is convicted by a jury of involuntary manslaughter and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. The trial court sentences the defendant to three years imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter. On the use of a handgun count, the court imposes a concurrent three year term despite the fact that Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d), mandates a sentence of not less than 5 years without parole. The defendant appeals, and the Court of Special Appeals orders a new trial. At the new trial, the defendant is again convicted of involuntary manslaughter and use of a handgun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">Accepting the State\u2019s premise that for the purposes of [CJP] \u00a7 12-702(b) \u201cthe sentence previously imposed\u201d is the sentence that was actually imposed even if that sentence is illegal, the trial court cannot impose a sentence more severe than three years for use of a handgun. The Legislature plainly did not intend this result, which would defeat the mandate of \u00a7 36B(d). The sentence actually imposed by the trial court cannot operate as a sentencing cap under [CJP] \u00a7 12-702(b) if it is more severe than the maximum sentence authorized by law or less severe than the minimum sentence required by law, regardless of whether the illegality favors the State or the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">We shall divert from the destination to which the Court of Special Appeals leads \u2014 that if \u201cthe sentence previously imposed\u201d may be illegal, then, on remand, following a new trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the court may impose the same illegal sentence. That result leads to illegal sentences ad infinitum. In essence, assuming the first sentence was for an illegal twenty years instead of a legal ten years, then Petitioner is worse off for appealing the case \u2014 exactly what the Court in <em>Pearce </em>and the Legislature in CJP \u00a7 12-702(b) attempted to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Before, however, determining the legality of the first sentence, we must address the effect that the nolle prosequi of the attempted voluntary manslaughter charge has on the present case, if any. Our preceding discussion ignores (for the sake of demonstration and interpretation of CJP \u00a7 12-702(b)) that action and assumes that the same charges existed at the first and the secopd trial. To deduce otherwise permits the State, assuming that in the first trial the two charges should have merged and the legal maximum sentence was ten years, to increase a sentence that would not have been permitted to be augmented under CJP \u00a7 12-702(b). On this point, Petitioner argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">[T]he sole reason for the increase was the nolle prosequi of the attempted voluntary manslaughter charged by the State. It would be anomalous indeed if a sentence could be increased under [CJP] \u00a7 12-702(b) because the State <em>dropped </em>the charge. An increase in sentence is clearly not permitted under [CJP] \u00a7 12-702(b) simply because the prosecutor nol[ ] prossed the attempted voluntary manslaughter charge to get it \u201cout of the way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Though not directly on point, in that the cases did not involve CJP \u00a7 12-702(b), we have employed a line of reasoning, similar to what Petitioner argues here, in <em>Simms v. State, </em>288 Md. 712, 421 A.2d 957 (1980), <em>Gerald v. State, </em>299 Md. 138, 472 A.2d 977 (1984), and <em>Johnson v. State, </em>310 Md. 681, 531 A.2d 675 (1987) <em>(infra </em>note 24), to demonstrate why we would not permit the entry of a nolle prosequi (or an acquittal) to cause a defendant to receive a higher sentence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> These cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>also demonstrate that, assuming merger is applicable and as was broached at oral argument, the nolle prosequi could not have been permitted in the first trial and thus could not be permitted in the second trial. Analogizing those cases to the present one avoids situations in which the State nol prosses one charge, a greater offense, and proceeds on the lesser included offense, which has a greater penalty than the greater offense, and thus, because of the nolle prosequi, the defendant is subject to the greater sentence of the lesser included offense. In the present case, assuming merger of the attempted voluntary manslaughter and first degree assault convictions, regardless of the nolle prosequi, the trial judge should have been bound in sentencing by the sentence for the attempted voluntary manslaughter conviction. We then do not have to consider necessarily the nolle prosequi; however, the <em>Simms-Gerald-Johnson </em>line of cases, not permitting a nolle prosequi, provides similar reasoning why we cannot permit the second sentencing in the present case to be based on an illegality in the initial sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In <em>Simms v. State, </em>288 Md. 712, 421 A.2d 957, we decided two cases <em>together</em>\u2014Simms <em>v. State </em>and <em>Thomas v. State. </em>In the latter case, the defendant was charged with, inter alia, assault with intent to rob, with a maximum sentence of ten years, and simple assault,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> both based on the same alleged conduct. <em>Simms, </em>288 Md. at 717, 421 A.2d at 960. At the close of evidence, but before the case went to the jury, the State nol prossed<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the charge of assault with intent to rob. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>Simms, </em>288 Md. at 718, 421 A.2d at 960. The defendant was found guilty of simple assault and was <em>sentenced to twelve years.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We determined that because \u201call of the elements of simple assault are present in the offense of assault with intent to rob\u201d and both are based upon the defendant\u2019s same acts, they are \u201cdeemed the same for merger and double jeopardy purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We stated further that \u201csimple assault is a lesser included offense of assault with intent to rob\u201d and that \u201cif a defendant were found guilty of both, he could not receive a separate sentence for each offense. Instead, a sentence could be imposed only for the greater offense of assault with intent to rob.\u201d <em>Simms, </em>288 Md. at 718-19, 421 A.2d at 960-61 (citations omitted). We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">To uphold the twelve year sentences [Simms\u2019s and Thomas\u2019s] under these circumstances would be to sanction an extreme anomaly in the criminal law. It would permit a defendant to be punished more severely because of an acquittal on a charge. He would have fared better if he were less successful or had pled guilty to the greater charge of assault with intent to rob....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">Accordingly, we hold that when a defendant is charged with a greater offense and a lesser included offense based on the same conduct, with jeopardy attaching to both charges at trial, and when the defendant is convicted only of the lesser included charge, he may not receive a sentence for that conviction which exceeds the maximum sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>which could have been imposed had he been convicted of the greater charge.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><em>Simms, </em>288 Md. at 724, 421 A.2d at 963-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">In <em>Gerald v. State, </em>299 Md. 138, 472 A.2d 977, the defendant was charged, in part, with, armed robbery carrying a maximum sentence of twenty years, robbery carrying a maximum sentence of ten years, and simple assault. <em>Gerald, </em>299 Md. at 139, 472 A.2d at 978. A jury found him guilty only on the assault charge, and he was sentenced to fifteen years. <em>Gerald, </em>299 Md. at 139-40, 472 A.2d at 978. We noted that the three charges arose out of the same incident and that \u201c[l]ike a little fish being eaten by a bigger fish which in turn is eaten by a yet bigger fish, simple assault is swallowed by robbery which then is swallowed by armed robbery.\u201d <em>Gerald, </em>299 Md. at 140-41, 472 A.2d at 979. Likening <em>Gerald </em>to <em>Simms, </em>we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">[WJhen the State placed Gerald in jeopardy on both the armed robbery and robbery charges, it was seeking a prosecution not only on a charge carrying a maximum possible sentence of 20 years, but, in the alternative, a charge carrying a maximum possible sentence of only 10 years---- Had it believed that Gerald\u2019s conduct was so atrocious as to warrant a sentence subject only to constitutional limitations, it could have gone to trial only on the simple assault charge, <em>see Simms, </em>288 Md. at 726-27, 421 A.2d 957, or, if it thought that justice would be served by a possible maximum sentence of 20 years, it could have proceeded on the armed robbery and assault charges. Of course, in such event, the prosecution would have to enter a nolle prosequi before jeopardy attached with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>charges it did not wish to pursue. But by putting Gerald to trial on both aggravated assaults, the prosecution indicated its acquiescence to a possible maximum sentence of 10 years. Under such circumstances, it is unfair to permit the State to exact a more severe and unanticipated penalty than that which could have been imposed if the prosecution, even though not able to prove armed robbery, had been successful in proving robbery. <em>See Simms, </em>288 Md. at 724, 421 A.2d 957. The short of it is that the \u201cflagship crime\u201d governing the sentence to be imposed in the case sub judice was the robbery and not the armed robbery. The maximum possible sentence that could be imposed on Gerald\u2019s conviction of assault was, therefore, 10 years, and the sentence of 15 years which was imposed was illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><em>Gerald, </em>299 Md. at 145-46, 472 A.2d at 981. Thus, we determined that the ten year maximum sentence for robbery provided the maximum that could be imposed on the simple assault conviction.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">B. <em>Dixon I </em>\u2014 Legality <em>of Initial Sentences</em></p>\n<p id=\"AmA\">1. <em>Required Evidence Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">To determine whether, in the second trial <em>(Dixon </em>II), the trial judge, in sentencing Petitioner on the first degree assault conviction, was limited to the ten year sentence imposed in <em>Dixon I </em>for the attempted voluntary manslaughter according to CJP \u00a7 12-702(b), we must decipher whether attempted voluntary manslaughter merges with first degree assault, and if so under what reasoning.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>The doctrine of merging of offenses, as applicable in the present case, stems in part from the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, applicable to state court proceedings via the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Nightingale v.

Therefore, attempted voluntary manslaughter requires an attempted homicide in the heat of passion in response to a legally adequate provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">As noted <em>supra </em>note 6 and accompanying text, first degree assault is a statutory offense and states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>(a) <em>Serious physical injury; use of a firearm. </em>\u2014 (1) A person may not intentionally cause or attempt to cause serious physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">(2) A person may not commit an assault with a firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1g\">Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 12A-1. According to the statute, a person can be convicted of first degree assault for either intentionally \u201ccaus[ing] or attempting] to cause serious physical injury to another\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>or </em>\u201ccommitting] an assault with a firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Attempted voluntary manslaughter clearly has a different required mens rea \u2014 an intent to kill \u2014 than first degree assault, which requires the specific intent to cause, or attempt to cause, serious physical injury. Upon examination of the first modality, (a)(1), of the first degree assault statute, however, it is clear that (a)(1) is <em>subsumed </em>by attempted voluntary manslaughter. Attempted voluntary manslaughter requires a specific intent to commit a homicide, which embodies an intention to cause or attempt to cause serious physical injury as required by (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">We set out a useful example in <em>Bruce v. State, </em>317 Md. 642, 647-48, 566 A.2d 103, 105 (1989), that aids our present analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">Some crimes, such as murder, are defined in terms of acts causing a particular result plus some mental state which need not be an intent to bring about that result. Thus, if A, B, C, and D have each taken the life of another, A acting with the intent to kill, B with the intent to do serious bodily injury, C with reckless disregard of human life, and D in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>course of a dangerous felony, all three are guilty of murder because the crime of murder is defined in such a way that any one of these mental states will suffice. However, if the victims do not die from their injuries, then only A is guilty of attempted murder; on a charge of attempted murder it is not sufficient to show that the defendant intended to so serious bodily harm, that he acted in reckless disregard for human life, or that he was committing a dangerous felony. Again, this is because intent is needed for the crime of attempt, so that attempted murder requires an intent to bring about that result described by the crime of murder (i.e., the death of another). (Quoting LeFave <em>&amp; </em>Scott, <em>Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 6.2, at 500 (2nd ed.1986)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Thus, nothing less then an intent to kill will suffice for attempted voluntary manslaughter. The intent to kill envelops the intent to do serious physical injury. Therefore, there is nothing required by modality (a)(1) of the first degree assault statute that is not also required by attempted voluntary manslaughter; the evidence required to show an attempt to Mil would demonstrate causing, or attempting to cause, a serious physical injury. <em>Cf. Newton, </em>280 Md. at 269, 373 A.2d at 267 (determining that felony murder and the underlying felony merged because \u201c[t]he evidence required to secure a first degree murder conviction is, absent the proof of death, the same evidence required to establish the underlying felony\u201d); <em>Thomas, </em>277 Md. at 270, 353 A.2d at 248 (concluding that \u201c[ujnder the <em>Blockburger </em>required evidence test, the same evidence necessary to convict on ...

Therefore, modality (a)(1) of the first degree assault statute is a lesser included offense of the greater offense of attempted voluntary manslaughter, while (a)(2) is not a lesser included offense.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">At least one other jurisdiction has reached a similar conclusion involving a comparable first degree assault statute and the required evidence test.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Superior Court of Pennsyl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>vania determined that voluntary manslaughter and first degree assault merge because first degree assault is the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter. <em>Pennsylvania v. Rosario-Hernandez, </em>446 Pa.Super. 24, 666 A.2d 292, 298 (1995). Under Pennsylvania law, voluntary manslaughter is defined as \u201ca person who kills an individual without lawful justification commits voluntary manslaughter if at the time of the killing he is acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation by ... the person killed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2503(a)(1)). First degree assault, a multi-purpose criminal statute, is defined as (1) attempting to cause serious bodily injury to another or (2) causing \u201csuch injury intentionally, knowingly or recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d <em>Id </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2702(a)(1)). Maryland\u2019s requirement of serious physical injury is similar to Pennsylvania\u2019s requirement of serious bodily injury in its first modality. Pennsylvania\u2019s statute in its second modality has a requirement of malice, which the Maryland statute does not. The Pennsylvania court, using the required evidence test, reasoned that \u201c[t]he requisite act for voluntary manslaughter, the killing of another individual, coincides with and includes the act which is necessary to establish aggravated assault, the infliction of serious bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX\">After reviewing the statutory definitions of both offenses, we are unable to agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that these offenses do not merge. Voluntary manslaughter re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>quires a specific intent to kill. Even though this intent is not malicious, <em>Commonwealth v. Pitts, </em>486 Pa. 212, 404 A.2d 1305 (1979), we, nonetheless, conclude that a specific intent to kill is greater and necessarily subsumes a specific intent to do bodily harm, even where the latter intent is malicious. In comparing the intent requirement of these two offenses, it is necessary to include the focus of the intent. Having done so, it is clear that the intent to kill must include the intent to do a lesser degree (bodily harm or serious bodily harm) or damage. As such, the two offenses merge for sentencing purposes and the sentence for aggravated assault and voluntary manslaughter must be vacated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av3\"><em>Rosario-Hernandez, </em>666 A.2d at 299-300 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">3. <em>Merger and Multi Purpose Criminal Statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"AX5\">To determine whether, in the present case, attempted voluntary manslaughter merges with first degree assault, we must discern, if possible, under which modality of the first degree assault statute the jury convicted Petitioner. The first degree assault statute is a multi-purpose criminal statute. <em>See Nightingale, </em>312 Md. at 705, 542 A.2d at 375. When confronted with such a statute in determining merger issues, we \u201crefine [the multi-purpose criminal statute] by looking at the alternative elements relevant to the case at hand.\u201d <em>Id.; see State v. Ferrell, </em>313 Md. 291, 298, 545 A.2d 653, 656 (1988) (\u201c[W]hen a common law offense or a criminal statute is multi-purpose, embracing different matters in the disjunctive, a court in applying the required evidence test must examine \u2018the alternative elements relevant to the case at hand.\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted)). The court, when presented with a multi-purpose criminal statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">must construct from the alternative elements within the statute the particular formulation that applies to the case at hand. It should rid the statute of alternative elements that do not apply. It must, in other words, treat a multi-purpose statute in the alternative as it would treat separate statutes. The theory behind the analysis is that a criminal statute written in the alternative creates a separate offense for each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>alternative and should therefore be treated for double jeopardy purposes as separate statutes would.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\"><em>Nightingale, </em>312 Md. at 706-07, 542 A.2d at 376 (quoting <em>Pandelli v. United States, </em>635 F.2d 533, 537 (6th cir.1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The record is not clear on which modality of the first degree assault statute the jury based its verdict.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In <em>Nightingale, </em>in determining upon which modality of a child abuse statute, which covered physical injury or sexual abuse, a jury grounded its conviction for purposes of deciphering whether there was merger with a sexual abuse statute,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> we examined the jury instructions and remarks made by the prosecutor to the jury regarding the there relevant crimes of sexual abuse and child abuse.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <em>Nightingale, </em>312 Md. at 707-08, 542 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>at 376-77. If the jury based its convictions of sexual abuse solely upon evidence of a sexual offense, then the sexual offense, for the purposes of merger, would have been a lesser included offense of the child abuse offense. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6t\">Under these circumstances, we believe that each jury [of the two companion cases] could have found the defendant before it guilty of child abuse based solely on evidence of a sexual offense in some degree. If that were done, then the sexual offense became in effect, a lesser included offense of sexual child abuse, and under the authorities we have cited, the offenses are the same for double jeopardy purposes.... [A] jury could have reached various decisions as to child abuse and sexual offenses, all of which were reflected in general verdicts of guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\"><em>The problem, then is that we cannot tell whether these general verdicts of guilty were based on the use of sexual offenses as lesser included offenses (or elements) of child abuse, or whether the child abuse verdicts were based on other reasons </em>(e.g., some sort of sexual molestation which the juries thought did not arise to the level of a sexual offenses in any degree).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\"><em>Nightingale, </em>312 Md. at 708, 542 A.2d at 377 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In the trial in <em>Dixon I, </em>the trial judge gave the following pertinent instructions to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>As I mentioned, the defendant is charged with several different charges. And you must consider each charge <em>separately....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">Of course, if you find the defendant guilty of the first degree murder, you don\u2019t have to go on and decide whether or not he was guilty of second degree or manslaughter.... If you determine he was not guilty of first degree murder, then you have to consider whether or not he was guilty of second degree murder or manslaughter. If. you decide he is not guilty of second degree murder, then you look at manslaughter....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">The next count has to do with do you find the Defendant Guilty or Not Guilty of First Degree Assault.... Now, in order to convict the defendant of first degree assault, the State must prove that the defendant caused offensive physical contact or physical harm to the victim, that the contact was not consented to, of course, by the victim, or was not legally justified; that the defendant used a firearm to commit the assault <em>or </em>the defendant intended to cause serious physical injury in the commission of the assault. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Thus, the trial judge advised the jury that it could find Petitioner guilty of first degree assault under either modality, (a)(1) <em>or </em>(a)(2), of the first degree assault statute and informed the jury to consider each charge separately.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The same was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>so in <em>Nightingale </em>where, as we noted, that the \u201cjudge instructed on the elements of all offenses submitted to the jury ... [and] included a direction to consider each charged offense separately.\u201d <em>Nightingale, </em>312 Md. at 707, 542 A.2d at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Upon returning its verdict, the jury did not identify verbally under which modality it had convicted Petitioner of first degree assault. The deputy clerk asked the jury: \u201cDo you find the Defendant Not Guilty or Guilty of First Degree Assault ... \u201d? To which the foreperson of the jury simply responded \u201cGuilty.\u201d The verdict sheet is no more illuminating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">Do you find the Defendant Not Guilty or Guilty of First Degree Assault ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">-NOT GUILTY <em>X </em>GUILTY</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">During his opening statement in the trial in <em>Dixon I, </em>the prosecutor did not place particular emphasis on the offense of assault or mention either modality of the assault statute. The State contended rather that the case was about guns; \u201c[t]he problem of guns and the power that guns have when they are in the hands of young men who go out and use them.\u201d In Petitioner\u2019s trial attorney\u2019s opening statement, nothing was mentioned specifically regarding the assault charge. The State\u2019s closing argument may be understood to emphasize only modality (a)(2) of the first degree assault statute. The prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">Did he commit a first degree assault? That\u2019s only part of the murder. It\u2019s going to be part of the first degree assault. What did the Judge tell you that was? Did the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>defendant by using that <em>gun shoot, strike, in any other way harm [the victim] using a handgun?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">A first degree assault is different from second degree assault in that first degree assault requires that you use a handgun. If you shoot somebody and use a handgun to do it, it\u2019s a first degree assault. And there is no doubt there are bullets throughout his body. It\u2019s a first degree assault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvP\">Petitioner\u2019s attorney, in his closing argument, did not mention the assault charge. Thus, it appears as if the jury was sent mixed messages in <em>Dixon I. </em>It is clear that the State was emphasizing the use of a handgun regarding the first degree assault, but the trial judge instructed regarding both modalities of first degree assault. The jury returned a general verdict. It is apparent then that we cannot determine under which modality the jury convicted Petitioner of first degree assault. We are left with the same ambiguity as was presented in <em>Nightingale. </em>In <em>Nightingale, </em>we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">In these circumstances we resolve the ambiguity in favor of the defendants and set aside the judgments on the sexual offense counts. <em>See Frye, </em>283 Md. at 723-25, 393 A.2d at 1379-80 (unclear basis for verdict of first degree murder). <em>Also see, Leary v.

For future guidance, we stated in <em>Frye:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">Where there is more than one ground for a verdict on a criminal charge, but where ramifications of a guilty verdict on that charge will be different depending upon the ground chosen by the jury, the obvious way to deal with the situation is, as indicated by the court below in <em>Frye, </em>to give the jury adequate advisory instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-6\"><em>Frye, </em>283 Md. at 723, 393 A.2d at 1379 (citing <em>United States v.

The rule \"provides that doubt or ambiguity as to whether the legislature intended that there be multiple punishments for the same act or transaction will be resolved against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses.\u201d <em>White, </em>318 Md. at 744, 569 A.2d at 1273 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Simpson v.

We fhrther stated: \"This policy of lenity means that the Court will not interpret a ... criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an inteipretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what [the legislature] intended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Simpson, </em>435 U.S. at 15, 98 S.Ct. at 914, 55 L.Ed.2d at 78). As for the application of the rule of lenity, \"it should be used like other principles of statutory construction as an aid in ascertaining legislative intent with respect to a statutory offense\u201d and should be used with other considerations such as whether the offenses have historically merged and \u201cthe fairness of multiple punishments in a particular situation\u201d. <em>White, </em>318 Md. at 745-46, 569 A.2d at 1273-74 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Although with merger of offenses under the required evidence test, \"we are not concerned with penalties \u2014 the lesser included offense generally merges into and is subsumed by the greater offense regardless of penalties,\u201d <em>Spitzinger v.
