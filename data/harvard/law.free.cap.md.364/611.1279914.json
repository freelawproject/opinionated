Fifteen years later, Jack D. Clark, Petitioner, was arrested and charged with the crimes. In the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, a jury convicted Petitioner of two counts of first degree felony murder, one count of attempted armed robbery with a deadly weapon, and one count of the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. The trial judge sentenced him to life imprisonment and life concurrent for the felony murders, twenty years concurrent for the attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, and twenty years concurrent(the first five to be served without the possibility of parole) for the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported decision, affirmed. We granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, <em>Clark v. State, </em>362 Md. 34, 762 A.2d 968 (2000), to address the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\">1. Where the fifteen year pre-indictment delay caused Petitioner conceded and substantial actual prejudice to the presentation of his defense, could his due process claim be defeated because he did not prove that the State purposefully delayed so as to gain a tactical advantage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-11\">2. Where trial was held sixteen years after the crimes occurred, was it error to preclude Petitioner from questioning the State\u2019s star witness about an intervening, injury which caused memory problems?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">On 7 October 1982, at approximately 5:80 a.m., George Wilker and Lurty Wood were shot to death during the course of a robbery attempt at a bar called the Alcove, located on Pulaski Highway in Baltimore County. The crimes were investigated by the Baltimore County Police. Detective Capel was the chief investigator. Certain interviewed witnesses reported seeing four suspicious men, one of whom wore a red bandana around his neck, in the bar the night before the murders. Other witnesses reported speaking with four men, one of whom displayed a gun, in the parking lot of the bar the night before the murders. The police also questioned three eyewitnesses to the attempted robbery. Two of the eyewitnesses, George Barnstorf, the bar owner, and a Mr. Trotter, saw a man, wearing a bandana over his mouth, with one of the victims just before the shooting. A third eyewitness, a Mr. Moog, told police he saw two white males beating one of the victims before that victim was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The police focused their initial investigation on four suspects \u2014 Petitioner, Julius (Bo) Stallings, Chadwick Gregory Grimes (Chad), and Charles Michael Grimes (Michael). Photo arrays, including pictures of Petitioner, Chad Grimes, and Michael Grimes, were shown to Barnstorf and Trotter. Neither was able to make an identification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no record of photographs being shown to Moog.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Also during the initial investigation, a red bandana was found near the point of entry the perpetrators used to enter the bar. Two hairs were found on the bandana. These two hairs, plus hair samples from Chad and Michael Grimes, were sent to the FBI for analysis in October 1982. One hair was consistent with that of Chad Grimes\u2019s sample. The other hair was inconsistent with both of the samples supplied by Chad and Michael Grimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Detective Capel questioned each of the four suspects and thereafter completed an Application for a Statement of Charges for each of them. Although the police believed they had enough evidence to charge the four suspects, they questioned whether they had sufficient evidence at this time for the State to mount a successful prosecution. Thus, the Applications were never submitted to a court and the case remained unsolved and dormant in police homicide files from 1986 until 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">On 16 September 1998, at the pretrial motion to dismiss hearing in Petitioner\u2019s prosecution, Detective Phillip Marll, who started in the homicide division on 15 September 1986, but did not familiarize himself with the Alcove bar murders case until sometime in 1996, testified regarding the dormancy of this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">[PETITIONER\u2019S TRIAL ATTORNEY]: Is there a reason why a double homicide case would not be worked for a period of approximately ten years, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">[MARLL]: The only answer to that, I think in Baltimore County, going back to the early '50s, we have about one hundred eighty open homicide cases. You take that and you couple it with a caseload of active cases that are coming in, and speaking from '86 on, thirty-five to forty-five murders per year, that would be why we wouldn\u2019t generally be able to take some time in going back over old cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">Within the last few years the old cases had become something of a[n] interest to go back on and work on, but it\u2019s nothing \u2014 we don\u2019t have, if you will, an old case squad. There\u2019s nothing that compels us to go back and work the old cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">And there was nothing in '86, actually through '96, that forced us to go back and work old cases. So the case would be sitting back there. It\u2019s not closed. If any information came in on it, somebody would have grabbed up on it and ran with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-10\">So this case, along with the other hundred seventy, hundred eighty other cases that were sitting back there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>were just waiting for a matter of a phone call from '86 to '96,1 would say.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Detective Marll, with his partner, Detective Tincher, became inspired to re-investigate the murders as the result of driving by the Alcove Bar while it was being torn down in 1996. Seeing the demolition, they \u201cboth commented, T wonder what happened with the double homicide that occurred there.\u2019 \u201d Curiosity piqued, they pulled the case file. After examining the file, Detective Marll decided to pursue it further. He admitted, however, that in 1996 the case was a \u201cback-burner\u201d issue that he and his partner worked on between their active cases, as time permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The detectives began the re-investigation by updating information in the file. They shortly learned that two of the eyewitnesses had died, Barnstorf in 1985 and Trotter in 1995, and that Bo Stallings, one of the four original suspects, died in 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Detective Marll focused his investigation on Chad Grimes because of the evidence that it may have been his hair that was found in 1982 on the bandana. He was forced to abandon this avenue, however, when Chad Grimes was murdered in Baltimore City in January 1997. Marll then focused on Chad\u2019s brother, Michael Grimes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Believing there was sufficient probable cause, Marll obtained an arrest warrant for the surviving Grimes brother based on essentially the same facts used by Detective Capel in the unfiled 1982 Application for Statement of Charges.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">When questioned in 1982, Michael Grimes had denied knowledge of the crimes. When questioned in 1998 by Detec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>tives Marll and Tichner, Michael Grimes claimed to have lied in 1982 and implicated himself and Petitioner in the crimes. In addition, he agreed to plead guilty and to testify against Petitioner. Petitioner was arrested at his home in North Carolina the day after Michael Grimes was questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Petitioner\u2019s trial was scheduled for 15 October 1998. Prior to trial, the State sought additional DNA testing of the red bandana, which remained in police custody. On 8 October 1998, the trial date was postponed to allow time for the DNA testing to be completed. The State was permitted to have an expert at Cellmark Laboratories perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) DNA testing on a spot of saliva found on the bandana. The results of the testing supplied a profile from which Petitioner could not be excluded. This DNA evidence was introduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Also before trial, Petitioner\u2019s trial attorney filed, on 9 September 1998, a motion to dismiss, alleging that the preindictment delay deprived Petitioner of due process. Petitioner\u2019s trial attorney proffered several ways in which the defense had been prejudiced by the delay of fifteen years, including the death of an alibi witness, the death and/or other loss of potentially exonerating eyewitnesses, and the loss of evidence tending to incriminate one of the other suspects. Specifically, as Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel expounded at the hearing on the motion to dismiss, Jean Rinesman, Petitioner\u2019s claimed alibi witness, had died; eyewitnesses Barnstorf and Trotter had died; and the third eyewitness, Moog, could not be located. Petitioner\u2019s defense attorney argued that these circumstances prejudiced Petitioner\u2019s case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">Back when, I guess, when the case was hot, so as to speak, each<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> of these men were shown photo arrays on separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>days. Each photo array contained a picture of [Petitioner]. And there was no identification made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">I think I can probably get around that by calling people to the stand that compiled the photographic array and ask them certain questions that don\u2019t obviously call for a hearsay response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">But what I am losing is something that I can\u2019t prove because these witnesses are dead, and that\u2019s the opportunity to bring these gentlemen into court and perhaps have them get a good look at [Petitioner] and say, \u201cThat\u2019s not the guy I saw do all these horrible things that night.\u201d Not just say, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t say if it is him or if it\u2019s not him,\u201d but actually the potential would exist, your Honor, that they would say or could say, \u201cI\u2019m certain that that\u2019s not the person that was observed.\u201d That opportunity is gone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ_\">Additionally, Petitioner\u2019s attorney noted, as mentioned <em>supra, </em>two of the four original suspects were dead. One of the suspects, Bo Stallings, apparently previously admitted to a man named Mike Miller that he, Stallings, was involved in the murders; both Stallings and Miller were dead, however, before Petitioner was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The prosecutor expressly conceded that there had been prejudice to Petitioner\u2019s defense during the fifteen year lapse before charges were filed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">I mean, we will concede there\u2019s prejudice with regard to Barnstorf, Trotter, Miller, and all of the significant points he brought up as well as he argues. We believe we have also been prejudiced because of the delay as well. And we believed the reason he called Detective Marll is so they could determine the justification for the delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">The State argued, however, citing <em>Smallwood v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 463, 443 A.2d 1003 (1982), that dismissal was not mandated because the defense failed to prove that the State purposefully delayed indicting Clark to gain a tactical advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">The trial judge denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss. The judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>The problem in this case \u2014 and the State concedes that there is prejudice with regard to the Defense in this case, and likewise, the Court believes that because of the \u2014 some witnesses are deceased at this point that there is some prejudice that has been attached to the State, because they are in a difficult position as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">The question is whether or not the government\u2019s delay violates what is, quote, in the fundamental conception of justice and the community sense of fair play and decency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">I mean, the Court must weigh the&gt; facts, what the allegations are in this case, that the Defendant did in fact commit two murders in the course of an armed robbery. That is obviously an extremely serious case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">The testimony is clear that the State, back at the time the crimes occurred, although they had some probable cause to believe that this Defendant and others were responsible for the robbery and the crimes, they did not have sufficient evidence with which to bring indictments and to proceed before a jury or judge to present .evidence which they believe could convict beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">There was a delay. The detectives in this case, who have been longtime homicide detectives in Baltimore County, as Detective Marll points out, by happenstance wondered what happened to the double murders at the Alcove Bar whenever they noticed it being demolished one particular day while driving down the road. They pull the case back out and attempt to resurrect what had transpired and to pursue what leads they had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">Now, there wasn\u2019t DNA testing back in the early '80\u2019s, at the time this episode occurred, and now have pursued other means of investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-10\">The difference between what this case is and the <em>Barker</em><footnotemark><em>[5]</em></footnotemark><em> </em>case that [Defense Counsel] cites to the Court is crystal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>clear. In the <em>Barker </em>case, that oral argument the counsel for the State of North Carolina, presumably the Attorney General\u2019s Office or someone has in here unequivocally and candidly stated that North Carolina\u2019s justification for the pre-indictment delay was mere convenience and that the court conceded, quote, that North Carolina was negligent in not prosecuting the defendant earlier, end of quote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">There is absolutely no such circumstance in this particular case. It\u2019s clear to the Court that the State could not prosecute the Defendant back when the initial investigation took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">And balancing the fundamental conception of justice and the community sense of fair play and decency, the Court determines that the \u2014 that it would be improper for me to dismiss the case for pre-indictment delay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">Accordingly, the motion to dismiss that\u2019s been filed is hereby denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">On 14 April 1999, at Petitioner\u2019s trial and before the direct testimony of Michael Grimes, the trial court seemed inclined to allow Petitioner\u2019s trial attorney to ask \u2014 in a \u201cyes or no\u201d question format \u2014 Michael Grimes whether he had filed a Maryland Worker\u2019s Compensation claim alleging some type of psychiatric injury and disability. In this context, it seemed clear that defense counsel intended to probe further whether the reported 1991 work-related injury affected Grimes\u2019s memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">The trial court, however, also ruled in limine that the defense could not use documents relating to Grimes\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation claim for impeachment purposes. Petitioner\u2019s trial attorney argued that the witness\u2019s ability to remember was an important issue because the witness would be testifying about events that transpired sixteen years earlier. The trial court ruled that there was nothing in the workers\u2019 compensation documents to denigrate Grimes\u2019s ability to recall the specific events at issue and that the memory problems reported by Grimes in 1991 did not relate to his veracity and credibility at the time he witnessed the 1982 events. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>court ruled that evidence suggesting psychiatric problems resulting from the work-related injury occurring subsequent to the 1982 events was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The jury ultimately convicted Petitioner. Clark appealed to the Court of Special Appeals claiming, inter alia, that he was entitled to dismissal of the charges due to the long preindictment delay, or that at least he was entitled to a new trial because the trial judge improperly limited his inquiry regarding the state of Michael Grimes\u2019s ability to recall accurately the 1982 events to which he testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, in an unreported opinion, the Circuit Court\u2019s judgments. The intermediate appellate court, relying on <em>Smallwood v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 463, 443 A.2d 1003 (1982), employed a two \u201cpronged\u201d test to determine whether Petitioner\u2019s right to a fair trial was prejudiced improperly by the pre-indictment delay of fifteen years. Under this test, one seeking dismissal for a pre-indictment delay must prove \u201c(1) actual prejudice to the accused, and (2) that the delay was purposefully made by the State to gain a tactical advantage over the accused.\u201d (Citing <em>Smallwood, </em>51 Md.App. at 472, 443 A.2d at 1008). The Court of Special Appeals noted, as to the first element of the test, that it had been conceded that Petitioner was prejudiced by the \u201csignificant lapse in time between the offenses committed and the criminal trial\u201d due to the loss of a potential alibi witness, a potential exonerating witness, two- eyewitnesses, and two alleged coconspirators. The court reasoned, as to the second element, that \u201c[m]ere delay ... absent an ulterior motive, does not necessarily deprive a defendant of due process\u201d and that, in Petitioner\u2019s case, \u201cthere was no showing that the delay was an intentional, calculated tactic utilized by the State to obtain an advantage over [Petitioner] at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">With regard to the question of whether Petitioner should have been permitted to inquire, during cross-examination of the State\u2019s witness, Michael Grimes, into his medical and psychiatric history that included evidence of memory problems, reported in 1992, caused by an injury occurring in 1991, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>the court answered in the negative. The Court of Special Appeals explained that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not permitting this cross-examination because \u201cGrimes\u2019s 1992 psychiatric problems were not a proper subject of inquiry because they did not relate to his perception at the time of the criminal incident.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">It is not proper to ask the witness, \u201cAre you under the care of a psychiatrist?\u201d People receive psychiatric treatment for many reasons that have nothing to do with any component of credibility. On the other hand, the question, \u201cWere you suffering from schizophrenia at the time you witnessed this incident?\u201d is not an unfair attack upon the witness\u2019s character for veracity. If the witness was indeed schizophrenic at the time of the incident, his ability to observe accurately and to retain the observation correctly may have been so impaired that his present testimony is incorrect even though he is doing his very best to supply truthful information. (Quoting Joseph P. Murphy, Jr., Maryland Evidence Handbook \u00a7 1302(D), at 506 (3d ed.1999) (citations omitted)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s holding with regard to whether Petitioner was denied due process due to the fifteen year pre-indictment delay. We disagree, however, with its holding that Petitioner should not have been permitted to cross-examine Michael Grimes relating the possibility of memory problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">\n<em>Pre-indictment Delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Petitioner argues that the Court of Special Appeals applied the wrong test in its analysis of the question of whether due process was violated due to the pre-indictment delay. He contends instead that we should adopt a test that balances prejudice to the defense against the State\u2019s reasons for the delay. In so arguing, Petitioner submits that what the test should be represents an open question for Maryland, as there is no controlling authority from the U.S. Supreme Court or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>this Court. Petitioner contends that the better-reasoned, persuasive authority employs a balancing test. Petitioner concludes that applying a balancing test to the record in the present case leads to the electable conclusion that Petitioner was denied due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">\n<em>A. What has the U.S. Supreme Court said?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971), the U.S. Supreme Court was asked to consider whether the dismissal \u201cof a federal indictment was constitutionally required by reason of a period of three years between the occurrence of the alleged criminal acts and the filing of the indictment.\u201d <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 308, 92 S.Ct. at 457, 30 L.Ed.2d 468. In <em>Marion, </em>the defendants argued that their Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> had been violated by a three year pre-indictment delay and that the delay was \u201cso substantial and inherently prejudicial that the Sixth Amendment required the dismissal of the indictment.\u201d <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 313, 92 S.Ct. at 459, 30 L.Ed.2d 468. The Court determined that the Sixth Amendment did not apply because the Sixth Amendment speedy trial provision does not become engaged until indictment or until \u201cthe putative defendant in some way becomes \u2018an accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">The Sixth Amendment provides that \u201cin all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.... \u201d On its face, the protection of the Amendment is activated only when a criminal prosecution has begun and extends only to those persons who have been \u201caccused\u201d in the course of prosecution. These provisions would seem to afford no protection to those not yet accused, nor would they seem to require the Government to discover, investigate, and accuse any person within any particular period of time. The Amendment would appear to guarantee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>to a criminal defendant that the Government will move with the dispatch that is appropriate to assure him an early and proper disposition of the charges against him. \u201cThe essential ingredient is orderly expedition and not mere speed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahg\"><em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>Smith v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 1, 10, 79 S.Ct. 991, 3 L.Ed.2d 1041 (1971)). The Court acknowledged that inordinate delay among arrest, indictment, and trial may impair a defendant\u2019s defense, but that \u201cthe major evils protected against by the speedy trial guarantee exist quite apart from actual or possible prejudice to an accused\u2019s defense.\u201d <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 320, 92 S.Ct. at 462, 30 L.Ed.2d 468. Thus, the Sixth Amendment speedy trial provision does not apply to the time preceding indictment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 321, 92 S.Ct. at 463-64, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (\u201cBut we decline to extend the reach of the amendment to the period prior to arrest.\u201d). The Court expounded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-4\">Until ... [indictment] occurs, a citizen suffers no restraints on his liberty and is not subject of public accusation: his situation does not compare with that of a defendant who has been arrested and held to answer. Passage of time, whether before or after arrest, may impair memories, cause evidence to be lost, deprive the defendant of witnesses, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>otherwise with his ability to defend himself. But this possibility of prejudice at trial is not itself sufficient reason to wrench the Sixth Amendment from its proper context. Possible prejudice is inherent in any delay, however short; it may also weaken the Government\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\"><em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 321-22, 92 S.Ct. at 463-64, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The Supreme Court envisioned the primary protection against the presumption of prejudice that may arise from extended pre-indictment delay to be the applicable statute of limitations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 322, 92 S.Ct. at 464, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (\u201cAs we said in <em>United States v.

The Court began by reiterating that <em>Manon </em>had determined: (1) that the Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment does not apply to pre-indictment delay; (2) that statutes of limitations \u201cprovide the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges\u201d; and, (3) that a statute of limitations does not define fully a defendant\u2019s rights prior to indictment and, thus, the Due Process Clause plays a limited role \u201cin protecting against oppressive delay.\u201d <em>Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. at 788-89, 97 S.Ct. at 2048, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 320 n. 8, 324, 322, 92 S.Ct. at 460 n. 8, 465, 464, 30 L.Ed.2d 468).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The Court rejected Lovasco\u2019s argument that <em>Manon </em>endorses that \u201cdue process bars prosecution <em>whenever </em>a defendant suffers prejudice as a result of pre-indictment delay.\u201d <em>Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. at 789, 97 S.Ct. at 2048, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (emphasis added).

The Court then reiterated, as it had pronounced in <em>Manon, </em>that \u201cinvestigative delay is fundamentally unlike delay undertaken by the Government solely \u2018to gain tactical advantage over the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. at 795, 97 S.Ct. at 2051, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (quoting <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 324, 92 S.Ct. at 465, 30 L.Ed.2d 468). The Court stated that \u201cto prosecute a defendant following investigative delay does not deprive him of due process, even if his defense might have been somewhat prejudiced by the lapse of time.\u201d <em>Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. at 795-96, 97 S.Ct. at 2051-52, 52 L.Ed.2d 752. In so concluding, the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">Rather than deviating from elementary standards of \u2018fair play and decency,\u2019 a prosecutor abides by them if he refuses to seek indictments until he is completely satisfied that he should prosecute and will be able promptly to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Therefore, to establish a federal due process violation, a defendant must show that the pre-indictment delay caused him actual, substantial prejudice and that the delay was the product of a deliberate act by the government designed to gain a tactical advantage.

In <em>United States v.

Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 57, 109 S.Ct. 333, 337, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988), the Court noted that in <em>Marion </em>it had required actual prejudice to the defense and a showing that the Government intentionally delayed indictment to gain some tactical advantage or to harass.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">\n<em>B. What have the Lower Federal Courts Said?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Petitioner would have us believe that the U.S. Supreme Court has not established a two element test for pre-indictment delay, and thus the Court of Special Appeals incorrectly, initially in <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>14 Md.App. 582, 287 A.2d 791 (1972), relied on <em>Marion </em>in formulating a two part test with two mandatory requirements, rather than a test that balances the two elements against each other. Petitioner argues that the proper test is a balancing test \u2014 balancing the prejudice to the defendant caused by the delay against the State\u2019s reasons for the delay. Petitioner finds succor for his view in the opinions of a minority of U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal. Petitioner believes that it is this minority view that correctly interprets the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Marion </em>and <em>Lovasco.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">In making his argument, Petitioner directs our attention to the following from a law review article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>In <em>United States v. Marion, </em>the Supreme Court accepted in dictum the government\u2019s concession that intentional prosecutorial delay transgresses due process strictures when the delay is undertaken for the purpose of gaining tactical advantage over a defendant who thereby suffers prejudice. The precise language of the portion of the opinion discussing intentional tactical delay indicates that the Court was not describing the standard for due process violations in this context. Because the appellee had claimed neither actual prejudice nor intentional delay, the Court expressly declined to elaborate a standard. Instead, it provided an illustration of one egregious situation that such a standard would likely proscribe. <em>In other words, the Court was establishing the dice process ceiling to the problem. Several circuits, however, have fixed the ceiling and the floor in identical locations, requiring both actual prejudice and intentional tactical delay as the minimum showing for a due process violation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 21 (alterations in original) (quoting Phyllis Goldfarb, <em>When Judges Abandon Analogy: The Problem of Delay in Commencing Criminal Prosecutions, </em>31 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. 622-23 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Petitioner primarily relies on Fourth and Ninth Circuit cases,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which clearly represent the minority view adopting a balancing test. The Ninth Circuit has explained the appropriate balancing test as the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">Pre-indictment delay that results from negligence or worse may violate due process. <em>See United States v. Swacker, </em>628 F.2d 1250, 1254 n. 5 (9th Cir.1980)____Whether due process has been violated is decided under a balancing test and \u2018if <em>mere negligent </em>conduct by the prosecutors is asserted, then obviously the delay and/or prejudice suffered by the defendant will have to be greater.\u2019 <em>United States v. Moran, </em>759 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>F.2d 777, 782 (9th Cir.1985) (as amended). The defendant must show actual prejudice from the delay, and the court must balance the length of the delay with the reasons for the delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-5\"><em>United States v. Ross, </em>123 F.3d 1181, 1184-85 (9th Cir.1997) (emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1066, 118 S.Ct. 733, 139 L.Ed.2d 670 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Similarly, the Fourth Circuit, in <em>Howell v. Barker, </em>904 F.2d 889 (4th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1016, 111 S.Ct. 590, 112 L.Ed.2d 595, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">Applying these principles of due process to the case at hand, we cannot agree with the position taken by the State of North Carolina and those other circuits which have held that a defendant, in addition to establishing prejudice, must also prove improper prosecutorial motive before securing a due process violation. Taking this position to its logical conclusion would mean that no matter how egregious the prejudice to a defendant, and no matter how long the preindictment delay, if a defendant cannot prove improper prosecutorial motive, then no due process violation has occurred. This conclusion on its face, would violate fundamental conceptions of justice, as well as the community\u2019s sense of fair play. Moreover, this conclusion does not contemplate the difficulty defendants either have encountered or will encounter in attempting to prove improper prosecutorial motive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-8\"><em>Barker, </em>904 F.2d at 895. The Fourth Circuit concluded that the \u201cbetter position\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">to put the burden on the defendant to prove actual prejudice. Assuming the defendant can establish actual prejudice, then the court must <em>balance </em>the defendant\u2019s prejudice against the government\u2019s justification for delay.... \u2018The basic inquiry then becomes whether the government\u2019s action in prosecuting after substantial delay violates fundamental conceptions of justice or the community\u2019s sense of fair play and decency.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">We observe, however, that the Fourth Circuit, in <em>Jones v. Angelone, Dir. Dept. of Corr., Virginia, </em>94 F.3d 900 (4th Cir.1996), has cast some doubt on the continuing vitality of <em>Howell v. Barker, supra. </em>In <em>Jones, </em>the court was presented with an argument calling for the overruling of <em>Howell </em>based on the .theory that the balancing test employed in <em>Howell </em>was \u201cirreconcilable\u201d with a number of Supreme Court cases, including <em>United States v. Gouveia, supra, </em>in the which the Court explained that \u201cto establish a due process violation based upon pre-indictment delay, a defendant must show not only actual prejudice, but also that the government deliberately caused the delay for tactical gain.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>94 F.3d at 904-05 (citations omitted). The court acknowledged that every other circuit, other than the Ninth Circuit, had, on the authority of <em>Gouveia^ Marion, Lovasco, </em>and <em>Youngblood, </em>adopted the two part test for evaluating pre-indictment delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The Fourth Circuit explained, however, that, even under the two part test, Jones could not demonstrate a due process violation as he had not presented any evidence the government delayed indictment to gain a tactical advantage or acted in any other way in bad faith. <em>Jones, </em>94 F.3d at 905. The panel of the Fourth Circuit, in <em>Jones, </em>in any event, recognized that it could not overrule the decision of the panel that decided <em>Howell; </em>that task being left to the court sitting en banc.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Indeed, the majority of the Federal Circuits interpret <em>Marion </em>and <em>Lovasco </em>differently than Petitioner and the Fourth and Ninth Circuits.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The majority of the circuits, expressly citing <em>Marion </em>and <em>Lovasco, </em>clearly employ a two element due process test for evaluating pre-indictment delay, requiring a showing of actual prejudice to the defense as well as a showing that the delay was an intentional device employed by the government to gain a tactical advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">For instance, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in <em>United States v.

Petitioner quotes <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> a Sixth Amendment speedy trial case, to demonstrate that the same concerns exist with providing a speedy trial as with preindictment delay, thus, as is the case with speedy trial violations, a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial must be protected in the case of pre-indictment delay by a balancing test. Petitioner contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">As the Supreme Court noted [in] <em>Barker v. Wingo, supra, </em>the harm threatened by untimely prosecution includes \u201coppressive pretrial incarceration,\u201d \u201canxiety and concern of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>accused,\u201d and \u201cthe possibility that the [accused\u2019s] defense will be impaired\u201d by dimming memories and the loss of exculpatory evidence. Of these forms of prejudice, \u201cthe most serious is the last because the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system.\u201d [Wingo,] 407 U.S. at 532, 92 S.Ct. at 2193, 33 L.Ed.2d at 118. That same concern with the ability to present a defense is of as much, if not more, of a concern when the latter-to-be accused is not aware during the period of the delay of the necessity to preserve memories and evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The Petitioner\u2019s attempted analogy between <em>Wingo </em>and the present case also misapprehends the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Wingo. </em>The <em>Wingo </em>factors, <em>supra, </em>are but some of the factors to be considered when considering prejudice to the defendant, which is itself a factor to be weighed against three other considerations, <em>see supra </em>note 19, and not necessarily something upon which a Sixth Amendment violation of the Speedy Trial Clause could stand alone. <em>Wingo, </em>407 U.S. at 533-35, 92 S.Ct. at 2193-95, 33 L.Ed.2d 101. As one author notes, with regard to the fallacy of such an analogy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">The Speedy Trial Clause and the due process analysis both rely on temporal delay as a trigger for protection. It is easy to view them as interchangeable, and the Court\u2019s consideration of the government\u2019s reasons for the delay for a speedy trial violation was reminiscent of the bad faith element of the due process analysis. A closer look, however, shows that the two rights are fundamentally different. The <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>test balanced the government\u2019s reason for a delay against the other factors, including the presumption of prejudice, to determine a constitutional violation. <em>Lovasco </em>and <em>Mari,on, </em>did not adopt a balancing test.... Unlike the speedy trial right, which arises from a specific constitutional protection requiring the government to act within some general time constraint, due process protects against prosecutorial misconduct related to the use or destruction of evidence. Delay alone is not a due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>violation, even if the government\u2019s reasons for not acting expeditiously were ill-considered or reflected a slovenly approach to the investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Henning, <em>supra, </em>at 777. It is clear then that, unlike in a Speedy Trial Clause balancing test, the element of prosecutorial misconduct, which amounts to more than mere negligence,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> is a necessary component to a due process violation as that is what due process protects against. It follows that for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>there to be a due process violation for pre-indictment delay, there must be both actual prejudice and government delay to gain a tactical advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">\n<em>D. Maryland Cases Regarding Pre-indictment Delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">As noted, <em>supra, </em>the Court of Special Appeals has adopted and employed the two element test over the balancing test for evaluating due process claims with regard to pre-indictment delay. <em>See Smallwood, </em>51 Md.App. 463, 443 A.2d 1003; <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>34 Md.App. 525, 368 A.2d 1036 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>280 Md. 730; <em>Blake v. State, </em>15 Md.App. 674, 292 A.2d 780 (1972); <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>14 Md.App. 582, 589, 287 A.2d 791, 795 (1972). The issue is a matter of first impression for this Court. We determine that the Court of Special Appeals correctly chose and applied the two element test of <em>Marion </em>and <em>Lovasco.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">As noted <em>supra, </em>Maryland has no statute prescribing a time limit for seeking an indictment for felonies and peneteniary misdemeanors. We look to the common law for guidance as required by Article 5 of the Declaration of Rights, Constitution of Maryland, which mandates \u201c[t]hat the Inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the Common Law of England, and the trial by Jury, according to the course of the Law, and to the benefit of such of the English statutes as existed on the Fourth day of July, seventeen hundred and seventy-six.\u201d As the Court of Special Appeals correctly noted in <em>Smallwood, </em>\u201c[a]t common law, criminal proceedings may be instituted at any time during the life of an offender.\u201d <em>Smallwood, </em>51 Md.App. at 468, 443 A.2d at 1006 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Hochheimer, Law of Crimes and Criminal Procedure \u00a7 87 (1897); 1 Wharton, Criminal Law \u00a7 90 (14th ed. (1978)). Therefore, assuming that the indictment against Petitioner was otherwise validly brought, the indictment does not fail merely because it was brought fifteen years after the crime was committed. <em>Cf. Smallwood, </em>51 Md.App. at 468, 443 A.2d at 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">We now turn to the Maryland Constitution to determine whether there is any barrier to be found regarding Petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>er\u2019s \u201cdelayed\u201d prosecution. Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights to the Maryland Constitution, addressing due process, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">[n]o man ought to be taken or imprisoned or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or, in any manner, destroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the Law of the land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">We long ago determined that the phrase, \u201cthe Law of the land,\u201d \u201cmean[s] the same thing\u201d as \u201cdue process of law\u201d as used in the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Baltimore Belt R.R. v.

Application of the Two Part Test to the Present Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">We now must determine whether the Court of Special Appeals correctly applied the two part test to the facts of the present case. The Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there was no showing that the delay was an intentional, calculated tactic utilized by the State to obtain an advantage over appellant at trial. The police initially investigated the crimes, interviewed witnesses and suspects, and pursued leads. Yet, the police did not obtain information necessary to move forward on the case until they re-interviewed Michael Grimes 15 years after the crimes, and obtained his cooperation. The court committed no clear error in its denial of appellant\u2019s claim of unconstitutional pre-indictment delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">In this instance, as George Washington once wrote to Thomas Jefferson, \u201c[d]elay is preferable to error.\u201d <em>Smallwood, </em>51 Md.App. at 467, 443 A.2d at 1005 (quoting Thomas Jefferson in a letter to George Washington dated 16 May 1792). Even though Petitioner concededly suffered actual prejudice due to the loss of witnesses and other suspects, <em>supra </em>p. 619,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> no evidence was adduced that the State pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>posefully delayed Petitioner\u2019s arrest to gain a tactical advantage over him. The investigation by Detective Capel conducted immediately following the crimes included: interviewing witnesses, including three eyewitnesses to the attempted robbery; compiling and showing to witnesses a photographic lineup that included Petitioner and the other three suspects; submitting hairs from the recovered red bandana for comparison with hair samples from Chad and Mike Grimes; and, interviewing the four initial suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Additionally, although the investigation immediately following the crimes apparently produced probable cause to believe that Clark, the Grimes brothers, and Stallings were involved, and Detective Capel prepared an Application for Statement of Charges for each of the four suspects, as the trial court found, it also was believed, with reason, that the evidence discovered at that time may have been insufficient to prosecute them successfully.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> As noted <em>supra, </em>in <em>Lovasco, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court explained that the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause does not require a prosecutor to seek an indictment the moment he or she has probable cause. The Third Circuit noted, in <em>United States v. Ismaili:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">As the Supreme Court instructs, \u201cit should be equally obvious that prosecutors are under no duty to file charges as soon as probable cause exists but before they are satisfied they will be able to establish the suspect\u2019s guilt beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>a reasonable doubt.... Penalizing prosecutors who defer actions [until doubt is eliminated] would subordinate the goal of \u2018orderly expedition\u2019 to that of \u2018mere speed.\u2019 <em>Smith v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 1, 10, 79 S.Ct. 991, 3 L.Ed.2d 1041 (1959).

Marll testified he felt Detective Capel had not lacked diligence in pursing the case. He stated that Detective Capel was \u201can excellent detective. And anything he could have pursued he would have back then. I read the case folder. I feel he did an excellent job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Detective Marll and his partner first focused on Chad Grimes, whose hair was on the red bandana, but when he was murdered in January 1997, they turned their attention to Mike Grimes. In March 1998, they prepared an arrest warrant based upon the probable cause they had and arrested Michael Grimes. He confessed to his role in the crimes and implicated Clark as the gunman. Based on this new evidence, Clark was promptly arrested and indicted in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The investigation continued after Clark\u2019s arrest. Saliva from the red bandana was found to match Clark\u2019s DNA within a statistical calculation of one in 7.7 million people.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Grimes brother, Mark Grimes, was also interviewed, and stated that he had overheard Clark admit to the murders in 1982. As Respondent explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">The reality of investigation is that sometimes a case can be thoroughly investigated and yield evidence insufficient to win at trial, and then later, a key piece of evidence \u201ccracks\u201d the case. That evidence may come in the form of an unexpected, albeit hoped-for, change in one of the suspect\u2019s stories, as it did here. The evidence could also come from a witness who comes forward for the first time because of a guilty conscience, or from an anonymous tip. While limited resources played a role in the timing of the re-interviewing of Mike Grimes, which produced the evidence that \u201ccracked\u201d the case here, there is nothing to say that re-interviewing Grimes at an earlier point in time after his initial denials would have yielded the same result. Indeed, Grimes testified that his brother Chad\u2019s murder in 1997 had a \u201cbig impact\u201d on him, and contributed to his confession to Detective Marll.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Respondent\u2019s Br., at 17. We conclude that there was no evidence that the State purposefully delayed indictment to gain a tactical advantage over Petitioner.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Cf, e.g., Lovasco, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>431 U.S. at 790-95, 97 S.Ct. at 2049, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (noting that the Government delayed prosecution on the \u201chope ... that others might be discovered who may have participated in the theft ----\u201d and concluding that such a delay does not amount to a due process violation as warranted by the two part test); <em>Sowa, </em>34 F.3d at 451-52 (approving delay because the Government acted promptly to charge defendant once they identified a reliable witness). Therefore, on this record, the trial court properly denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">As to the second question before us, we conclude that the trial court improperly excluded the relevant medical records of the witness, Michael Grimes, and foreclosed cross-examination of Grimes regarding related potential memory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>problems Prior to trial and pursuant to subpoena, Petitioner obtained records from the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission pertaining to a claim filed by Michael Grimes. The records indicated that, on 30 April 1991, Michael Grimes was the victim of an industrial accident. On 3 June 1991, he filed a claim with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission in which he stated: \u201cI was unloading a hopper of lime and ash when the door pushed open to the hopper. I fell from a ladder and was burned by the hot lime and ash.\u201d Grimes also claimed that he suffered other physical and psychological injuries from the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">As part of his post-accident treatment, Grimes began to see a psychologist, Dr. Joseph M. Eisenberg. In July 1991, Dr. Eisenberg conducted a psychodiagnostic evaluation of Grimes. In a report of that evaluation, he stated that shortly after Grimes was released from the hospital several symptoms developed, including memory problems. In a letter dated 30 September 1991, Dr. Eisenberg related that Grimes was being treated for \u201ca set of emotional disorders that are a direct consequence of the accident.\u201d Throughout the period of treatment, Dr. Eisenberg took progress notes and, on 7 April 1992, he observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">[Michael] forgot his appointment today, but I made time to see him in spite of his having missed his scheduled hour. During the course of the session, he described how he has difficulty with memory \u201cat least five times a day,\u201d and he tends to feel demeaned and \u201cstupid\u201d because of his memory difficulties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The State filed a motion to preclude the defense from inquiring into Grimes\u2019s medical history following the 1991 industrial accident. Immediately preceding the direct testimony of Michael Grimes at Petitioner\u2019s trial on 14 April 1999, the trial court considered whether to permit Petitioner to question Grimes about his reported memory problems. After noting that the State had filed a written motion to preclude the defense from inquiring into Grimes\u2019s psychiatric history, the trial judge observed that, although the entire Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission file was available, \u201cnothing the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>has found ... would go to whether or not ... \u2014 it would affect his memory as such.\u201d The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acd\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Judge, would I be allowed to ask if he filed a worker\u2019s comp-claim alleging some type of psychiatric disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-4\">THE COURT: I think I\u2019ll let you ask that question and consider letting him answer yes or no.<footnotemark>[32]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Now I\u2019ve looked at the notes that were in here, and it\u2019s interesting, your Honor, that you talk about memory. I\u2019m going to hand this here up to you. He was being interviewed by one of the therapists.... During the course of the sessions he has described how he has difficulty with memory at least five times a day and he tends to feel demeaned and stupid because of his memory difficulties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY: Judge, I haven\u2019t been shown this and haven\u2019t had a chance to look over this. I did have a glance at this. It\u2019s dated April 14, 1992[sic].<footnotemark>[33]</footnotemark> I think that the cases that have been cited, specifically the case [defense counsel] was kind enough to direct us to last week, <em>Reese </em>versus State,<footnotemark>[34]</footnotemark> which is also what the Court looks at, that\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>relevancy issues here. The first thing that <em>Reese </em>says, and which Judge Murphy says in his evidence handbook, is that it is impermissible to simply just ask about psychiatric treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">Clearly if [defense counsel] is allowed to just simply ask whether or not Mr. Grimes has filed for disability claiming a psychiatric disorder, the Jury then has no idea. And I believe it\u2019s done only in essence to \u2014 it\u2019s not probative of any sort of relevant trait regarding his truthfulness or his ability to observe or to remember. It is only in an effort to sort of intimidate or harass, which is what <em>Reese </em>is trying to guard against.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">If he asks that question because he knows \u2014 and defense counsel knows that the claim was for depression and substance abuse, that certainly isn\u2019t relevant to his ability to testify truthful [sic], which the case addresses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-7\">So I don\u2019t even believe that it\u2019s permissible that he asks, specifically knowing that the claim was filed for depression and substance abuse,<footnotemark>[35]</footnotemark> which has nothing to do with, back in 1982, his ability to observe and to perceive what was happening around himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">Certainly he wasn\u2019t hallucinating or delusional back then. There is no evidence of that. In 1999 we have no evidence that he is delusional or hallucinating or has a problem with memory or perception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-9\">Those are the two relevant types I believe that the Court is supposed to be looking at when determining whether or not the psychiatric history of a witness is admissible. And there\u2019s just been nothing provided. And certainly there\u2019s been no expert to say that someone who is suffering from depression or substance abuse is then likely to be delusional or hallucinate or have a lack of memory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-10\">I don\u2019t see how it all comes in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>* <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Now memory is something that comes and goes. This case happened many, many years ago. And it\u2019s got to do with this witness and his ability to accurately recall certain events. And he states it right there, he\u2019s got memory problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">THE COURT: That was in '92.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Yeah. But, like I said, memory comes and goes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">THE COURT: I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: And it did happen. And this happened between now and that event sometime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-10\">I think it\u2019s fair game.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-11\">THE COURT: I\u2019ll answer your first question first. I\u2019m going to dump it right on Chief Judge [Joseph F.] Murphy [Jr.]\u2019s lap. And he talks about something that would affect the veracity and credibility of a witness at the present time he witnessed the event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-12\">There\u2019s no indication whatsoever at the time he witnessed this event or the time frame that he\u2019s talking about back in 1982 that there was anything wrong with him. And that workmen\u2019s comp claim that was filed much later and the reports concerning his memory were in 1992. So I\u2019m going to dump it in his lap and say it did not concern the time frame and the mere fact that he may have subsequent thereto had some psychiatric problems is inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">The Court of Special Appeals, as noted <em>supra, </em>determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not permitting the cross-examination as \u201cGrimes\u2019s 1992 psychiatric problems were not a proper subject of inquiry because they did not relate to his perception at the time of the criminal incident.\u201d On appeal, Petitioner argues the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-14\">The trial court, in denying petitioner the opportunity to question [Michael] Grimes about his self-reported memory problems, and the Court of Special Appeals, in affirming the lower court\u2019s ruling, both focused on the issue of perception at the time of the crime, not accuracy of memory and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>recollection years later. Accuracy of memory and recollection, however, are clearly appropriate subjects of cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Petitioner further contends that because the accuracy of Grimes\u2019s memory and recollection were relevant, it should have been the subject of cross-examination. We agree with Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Accuracy of memory and recollection are appropriate subjects for cross-examination. Chief Judge Murphy of the Court of Special Appeals, in his <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook, </em>states with regard to recollection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">How good is the witness\u2019s recollection? How intelligent is he? How accurate is his memory? No matter how honest the witness happens to be, it is entirely <em>proper </em>to demonstrate his lack of capacity or opportunity to recall the relevant event.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Murphy, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1301(B), at 493 (emphasis added). In <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence, </em>it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-9\">A witness may be cross-examined for the purpose of testing his recollection. The cross-examiner is allowed great latitude in testing a witness\u2019s recollection and accuracy. The witness may be asked any question which would probe the accuracy of the witness\u2019s memory. Indeed, in the trial judge\u2019s discretion, the witness may even be questioned regarding irrelevant matters for the purpose of testing the witness\u2019s memory. The witness may be asked about anything that tends to show an inability to recall and to testify accurately, provided counsel has a good faith basis for the question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">B. Bergman and N. Hollander, 2 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence \u00a7 9:07, at 598-99 (15th ed 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">We have not addressed this question directly; however, in <em>Martens Chevrolet v.

Ash, </em>215 Md. 285, 290, 137 A.2d 661, 664 (1958)). In addition, Maryland Rule 5-616(a)(6),<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> impeachment by inquiry of the witness, states that the \u201ccredibility of a witness may be attacked through questions asked of the witness, including questions that are directed at ... [p]roving lack of personal knowledge or weakness in the capacity of the witness to perceive, remember, or communicate .... \u201d Maryland Rule 5-616(b)(4), concerning extrinsic impeaching evidence, states that \u201c[ejxtrinsic evidence of a witness\u2019s lack of personal knowledge or weaknesses in the capacity of the witness to perceive, remember, or communicate may be admitted if the witness has been examined about the impeaching fact and has failed to admit it, or as otherwise required by the interests of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Respondent acknowledges generally that the accuracy of a witness\u2019s memory is a fit subject for exploration on cross-examination, but argues that Petitioner \u201cutterly failed to demonstrate that the proffered evidence, i.e., a self-report of memory problems from 1992, had an bearing on Grimes\u2019s ability to perceive the events at the time of the crimes in 1982, or to recall the events in 1982 at the time of the trial,\u201d and \u201c[ajbsent this link, the evidence of Grimes\u2019s memory problems in 1992 is irrelevant, and was properly held to be inadmissible.\u201d We determine otherwise and conclude that the relevancy of the obviously intended line of questioning was demonstrated, particularly in determining whether Grimes had lingering memory difficulties at the time of his testimony at Clark\u2019s trial in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Respondent correctly notes that initially it is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court to determine the admissibility of evidence. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-104(a) (\u201cPrelim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>inary questions concerning ... the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court\u201d); <em>see also Hopkins v. State, </em>352 Md. 146, 158, 721 A.2d 231, 237 (1998). Trial courts are afforded \u201cbroad discretion in the conduct of trials in such areas as the reception of evidence.\u201d <em>Hopkins, </em>352 Md. at 158, 721 A.2d at 237 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Void v. State, </em>325 Md. 386, 393, 601 A.2d 124, 127 (1992)). \u201cAccordingly, in our appellate review, we extend the trial court great deference in determining the admissibility of evidence and will reverse ... if the court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">A threshold requirement for the admission of any evidence is that the evidence be relevant. <em>See Conyers, </em>354 Md. at 176, 729 A.2d at 933 (\u201cOf critical importance ... is that any proffered evidence must be relevant.\u201d); Md. Rule 5-402 (\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by constitutions, statutes, or these rules, or by decisional law not inconsistent with these rules, all relevant evidence is admissible. Evidence that is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d). Maryland Rule 5-401 defines relevant evidence as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d \u201cEven if relevant, however, evidence can be excluded if \u2018its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hopkins, </em>352 Md. at 159, 721 A.2d at 237 (quoting Md. Rule 5-403). Lastly, a party seeking to admit impeachment evidence is in no way relieved of the obligation to show that the evidence is relevant to the witness\u2019s ability to perceive or to remember the events about which he is testifying. <em>Cf. Blair v. State, </em>130 Md.App. 571, 596, 747 A.2d 702, 715 (2000) (\u201cMd. Rule 5-616(c) does not relieve a party seeking to admit a statement under the rule of the obligation to show the statement\u2019s relevance.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Petitioner relies heavily on <em>Reese v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 281, 458 A.2d 492 (1983), for his position that he should be entitled to question Michael Grimes about his self-reported memory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>problems. In <em>Reese, </em>the appellant, upon the testimony of the victim, Donald Major, was convicted of robbery with a deadly weapon by a jury in the Criminal Court of Baltimore. <em>Reese, </em>54 Md.App. at 282, 458 A.2d at 493. \u201cBefore, during and after the trial appellant sought leave to probe the psychiatric history of the victim and to cross-examine him regarding related matters.\u201d <em>Reese, </em>54 Md.App. at 283, 458 A.2d at 494. The information before the trial court related that the victim had been hospitalized before and after the crime and \u201cat least twelve times in the last several years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Medical Administrator explained that the victim\u2019s diagnosis was \u201cmixed emotional disturbance and borderline personality,\u201d which was described as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">Essentially a borderline personality individual is someone who experiences from time to time under stress episodes of psychosis or losing touch with reality and comes back into reality fairly easily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-6\"><em>Id. </em>The Administrator added that \u201cif [the victim] had been out of touch with reality at the time of the offense he would not be able to recollect issues in any kind of detail.\u201d <em>Reese, </em>54 Md.App. at 284, 290, 458 A.2d at 494 (internal quotation marks omitted). The trial court declined to permit appellant to question the victim/witness on this basis. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed and stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACa\">had appellant been permitted to elicit even that much of a basis upon cross-examination of the victim, a serious question would have been cast on the victim\u2019s recollection of the appellant\u2019s participation in the episode. The appellant\u2019s peculiar explanation of a limited participation may or may not have been believed, but ... he had a right to have his version fully in balance before the factfinder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-8\"><em>Reese, </em>54 Md.App. at 290, 458 A.2d at 497. In so concluding, the intermediate appellate court noted that the scope of cross-examination is within the discretion of the court, that generally a witness may be questioned on any relevant matter, that the witness\u2019s credibility is always relevant, and that the trial judge, within his or her discretion, must preclude harassment of the witness on cross-examination. <em>Reese, </em>54 Md.App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>286, 458 A.2d at 495 (citing <em>Conner v. State, </em>34 Md.App. 124, 133, 366 A.2d 385 (1976); <em>Smith v. State, </em>273 Md. 152, 157, 328 A.2d 274 (1974); <em>Alford v. United States, </em>282 U.S. 687, 694, 51 S.Ct. 218, 75 L.Ed.2d 624 (1931)). The court also noted that the U.S. Supreme Court described the trial court\u2019s discretion regarding the scope of cross-examination</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-4\">as the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested. Acknowledging \u2018the broad discretion of a trial judge to preclude repetitive and unduly harassing interrogation,\u2019 the Court in <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316, [94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347] (1974), pointed out that a cross-examiner is not only permitted to delve into a witness\u2019s perceptions and memory, but the cross-examiner is allowed to impeach, \u2018i.e., discredit\u2019 the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">What is referred to as \u2018broad discretion\u2019 of the trial judge, upon examination, becomes a rather narrow one. The right to discredit an accuser being one of constitutional dimension, <em>Davis, supra, </em>can be but limitedly circumscribed. It appears that only to the extent that the examination strays from extracting from a witness that which discredits the credibility of his testimony, and broaches upon an effort rather to humiliate his person that the duty to protect at the other end of the spectrum arises....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">The \u201cdiscretion\u201d then, between the defendant\u2019s right to discredit testimony and the trial judge\u2019s duty to protect a witness is solely one of relevance of the questions to the witness\u2019s credibility. The relevancy test at this juncture does not regard the elucidation of one of the main issues at trial, it is whether the answer elicited will be a useful aid to the court or jury in appraising the credibility (not necessarily the veracity) of the witness and in assessing the probative value of his direct testimony. McCormick, Handbook of the Law of Evidence, \u00a7 29 (2d ed.1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-7\"><em>Reese, </em>54 Md.App. at 286-87, 458 A.2d at 495-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">The Court of Special Appeals continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>In determining the relevance of an inquiry into a witness\u2019s psychological instability, there is some room for discretion such as defining whether the particular disorder affects factors of credibility like memory, observation, exaggeration, imagination, etc. But even that limited sphere is further restricted by the weight of the evidence so indicating. The proffer need not be that proof beyond a reasonable doubt, or even by a preponderance of evidence, will show that such disorder is or was prevalent. It need only show that inquiry is likely to so divulge such a defect in the witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\"><em>Reese, </em>54 Md.App. at 289, 458 A.2d at 497. The Court concluded, \u201c[i]t is enough to compel a reversal that a constitutional right was improperly restricted leaving prejudice an obvious possibility.\u201d <em>Reese, </em>54 Md.App. at 291, 458 A.2d at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Respondent incorrectly concludes that Grimes\u2019s 1992 self-reported memory problem is so different from the situation in <em>Reese </em>that Grimes\u2019s condition was irrelevant. Respondent asserts that the memory problem was irrelevant because the report of the condition was distant in time from both the events that were the subject of Grimes\u2019s testimony and the time he testified about them. Respondent is correct that there was no indication from the record whether Michael Grimes suffered memory problems at the time of the crimes in 1982 or at the time of the trial in 1999; however, as Petitioner points out, \u201c[t]he fact that he reported his memory problems to a therapist in 1992 did not mean that the problems no longer existed when he testified in 1999.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br., at 38. As the Court of Special Appeals stated in <em>Reese, </em>\u201ca proffer to permit an initial question regarding credibility needs but minimal support. Apparently, it need be little more than an \u2018articulable suspicion,\u2019 or at most \u2018probable cause\u2019 to believe that the facts elicited will be relevant to credibility.\u201d <em>Reese, </em>54 Md.App. at 288, 458 A.2d at 496 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">We further disagree with Respondent\u2019s argument that \u201c[njothing about Grimes\u2019s memory problems in 1992 suggests that it was a matter \u2018likely to ... test his memory or knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>edge\u2019 about events long past,\u2019 \u201d Respondent\u2019s Br. at 29 (quoting <em>State v. Cox, </em>298 Md. 173, 178, 468 A.2d 319 (1983)), and with Respondent\u2019s attempt to \u201cdiagnose\u201d Grimes\u2019s memory problems as merely \u201cshort-term memory loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Upon inquiry, Grimes may have acknowledged that he still suffered from memory problems or he may have testified that all of his memory problem had resolved long ago. He may have stated that, although he still suffered from memory problems, his memory of the crime was quite clear. In any event, the topic was relevant and Petitioner had the right to cross-examine Grimes on the subject.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> As in <em>Davis v. Alaska, supra,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqL\">We cannot speculate as to whether the jury, as sole judge of the credibility of a witness, would have accepted this line of reasoning had counsel been permitted to fully present it. But we do conclude that the jurors were entitled to have the benefit of the defense theory before them so that they could make an informed judgment as to the weight to place on Green\u2019s testimony which provided \u2018a crucial link in the proof ... of petitioner\u2019s act.\u2019 ... The accuracy and truthfulness of Green\u2019s testimony were key elements in the State\u2019s case against petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"><em>Davis, </em>415 U.S. at 317, 94 S.Ct. at 1111, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (alterations in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">We agree with Petitioner that defense counsel\u2019s purpose in asking Grimes about his past memory problems was not to embarrass or humiliate the witness, but was to determine the reliability of his memory in 1999 with regard to his testimony concerning events allegedly occurring in 1982. The potentially impeaching information could have been elicited without revealing that its source was a psychiatric record, thereby eliminating the concerns expressed by the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals relied on a passage, <em>supra </em>p. 11, from Chief Judge Murphy\u2019s <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook, </em>to illustrate that the trial court did not abuse its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>discretion because it would be improper to ask the witness, \u201cAre you under the care of a psychiatrist?\u201d Yet, asking that precise question is not necessary to determine whether Grimes suffered from any memory impediment at the time of his testimony. For example, the witness could be asked whether he had suffered an industrial accident in 1991 and whether, as a result, he experienced, and continued to experience, problems with memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">What may be a more significant consideration in permitting this line of questioning is the importance of Grimes\u2019s testimony to the State\u2019s case. It seemed to make a critical difference to the State between only having probable cause to charge Petitioner and being able to try him. In 1982, Grimes denied any knowledge of the crime, but when questioned in 1998, Grimes admitted his involvement, agreed to plead guilty, and to testify against Petitioner. Petitioner was arrested the next day. At the motions hearing on 16 September 1998, Detective Marll agreed that as a result of Michael Grimes\u2019s statements Petitioner had been arrested.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In light of the apparent importance of Grimes\u2019s testimony to the State\u2019s case, cross-examination regarding Grimes\u2019s memory in 1999 of events allegedly occurring over sixteen years earlier should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL.

Justice White stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">The issue presented by this petition for certiorari is what is the correct test for determining if prosecutorial pre-indictment delay amounts to a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.... The Second Circuit held that there was no due process violation because petitioner \u2018made no showing of an improper prosecutorial motive.' . .. Other circuits [(the First, Third, Tenth, and Eleventh)] have similarly required a showing of prosecutorial misconduct designed to obtain a tactical advantage over the defendant or to advance some other impermissible purpose ... to establish a due process violation... . Two Circuits [(the Fourth and the Ninth)], however, have concluded that intentional misconduct is not the sine qua non for a due process violation from prosecutorial preindictment delay, and instead they hold that the proper inquiry is to balance the prejudice to the defendant against the Government\u2019s justification for delay.... Exemplifying the significant disagreement in the lower courts over the proper test, panels in the Fifth and Seventh Circuits have acknowledge conflicts between decisions from their own Circuits on this issue....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-8\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Crouch, </em>84 F.3d 1497, 1512 n. 13 (5th Cir.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1076, 117 S.Ct. 736, 136 L.Ed.2d 676 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b671-6\">. In reaching this conclusion, the Fifth Circuit noted, inter alia, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae_\">neither <em>Marion </em>nor <em>Lovasco </em>mentions any 'balancing' or 'weighing' of the extent of the prejudice against the relative merit of the reasons for the delay. Indeed, the closest thing to a reference to balancing is <em>Marions </em>statement that limitations statutes 'represent legislative assessments of <em>relative interests </em>of the State and the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-7\"><em>Crouch, </em>84 F.3d at 1510 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\">. Petitioner incorrectly employs the Seventh Circuit case of <em>United States v. Sowa, </em>34 F.3d 447 (7th Cir.1994) as support for a due process balancing test. It is clear that the Seventh Circuit in <em>Sowa </em>employed a two part analysis rather than a balancing test. <em>Cf. Crouch, </em>84 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>1512 &amp; n. 14 (explaining <em>Sowa </em>as a case in which the Seventh Circuit uses the two part test rather than the balancing test). In <em>Sowa, </em>the Seventh Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">To establish that a pre-indictment delay violated due process, Sowa must prove that the delay caused actual and substantial prejudice to his fair trial rights, and there must be a showing that the government delayed indictment to gain a tactical advantage or some other impermissible reason....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">Sowa\u2019s claim, however, fails to meet the requirements of the second prong. With respect to the government's delay, due process is only implicated if the government purposely delayed the indictment to take advantage, tactically, of the prejudice or otherwise acted in bad faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-9\"><em>Sowa, </em>34 F.3d at 450; <em>see also Aleman v. The Honorable Judges of the Circuit Court of Cook County, </em>138 F.3d 302, 309 (7th Cir.1998) (stating that to demonstrate a pre-indictment delay violation, the defendant must show actual delay and the government must demonstrate justification for the delay, \"which the court will balance against the prejudice\u201d), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 1097, 148 L.Ed.2d 969 (2001). It is likely that Petitioner believes that <em>Sowa </em>supports a balancing test because the Seventh Circuit provided that once the defendant proves actual prejudice the government has to supply its reasons for delay, and the \"[t]he reasons are then balanced against the defendant\u2019s prejudice to determine whether the defendant has been denied due process.\u201d <em>Sowa, </em>34 F.3d at 451. This form of balancing, however, does not go as far as those courts that clearly adopt a balancing test, <em>see supra </em>pp. 632-35. <em>Sowa </em>has been criticized as ignoring what the Supreme Court intended in requiring proof of bad faith, that there must be a direct connection between the government\u2019s reason for the delay and the prejudice. In other words, prejudice that is an incidental effect of delay is insufficient for a due process violation. <em>See </em>Peter J. Henning, <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct and Constitutional Remedies, </em>77 Wash. U.L.Q. 713, 778 (1999) (noting some courts, such as the Seventh Circuit in <em>Sowa, </em>\u201chave ignored the requirement of actual bad faith adopted in <em>Lovasco </em>and <em>Marion, </em>instead substituting a broader examination of the government\u2019s reasons for the delay that is more akin to the balancing test\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\">. One author also commented on the difficulty with using a balancing test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">Any test that simply compares prejudice to the defendant with the prosecutor\u2019s reason for a delay runs the risk of holding the government responsible for the loss of testimony or items about which it had no knowledge, and more importantly, no intention of removing from the body of evidence available at trial. If a defendant could show some harm from the government\u2019s decision to postpone initiating a prosecution, then the balancing test would give courts the authority to assess the government\u2019s reasons for delay an to decide whether they met some unspecified criterion of acceptability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Henning, <em>supra, at 779.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b674-9\">. In determining Sixth Amendment speedy trial violations, the Supreme Court employs a balancing test, which takes into consideration length of delay, the reason for delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant. <em>Barker v.

It is clear from <em>Marion </em>and <em>Lovasco </em>that something more than mere negligence is required to amount to an intentional delay to gain a tactical advantage, particularly in light of the Court\u2019s noting in <em>Marion </em>that the Government conceded that an intentional tactical delay by the Government would violate the Due Process Clause. <em>See United States v. Rogers, </em>118 F.3d 466, 476 (6th Cir.1997) (explaining that the second part of the test for unconstitutional pre-indictment delay is \"that the delay was an intentional device by the government to gain a tactical advantage\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (citation omitted)). <em>Cf. </em>Henning, <em>supra, </em>at 776 (\"The Supreme Court has been consistent throughout its decisions reviewing knowing use of perjured testimony, destruction of exculpatory evidence, and investigative delay, in holding that a defendant must furnish proof of <em>actual </em>prosecutorial intent to harm, not just that the government negligence resulted in prejudice\u201d (emphasis added)). Yet, whether the U.S. Supreme Court intended that a demonstration of recklessness may be sufficient is unclear. <em>See Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. at 795 n. 17, 97 S.Ct. at 2051 n. 17, 52 L.Ed.2d 752.
