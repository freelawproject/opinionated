Farrell was initially charged by citations numbered OU396860 and OU396861 in the District Court of Maryland, Prince George\u2019s County, with exceeding the maximum speed limit and negligent driving in violation of Maryland Code (1977, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 21-801.1 and 21-901.1 of the Transportation Article. The case was set for trial on November 19, 1998, and, on that date, the case was called in open court before Judge Josef Brown. Farrell appeared with his attorney and entered a plea of not guilty. After no witnesses appeared on behalf of the State, Judge Brown found Farrell \u201cnot guilty\u201d and entered judgment to this effect. The State filed no motions or other documents in the citation case after the not guilty verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Twenty-eight days later, on December 17, 1998, the State instituted a new prosecution by filing in the District Court, Prince George\u2019s County, a second set of identical charges against Farrell by criminal information (MV Numbers 5090785 and S090786). On January 27, 1999, Farrell, by his attorney, filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the new charges were barred under established double jeopardy principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">A hearing on the motion to dismiss took place on February 25, 1999, before Judge Patrice E. Lewis of the District Court. Documentary evidence was presented to the court showing that the offenses charged under MV Numbers S090785 and 5090786 had previously been charged by traffic citations OU396860 and OU396861, had been called for trial on November 19, 1998, and had resulted in not guilty verdicts. The assistant state\u2019s attorney representing the State acknowledged that he had listened to the tape of the November 19, 1998, proceeding, and he conceded that \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdicts were rendered on the identical charges at that time. The State, however, argued that the new charges should not be dismissed on double jeopardy grounds because there was a good reason why no witnesses appeared for the State at the trial on November 19, 1998. The assistant state\u2019s attorney represented that, in early November 1998, the State had requested a postponement of the November 19th trial date and that the State had been informed that the trial had been postponed. According to the assistant state\u2019s attorney, the police officer and other witnesses were not present at the November 19th trial because they believed that the trial had been postponed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The District Court held that, regardless of what the State had been told concerning a postponement, the not guilty verdicts rendered on November 19, 1998, required the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>missal of the new charges. The District Court dismissed the second set of charges, with prejudice, on the ground of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The State appealed the dismissal to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 12 \u2014 401(b)(l)(ii) and 12-401(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article and Maryland Rule 7-102.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After receiving legal memoranda, the Circuit Court reversed the judgment of the District Court and ordered that the criminal information charges of exceeding the maximum speed limit and negligent driving be reinstated and that the case be remanded for a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Farrell filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted. <em>Farrell v. State, </em>359 Md. 333, 753 A.2d 1031 (2000). Farrell argues that, under settled double jeopardy principles, the not guilty verdicts rendered on November 19, 1998, barred a subsequent prosecution for the identical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>offenses. He invokes both the double jeopardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Maryland\u2019s common law double jeopardy prohibition. In connection with the double jeopardy prohibition under Maryland common law, Farrell particularly relies on <em>Daff v. State, </em>317 Md. 678, 566 A.2d 120 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The State asserts that, because it had been granted a postponement, the original charges were called for trial on November 19, 1998, as a result of a \u201cclerical error\u201d committed by the clerk\u2019s office of the District Court. Thus, according to the State, the prosecution had no opportunity to present evidence at the November 19th \u201ctrial.\u201d Consequently, the State\u2019s argument continues, jeopardy did not attach at the November 19th proceeding, and the filing of subsequent identical charges did not place Farrell in \u201cdouble jeopardy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">As this Court has pointed out on a multitude of occasions, the double jeopardy prohibition protects a criminal defendant from successive prosecution as well as cumulative punishment for the same offense. It is applicable to criminal prosecutions in this State by virtue of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Maryland common law. <em>See, e.g., Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 708, 759 A.2d 764, 794-795 (2000); <em>Jones v. State, </em>357 Md. 141, 156-157, 742 A.2d 493, 501 (1999); <em>Gianiny v.

We shall hold that the District Court correctly dismissed the new charges under Maryland\u2019s common law prohibition against double jeopardy. Therefore, consistent with our \u201cestablished principle that a court will not decide a constitutional issue when a case can properly be disposed of on a non-constitutional ground,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we shall not reach the issue of whether the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments also required the dismissal of the charges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">In holding that an intentionally rendered verdict of \u201cnot guilty\u201d is final and precludes, under Maryland common law, any further prosecution for the same offense, this Court in <em>Pugh v.

Adams, </em>196 Md. 341, 348, 76 A.2d 575 (1950); <em>Cochran v. State, </em>119 Md. 539, 544, 87 A. 400 (1913); <em>State v.

State, supra, </em>271 Md. 701, 319 A.2d 542, and <em>State v. Shields, supra, </em>49 Md. 301, has been reiterated by this Court on numerous occasions. <em>See, e.g., State v. Ghajari, </em>346 Md. 101, 109, 695 A.2d 143, 146 (1997) (\u201ca not guilty verdict may not be disturbed or revised by any Maryland court ... if [the] verdict of not guilty has been intentionally rendered by a court\u201d); <em>Wright v. State, supra, </em>307 Md. at 562-563, 515 A.2d at 1162 (the grant of a motion for judgment of acquittal, after the prosecution\u2019s case, precludes further trial proceedings and conviction for the same offense); <em>Brooks v. State, supra, </em>299 Md. at 155, 472 A.2d at 986 (\u201cOnce a trial judge intentionally acquits a defendant of a criminal offense over which the court has jurisdiction, the prohibition against double jeopardy does not permit him to change his mind. The grant of the motion for judgment of acquittal was a bar to further criminal proceedings on the same charge\u201d); <em>Block v. State, supra, </em>286 Md. at 273-274, 407 A.2d at 324 (\u201cthe fact that the court may not have been authorized under the rules to render the verdict does not make it void for double jeopardy purposes. The cases make it clear that an improper or defective exercise of jurisdiction does not deprive an acquittal of its finality. Instead, as long as the court rendering a not-guilty verdict has jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>over the offense, the verdict is a bar to further criminal proceedings on the same charge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">As argued by Farrell\u2019s counsel, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Daff v. State, supra, </em>317 Md. 678, 566 A.2d 120, is directly on point. The defendant Daff had been charged in the District Court of Maryland with assault and battery of two persons, and, upon Daff s request for a jury trial, the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Trial in the Circuit Court was scheduled for September 4, 1987. When the case was called for trial on September 4th, none of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses were present. The assistant state\u2019s attorney handling the prosecution stated that requests for the issuance of subpoenas for the witnesses had been given to the clerk of the court but that for some reason the subpoenas had not been issued. The prosecuting attorney requested a postponement of the trial. The court denied the request for postponement and suggested that the State nol pros the charges. The prosecuting attorney, however, refused to nol pros the two charges. The court thereupon rendered not guilty verdicts on both charges. About two months later, the State filed a bill of information in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County charging Daff with the identical assault and battery offenses. The Circuit Court granted Daff s motion to dismiss the information on double jeopardy grounds. Upon the State\u2019s appeal, the Court of Special Appeals reversed on the theory that jeopardy had not attached when the not guilty verdicts were entered and that, therefore, the prosecution was free to renew the charges. This Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals- and directed that the trial court\u2019s dismissal on double jeopardy grounds be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In holding that the not guilty verdicts barred any subsequent prosecution for the same -offenses, Judge McAuliffe for the Court in <em>Daff </em>reviewed the prior Maryland cases and other authorities (317 Md. at 684-685, 566 A.2d at 123-124):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2H\">\u201cThe principle embodied in the plea of <em>autrefois acquit </em>has been broadly interpreted. A verdict of not guilty, even though not followed by a judgment on the docket, is sufficient to invoke the protection. <em>Pugh v. State, supra, </em>271 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Md. at 706-07, 319 A.2d 542. Once a trial judge has intentionally rendered a verdict of not guilty, a subsequent change of mind is prohibited even though the judge may be convinced, even moments later, that the verdict was erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 707, 319 A.2d 542; <em>Brooks v. State, supra, </em>299 Md. at 155, 472 A.2d 981. The court entering the acquittal must have basic subject matter jurisdiction, but procedural errors will not affect the efficacy of the acquittal for jeopardy purposes. 2 Hawkins, <em>Pleas of the Crown </em>521 (8th ed. 1824); 2 Hale\u2019s <em>Pleas of the Crown, </em>247 (1st Am.Ed.1847). <em>See Block v. State, supra, </em>286 Md. at 273-74, 407 A.2d 320 (improper or defective exercise of jurisdiction does not deprive an acquittal of its finality); <em>Parojinog v. State, </em>282 Md. 256, 384 A.2d 86 (1978) (although juvenile judge lacked authority under the statute and rules to enter a verdict when he did, the verdict is final for jeopardy purposes because the court had subject matter jurisdiction and jurisdiction over the respondent). An acquittal entered after trial on a fatally defective indictment is nevertheless effective to bar a subsequent prosecution for the same offense if the court had jurisdiction of the cause and of the party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">\u201cIn the instant case, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County had jurisdiction over the subject matter and over the defendant. The case had been called for trial, and the State\u2019s request for a postponement had been denied. If we assume that the trial judge erred in denying the State\u2019s request, or even that the judge was not the designee of the administrative judge authorized by the rules to grant a postponement, neither of these matters would affect the finality of an acquittal thereafter entered on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The State in <em>Dajf, </em>like the State in the case at bar, argued that, because no evidence had been presented and no witnesses had been sworn, jeopardy had not attached, and that, therefore, the filing of new charges was not \u201cdouble jeopardy.\u201d This Court pointed out that the issue of whether jeopardy had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>attached, in the sense of the presentation of evidence or the swearing of witnesses, has no relevance to the finality of an acquittal under common law principles (317 Md. at 688-689, 566 A.2d at 125-126):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">\u201cThe language relied upon by the State in connection with the question of when jeopardy attaches has largely evolved from cases dealing with mistrials or terminations other than by verdicts of guilty or not guilty. <em>See, e.g., Crist v. Bretz, supra </em>[437 U.S. 28, 98 S.Ct. 2156, 57 L.E.2d 24(1978)]; <em>Serfass v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 377, 95 S.Ct. 1055, 43 L.Ed.2d 265 (1975). Even under that line of cases, it is far from clear that the Supreme Court would hold that jeopardy had not attached in the instant case, within the meaning of the former acquittal protection of the Fifth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">\u201cIn any event, we reach the same conclusion under our interpretation of the common law of double jeopardy as it exists in this State. The plea of <em>autrefois acquit </em>was available when an acquittal followed a trial. It made no difference that the State\u2019s evidence may have been woefully deficient at that trial. Indeed, one may assume that the acquittal usually reflected the inadequacy of the State\u2019s case. We think the defense is no less available when the State\u2019s case has been completely deficient than when the State\u2019s case has been only partially deficient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">In the present circumstances, as in <em>Daff, </em>the trial court had jurisdiction over the offenses and over the defendant, and the trial court intentionally rendered not guilty verdicts. Under settled Maryland common law principles, the acquittals were final, and the State was precluded from bringing a new prosecution charging the same offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE DISTRICT COURT OF MARY</em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\n<em>LAND.
