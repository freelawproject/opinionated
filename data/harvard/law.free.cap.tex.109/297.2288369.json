Ferguson, ante, p. 287, are followed and held to control the disposition of this case. The Married Woman\u2019s Act of 1913 does' not confer on her power to contract as surety for her husband on a note not given for necessaries, and she is not bound thereby. (P. 298.)</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-14\">Error to the Court of Civil Appeals for the Second District on writ of error from Wise County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-15\">The bank sued Akin and wife as joint makers of a promissory note executed December 3, 1914, and for foreclosure of a deed of trust given by both to secure it. Neither defendant answered and judgment was taken by default against both with foreclosure of the mortgage. Nellie P. Akin, the wife, brought the case to the Court of Civil Appeals on writ of error, asserting that she appeared on the face of the record to be a married woman, that there were no allegations charging her person<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>ally or her separate estate with liability or calling on her to plead her disability. The appellate court reformed the judgment, disallowing the recovery against her except for the foreclosure. (194 S. W., 610.) The bank thereupon procured writ of error from the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-3\"><em>McMurray &amp; Gettys </em>and <em>H.
