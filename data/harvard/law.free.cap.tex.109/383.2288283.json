In the former case it would not be necessary to present them again by motion for new trial in order to assign the ruling as error; but where not preserved in the record in either way it was not made assignable as error by a general exception to the judgment on its merits, which did not involve a ruling on such application.

With a judgment, taken from the minutes of the court, revealing the court\u2019s action, it would have sufficiently appeared of record, rendering a formal bill of exception useless and unnecessary. The hearing on the plea having been before the court and the court having acted, there was no need to again bring the matter to the court\u2019s attention by a motion for new trial. The record here, however, does not contain the order of the court on the plea, nor does it show any proper exception to the court\u2019s action in overruling it. Attempt was made to preserve a record of the court\u2019s action by means of a bill of exception filed to the succeeding term of the court at which the trial on the merits was had. The ruling would have been reviewable under a proper bill of exception filed to the term \u25a0at which it was made, but it was clearly not reviewable under a bill of exception filed to a succeeding term.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The judgment of the court entered on the verdict of the jury in nowise reflected its action at the previous term on the plea of privilege, .and excepting to that judgment did not, therefore, amount to an exception to its ruling on the plea. It was for these reasons that we sustained the action of the Court of Civil Appeals in its declining to consider the assignment of error touching the plea of privilege through our refusal of the writ of error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
