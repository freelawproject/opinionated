C. Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In his petition Allen charged that in 1907 he was in possession of a sum of money, which was known to Thomas, his uncle. Thomas proposed that Allen turn over the money to him, assuring Allen that in such event he would put it out at interest for Allen\u2019s benefit and that Allen could obtain it whenever he needed or desired it; that he would place it so that it would be at all times safe and yield Allen an interest return. Upon this understanding, it was alleged, Allen delivered the money to Thomas. The agreement, as pleaded, was established by Allen\u2019s testimony. . There was no variance between the pleading and the proof, as is contended by the defendant in error, except that, according to Allen\u2019s testimony, Thomas\u2019 proposal was that he would put the money \u201cin the bank\u201d on interest for him, which is an immaterial distinction. Thomas died in 1912. Prior to Thomas\u2019 death, Allen had not requested the return of the money and Thomas had not returned it. Thomas at no time repudiated the agreement under which Allen entrusted the money to him. The suit was seasonably brought after Thomas\u2019 death.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">It was held by the Court of Civil Appeals that the claim was barred by limitation. We granted the writ of error upon the view that transaction amounted to an express trust in Allen\u2019s favor, as to which, under the facts, there was no limitation. It is plain, we think, that \"Thomas did not borrow the money and that the relation of debtor and creditor, therefore, was not created by the transaction. Thomas\u2019 proposal contemplated that his possession of the money should be in recognition of Allen\u2019s right to it, and that he would so use it for Allen\u2019s benefit as to certainly afford Allen the interest. His holding of the money was clearly that of an acknowledged trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The case was withdrawn from the Commission for the determination of another question, for which purpose we set it down for argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The ex parte deposition of Allen was taken by the executor, but not offered in evidence. The interrogatories propounded called for Allen\u2019s testimony touching the transaction with the decedent Thomas. Holding that thereby Allen had, within the meaning of the statute, been \u201ccalled to testify,\u201d by the adverse party in regard to the transaction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>and his incompetency as a witness in that particular thus removed, the trial court permitted him as a witness in his own behalf to recite what transpired between Thomas and himself in reaching the trust agreement. The Commission of Appeals was of the opinion that the ruling should be sustained. After a full review of the question we have reached the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction of the case is governed by the Act of 1913. Allen\u2019s right of recovery depends upon this testimony. Having this vital relation to the case, the question of the admissibility of the testimony is to be regarded as one of substantive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The taking of the deposition was for the purpose of obtaining Allen\u2019s testimony in respect to the matters inquired about. It was effective for the purpose. By its means the testimony was developed. Allen was-made to disclose the facts. He was compelled \"to testify\u201d regarding them. The method was one which the law furnished the adverse party and of which he availed himself, just as he might have called Allen to the stand. Allen\u2019s testimony was made subject to his use. It was not within Allen\u2019s power to prevent its use. He could not recall it. It stood adduced as a part of the record of the proceeding. With his testimony compelled under oath and obtained at the instance of the adverse party through the force of the law, with it available for the free use of the adverse party and at his disposal, with it of record and constituting an integral part of the trial, we think it is evident that within the full intendment of the statute Allen must be regarded as having been called by his adversary to testify concerning the transaction with the decedent, and as competent, therefore, to give evidence in his own behalf in relation to it. Regardless of any use of the deposition, Allen had thereby been required to give the testimony in a way sanctioned by the law as only another and equivalent method of placing him upon the stand. The purpose of his adversary in seeking the testimony had been accomplished. It had been attained as fully as though Allen had been called to the stand, since the testimony was as effectually developed and rendered as freely available. The trial court made the proper ruling. Gilkey v. Peeler, <em>22 </em>Texas, 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals is reversed and the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">\n<em>Reversed and judgment of District Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Mb. Justice HAWKIUS made the following announcement as to his views:</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">This case presents several important questions upon some of which I have not had reasonable opportunity for full investigation of the record or of the law of the case, and upon those questions I have reached no definite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">My request for a postponement, for one week, of the decision of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>court in this recently submitted cause having been denied, I decline to express therein, at this time, any opinion whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\">Later I will file a statement of my views in the premises.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
