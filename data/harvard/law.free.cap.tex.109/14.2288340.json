Defendant appealed, and on affirmance (179 S. W., 78) applied for writ of error. It was claimed on the trial that insured was killed when the railway depot at Lufkin, where he had a desk, was blown up by an explosion of dynamite stored there. The evidence supporting the conclusion of his death is given in the opinion by the appellate court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-10\"><em>Chas. B.

In the trial court a judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff, afterwards affirmed in the Court of Civil Appeals. The principal issue upon the trial was whether or not George Frank Parsons was in fact dead. It appears that since the affirmance of the judgment in the Court of Civil Appeals he has been discovered to be alive, revealing that no judgment on the policy ought to have been rendered. Under this condition both the plaintiff and defendant have filed motions in court, asking that the petition for writ of error be granted and the judgments of the District Court and Court of Civil Appeals be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court with instructions that it be dismissed at the plaintiff\u2019s cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-14\">We think this is the proper disposition to be made of the case. The petition for writ of error is accordingly granted; the judgments, of the Court of Civil Appeals and District Court are reversed, and the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>remanded to the District Court to be there dismissed at the plaintiffs cost. <em>Reversed and remanded with directions.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
