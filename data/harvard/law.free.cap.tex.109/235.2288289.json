The assignment was not made to secure this latter debt, though both assignor and assignee expected the latter to retain the amount thereof out of the proceeds of the note. A judgment creditor of the assignor garnished the maker of the note; he tendered the amount into court and the assignee intervened. Held that the garnishment prevailed over the claim of the assignee to appropriate the proceeds to the assignor\u2019s debt to him for legal services.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-13\">Question- certified from the Court of Civil Appeals for the Third District, in an appeal from Tom Green County.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-14\"><em>J.

A copy of our opinion is hereto attached and made a part hereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u201cThe facts pertinent to said question are these:</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u201cGeo. Allen executed to one Simpson his negotiable promissory note for $300, due March 33, 1913. Simpson endorsed this note to S. K. P. Jackson, but in fact Hugh Jackson owned a one-half undivided interest in said note, as was shown by oral testimony. He afterwards inherited a one-fourth interest in said note from said S. K. P. Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u201cOn January 6, 1913, Hugh Jackson endorsed said note and delivered it to J. T. Thomson, an attorney at law, as collateral security for a $50 note that he owed Thomson and $33 that he owed one Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\u201cFindlater &amp; Company obtained judgment against Hugh Jackson and garnisheed Allen. Thomson and Jackson intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">\u201cAt the time this note was delivered to Thomson, Hugh Jackson was indebted to him for various legal services in the sum of $75. Thomson never rendered an account to Jackson. Jackson knew that he was indebted to Thomson for legal services, but did not know the amount. Hothing was said by either Jackson or Thomson at the time said note was so endorsed and delivered, nor at any time prior to the service of the writ of garnishment on Allen, or prior to Allen\u2019s answer in said suit, about Thomson\u2019s appropriating any of the money when collected, on the debt that Jackson owed Thomson for legal services, though Jackson expected at the time he delivered said note to Thomson that Thomson would retain whatever was necessary out of said collection to pay such debt; and Thomson at the time said note was endorsed and delivered to him, expected to appropriate the money when collected on said Allen note, or so much thereof as was necessary, after paying said $50 note and the $33 due Scott, to the payment of the debt due him for such legal services. Thomson still retains possession of said note.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">\u201cWith the foregoing statement and explanation, the Court of Civil Appeals certifies to the Supreme Court for its decision the following question:.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">\u201cDid the facts above stated constitute an equitable assignment to' Thomson by Jackson of said Jackson\u2019s interest in the debt due on said Allen note to the extent of said $75 indebtedness, in addition to said indebtedness of $50 and $33?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">We answer \u201cNo\u201d to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">On the facts certified, the note of Allen never came into the hands of Thomson by virtue of any relation of attorney and client between \u2022Thomson and Jackson. Thomson held the note as collateral security as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>would any other creditor, and, as announced by this court in San Antonio National Bank v. Blocker, 77 Texas, 78, 13 S. W., 962: \u201cThe rule is well established that a pledge, or collateral, can not be held or used as a security for any debt or for any purpose save such as is covered by the agreement of the parties.\u201d \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\">Mechem accurately states the rule, which precludes the holding that an attorney\u2019s lien attached in favor of Thomson, in the following language: \u201cAn attorney has a general lien upon all the papers, deeds, vouchers and other documents of his client which come into the possession of the attorney while he is acting for his client in a professional capacity. But in order to the creation of the lien, the papers must not only have come into the actual possession of the attofney, but they must have so come into his possession in his character as an attorney at law. Thus he has no lien on papers which he receives ... as a mortgagee.\u201d Mechem on Agency, sec. 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The note was not placed in Thomson\u2019s hands for collection by him as an attorney. Since Thomson did not hold the note as attorney for Jackson and since he would not have held any part of the proceeds of the note\u2019s collection as Jackson\u2019s attorney, there was no attorney\u2019s lien in favor of Jackson; and there was no assignment save to secure the $50 and $33 notes.
