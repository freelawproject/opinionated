Before the lease was executed the plaintiff endeavored to hire the apartment unfurnished, as she had furniture of her own to move in. The response to this attempt was a statement by one of the defendants that the tenant would have to take the premises furnished or not at all. The plaintiff next asked what she would do with the defendant\u2019s furniture in the apartment and was told that she would have to rent garage space in the garage building behind the cottage next door at the rate of $5.00 per month, and that although she had no ear she would have to take the garage space if she wanted to take the cottage at No. 136. The lease as executed, August 24,1944, called for the rental of 136 Flash Road, furnished, at forty-five dollars a month and garage space in the rear of 138 Flash Road at $5.00 per month, to take effect, September 2,1944. On that date the defendants filed in the Rental Area Office a report in which they recited no change \u201cin the cottage\u201d and as follows: \u201chave rented garage space at rear of 138 Flash Road at $5.00 per month.\u201d The defendants made the following requests for rulings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-3\">\u201c1. Under the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 as amended, the authority of the Price Administrator to establish maximum rents is restricted to rents for housing accommodations. (See Section 2, Subsection B.) 2. Rent regulations issued by the Price Administrator under the authority of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 as amended are applicable to housing accommodations only. (See Public Document No. 50382, Section 1.) 3. The term \u2018housing accommodations\u2019 does not include a separate building or part thereof rented for storage of furniture. 4. Providing storage space in a separate building is not a privilege, service, or facility connected with the use of a furnished dwelling within the provisions of rent regulations. 5. If the Defendants in letting or leasing a fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>nished dwelling to the Plaintiff also let or leased a space in a separate building on a separate lot of land to the Plaintiff to be used by the Plaintiff for storing furniture, the rent charged or received by the Defendants for such space and use is not subject to the provisions of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 as amended. 6. If the Defendants in letting or leasing a furnished dwelling to the plaintiff also let or leased space in a separate building upon a separate lot of land to the Plaintiff for her use for storing furniture, the rent charged or received by the Defendants for such space or use is not subject to the provisions of rent regulations issued by the Price Administrator under the authority of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 as amended. 7. Even if the Defendants violated the provisions of a regulation issued by the Price Administrator under the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 as amended, the Plaintiff may only recover in this action for violations which occurred within one year of the bringing of this action (within one year of March 27, 1946.) (See Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 as amended, Section 205, Subsection E.) 8. Even if the Defendants violated any regulations issued by the Price Administrator in accordance with the authority conferred by the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 as amended, the Plaintiff is not entitled to recover treble damages if such violation was neither willful nor the result of failure to take practicable precautions against the occurence (sic) of such violation. 9. If the Defendants notified the Essex County Defense-Rental Area Office of the leasing or letting of space for storage of furniture and of the amount of rent charged therefor at or about the time of such leasing or letting then, if such leasing or letting was in violation of the regulations issued under the authority of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 as amended, such violation was neither willful nor the result of failure' to take practicable precautions against its occurrence. 10. Even if the Defendants violated a regulation issued by the Price Administrator under the authority of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 as amended, the Defendants are liable in this action only for the amount of overcharges accruing from March 27,1945, to March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>27, 1946, together with reasonable counsel fees and costs, if it appears that the Defendants gave notice of the terms and conditions of the letting of their property to the Essex County Defense Rental Area Office at or about the time of letting or leasing. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-3\">\u201cThe trial judge denied the 5th, 6th, 9th and 10th requests for rulings and gave as reasons for such denials, the following: In denying the Defendants\u2019 5th request for ruling, the Court ruled that \u2018Increase of rent is subject to approval by Rent Director. \u2019 In denying the Defendants\u2019 6th request for ruling, the Court found or ruled as follows: \u2018 The leasing of space in garage was subterfuge. \u2019 In denying the Defendants \u2019 9th request for ruling, the Court ruled as follows: \u2018Mere notice to Area Rent Office is insufficient. Defendants had burden of procuring assent of Director to increase.\u2019 In denying the Defendants\u2019 10th request for ruling, the Court ruled as follows: \u2018Mere filing of notice without assent from Area Rent Director was insufficient. \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The trial judge found the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">\u201cOn August 24,1944, the Defendants, as lessors, and the Plaintiff, as lessee, entered into a written lease for the housing accommodation known as and numbered 136 Flash Road, in the Town of Nahant, consisting of a \u2018six room cottage furnished\u2019 and \u2018one garage space on said property. \u2019 The lease was to take effect on September 2, 1944, at a rental of \u2018$45.00 for the furnished cottage and $5.00 for the garage space per month.\u2019 The said housing accommodation without \u2018garage space\u2019 was registered with the Essex County Defense Rental Area Office at $45.00 per month. The \u2018garage space\u2019 was located \u2018at rear of 138 Flash Road\u2019, and was no part of the said housing accommodation. At the time the said lease was made and executed, the plaintiff owned no car or other vehicle, and had no use for the said \u2018garage space\u2019; but could not rent the said housing accommodation without the \u2018garage space.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">\u201cOn September 2, 1944, the Defendants filed a \u2018Report of Change in Tenancy\u2019 with the said \u2018Rental Area Officer\u2019; in which report, they recited no change \u2018in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>cottage/ and stated as follows: \u2018have rented garage space at rear of 138 Flash Road at $5.00 per month.\u2019 No action was \"taken by said Rental Area Office on the said Report of Change in Tenancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-3\">\u201cThe Plaintiff took possession of said housing accommodation and paid the rent of $50.00' a month from September <em>2, </em>1944, up to and including January, 1946. Subsequently, on complaint, the Essex County Area Rent Director notified the Defendants that they could not charge more than $45.00 per month, as rent, for the said housing accommodation, without an order from the Rent Director, and advised the Defendants to return to the Plaintiff excess rent collected by them. The Defendants refused to return to the Plaintiff <em>\u2018 </em>excess rent collected\u2019 by them. March 27, 1946, the Plaintiff brought this action. Thus, it appears that the Defendant collected an excess of $5.00 per month for a period of ten months, within one year, from the time this action was instituted. Therefore, I find for the Plaintiff as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">\u201cIn the sum of $50.00 for reasonable attorneys fees and costs, and $100.00 for overcharges, making a total of $150.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">\u201cThis report contains all the evidence material to questions reported.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">\u201cThe Defendants claiming to be aggrieved by the findings, rulings and refusals to rule as requested, I hereby report the same to the Appellate Division for determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The report states that requests 5, 6, 9 and 10 were denied but does not state what happened to the other requests as there is nothing in the report or in the docket entries to explain their disposition. The plaintiff\u2019s brief, however, says that \u2018 \u2018 six of which were allowed and the following four requests were denied (naming the 5th, 6th, 9th and 10th). The defendants in their brief enumerated the first, second, third, fourth, seventh and eighth as allowed. At the oral argument the defendant, the appellant, argued the case on the theory that the six requests just mentioned had been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>In our opinion it was proper to allow the first four rer quests; their denial would have been prejudicial error. <em>Gershberg v. Braverman, </em>1944 N. J. 40A 2d\u2014288; in 155 A. L. R. at 1464. If we treat them as allowed, as the parties have in their briefs, and the defendants did at the argument, there was still prejudicial error for the trial judge did not apply them to the facts that he found.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\">The first request is that the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, as amended is restricted to rents for housing accommodations; the second that rent regulations under the Act are applicable to housing accommodations only; the third that the term \u201chousing accommodations\u201d does not include a separate building or part thereof rented for storage of furniture; and the fourth, that providing storage space in a separate building is not a privilege, service or facility connected with the use of a furnished dwelling within the provisions of the rent regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Treating the case on the theory that the judge gave the four rulings specified, he then went on to find the facts in the case to be within the scope of those rulings and then found for the plaintiff. How, after he had granted requests three and four he could find that rent paid for the garage for storage purposes was an overcharge is not clear. If he had applied to the evidence the rulings he had given he was compelled to find for the defendants. He was as much compelled to apply the rulings as to grant them. <em>Clarke v. Second National Bank, </em>177 Mass. 257, at 266, 267, <em>Bangs v. Farr, </em>209 Mass. 339, at 244. <em>Massachusetts General Hospital v. Belmont, </em>233 Mass. 190, at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">If the 4th request was allowed, as we think it was, <em>Gershberg v. Braverman, supra, </em>then it was prejudicial error, also, to deny the 5th and 6th requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">There was evidence to which the 5th and 6th requests were applicable and each <em>ruling1 \u2018 </em>correctly stated the law applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>ble to one possible, indeed probable, view of the evidence. It does not appear that it was refused upon the ground that it was immat\u00e9rial upon the facts found by the court. The refusal therefore to give it was error\u201d. <em>Chandler v. Baker, </em>191 Mass. 579, at 585. \u201cThe defendants were entitled to the rulings requested in a possible view of the evidence, and, although the findings may have been right, we are unable on the report so to determine.\u201d <em>Kaufman v. Sydeman, </em>251 Mass. 210, at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\">The trial judge did find, in disposing of the 6th request, that \u201cthe leasing of space in garage was subterfuge\u201d. It is to be noted that he nowhere found that the garage was used for storage, although he did find that the plaintiff had no car. \u201cIf the judge did not find the facts to be as stated in the testimony . . . and recited in the prayer, he should have so stated in a finding of fact, otherwise, it can not be assumed that he did not find the facts to be true. Or, he should have so stated that, finding the facts to be true, he found they were inapplicable and did not overcome the weight of over testimony and the inference of facts which he drew therefrom\u201d. <em>Rooney v. Porter-Milton Ice Co., </em>275 Mass. 254, 257.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\">\u201cAnd if the judge did not grant it he would have been required to <em>1 </em>state expressly or by fair inference either that the legal proposition presented . . . (was) unsound or inapplicable, or that the facts upon which it (was) predicated (was) not found to be true.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commercial Credit Corporation v. Flowers, </em>282 Mass. 316, at 322, 323.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The sense of the two requests was that the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, as amended, did not apply to the letting of the garage for storage. The finding that the letting of the garage was a subterfuge is not a finding that it was not so let, or was not let for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>If it was so let, and the Act did not apply to such a letting the fact that it was a subterfuge did not make the Act applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\">It was prejudicial error under the circumstances to deny the 5th and 6th requests without explanation or finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">There is in the report no claim of inconsistency between the allowance of the first four rulings and the finding for the plaintiff and no such issue was argued., <em>Korb v. Albany Carpet Cleaning Co., </em>301 Mass. 317, at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The proper application of the 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th and 6th requests would have required the trial judge to find for the defendants. The finding for the plaintiffs is to be vacated and judgment is to be entered for the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
