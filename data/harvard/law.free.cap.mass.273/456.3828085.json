It described accurately the time of the accident, stated that the place was on Washington Street at the corner of Pleasant Street in Malden, and alleged that the plaintiff was \u201c injured by reason of a defect in said Washington Street, corner of Pleasant Street, and want of railing about a certain signal used for traffic, in that she fell in walking upon said signal and was greatly injured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The defendant moved for a directed verdict. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>motion was denied. It also asked for several requests which were refused. The jury viewed the premises. There was a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The defendant contends that the notice of the time, place and cause of the accident was inaccurate, in not correctly stating the cause of the accident; and that the plaintiff did not sustain the burden of showing that the defendant was not in fact misled thereby. It also contends that the evidence did not justify the finding that the defendant had, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence might have had, notice of the defect in time to remedy it.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The place of the accident was on a business street which was patrolled day and night by police officers of the city. The jury could have found that the defect was an open and obvious one; that it existed for at least nine days before the plaintiff was injured. On this evidence a finding would be justified that the city, by the use of ordinary care, could have known of the defect and had ajnple opportunity to remedy it. It is argued that the witness who saw the defect on September 9 did not testify that at any time prior to that date she saw the hole. The witness gave the dimensions of the depression and testified that from September 1 on it was in the same condition substantially as it was on the ninth of September. This evidence was sufficient to show that the hole existed on. September 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The written notice did not accurately specify the defect which caused the injury. <em>Gardner </em>v. Weymouth, 155 Mass. 595. The statute provides that the notice shall not be invalid or insufficient solely by reason of any inaccuracy in stating the time, place or cause of the injury, if it is shown that there was no intention to mislead, and that the party entitled to notice was not misled thereby. G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 18. By \u00a7 20 of this statute, the defendant cannot avail himself of any omission to state in the notice the time, place and cause of the injury or damage, \u201c unless, within five days after receipt of a notice,\u201d the person receiving the notice notifies the person injured that his notice is insufficient and requests a written notice comply<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>ing with the law. No counter notice under this statute was given by the defendant. The defendant contends that this section is not applicable for the reason that the statute has reference only to an omission to state the time, place and cause of the accident; that the notice did not omit to state the cause, but stated it inaccurately. See <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Brimfield, </em>182 Mass. 117. See also <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>219 Mass. 302. Even if the defendant is right in this contention, and we make no decision on this point, the plaintiff cannot be deprived of her recovery because of a defect in the notice, if she has sustained the burden of showing that there was no intention to mislead the defendant, and the defendant was not in fact misled. G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 18. She was injured in a public street where there was apparently much traffic; she accurately described the time and place of her injury. It could be inferred from this and from all the facts shown on the record that she had no intention to deceive or mislead the defendant; and it is not argued in the brief of the defendant that the plaintiff had such intention. Its contention is that nothing was shown to support a finding that the city was not in fact misled by the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\">The notice directed the attention of the defendant to a defect at a specified place. It pointed out correctly where the injury happened; it referred to both streets and to the \"traffic signal and alleged that the plaintiff was injured by reason of a defect in Washington Street, corner of Pleasant Street, and \u201c want of railing about a certain signal used for traffic, in that she fell in walking upon said signal.\u201d If the street was in the condition described by one of the witnesses, the hole was plain to be seen. The surface of the ground \u201c was badly broken \u201d and there were \u201cseveral jagged holes.\u201d In such conditions the majority of the court are of opinion that the jury could find that the plaintiff sustained the burden of proving that the defendant was not misled. This was not a concealed or hidden defect. It could easily have been seen and a slight examination of the place would disclose it.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The defendant contends that the notice describes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>signal as the defect relied on. We do not think this is a fair interpretation of the notice. The notice recites that the plaintiff was injured by a defect in the street, and, in walking, fell upon the signal. This does not mean that she specified the signal as the defect relied on. Her notice says that she fell against or upon the signal, but she alleges the defect in the street as the cause, and also the want of railing, both of which were the cause of her falling on the signal. Her evidence does not contradict this. She testified that the cause of her injury was the \u201c broken surface of the street around the beacon, but the beacon caught her foot and held it.\u201d <em>Messner </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>261 Mass. 142. <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>269 Mass. 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><em>Dooling </em>v. <em>Malden, </em>258 Mass. 570, relied on by the defendant, is to be distinguished. There the notice described the defect which caused the injury as <em>\u201c </em>an icy sidewalk on Belmont Street.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s testimony tended to show she slipped on a thin coating of ice covering a stone which extended into the sidewalk from two to three feet and to a height of two or three inches. There was evidence that an examination of the place was made, that it was covered with snow and ice and no stone could be seen. It was held that there was no evidence to sustain the burden of proof resting on the plaintiff to show that the defendant was not misled. In the case at bar the place was accurately described, the defect was obvious, it was on a much travelled street. The jury therefore could say the defendant was not misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The attorney for the plaintiff who was acting for her in September, 1926, and April, 1927, wrote to the city solicitor on April 26, 1927, requesting that the claim of the plaintiff be considered by the committee on claims. In this letter it was stated that her injuries were caused <em>\u201c </em>by her tripping over the traffic signal.\u201d This letter could be considered with all the other evidence, but it did not preclude the jury from finding that the defendant was not misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
