Ryder and Charles W. Ryder on a promissory note for $20,000, dated March 18, 1929, and payable to Morris Rudnick six months after date, purporting to have been made by the defendant Robert L. Ryder, indorsed in blank by the defendant Charles W. Ryder, \u201cWaiving demand notice and protest,\u201d and indorsed in blank also by Morris Rudnick and \u201cE. S. Company, Inc. Morris Rudnick, Treas.\u201d The declaration alleges that the defendant Charles W. Ryder indorsed the note on March 18, 1929, that on. its due date it was protested for nonpayment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>notice thereof given to said defendant and that \u201c said Morris Rudnick, before delivery of said note to the plaintiff for a valuable consideration, indorsed said note in blank.\u201d The defendants answered by a general denial and denial of their signatures, and further alleged that the note \u201c was made without consideration,\u201d \u201c was never delivered,\u201d and was \u201c fraudulently transferred \u201d by the payee \u201c to the plaintiff in violation of an agreement with the defendants,\u201d that the plaintiff is not a holder in due course and that the consideration for the' note has failed wholly or in part. The case was tried by a judge sitting without jury. There was evidence that the signatures on the note were the defendants\u2019, and that the note was delivered by Rudnick to the plaintiff before its maturity and discounted by the plaintiff, and other evidence on the issues raised by the pleadings, which need not be recited. The judge found for the plaintiff in the amount of the note, and the defendants excepted to his refusals to rule as requested by them and to the exclusion of certain evidence offered by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-3\">. We consider only the exceptions argued or briefed by the defendants, others being treated as waived. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Hannah, </em>266 Mass. 101, 105. <em>Guinan </em>v. <em>Famous Players-Lasky Corp. </em>267 Mass. 501, 519, 521, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><em>First. </em>It was not error to refuse to rule, as requested by the defendants, that \u201c When testimony warranting a finding that the note in suit was negotiated in breach of faith by the payee has been introduced, the burden of proof is then upon the plaintiff to show that he is a holder in due course.\u201d This requested ruling did not state the law correctly. Under the statute the holder of a negotiable instrument \u201c is deemed prima facie to be a holder in due course\u201d and no further burden rests upon him \u201cto prove that he or some person under whom he claims acquired the title as holder in due course \u201d unless \u201c it is shown that the title of . . . [some] person who has negotiated the instrument was defective\u201d (G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 82), which may be done by showing that the payee negotiated it \u201cin breach of faith.\u201d G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 78. Defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>title in the payee is not \u201c shown,\u201d. within the meaning of the statute, by the introduction of \u201c testimony warranting \u201d such a \u201c finding \u201d unless the testimony is believed, so that the fact is proved. The burden of establishing that the payee\u2019s title was defective was on the defendants. If they failed to sustain this burden, no burden rested upon the plaintiff to support by evidence its <em>prima facie </em>case that it was a holder in due course. See <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>221 Mass. 103, 104; <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>264 Mass. 208, 214; <em>First National Bank of Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Groves, </em>269 Mass. 161, 172; <em>Crosley </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>196 Fed. Rep. 640, 644; <em>Boone National Bank </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>199 Iowa, 848. Brannan\u2019s Negotiable Instruments Law (4th ed.) 535. See also cases decided in this Commonwealth before the passage of the negotiable instruments act. <em>Sistermans </em>v. <em>Field, </em>9 Gray, 331, 337. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>111 Mass. 342, 345. <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>114 Mass. 348, 349. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Langley, </em>120 Mass. 437, 443. <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Phoenix Rattan Co. </em>168 Mass. 570, 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\"><em>Second. </em>It was not error to refuse to\" rule that \u201c If it was understood or was a course of dealing between the plaintiff and the payee of the note in suit that, if the note was not paid at maturity by the defendants in this case the account of the payee was to be charged, then the plaintiff is not a holder in due course.\u201d A right in the plaintiff to charge the account of the payee was not necessarily inconsistent with the plaintiff\u2019s being a holder of the note in due course. It was not inconsistent with the plaintiff\u2019s having acquired title to the note for value, as distinguished from being the agent of the payee for its collection. As to this distinction, see <em>Salem Elevator Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banks, 252 </em>Mass. 366, 370, 371. A holder in due course of a note indorsed in blank without qualification ordinarily has a right of recourse to the indorser if the note is not paid at maturity. If this plaintiff, by reason of an understanding or <em>\u201c </em>course of dealing \u201d with the payee-indorser, had the right upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>nonpayment by the defendant, without more, to charge the note to such indorser\u2019s account, it might be \u201csimply a method ... of exacting payment from the indorser.\u201d <em>Burton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>196 U. S. 283, 297. See also <em>Walker &amp; Brock </em>v. D. <em>W. Ranlett Co. </em>89 Vt. 71, 76. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>221 Mass. 103, 105, relied on by the defendants, does not imply that such an agreement is conclusive against the indorser\u2019s being a holder in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><em>Third. </em>There was no prejudicial error in the exclusion of testimony. The plaintiff\u2019s president was asked: (1) \u201cNow I will ask you whether or not the Beacon Trust Company is indifferent to the outcome of this suit?\u201d (2) \u201c It is Mr. Rudnick\u2019s note which he controls, and the suit here is brought in the name of the Beacon Trust Company for his use, is it not?\u201d and (3) \u201c The suit here is brought in the name of the Beacon Trust Company for the use of Mr. Rudnick, is it not?\u201d The questions were excluded, subject to the exceptions of the defendants, who offered to prove that the answer to each question would be \u201cYes.\u201d The first question was not material to any issue in the case. Indifference on the part of the plaintiff as to the outcome of this action would not tend to show that it was not a holder of the note in due course. Such indifference might result from a consciousness that there was a good indorser. The other questions were answered in substance when the witness testified that \u201cthe note belongs to the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
