Their car then struck something and the automobile turned over ... he should judge the car was- going about twenty-five or thirty miles an hour.\u201d He also testified that an automobile, in the line of cars going in a southerly direction, <em>\u201c </em>suddenly left that line and pulled out to the left,\u201d that is, as we understand the record, the operator moving in a southerly direction turned onto the defendant\u2019s side of the road; that the defendant \u201c turned to his right when this other car came out of the line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">The plaintiff was asked if he said <em>\u201c </em>I do not blame Mr. Cuneo for this accident.\u201d He answered \u201c I never know about this thing, but I always said I believe that Cuneo was right.\u201d The plaintiff further testified that he made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>a statement to the adjuster of the insurance company; that the adjuster asked him if the defendant was going fast and he replied <em>\u201c </em>I don\u2019t know nothing .... That he told the adjust\u00e9r as he was going north on the right hand side, he told Mr. Cuneo to go slow as there were many automobiles on the road. That at the time he made the statement he believed that Mr. Cuneo was driving slow and carefully.\u201d He was asked if <em>\u201c </em>he told the adjuster that one car going south pulled out of the line to pass another,\u201d and he testified that he <em>\u201c </em>told the adjuster that was the way it looked to him that it seemed as if the car came headed for Mr. Cuneo\u2019s car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">There was evidence that the defendant was drunk; and it appeared when he pulled to the right to avoid the car approaching from the north and moving toward his side of the highway, in order to avoid a collision with this car he turned to the right and struck a sedan car standing on the east side of \u2019Riverdale Street and facing north.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The burden of proof was on the plaintiff to show that the defendant in operating his vehicle was guilty of gross negligence. The jury could have found that the defendant was drunk. But however unsafe it may be for a drunken person to operate an automobile especially upon a public highway, some act of negligence must be shown in addition to drunkenness to make out a case of gross negligence. From all that appears on this record there was nothing to indicate that the defendant was careless. He was on his right hand side of the way. As we interpret the evidence he was driving carefully. The possibility of danger is always present when a drunken person attempts to operate a motor vehicle, but if he acts as carefully as a sober man of ordinary prudence under the existing circumstances he is not negligent. The fact that the car of the defendant as he got \u201c near the place of the accident. . . switched and changed \u201d does not mean that he was careless or negligent. The switching and changing may have been necessary to avoid a collision. A sober and reasonably prudent operator might have acted in the same manner under the conditions then existing. It is not shown that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>was negligent in running into the parked sedan: he had to turn to the right to avoid a collision with the automobile coming from the north which had left the line of travel and was on the defendant\u2019s side of the road. It does not appear how near to the defendant the parked sedan was located when the collision with the automobile moving south was imminent except that the sedan was \"parked off the hardened part of the highway.\u201d It is not shown that the sedan was lighted, that the defendant saw it or could have avoided striking it. <em>Bryne </em>v. <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. </em>269 Mass. 130, is not in conflict. In that case a motor truck struck an excavator standing on the highway between eight and ten o\u2019clock of a September morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We have not considered the question of the plaintiff\u2019s \"care as we do not discover in the record sufficient evidence to justify a jury in finding that the defendant was grossly negligent. The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\n<em>Exception's sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
