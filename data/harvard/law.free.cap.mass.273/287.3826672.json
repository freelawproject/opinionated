The respondent Louisa M. Bingham\u201d is a first cousin and sole heir and next of kin of the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\">G. L. c. 191, \u00a7 22 provides: \u201c If a devise or legacy is made to a child or other relation of the testator, who dies before the testator, but leaves issue surviving the testator, such issue shall, unless a different disposition is made or required by the will, take the same estate which the person whose issue they are would have taken if he had survived the testator.\u201d The decree of the Probate Court ordered the seventeenth part of the residue to be distributed to the two children of Harriet Avery Peabody, and the only question for decision is whether she was a \u201c relation \u201d within the meaning of the statute. The term <em>\u201c </em>relation \u201d includes only relations by blood. <em>Esty </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>101 Mass. 36, 39. <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Story, </em>108 Mass. 382, 385. This court has held that a first cousin is a \u201c relation \u201d within the meaning of the statute. <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>155 Mass. 415. <em>Sleeper </em>v. <em>Larrabee, </em>266 Mass. 320, 322. There \u2018is nothing in the language of the statute or, so far as we perceive, in the policy of the law to justify the conclusion that a child of a first cousin does not come within the terms of the statute. In <em>Galloupe </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>248 Mass. 196, 200, the court said: \u201cUnder this statute legacies to cousins are legacies to relatives within its terms.\u201d See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>195 Mass. 520, 523. It could hardly be contended that a child of a first cousin would not inherit intestate property if he was the nearest blood relation of the deceased. See <em>Swasey </em>v. <em>Jaques, </em>144 Mass. 135, 138; <em>Kelley\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 538, 541. There is nothing to indicate that a different disposition from that ordered by the decree is made or required by the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
