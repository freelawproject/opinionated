At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case a verdict for the defendant was directed and the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-15\">There was evidence that, on March 16, 1927, the defendant was driving a motor truck loaded with crates of oranges from Somerville to Springfield, that the plaintiff got into the cab of the truck at Leicester, that when he was riding there, sometime between four and five o\u2019clock in the morning, on a State highway in Warren, the truck \u201cshot off the road\u201d to the left and struck a tree, and that the plaintiff was injured. There was no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>that compensation in any form for the transportation of the plaintiff was paid or promised to the defendant, his employer, or the owner of the truck. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The plaintiff seeks to bring himself within the rule, well established in this Commonwealth, that the operator of a motor vehicle, by analogy to the liability of a gratuitous bailee, is liable for injuries resulting from his gross negligence to an invited person whom he is transporting gratuitously. <em>Massaletti </em>v. <em>Fitzroy, </em>228 Mass. 487. <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>231 Mass. 550, 554. <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>246 Mass. 518, 521. <em>Marcienowski </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>252 Mass. 65, 67. <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>261 Mass. 494. <em>Rog </em>v. <em>Eltis, </em>269 Mass. 466. The defendant contends that the evidence did not warrant a finding either (a) that the plaintiff was riding on the truck by invitation of the defendant or (b) that the defendant was guilty of gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\"><em>First. </em>The evidence warranted a finding that the plaintiff was riding on the truck by invitation of the defendant. This finding could have been made on the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that when he was sitting on a .rail outside a lunch cart, in Leicester, the defendant <em>\u201c </em>drove a truck alongside the lunch cart and stopped because he thought he knew me. He said \u2018 hello \u2019 and asked me if I were so and so and I said \u2018 no,\u2019 and told him that I was going to Hartford, Connecticut. He said he was going as far as Springfield; I could ride along with him. I said all right and I got in the cab and sat down alongside of him.\u201d The plaintiff, who called the defendant as a witness, would not have been bound by the conflicting testimony given by such adverse party even if it had been uncontradicted <em>(Emerson </em>v. <em>Wark, </em>185 Mass. 427, <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>221 Mass. 103, 104, <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Bedard, </em>265 Mass. 408, 411), and, <em>a fortiori, </em>was not bound by it where, as here, it was contradicted. See <em>Whiteacre </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>241 Mass. 163, 165; <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Levinson, </em>266 Mass. 264, 267. The evidence could be found to show more than mere acquiescence by the defendant in the presence on the truck of a self-invited guest. See <em>West </em>v. <em>Poor, </em>196 Mass. 183, 185. Furthermore, even if the plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>riding on the truck solely for his own purposes, it does not follow necessarily that he was not an invited person within the meaning of the rule. Cases involving the obligation of a landowner to persons going upon the land for their own purposes (see <em>Plummer </em>v. <em>Dill, </em>156 Mass. 426; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>156 Mass. 475; <em>Glaser </em>v. <em>Congregation Kehillath Israel, </em>263 Mass. 435) are distinguishable because of the difference in the ground of liability, as was pointed out in <em>Massaletti </em>v. <em>Fitzroy, supra, </em>at pages 507-508.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\"><em>Second. </em>The evidence did not warrant a finding that the defendant was guilty of gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s account of the cause of the accident may be summarized as follows: For five or six hundred feet before the motor truck came to the place of the accident there was no other traffic in the road. There was a curve in the road and the beginning of a down grade three or four hundred yards before the place of the accident was reached and another curve farther on, though there was no evidence of the degree of either curve or of the grade, except the testimony of the defendant that the road was \u201c very slightly down grade.\u201d The motor truck was travelling about twenty-five (or thirty-five) miles an hour when the beginning of the grade was reached. Its speed increased. When it was travelling thirty-five miles an hour, or more, the plaintiff asked the defendant \u201c to stop to allow him to leave the truck \u201d and saw the defendant disconnect the gears so that the truck \u201c seemed to loll to one side, first to the left and then to the right and then back to the left again.\u201d One hundred feet from the place where the truck left the road it was travelling about thirty-five to forty miles an hour. The plaintiff then \u201c requested the defendant to let him off the truck as the truck was going too fast. The defendant then said to the plaintiff, \u2018 We are all right; you will be all right.\u2019 \u201d After this conversation <em>\u201c </em>the truck shot off the road.\u201d It could have been found from the testimony of other witnesses that the diameter of the trunk of the tree which was struck w$s twelve or fifteen inches, that the \u201c tree was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>bent down with broken limbs \u201d and that the front part of the truck was damaged. There was evidence that the truck operated by the defendant was a \u201c two and one-half ton truck \u201d \u201c which was registered for six tons.\u201d The plaintiff testified that the defendant told him that \u201c the truck was about five hundred pounds overweight, with the load.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The defendant\u2019s testimony, the whole or part of which might have been disbelieved, was in substance a denial of the truth of most of the testimony of the plaintiff. His explanation of the cause of the accident was that while passing a larger truck, at the rate of twenty miles an hour, on a straight part of the road, his truck was crowded to the left so that the left front wheel got into the gravel and he was unable to turn the truck back into the road before it reached the tree. He testified that the plaintiff, \u201c who was asleep, had fallen onto the defendant\u2019s shoulder \u201d and that he \u201c gave . . . [the plaintiff] a push to the other side of the cab.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Gross negligence was defined and distinguished from ordinary negligence in <em>Altman </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>231 Mass. 588, 591-593. (See <em>Learned </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>269 Mass. 554, 560-562). It was there pointed out that gross negligence differs in degree rather than in kind from ordinary negligence and is \u201c materially more want of care than constitutes simple inadvertence \u201d but need not amount to \u201csuch reckless disregard of probable consequences as is equivalent to a wilful and intentional wrong.\u201d Various tests of gross negligence were set forth, but it was added that the \u201c definition does not possess the exactness of a mathematical demonstration.\u201d Decided cases, however, by the application of the definition to evidence, to some extent have marked the line between ordinary negligence and gross negligence in the operation of motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Tested by the decided cases, the evidence here does not establish gross negligence on.the part of the defendant. The fact, unexplained, that the truck went off the road at the left and struck a tree, did not show gross negligence on the part of the defendant. <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>246 Mass.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>518. <em>Shriear </em>v. <em>Feigelson, </em>248 Mass. 432. There was no evidence that he was not paying attention to his driving. It does not appear that the operator was asleep or had closed his eyes, as in <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>269 Mass. 480 (compare <em>Shriear </em>v. <em>Feigelson, supra), </em>or had been drinking intoxicating liquor, as in <em>Learned </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>269 Mass. 554, and in <em>McCarron </em>v. <em>Bolduc, </em>270 Mass. 39 (compare <em>Bertera </em>v. <em>Cuneo, </em>273 Mass. 181), or that his attention was diverted to other matters, as in <em>Rog </em>v. <em>Eltis, supra, </em>and in <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>271 Mass. 390. Neither the plaintiff\u2019s account of the accident nor that of the defendant showed that the defendant was driving improperly with relation to other traffic, as in <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>261 Mass. 494, where the operator drove across the path of an approaching motor vehicle. \u2022 Nor do we perceive any combination of the testimony which would warrant a finding of gross negligence in this respect. In view of the meager evidence of unfavorable road conditions, the direct evidence of the speed of the truck and inferences of such speed from its <em>\u201c </em>lolling \u201d from side to side of the road and from the force of its impact against the tree, though warranting a finding of ordinary negligence, did not warrant a finding of gross negligence. <em>Marcienowski </em>v. <em>Sanders, 252 </em>Mass. 65. See also <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Cook, supra. Healy </em>v. <em>O\u2019Riley, 257 </em>Mass. 413, and <em>Terlizzi </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>258 Mass. 156, are distinguishable. Nor was such a finding warranted by the testimony to the plaintiff\u2019s requests that the defendant let him off the truck, nor by the testimony that the defendant told the plaintiff that he would be \u201c all right.\u201d See <em>Bertelli </em>v. <em>Tronconi, </em>264 Mass. 235; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Satran, </em>266 Mass. 253. As there was no evidence that the road was more than \u201c very slightly down grade \u201d the testimony that the defendant disconnected the gears, thus permitting the truck to coast, did not show gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">It remains to consider the effect of the testimony that the truck with its load \u201c was about five hundred pounds overweight.\u201d In the absence of evidence of the effect of such overloading on the operation of the truck, a finding of gross negligence was not warranted, unless on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>ground that the overloading was a violation of a statute or of a rule or regulation adopted under authority of a statute. No such violation, was proved. The evidence was not sufficiently definite to warrant an inference that the truck and load exceeded fourteen tons in weight or \u201c eight hundred pounds upon any inch of the tire <em>\u201d </em>in violation of G. L. c. 85, \u00a7 30, as finally amended by St. 1925, c. 342, \u00a7 2 (see now St. 1930, c. 353, \u00a7 1), and the effect of any such violation on the liability of an operator need not be considered. It could have been inferred, however, that the truck and load exceeded the aggregate \u201c weight \u201d and \u201c maximum carrying capacity \u201d for which the truck was registered under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 33, as amended by St. 1925, c. 342, \u00a7 1, (see now St. 1928, c. 316, \u00a7 5), but it would not follow that the truck was not legally registered. It does not appear that the \u201c carrying capacity \u201d was misstated in the application for registration, that the truck was not registered for the \u201c carrying capacity <em>\u201d \u201c </em>determined by the division \u201d of highways, which \u201c determination \u201d by express statutory provision was to be final and conclusive (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 2, as amended by St. 1924, c. 224, see now St. 1928, c. 316, \u00a7 3), nor that such \u201c weight \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>maximum carrying capacity \u201d were not determined, in accordance with rules established under authority of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 33, as amended. No misdescription of the truck at the time of registration was shown (compare <em>Staley </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>258 Mass. 481; <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Liss, </em>269 Mass. 373) and the overloading did not effect such a material change in the truck that it was no longer the motor truck originally registered. (Compare <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Holyoke Street Railway, </em>250 Mass. 88; <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>New Bedford &amp; Onset Street Railway, </em>259 Mass. 20.) Therefore, it could not have been found that the truck was a nuisance on the highway within the principle laid down in the line of cases of which <em>Koonovsky </em>v. <em>Quellette, </em>226 Mass. 474, <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Dundon, </em>242 Mass. 229, <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Alter, </em>251 Mass. 223 (see also <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Northampton Street Railway, </em>202 Mass. 443) are examples, nor that its operation was within the prohibition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>by G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 9, as amended by St. 1922, c. 303, \u00a7 3, (see now St. 1928, c. 381, \u00a7 3), of the operation on any way of an unregistered motor vehicle. No statute prohibits the operation of a motor truck where truck and load exceed the aggregate \u201c weight \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>maximum carrying-capacity \u201d for which it is registered, or imposes a penalty therefor unless such operation is in violation of an authorized rule or regulation. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 20, as amended by St. 1922, c. 130; \u00a7 31; \u00a7 31 A, added by St. 1924, c. 457. Said \u00a7 31A expressly authorizes the division of highways to make rules and regulations covering \u201c the establishment of the maximum weight of loads per commercial motor vehicle and per inch of tire- in contact with the surface \u201d of ways and imposes a penalty for violation of such a rule or regulation. Since the record, unlike that in <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Pallotta, </em>274 Mass. 110, discloses no evidence, and not even a suggestion by either party, that such authority has been exercised, we are not called upon to consider the effect of a violation of such a rule or regulation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>158 Mass. 218; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>248 Mass. 220; <em>Seemann </em>v. <em>Eneix, </em>272 Mass. 189, 195-196.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
