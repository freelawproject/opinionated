The defendant for answer pleaded a general denial, that he had a warehouseman\u2019s lien on the furniture, and <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">There was evidence tending to show \u201c that the plaintiff had title to the furniture as a conditional vendor \u201d and \u201c that he, on or about January 2, 1930, through his agents, demanded the furniture . . . from the defendant,\u201d but the defendant refused to deliver it. The plaintiff testified that in 1929 he \u201c sued the defendant \u201d and \u201c the defendant recovered judgment \u201d and that now <em>\u201c </em>he is attempting to recover the same damages on the same furniture as alleged in the preceding suit.\u201d The records of the former action were in evidence. The declaration was exactly like that in the present case, except that the date of the alleged conversion was different, and the answer was the same except that it did not contain a plea of <em>res judicata. </em>The judge there \u201c ruled that the defendant had a warehouseman\u2019s lien and found for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">The trial judge in the present action refused to rule, as requested By the defendant, that a \u201c warehouseman shall have a lien on goods deposited or on the proceeds thereof in his hands, for all lawful charges for their storage and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>preservation \u201d and for certain other claims (see G. L. c. 105, \u00a7 32), on the ground that the ruling requested was \u201c inapplicable to claim by conditional vendor whose goods have been removed to storage in breach of his contract. Case governed by G. L. c. 255, \u00a7 35 \u201d; ruled, in substance, that the plaintiff was not barred by the prior adjudication, and found for the plaintiff. On a report made at the request of the defendant, the Appellate Division entered an order, \u201c Finding for the plaintiff vacated. Judgment to be entered for the defendant.\u201d The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The order of the Appellate Division was right. As matter of law, in the circumstances of this case, the prior adjudication was a bar to recovery by the plaintiff. The causes of action declared' on were not identical but the parties were the same. The former judgment, therefore, was conclusive on the issues \u201c actually tried and determined \u201d in the action in which it was entered. <em>Foye </em>v. <em>Patch, </em>132 Mass. 105, 110-111. <em>Eastman Marble Co. </em>v. <em>Vermont Marble Co. </em>236 Mass. 138, 149. The report shows that it appeared from the record of the earlier case without resort to extrinsic evidence, that it was therein \u201c actually tried and determined \u201d that the defendant then had a warehouseman\u2019s lien on the furniture there in question, valid against the plaintiff. According to the testimony of the plaintiff, binding upon him, the same furniture is involved in the present case. He testified also <em>\u201c </em>that he is attempting to recover the same damages . . . as alleged in the preceding suit,\u201d but he now argues, in substance, that this is not true since he relies upon a different, and obviously later, demand and refusal. Even if we assume in his favor that in testifying he impliedly excepted from his statement of the similarity of the two actions, the difference in the dates of the alleged conversions, or assume that for any reason he is not estopped to rely upon that difference as shown by a comparison of the declarations, his testimony must be taken as meaning that the other elements of the causes of action, including the conditions under which the defendant held the furniture at the times of the alleged conversions, respectively, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>the same in both cases. Therefore, the adjudication in the earlier case, that the defendant had a warehouseman\u2019s lien on the furniture, established that fact conclusively for the purposes of the present case. That fact prevents recovery by the plaintiff. G. L. c. 105, \u00a7 36. It is unnecessary to consider other rulings by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\">\n<em>Order of Appellate Division affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
