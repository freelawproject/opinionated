They were tried by a judge and a jury with two other actions brought by these plaintiffs against Louis Grace. The plaintiff Sophie Wilson seeks to recover for personal injuries received by her when the automobile owned by her husband, Morris Wilson, in which she was sitting, was struck by the defendant\u2019s automobile, operated by Louis Grace. Her declaration was in two counts. The plaintiff Morris Wilson seeks to recover for damages to his automobile and for the medical expenses of his wife. His declaration was in four counts, the first and second for property damage, the third and fourth for medical expenses. In each case the defendant filed a motion for a directed verdict on each count of the declaration. In the case of Sophie Wilson the motion as to the first count of the declaration was denied and the motion as to the second count was granted. In the case of Morris Wilson the motions as to the first and third counts were denied and the motions as to the second and fourth counts were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>granted. The defendant excepted to the denial of his motions. February 3, 1930, a verdict was rendered in' each case for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">There was evidence that on October 23, 1927, an automobile owned by Morris Wilson was struck on a public way by an automobile driven by one Louis Grace, and damaged, that Sophie Wilson, who was sitting in her husband\u2019s automobile, \u201c was injured as a result of the impact,\u201d and that her husband \u201c expended over $400 in medical expenses for services rendered to his wife as a result of this accident.\u201d The defendant agreed that the automobile driven by Louis Grace was owned by the defendant and registered in his name as owner. It was agreed further \u201c that the evidence was sufficient to warrant the jury in finding that the driver of the defendant\u2019s car was negligent and that the plaintiff Sophie Wilson was in the exercise of due care at the time of the accident.\u201d The defendant contends, however, that the jury were not warranted in finding that at the time of the accident his automobile was \u201c being operated by and under the control of a person for whose conduct the defendant was legally responsible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">1. The motion for a directed verdict on count one of the declaration in the ease brought by Sophie Wilson was denied rightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">St. 1928, c. 317, \u00a7 1, added a new section, \u00a7 85A, to G. L. c. 231, which provided that <em>\u201c </em>In all actions to recover damages for injuries to the person or to property or for the death of a person, arising out of an accident or collision in which a motor vehicle was involved, evidence that at the time of such accident or collision it was registered in the name of the defendant as owner shall be prima facie evidence that it was then being operated by and under the control of a person for whose conduct the defendant was legally responsible, and absence of such responsibility shall be an affirmative defence to be set up in the answer and proved by the defendant.\u201d This section became operative September 1, 1928. St. 1928, c. 317, \u00a7 3. Since it is procedural in its nature it applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>to cases where, as here, the cause of action arose before, and the trial took place after, its passage. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Freedman, </em>268 Mass. 38. <em>Thomes </em>v. <em>Meyer Store Inc. </em>268 Mass. 587. <em>Haun </em>v. <em>LeGrand, </em>268 Mass. 582. The case brought by Sophie Wilson, being an action \u201cto recover damages for injuries to the person,\u201d is within the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">By force of the statute, the agreement that the automobile, operated by Louis Grace at the time of the accident, was registered in the name of the defendant as owner was \u201c prima facie evidence that it was then being operated by and under the control of a person for whose conduct the defendant was legally responsible,\u201d and \u201c absence of such responsibility \u201d in each case became \u201c an affirmative defence to be set up in the answer and proved by the defendant.\u201d This statute did not change the substantive law. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Freedman, </em>268 Mass. 38, 40. It does not impose upon the owner of an automobile liability for the negligence of an unauthorized operator, whether or not such operator is a thief or is violating G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, as amended by St. 1926, c. 253, by using \u201c a motor vehicle without authority knowing that such use is unauthorized.\u201d It merely, as a matter of trial procedure, (a) puts upon the owner the burden of proving that the automobile was not \u201c being operated by and under the control of a person for whose conduct . . . [he] was legally responsible,\u201d with the attendant risk of liability if he does not sustain this burden, <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Freedman, supra), </em>and (b) makes the fact that the automobile \u201cwas registered in the name of the defendant as owner \u201d <em>prima jade </em>evidence (as it was not before the passage of the statute, <em>Trombley </em>v. <em>Stevens-Duryea Co. </em>206 Mass. 516, 519) that the automobile was \u201c being operated by and under the control of \u201d such a person. <em>Thomes </em>v. <em>Meyer Store Inc. </em>268 Mass. 587, 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The defendant set up in his answer the affirmative defence that \u201c the operator of his automobile was not acting as his agent or servant,\u201d but it could not have been ruled as matter of law, in accordance with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>contention, that the <em>prima facie </em>evidence of agency was overcome and the affirmative defence proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\">It is true that the testimony of Louis Grace and the defendant, uncontradicted apart from the statute, tended to show that Louis Grace was operating the automobile without authority from the defendant, but they were not the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses \u2014 as to a plaintiff\u2019s own witnesses, see <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Cunard Steamship Co. Ltd. </em>204 Mass. 310, 321, <em>Haun </em>v. <em>LeGrand, supra </em>\u2014 and the plaintiff was not bound by their testimony. The jury could disbelieve it. <em>Lindenbaum </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>197 Mass. 314, 323 and cases cited. <em>Guinan </em>v. <em>Famous Players-Lasky Corp. </em>267 Mass. 501 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">In the course of his testimony Louis Grace stated, in substance, that, in a conversation with Morris Wilson, he told Wilson that he did not have permission from the defendant to use the automobile, Wilson asked the witness to have the defendant report to the insurance company that the witness had such permission \u201c so he could make a case out of it,\u201d but the witness refused to do so, and Wilson also asked him to have his father report that the witness was using his truck at the time of the accident. Wilson previously testified that he had had a conversation with Louis Grace, but did not state what was said. The defendant, relying upon <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>240 Mass. 264, 316, contends that Wilson\u2019s failure to testify in refutation of this testimony of Louis Grace was an admission of its truth, binding upon the plaintiff for whom, it is argued, Wilson was acting at the time of the conversation and at the trial. Without discussing other aspects of this contention, it is sufficient to say that such failure to testify, at most, was evidence for the consideration of the jury from which unfavorable inferences could be drawn. Even if Wilson\u2019s failure to testify was \u201c conduct in the nature of an admission \u201d <em>(Attorney General </em>v. <em>Pelletier, supra, </em>see also <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Old Colony Railroad, </em>154 Mass. 251, 253-254, <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>199 Mass. 598, 603), it was not an admission, con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>elusive as matter of law, that the conversation was reported correctly by Louis Grace nor that the statement said to have been made by him during the course of it, that he was operating the automobile without permission, was true. Such conduct \u201c does not amount to an estoppel.\u201d See <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Old Colony Railroad, supra, </em>at page 254. Moreover, even if the conversation was reported correctly, it was a question of fact whether Wilson\u2019s conduct during the course of it was an admission of the truth of Louis Grace\u2019s statement of his lack of authority. <em>Greenfield Bank </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>2 Allen, 269, 273. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>1 Gray, 487, 489. <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Old Colony Railroad, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\">The defendant contends that as matter of law the <em>prima facie </em>evidence that Louis Grace was authorized to use his automobile is overcome by the presumption that the defendant was innocent of violating G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 12, as amended by St. 1923, c. 464, \u00a7 5, and St. 1925, c. 201, \u00a7 1, providing that \u201cNo person shall allow a motor vehicle owned by him or under his control to be operated by any person who has no legal right so to do.\u201d This argument rests upon the assumption that at the time of the accident Louis Grace was under sixteen years of age so that he could not have been licensed to operate motor vehicles and could not have operated one legally without a license. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 10. But the only evidence of the age of Louis Grace was his testimony, which the jury might have disbelieved. Furthermore, even if this testimony was believed, the presumption of the defendant\u2019s innocence was not evidence to be weighed against the <em>prima facie </em>evidence that Louis Grace was operating the automobile as the agent of the defendant, acting within the scope of his authority. <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>Bay State Street Railway, </em>230 Mass. 370, 378. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De Francesco, </em>248 Mass. 9. <em>Thornes </em>v. <em>Meyer Store Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><em>2. </em>The motion for a directed verdict on count one of the declaration in the case brought by Morris Wilson was denied rightly. This count is \u201c to recover damages for injuries ... to property,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 85A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>added to G. L. c. 231 by St. 1928, c. 317, \u00a7 1, and there was evidence that this plaintiff\u2019s automobile was damaged. The reasons for the decision of the case brought by Sophie Wilson, above set forth, are controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The motion for a directed verdict on count three of this declaration, however, should have been granted. The case stated in this count \u2014 to recover the plaintiff\u2019s medical expenses incurred by reason of his wife\u2019s injuries \u2014 is not within G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85A. In view of the construction of similar words in earlier statutes, of which the Legislature must be taken to have been cognizant, the phrase \u201c damages for injuries to the person \u201d must be interpreted to mean damages which are the result of a direct injury to the person of the plaintiff and not to include those which, as here, were sustained by the plaintiff in consequence of direct injury to the person of another. <em>Harwood </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>4 Cush. 310. <em>Nestor </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>183 Mass. 265. <em>Hey </em>v. <em>Prime, </em>197 Mass. 474. <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>209 Mass. 278, 282. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>228 Mass. 191, 196. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>261 Mass. 183, 186. And see G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A and 34D, as appearing in St. 1928, c. 381, \u00a7 4 and as amended by St. 1930, c. 340, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. Compare, however, <em>M\u2019Carthy </em>v. <em>Guild, </em>12 Met. 291; <em>Osgood </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston Railroad, </em>130 Mass. 492; <em>Mulvey </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>197 Mass. 178, 180. Further support for this construction of the statute is found in the fact that actions for damages \u201c for the death of a person \u201d are included in express terms, as would be unnecessary if the words \u201c injuries to the person \u201d were to be interpreted broadly. <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>244 Mass. 83. Moreover, \u201c The statute is a complete reversal of the common law \u201d as understood in this Commonwealth and \u201c It cannot be presumed that such a statute was intended to go beyond the purpose manifested by its words.\u201d See <em>Bullard </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>226 Mass. 262, 267. Nor is this count for damages \u201c for injuries ... to property \u201d of the plaintiff. This language does not extend to the \u201c mere impoverishing of a man\u2019s estate generally,\u201d due to his being required to spend money. <em>Cutter </em>v. <em>Hamlen, </em>147 Mass. 471, 472. <em>Keating </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, supra. </em>The burden, therefore, was upon the plaintiff to prove that Louis Grace was the defendant\u2019s agent, acting within the scope of his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s burden, under count three, of proving that Louis Grace was the agent of the defendant was not sustained.\" Apart from the statute, ownership of the automobile by the defendant and registration in his name as owner were not sufficient to prove the agency of the operator. <em>Trombley </em>v. <em>Stevens-Duryea Co., supra. Nash </em>v. <em>Lang, </em>268 Mass. 407, 410. <em>DuBois </em>v. <em>Powdrell, </em>271 Mass. 394, 397. There was no evidence that the defendant saw Louis Grace get into the automobile and drive it. Hence <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Bedard, </em>265 Mass. 408, 410 is distinguishable. The testimony of the defendant that, having notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the next year after the accident though continuing to own the automobile he had it registered in the name of his daughter who was not licensed to operate motor vehicles, did not warrant a finding that the automobile \u201c constituted all of the defendant\u2019s attachable property, and . . . was voluntarily conveyed to avoid an attachment by the plaintiff \u201d thereby showing such consciousness of liability on the part of the defendant for the results of the accident as to amount to an admission thereof. See <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>262 Mass. 10, 12. See also <em>Banfield </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>10 Allen, 27, 31; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Susser, </em>191 Mass. 329, 331; <em>Portland Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>Ruud, </em>242 Mass. 272, 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In the case brought by Sophie Wilson the exceptions must be overruled. In the case brought by Morris Wilson the verdict on counts one and three was for $340, but it was agreed by the parties at the argument that if a verdict for the defendant ought to have been directed on the third count judgment should be entered for the plaintiff for $15. It follows that judgment must be so entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
