That contention cannot be sustained. The testimony of the plaintiffs that the freight cars were of such color that they did not see them is no excuse for their conduct. The immutable fact of the collision and the testimony of the plaintiffs permit only one rational inference and that is that the negligence of the plaintiffs contributed directly to their injury and damage. <em>Pigeon </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Northeastern Street Railway, </em>230 Mass. 392, 395. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>245 Mass. 139.
