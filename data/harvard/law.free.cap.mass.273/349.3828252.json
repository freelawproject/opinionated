There was a finding for the garage company in each case, and a report to the Appellate Division, which was dismissed. The trust company appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\">On December 13, 1926, the garage company made a contract in writing with the owner of certain lots of land in Winchester, title to which stood in the name of his daughter \u2014 it is not contended that anything turns upon the fact that title was so held \u2014 \u201c to deliver and install ten clapboard steel garages, size 11 x 18 on ten lots of land,\u201d including \u201c Lot No. 21,\u201d involved in the case brought by the trust company, and \u201c Lot No. 22,\u201d involved in the case brought by the garage company. This contract provided \u201c that the title to all material and fixtures covered by this contract shall remain in the vendor until all payments called for by the contract have been made, and that upon the failure of the vendee to make any payment called for by the contract, the vendor may remove all such material or fixtures from whatever premises they may be placed upon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">When the conditional sale contract was made each lot here involved was subject to a construction mortgage, duly recorded, to the trust company which, by the schedule of payments agreed upon, was to advance $300 for a garage thereon. The trust company never received notice \u201c of the terms and conditions of the sale\u201d of the garages \u201cas between the then land owner \u201d and the garage company. The contract was not recorded in the registry of deeds and no notice thereof was given to the trust company by either of the parties thereto. Soon after the contract was made the garage company erected a garage on each of these lots and the trust company, relying on the erection thereof, advanced $300 on account of each garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The trial judge states in his report as to the garage on \u201c Lot No. 21,\u201d that it <em>\u201c </em>was a metal garage and was placed on six concrete piers embedded in the ground and projecting about six inches above the ground, which piers were erected by another contractor. This garage was not bolted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>down to the piers. It was simply resting on the piers and no floor was ever laid . . . This garage was not physically attached to the realty in any way.\u201d He states in respect to the garage on \u201c Lot No. 22 \u201d that it was placed on concrete piers, as in the other case, that <em>\u201c </em>the sills of the garage were fastened down to each pier by a removable nut which operated on a threaded bolt embedded in each pier,\u201d that \u201c Sometime after the garage was erected the owner had a concrete floor put in by another contractor, which cemented in part of the lower sill of the garage \u201d and that \u201c To remove the garage it was necessary to break the cement floor slightly to release the sills.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\">In June, 1928, the trust company foreclosed its mortgages on the lots in question and became the owner of the land. Previously, the garage company, by direction of the landowner, had removed the garage from \u201c Lot No. 21,\u201d for nonpayment of the purchase price. On November 12, 1928, the garage company, when attempting to remove the garage from \u201cLot No. 22,\u201d for nonpayment, with the permission, given before the foreclosure, of the person in whose name the title then stood, was prevented from doing so by the duly authorized agent of the trust company.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The judge took a view of the premises and of the garage which had been removed from \u201c Lot No. 21.\u201d Each report states that it \u201c contains all the evidence material to the questions reported.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In each case the judge ruled, at the request of the garage company, that \u201c By the contract . . . title to the garage remained \u201d in the garage company, and that the \u201c garage . . , was never part of the realty \u201d but \u201c was personal property and a removable chattel,\u201d and denied requests by the trust company for rulings setting forth the contrary view in various aspects. At the request of the garage company, he ruled further in the case involving \u201c Lot No. 22,\u201d that the \u201c owner gave . . . [the garage company] permission to remove the garage,\u201d that the \u201c foreclosure of the mortgage . . . did not make the garage realty \u201d and that \u201c On all the evidence \u201d the trust company was \u201c liable for conversion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>These cases must be considered apart from G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 13. Before its amendment by St. 1929, c. 261, it applied only to conditional sales of \u201c heating apparatus, plumbing goods, ranges or other articles of personal property,\u201d \u201cother articles of personal property \u201d meaning \u25a0\u201c property of the same kind or of the same general description \u201d as the articles specifically mentioned. <em>Babcock Davis Corp. </em>v. <em>Paine, </em>240 Mass. 438, 441. <em>J. H. Gerlach Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>241 Mass. 69, 73. See also <em>Automatic Sprinkler Corp. </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>259 Mass. 319, 322; <em>American Soda Fountain Co. </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>32 Fed. Rep. (2d) 737, 739. Portable steel garages are not such property. St. 1929, c. 261, which extends the provisions of G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 13, to \u201c buildings of wood or metal construction of the class commonly known as portable or sectional buildings,\u201d was not passed until after these actions were brought. We need not determine whether G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 13, as amended, would have been applicable to the facts in these cases if St. 1929, c. 261, had been passed at any earlier time.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\">Whether, as between the trust company and the garage company, the garages were personal property or parts of the realty was a mixed question of law and fact <em>(Henry N. Clark Co. </em>v. <em>Skelton, </em>208 Mass. 284, 286, <em>Automatic Sprinkler Corp. </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>259 Mass. 319, 323), \u201cdepending for its answer in part upon the intention of . . . [the landowner] as manifested by his acts.\u201d <em>Wentworth </em>v. <em>S. A. Woods Machine Co. </em>163 Mass. 28, 33. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bay State Savings Bank, </em>202 Mass. 482. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>222 Mass. 192, 194, 195. Such a garage does not fall on the one hand within the class of property which is real estate as matter of law, because \u201c so affixed \u201d thereto \u201c that its identity is lost, or so annexed that it cannot be removed without material injury to the real estate or to itself,\u201d nor, on the other hand, within the class of articles which are personal property as matter of law because \u201c manifestly furniture as distinguished from improvements.\u201d <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Livingston, supra. </em>Compare <em>Ferdinand </em>v. <em>Earle, </em>241 Mass. 92, 94, 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The so called \u201c rulings \u201d of the trial judge obviously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>were findings and rulings. Compare <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Pero, </em>272 Mass. 482, 484. His finding, expressed in various forms, that the garages were not parts of the realty, means that the question of fact involved was decided against the trust company. Compare <em>Automatic Sprinkler Corp. </em>v. <em>Rosen, supra. </em>We cannot say that this finding was not warranted. We do not know precisely what was disclosed by the view taken by the judge. There is nothing in the report in either case to indicate that the garages were specially designed for use on these premises or were peculiar in pattern, nor that the piers were not as well adapted to support other garages. The view may have shown the contrary. The conditional sale contract gives some indication that the garages were of a stock pattern. It could have been found also that they were removable easily without injury to themselves or to the piers upon which they rested. It is stated that the garage erected on \u201c Lot No. 21 \u201d merely rested upon concrete piers and \u201c was not physically attached to the realty in any way,\u201d and that, though the sills of the -other garage resting upon concrete piers \u201c were fastened down to each pier by a removable nut . . . on a threaded bolt embedded in each pier \u201d and the concrete floor, put in after the garage was erected, <em>\u201c </em>cemented in \u201d part of the lower sill, it was necessary to break the floor only \u201c slightly \u201d to remove the garage. The physical facts, set out in the report as 'evidence or subsidiary findings, furnish some basis for the inference, which, however, was not required as matter of law, that the owner in placing the garages upon the land did not intend to make them a permanent part of it. See <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Livingston, supra. </em>See also <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>140 Mass. 416, 420; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bay State Savings Bank, supra. </em>Furthermore, the fact that the garages were bought on conditional sale, even if unknown to the mortgagee, had some tendency to show that the landowner did not intend them to remain permanently <em>(Jennings </em>v. <em>Vahey, </em>183 Mass. 47, 49, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bay State Savings Bank, </em>202 Mass. 482, 487, see also <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Livingston, supra) </em>though, under our decisions, if they were found to be parts of the realty, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>agreement that they should be treated as personalty or that title thereto should remain in the vendor would not bind a prior nonassenting mortgagee. <em>Clary </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>15 Gray, 522. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Bay State Iron Co. </em>97 Mass. 279. <em>Hopewell Mills </em>v. <em>Taunton Savings Bank, </em>150 Mass. 519, 521. <em>Tarbell </em>v. <em>Page, </em>155 Mass. 256. The schedule of advances agreed upon between the mortgagee and the land- , owner, including $300 for each garage, and the acceptance of such advances by the landowner, though evidence tending to show that he intended to treat the garages as realty, were not necessarily controlling. Nor was the nature of the garages changed by the foreclosure of the mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\">It does not appear that the garage company made or assented to any representation to the trust company as to the nature of the garages by which it was estopped to assert its title thereto. Compare <em>J. H. Gerlach Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>241 Mass. 69, 73, 74; <em>S. C. </em>251 Mass. 558, 565, 566. Even if the acceptance by the landowner of advances from the trust company, on account of the garages, amounted to a representation by him that the garages were parts of the realty, it does not appear that the garage company knew of these advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">If, as the trial judge found justifiably, the garages were not parts of the realty, the findings that title to them remained in the garage company also were warranted. On these findings the removal of the garage from <em>\u201c </em>Lot No. 21 \u201d by the garage company was not a conversion and the garage company was entitled to reclaim the garage on <em>\u201c </em>Lot No. 22.\u201d The trust company does not contend that in this state of the title the trial judge was not warranted in finding that its action in preventing the removal of the garage from \u201c Lot No. 22 \u201d by the garage company amounted to a conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
