McDonald; The trial judge found that the attachment was made on April 26, 1927, and \u201cwas a valid one as far as McDonald was concerned and the defendant was acting within his official authority providing the flour was the property of McDonald at the time the attachment was made,\u201d but that on the preceding day McDonald had given a bill of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>sale of the flour to the plaintiff which was never recorded. He found as a fact that the bill of sale was given as security and ruled that as it had not been recorded it was \u201cof no legal effect again\u00a7t the defendant \u201d and found for him. The Appellate Division, to which, at the request of the plaintiff, the case was reported, dismissed the report, and the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\">The plaintiff\u2019s contention is, in substance, that \u201c the flour was \u201d not \u201c the property of McDonald at the time the attachment was made,\u201d because (a) title thereto never passed to him, but, (b) if it ever did so pass, the bill of sale, though unrecorded, transferred from him to the plaintiff a title valid against the subsequent attachment, since at the time of the attachment the plaintiff had possession of the flour.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The trial judge found that at the time \u201c the attachment was made the flour was on the track for delivery in Worcester where it had been shipped by a flour mill from whom McDonald had purchased it . . . on a bill of lading made out to the shipper as consignee but with order to notify McDonald.\u201d On the day of the attachment, but before it was made, the plaintiff, McDonald\u2019s mother-in-law, \u201c with her own money paid a bank . . . the amount of the arrival draft issued with the shipment and then went to the freight house and obtained a release of the flour to herself.\u201d The flour remaining in the car was attached while the plaintiff was in the process of unloading. The finding that the bill of sale was given as security, which was warranted by the evidence, in connection with the other findings, imported that the plaintiff paid the draft on behalf of McDonald. Consequently, title to the flour passed to him before the attachment was made, subject to the rights of the plaintiff, if any, under the bill of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The trial judge ruled correctly that the bill of sale \u201c given as security,\u201d unrecorded, was \u201c of no legal effect against the defendant.\u201d The defendant was not a party thereto. See <em>Denny </em>v. <em>Lincoln, </em>13 Met. 200; <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Harlow, </em>16 Gray, 379; <em>Drew </em>v. <em>Streeter, </em>137 Mass. 460. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>G. L. c. 255, \u00a7 1, provides for recording mortgages of personal property and provides further that such a mortgage \u201c shall not be valid against a person other than the parties thereto until so recorded,\u201d and that the \u201c section shall apply to bills of sale given for security.\u201d This bill of sale is not within the exception made by St. 1921, c. 233. Nor, as contended by the plaintiff, is it outside the statute because the flour came into her possession. This statute, as it appeared in R. L. c. 198, \u00a7 1, did not apply to bills of sale <em>(Coggan </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>215 Mass. 13) and expressly excepted from its application mortgages where \u201c the property mortgaged has been delivered to and retained by the mortgagee.\u201d It was extended to \u201c bills of sale intended for security \u201d by St. 1913, c. 656. St. 1915, c. 226, repealed St. 1913, c. 656, struck from R. L. c. 198, \u00a7 1, the express exception of mortgages covering property <em>\u201c </em>delivered to and retained by the mortgagee \u201d and provided that the section should <em>\u201c </em>apply to bills of sale given for security.\u201d The statute was so codified in General Laws. In view of its history, there can be no implication that <em>\u201c </em>bills of sale given for security \u201d covering property in the possession of the vendee are excepted from its provisions. Such an implication as to mortgages is rebutted by the repeal of the express exception and the statute purports' to treat such bills of sale like mortgages. Therefore, cases, arising before the passage of St. 1915, c. 226, in which the effect of delivery is considered, are no longer controlling. See, for example, <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>190 Mass. 219; <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Dore, </em>194 Mass. 493. Nor, as the statute includes expressly \u201c bill's of sale given for security,\u201d need the cases distinguishing chattel mortgages and pledges be discussed. See, for example, <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>5 Allen, 34; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Dolliver, </em>132 Mass. 103; <em>Harding </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>186 Mass. 39; <em>Coggan </em>v. <em>Ward, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">As no error of law is disclosed by the record, the order of the Appellate Division dismissing the report must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
