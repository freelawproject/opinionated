The testimony of the plaintiff showed that after waiting for several cars she stepped into one, and other passengers pushing and crowding to get in knocked her down inside the car; that the conductor was standing by the fare box but he did nothing, and that she saw no guard on the platform; that she became separated from her companion by the pushing crowd; and that this was at the rush hour. A witness called it the usual crowd and another testified that it was an unusually large crowd. The evidence need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>not be narrated in further detail.
