J. Miller. Appellants furnished said Miller with a line of samples of these cigars and he solicited orders for cigars and sent them to appellants at Philadelphia, who filled them, if they accepted the orders, and shipped the goods direct to the purchasers, drew on them for the price at which goods were sold, and from and after the acceptance of the orders dealt directly with the purchaser, paying Miller commissions on such orders as they accepted. Appellee had given appellants several orders for goods through Miller, which they had filled, shipping the goods direct to appellee and drawing on him for the amount of the bill. Early in August, 1884, appellants received from Miller the following order:</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-13\" pgmap=\"575\">\u201cMessrs.

Grands), 1-1 os., at $65, to be shipped on the 25tli instant, which we have booked and hope to be able to ship the former on or about the 20th instant, which time it required to make the special box for you, while the Grands we shall forward in due time.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-11\" pgmap=\"576\">\u201cVery Besp.,</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-12\" pgmap=\"576\">\u201c Boltz, Clymer &amp; Co.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-13\" pgmap=\"576\">This letter was mailed to appellee on the day of its date, and on August 21st, thereafter, the 10,000 cigars mentioned therein were shipped to appellee, and bills for each 5,000 were mailed to him stating the terms of the sale and the prices.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-14\" pgmap=\"576\">Appellee was not at home when the cigars arrived, but September 12, 1884, came home and found the cigars, and found by the bill that 10,000 cigars had been sent to him. He then notified Miller that appellant had sent him 10,000 and he had only ordered 5,000. Miller said it was all right; lie would take the other 5,000 and dispose of them, and he obtained appellee\u2019s consent to leave them on store with him for a time. On the maturity of the first bill in November, appellants drew on appellee for $150, the amount of the bill, and the draft was paid. On December 4th they drew another draft for $325 for the other 5,000 cigars and the draft was returned unpaid.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"APW\" pgmap=\"577\">In December afire occurred at appellee\u2019s place in which the 5,000 cigars were slightly damaged, and then appellee hunted up Miller and asked why he had not taken the cigars away. Miller shortly after took away 3,000 of the cigars and appellee kept 2,000 of them and forwarded to appellants a draft for the price, \u00a7130, which appellants refused to accept. On February 4, 1885, appellee wrote to appellants for the first time, explaining to them that he had ordered but 5,000 cigars and declining to pay for the other 5,000, but only for the 2,000 of them which he had used. Miller had no authority to settle differences or collect money for appellants and had never done so except on one occasion, when he was given special directions. Miller used a letter head, on the top of which were two pictures of buildings\u2014one purported to be a picture of Boltz, Olymer &amp; Go.\u2019s house in Philadelphia and one purporting to he a picture of S. J. Horner &amp; Co.\u2019s, Louisville, with the words, e\u00a3 Chas. Jay Miller &amp; Co., Manufacturer\u2019s agents, tobacco and cigars, 62 Wabash Av., Chicago.\u201d This letter head was printed in Chicago by Miller. There was no evidence that appellants knew anything of it, and it was not proven to have been seen by appellee until nearly six months after the cigars in question were received by him.</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-4\" pgmap=\"577\">Upon these facts the County Court found for appellee and rendered a judgment for costs against appellants, who jiroperly excepted to the finding and bring the ease to this court for reviexv.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b577-5\" pgmap=\"577\">Messrs.

Washington Ins. Co., 4 Cow. 645.</p><p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-6\" pgmap=\"579\">In the case of Columbian Ins. Co. v. Cooper, 50 Pa. St. 331, an insurance case, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held the company bound by any notice that came to its agent to take applications.</p> <opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b579-7\" pgmap=\"579\">Per Curiam.</author> <p id=\"A8Y\" pgmap=\"579\">There is nothing whatever in the course of dealing between appellee and appellants through the agent, Miller, which would warrant appellee in concluding that said Miller had any authority further than to take orders for cigars and forward them to appellants for acceptance after the order was taken. Appellee had dealt exclusively with appellants in all their previous transactions.</p> <p id=\"b579-8\" pgmap=\"579\">We have searched this record in vain to find any evidence that would justify appellee in dealing with Miller on the assumption that he was anything more than a mere solicitor of orders for appellants.</p> <p id=\"b579-9\" pgmap=\"579(67) 580(103)\">If appellants had known of the pictured letter head it would not have furnished evidence which would justify such assumption, but there is no evidence that they were at all aware of Miller\u2019s use of such letter head. There is then no ground whatever for implying authority or a holding out from such a source, A party who deals with an agent is bound at his peril to advise himself of the agent\u2019s authority, and an authority to take orders does not include the right or authority to take and deal with the principal\u2019s goods. Appellee had no right to deliver to said Miller any of the cigars, and doing so was equivalent to a conversion of them to his own use. We are of opinion that it was the duty of appellee to have advised appellants, within a reasonable time of the mistake in the order, if there was such mistake, and that notice to Miller was no notice to appellants under the facts in this case.</p> <p id=\"b580-5\" pgmap=\"580\">The notice, given in February, after he had taken 2,000 of the cigars himself and allowed Miller to take away the other 3,000, was not reasonable. He was, after having so dealt with the cigars, estopped to deny that he had accepted them, and he is, under the facts as shown in this record, justly and legally liable to appellants for the price at which the cigars were billed to him.</p> <p id=\"b580-6\" pgmap=\"580\">The judgment of the County Court must therefore he reversed and the case remanded.</p> <p id=\"b580-7\" pgmap=\"580\">Reversed and remanded..</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
