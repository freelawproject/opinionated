The vehicle was not licensed under the laws of Yew Jersey. Service of the summons and complaint was made upon the Secretary of State of Yew Jersey on February 10th, 1927, under <em>chapter </em>232 <em>of the laws of </em>1924. <em>Pamph. L., p. </em>517. He forwarded the papers thus served to the defendants by mail at addresses in Yew York provided by plaintiffs\u2019 attorney. Yeither letter was returned by the postal authorities. There being no answer to the complaint, judgment interlocutory was entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>on March 16th, 1927. Oil March 19th ensuing, plaintiffs served upon the Secretary of State notice of their intention to have the damages assessed by a jury under rule 90 of this court. The Secretary of State also mailed this notice to each defendant, but there was no response thereto. The damages were assessed; and on April 14th, 1927, judgment final was entered. On June 11th, 1941, a wage execution was issued on the judgment against the defendant Wittman, who was then employed in this state, and thereupon the instant rule was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The judgment is a nullity for want of jurisdiction of the person. The proceeding was <em>coram non judice. </em>In <em>Wuchter </em>v. <em>Pizzutti, </em>276 <em>U. S. </em>13; 48 <em>S. Ct. </em>259; 72 <em>L. Ed. </em>446, it was held that the cited statute did not meet the requirement of due process of law since it did not contain a provisi\u00f3n making it reasonably probable that notice of the service of process on the Secretary of State would he communicated to the nonresident defendant, and so contravened the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. And it does not matter that here the defendants had actual notice of the suit by the delivery of the summons and complaint mailed by the Secretary of State. That was so in the case referred to; and the ruling was that, inasmuch as such notice was not \u201cdirected by the statute,\u201d it does not operate to \u201csupply constitutional validity to the statute or to service under it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Invoking <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>3 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>726, and the holding of the Court of Errors and Appeals in the cited case of <em>Pizzutti </em>v. <em>Wuchter, </em>103 <em>N. J. L. </em>130, plaintiffs maintain that when the instant action was brought and the judgment therein entered the statute had been \u201cjudicially approved,\u201d and, such having then been \u201cthe state of the law,\u201d the judgment was rendered \u201cunassailable\u201d upon the expiration of the time for appeal, and could not thereafter be vacated \u201cmerely because of a subsequent change in the law\u201d effected by the Federal Supreme Court\u2019s condemnation of the act as in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; and that, moreover, defendants are precluded from relief by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>laches. The cases found to support the first proposition are <em>Miller v. McCutcheon, </em>117 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>123; <em>Chicot County Drainage Dist. </em>v. <em>Baxter State Bank, </em>308 <em>U. S. </em>371; 60 <em>S. Ct. </em>317; 84 <em>L. Ed. </em>329; rehearing denied, 309 <em>U. S. </em>695; 60 <em>S. Ct. </em>581; 84 <em>L. Ed. </em>1035, and <em>Woods Bros. Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Yankton County, </em>54 <em>Fed. Rep. (2d) </em>304. But they are plainly not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">There, jurisdiction of the person had been acquired; and it was sought to open a judgment or decree regularly entered for the assigned reason that the statute upon which it was rested was later adjudged to be constitutionally insufficient. This was matter relating to the merits of the action and not to the jurisdiction of the court. Here, jurisdiction <em>in personam </em>was not obtained, and the judgment was therefore void <em>ab initio. </em>Being void, it has not been vitalized by the lapse of time; and, since the jurisdictional lack is apparent upon the face of the record, there can be no doubt that it is subject to collateral attack. And it may, of course, be vacated at any time. <em>McKelway &amp; Gray </em>ads. <em>Jones, </em>17 <em>N. J.
