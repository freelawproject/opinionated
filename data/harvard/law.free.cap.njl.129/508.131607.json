Defendant adduced no evidence in contravention of the case made by plaintiff. The deceased was employed at Jersey City by the National <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Grocery Company. On the evening of June 3d, 1938, he joined employees of this company and other groups on a steamboat excursion -\u00bbup the Hudson River from Jersey City. He was a \u201cvery jolly\u201d young man of the age of twenty-five years, and apparently in robust health. He spent the evening \u201cdancing and kidding and fooling.\u201d As the boat was \u201cmoving into shore\u201d on the return trip, the deceased removed his coat, vest, tie and shoes, and, declaring his intention \u201cto beat the boat in,\u201d dived into the water. Before going overboard he addressed a friend standing nearby: \u201cWatch them [his clothes], Scotty. Pick them up when you get to Jersey City.\u201d The boat was stopped, but the deceased could not be found. His body was recovered from the water several days later. The death certificate issued by the medical examiner of the City of New York was introduced into evidence by consent; and it disclosed the cause of death as \u201casphyxia by submersion\u201d under \u201cundetermined circumstances.\u201d The deceased was \u201ca very good swimmer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">It is the insistence of the insurer that the coverage of the accidental death benefit clause does not extend to \u201can unforeseen, unexpected death resulting from means which are intended and deliberate.\u201d There is no contention of suicide. Conceding that the insured \u201cfully intended to reach the shore,\u201d and that he was \u201cknown to be a good swimmer and presumably had indulged in such demonstrations on'other occasions,\u201d and characterizing his conduct as the \u201crash act of a youth eager to demonstrate his physical or athletic prowess,\u201d the specific point made is that there was an utter lack of evidence of \u201cany unintended chance happening intervening the inception of deliberate means and the unintended result.\u201d A distinction is found between \u201can unexpected, unusual, unforeseen result brought about by means voluntarily undertaken\u201d and \u201ca like result occasioned by means which are accidental.\u201d It is said that the deceased \u201cvoluntarily assumed the many risks inherent in so foolhardy an exploit\u201d and \u201crecklessly hazarded the very result which in fact occurred.\u201d The point is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The term \u201caccidental means\u201d was employed in the policy in its usual and popular sense, <em>i. e., </em>as signifying a \u201chappen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>ing by chance; unexpectedly taking place; not according to the usual course of things; or not as expected.\u201d The means are \u201caccidental\u201d if, \u201cin the act which precedes the injury, something unforeseen, unexpected, unusual occurs, which produces the injury.\u201d If the result \u201cis such as follows from ordinary means, voluntarily employed, in a not unusual or unexpected wajy\u201d the means are not in this category. <em>Lower </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>111 <em>N. J. L. </em>426. Here, an inference of death by accidental means within this definition is reasonably derivable from the evidence. It is to be presumed, indeed it is conceded, that the deceased intended to reach the nearby shore in safety, and was not in doubt as to his ability to do so; and it is fairly deducible that his failure was due to intervenient accidental means as so defined. Compare <em>United States Mutual Accident Association </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>131 <em>U. S. </em>100, 121; 33 <em>L. Ed. </em>60, 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The inquiry is whether there is any evidence which, if accepted and given its fullest probative force, reasonably tends to sustain the pleaded cause of action. Is it such that fair and reasonable men would be justified in concluding that the <em>onus pro'bandi </em>had been sustained? <em>Sivak </em>v. <em>New Brunswick, </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>197. It need not have the quality of certainty. Indirect or circumstantial evidence meets the legal standard if it preponderates in favor of the tendered hypothesis. That must be a rational inference, <em>i. e., </em>such as is based upon a preponderance of the probabilities according to the common experience of mankind. It must be a presumption grounded in reason and logic. It is not easy to lay down with precision the line of demarcation between a just and reasonable inference and mere conjecture or surmise. The accepted standard of persuasion governing the triers of the facts is that the determination be probably founded in truth. <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em>82 <em>Id. </em>416; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Co., </em>111 <em>Id. </em>487. A mere quantitative preponderance does not suffice. It is requisite that the evidence be such as to lead a reasonably cautious mind to that conclusion. Professor Wigmore, in the recent revision of his work on evidence, quotes from a treatise by Professor Trickett on the doctrine of preponder<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>anee of evidence: \u201cThere is no measure of the weight of evidence (unless the witnesses on the evidential facts are counted) other than the feeling of probability which it engenders.\u201d <em>Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed.), </em>\u00a7 2498.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">So assayed, there is a tangible basis in the evidence here adduced for the judgment under review. It is fairly infer-able that an untoward and unexpected mishap was the means of the insured\u2019s drowning. He was a strong swimmer; and, as stated, the proofs clearly show that he designed to swim to shore. That an intervening accident was the agency of death is a reasonable hypothesis \u2014 a natural presumption. Reason guided by common experience leads to that conclusion. That the insured\u2019s act was foolhardy does not serve to make the provision for double indemnity inoperative. The clause is to be construed most strongly against the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
