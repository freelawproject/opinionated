J. S. A. </em>2:202-16. He was committed to the penitentiary of the County of Hudson for a period of one year. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2:205-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Three others (Dominick Warn, August Latzo and Joseph Sabo) were likewise charged, convicted and punished. Each was allowed a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to review his conviction. On the representation that the four writs were based upon the \u201cidentical facts and law,\u201d a justice of this court, with the consent of counsel for the respective parties, ordered that the four cases be \u201cconsolidated,\u201d that they be \u201cargued together\u201d upon the record submitted in the Carroll case, and that the decision in the Carroll case be \u201cdispositive\u201d of the issues of \u201claw and facts\u201d in the other three cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Prom the record thus submitted it is clear that the proofs are not in dispute. While ours is not the duty, in a case of this type, to \u201cweigh the evidence,\u201d even if it be in dispute <em>(Cf. State </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>116 <em>N. J. L. </em>48, 57, 58; 181 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>706; <em>affirmed, </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>466; 5 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>697), nor to \u201cresolve factual disputes,\u201d if there be any \u201clegal evidence to sustain them\u201d <em>(Cf. State </em>v. <em>Czarnicki, </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>43, 46, 47; 10 <em>All. Rep. (2d) </em>461), nonetheless, we shall make brief reference to the undisputed facts as exhibited to the end of disposing the frivolous argument made, namely, that the proofs neither support the complaint nor the conviction. The proofs are in substance as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">On the morning of the day in question (June 25th, 1942), the police of Jersey City, at the Fifth Precinct Station, received a telephone call \u201cthat there was a group of four or five suspicious men at a saloon at Gates and Princeton Avenues.\u201d Because of this information, because \u201cthere had previously been a hold-rrp at a saloon in that neighborhood,\u201d and because the day in question was a pay day for the Pennsylvania Railroad, several officers \u201cimmediately\u201d went to the scene and found a group of men of whom prosecutor was one. Prosecutor was stopped as he came out of the saloon. On questioning he stated that he was a resident of New Brunswick, in this state; that he had come to Jersey City \u201cto see a man * * * about a job for a friend.\u201d In answer to a question as to whether he had ever been convicted, he said that \u201che had been on parole for a charge of death by auto * * *\u201d and that he had previously \u201cbeen arrested as a disorderly person in New Brunswick.\u201d Carroll subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>quently admitted that his answers were not true and that he had actually come to Jersey City to get into a \u201ccrap game;\u201d that he had been in the rear of the stated saloon a few days before and \u201csaw a crap game in which a fellow had won $800;\u201d that he \u2018Tiad won it easily,\u201d so \u201che told his friends about it\u201d and that \u201cthen all decided to break into the game and get some easy money.\u201d. Prosecutor\u2019s criminal record, verified by himself, contained at least twelve encounters with the law for the period from 1934 to 1942, including, but not limited to, convictions for malicious mischief, grand larceny, breaking and entering, larceny of automobile, for being drunk and disorderly and for assault and battery. (Parenthetically, it is interesting to observe the printed length of the criminal records of\u2019 all prosecutors; they comprise about six pages.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Prosecutor\u2019s conviction was proper. His arrest was legal notwithstanding that the officers had no warrant. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2:206-2. It is not open to the prosecutor to argue the point for the first time, as he does, that the complaint is \u201cvague, indefinite and insufficient in law.\u201d Prosecutor was represented by counsel at the hearing which took place on July 9th, 1942. No objection was made to the form of the complaint or otherwise, and prosecutor participated in the hearing on the merits. <em>Kluczek </em>v. <em>State, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>105; 178 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>632; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rowe, supra </em>(at <em>p. </em>50). Especially is this so when, as here, the point urged does not relate to \u201can error of law\u201d exhibited on the face of the record; nor to \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d nor to \u201cpublic policy.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Czarnicki, supra </em>(at <em>pp. </em>46-47.) Our Disorderly Persons Act <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2:202-16) is constitutional. <em>McNeilly </em>v. <em>State, </em>119 <em>N. J. L. </em>237; 195 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>725. The court below had unchallenged jurisdiction over the subject-matter and of the person of the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Moreover, the complaint couched in the language of the statute, was sufficient. <em>Cf. Levine </em>v. <em>State, </em>110 <em>N. J. L. </em>467, 471; 168 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>300. Prosecutor well knew the charge made against him. He asked for no further particulars. He admitted the truth of the charge which was based upon his own admission. He merely sought to invoke the mercy of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>The court was not moved by the plea for mercy and the penalty imposed was within the limit authorized by the act. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2:205-l.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">We have considered all other points argued and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Accordingly, the judgment in this ease, and the judgment in each of the three other cases named, is affirmed, and the writ in each case is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
