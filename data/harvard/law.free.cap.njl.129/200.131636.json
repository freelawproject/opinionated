When the state rested, counsel for defendant moved a direction of acquittal on several grounds, only one of which' need be considered, viz., that the indictment did not charge a crime. The motion was denied, was renewed at the close of -the evidence and again denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>We are compelled to the conclusion that there was legal error in the denial of the motion, and that in consequence there must be a reversal. The language of the statute is as follows: \u201cAny person who shall be guilty of open lewdnoss, or any notorious act of public indecency, grossly scandalous and tending to debauch the morals and manners of the people, or who shall in private be guilty of any act of lewdness or carnal indecency with another, grossly scandalous and tending to debauch the morals and manners of the people, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d The clause particularly relevant is \u201cOr who shall in private be guilty of any act of lewd ness or carnal indecency with another.\u201d The fundamental point argued is whether an act of private lewdness is in violation of the statute if committed with no other person present. The language of the statute, particularly in connection with its history, indicates the contrary. In the 1874 revision of the Crimes Act <em>(Rev. </em>1877 (at <em>p. </em>234)), section 1-2 reads: \u201cEvery person who shall be guilty of <em>open </em>lewdness, or any notorious acts of <em>public </em>indecency,\u201d &amp;c. This language was considered in <em>Van Houten </em>v. <em>State, </em>46 <em>N. J. L. </em>16. In 1906 the legislature added the clause: \u201cor any person who shall <em>in private </em>be guilty of any act of lewdness or carnal indecency <em>with another.\u201d Pamph. L., p. </em>101. Tlie words deemed important have been italicised. The section appears unchanged in the Revision of 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The argument for the state is that the two words \u201cwith another\u201d relate only to carnal indecency and not to lewdness. We have some difficulty in distinguishing the two: but assuming a difference, we are unable to see any force in this claim. The original crime involved publicity. The legislature added the clause \u201cor any person who shall in private,\u201d &amp;c. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Michalis </em>99 <em>N. J. L. </em>31, the clause was treated as an entire clause, and properly so. To say that when the legislature added this clause it intended to make an act of \u201ccarnal indecency\u201d criminal only when committed with another, and an act of \u201clewdness\u201d criminal when committed in private and alone, seems both unreasonable and to require the clause to be subdivided by a comma after \u201clewdness\u201d where none appears in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>We conclude that the judgment must be reversed. It is suggested that the objection to the indictment should have been taken before the jury was sworn: but the decisions are to the contrary. <em>State </em>v. Callary, 108 <em>N. J. L. </em>462, 464, and cases cited.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
