Lehman, Jr., </em>of counsel).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b394-8\">Perskie, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae2\">This is an action in replevin. It is the second but differently grounded action between the same parties and in the same court, which plaintiff has prosecuted against defendant concerning her bedspread.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">It is conceded that the single question requiring our decision is whether the trial judge erred in holding that defendant's payment of the judgment which plaintiff recovered in her first action did not, on the record in support of that satisfied judgment, defeat her right successfully to maintain the instant action' of replevin for the return of her spread.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">The facts which give rise to the stated question are free from dispute; their legal efficacy is not. The agreed state of case chiefly consists of a resume of the allegations set down in the state of demand in each action and the result reached in each.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">From the meager record thus submitted we learn that plaintiff on July 1st, 1940, \u201cleft with\u201d or \u201cdelivered to defendant,\u201d engaged in the laundry or dry cleaning business, her \u201ccream colored hand crocheted bedspread\u201d to be dry cleaned for a fixed price. Because defendant, in its undertaking, damaged her spread, plaintiff refused to accept same and defendant has since retained possession thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">On May 1st, 1941, plaintiff sued defendant to recover compensation for the damage to her spread. The gravamen of the state of demand is concededly negligence. The acts of negligence alleged were that the defendant \u201claundered\u201d and \u201cre-laundered\u201d the spread instead of having \u201cdry cleaned\u201d it, that defendant \u201cwas careless, negligent and incompetent,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>that, as a result thereof, the spread was \u201cso damaged that it had lost its value as such,\u201d and that the \u201creasonable value\u201d of the spread \u201cwas $150,\u201d which amount plaintiff sought to recover from defendant. This suit (first action) resulted in a judgment of $75, plus costs of $7.71, total $82.71, in favor of plaintiff, which judgment defendant paid but continued in possession of the spread.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Thereafter, on September 8th, 1941, plaintiff made formal demand for the return of her spread. Defendant refused the demand. Whereupon, on December 29th, 1941, plaintiff instituted this replevin suit (second action). Defendant offered in evidence the entire file in the first action and challenged plaintiff\u2019s asserted right to her spread. That challenge was based upon the premise that it had both \u201clegal possession\u201d and \u201clegal title\u201d to the spread, that plaintiff had neither because its (defendant\u2019s) payment of the stated judgment and costs in the first action \u201ctransferred\u201d to it, by operation of law, the right of possession of and title to the spread.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The trial judge, sitting without a jury, held that the verdict and judgment based thereon, in the first action, was one for \u201cdamages\u201d to the bedspread and, therefore, title thereto \u201cdid not [as urged] pass from plaintiff to defendant.\u201d Accordingly, he entered \u201cjudgment of possession for plaintiff.\u201d Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">We are of the opinion that the trial judge reached a correct result. In support of its claim of possession of and title to the spread, defendant relies here, as it did below, upon the holding in the cases of <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Hess, </em>76 <em>N. J. L. </em>257; 89 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>966, and <em>Siegel </em>v. <em>Riverside Box and Lumber Co., </em>89 <em>N. </em>J. <em>L. </em>595; 99 <em>All. Rep. </em>407. These cases are clearly distinguishable. The former was an action in trover and the latter was an action in conversion. The gist of both actions is \u201cconversion.\u201d <em>Cf. Baude </em>v. <em>Chemical Bank and Trust Co., </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>120, 122; 178 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>799; <em>Potash Stores, Inc., </em>v. <em>Bay Development Corp., </em>118 <em>N. J. L. </em>242; 192 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>379. And \u201cconversion can only result from intentional conduct.\u201d 1 <em>Prosser on Torts </em>572, <em>et seq.; Farrow </em>v. <em>Ocean County Trust Co., </em>121 <em>N. J. L. </em>344, 348; 2 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>352. The gist of plaintiff\u2019s first action, as already observed, concededly is negligence, which is not intentional conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">But however the form of plaintiff\u2019s first action may be characterized, the question still remains whether the judgment that was satisfied covered the full value of the spread. Eor clearly plaintiff may not have both the full cash value of her spread and the spread. <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Hess, supra </em>(at <em>p. </em>258).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">It is true that the state of demand alleges, <em>inter alia, </em>that the spread \u201cwas so damaged that it lost its value as such,\u201d but it is equally true that the state of demand alleges the particulars in which the spread was damaged as a result of which \u201cit lost its value as such,\u201d namely, that it was \u201cstretched,\u201d its \u201coriginal color\u201d was removed, \u201cits texture\u201d became stiff and its \u201ctensile strength\u201d was \u201cmeasurably lessened.\u201d We here mark the fact that the state of demand does not'allege, nor is it otherwise made to appear, that the defendant had rendered the spread entirely worthless. <em>Cf. May </em>v. <em>Georger, </em>47 <em>N. Y. Supp. </em>1057; 21 <em>Mis. R. (N. Y.) </em>622. It is rudimentary that the <em>\u201callegata </em>and <em>prolata </em>must agree; the latter must support the former.\u201d <em>Cf. Boone et al. </em>v. <em>Chiles et al., </em>10 <em>Peters (U. S.) </em>177*, 208*; 9 <em>L. Ed. </em>388, 389. So, too, the verdict and the judgment based thereon, necessarily must in turn find support in the allegations and proofs. In light of these principles and in the absence of an allegation or proof that the spread was rendered entirely worthless, we are unable to say that the judgment and costs of $82.71, satisfied by defendant, covered the full value of the spread which value, as observed, plaintiff alleged to be $150. Rather are we obliged to find, under the circumstances, that the judgment finds support in the allegations of the state of demand and the proofs in support thereof and that it covers, as the trial judge found, compensation for the damage done to the spread.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
