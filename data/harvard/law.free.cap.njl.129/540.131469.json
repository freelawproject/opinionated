Respondents-Prosecntors, vs. Alice Yarborough, et al., Petitioner-Respondents.\" This practice is not in accord with rule 15 of this court which reads, in part: \u201cthe party instituting the original suit or proceeding shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>be named first, although the other party may be the mover of the particular trial or argument noticed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">The pertinent facts are that Alice Yarborough, on December 1st, 1941, was employed as a domestic by William Slocum and Sally Slocum, who then resided in New Jersey. On the above date, Alice Yarborough sustained an injury arising out of and in the course of her employment by the Slocums. On January 28th, 1942, the Slocums moved their residence to New York City. Thereafter, Alice Yarborough filed a formal petition in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau and the chief clerk thereof forwarded a copy to the Slocums at their New York address, stating, in a covering letter, that he was doing so in conformity with <em>R. S. </em>34:15-55.1.\u2019 In this posture of affairs, counsel for the Slocums entered a special appearance and on motion sought, without success, to quash the service of the petition filed by Alice Yarborough.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The defendant in <em>certiorari </em>(petitioner below) urges that the writ should be dismissed as premature because there is, as yet, no final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">We do not think that the allowance of the writ was premature. It is long since settled that the proceedings of a special tribunal \u2014 and the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau is such \u2014 may be reviewed by writ of <em>certiorari </em>prior to a final decision where the jurisdiction of the lower tribunal is, as here, called in question. This is the specific reason for our entertaining the writ at this stage of the proceedings. <em>Mowery </em>v. <em>Camden, </em>49 <em>N. J. L. </em>106; <em>Breen Iron Works </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>115 <em>Id. </em>305; <em>affirmed, </em>117 <em>Id. </em>150.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The prosecutor attacks the statute under which service was made through the agency of the secretary of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau on the ground that such service violates paragraph 2 of article IV of the Federal Constitution. This point was raised in <em>Kawko </em>v. <em>Howe &amp; Co., </em>129 <em>N. J. L. </em>319, and disposed of adversely to the present prosecutors\u2019 claim. In <em>Kawko </em>v. <em>Howe &amp; Co., supra, </em>we held that the statutory method of service was not violative of the \u201cdue process\u201d clause of the Federal Constitution in the case of a non-resident individual who employs labor within the state. The holding in the cited ease is, in effect, that the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>B. S. </em>34:15-55.1 wipes out any difference between a resident and non-resident employer with regard to employment of labor in New Jersey, or employment of labor under contract made in New Jersey. We perceive no distinction between a non-resident employer and a resident employer who, after the contract of employment is made and services are performed thereunder, becomes a non-resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The writ of <em>certiorari </em>is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
