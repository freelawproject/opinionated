We are not unmindful of the provisions of <em>R. S. </em>2 :188-18 that \u201cin any indictment for fraudulently obtaining or attempting to obtain any property by false token, counterfeit writing or other false pretenses, it shall be sufficient to allege that the defendant did the act with intent to defraud, without alleging an intent to defraud any particular person, and without alleging any ownership of the chattel, money or valuable security; and, on the trial of any such indictment, it shall not he necessary to prove an intent to defraud any particular person, but it shall be sufficient to prove that the defendant did the act charged with intent to defraud.\u201d But it cannot be discerned from the indictment before us whether the alleged false pretenses were one act or a series of independent acts. Obviously there were a number of false salary vouchers, and in a number of different names, on which, not on any specific date, but quite conceivably on various dates between July 18th, 1941, and January 9th, 1942, the accused \u201cobtained\u201d the sum of $288.94. The defendant is entitled to be informed, among other things, whether he is charged with obtaining one lump sum by false representations relating to several different fraudulent vouchers, or several different sums based on one or more vouchers. The indictment should show on its face whether one offense is to be charged, or several distinct offenses; in which latter case there should be a separate count for each offense. This indictment fails to show either situation, and we think a proper exercise of judicial discretion requires that it he quashed Such will he the order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
