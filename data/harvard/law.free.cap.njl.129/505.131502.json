Plaintiff deposited with defendant the sum of $150, to \u201cbe applied against the last two months of the lease term.\u201d There was a covenant of peaceful and quiet enjoyment during the term. In the course thereof, the municipality instituted proceedings in Chancery to foreclose a tax sale certificate covering the demised premises, in which plaintiff and defendant were joined as parties defendant; and on April 2d, 1940, a final decree was entered therein foreclosing the right of redemption of both parties. Thereupon, the municipality asserted its title, and demanded and received the rent from plaintiff. The latter then sought a return of the security from defendant; and, upon failure of compliance with the demand, it brought this action to recover the deposit on the theory of \u201can eviction of the plaintiff by paramount title.\u201d Defendant counter-claimed for the rent payable under the lease, and gave notice also of recoupment of damages for breach of the contract. The counterclaim and notice of recoupment were \u201cstricken because excessive;\u201d and plaintiff was awarded judgment for the full amount claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>It is contended that plaintiff has not established a breach of contract, since it \u201csold its business and voluntarily vacated the premises on May 31st, 1941,\u201d and the vendee entered \u201cinto possession after plaintiff vacated and is still in possession of the leased premises;\u201d and there was, moreover, no proof that plaintiff \u201chas been evicted or disturbed in anyway whatever, by any act of defendant, or anyone else as to its rights and the rights of the vendee under\u201d the lease. The point is not well-made.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Defendant\u2019s right of redemption had been cut off by the decree in the foreclosure proceedings; and thereafter plaintiff held possession of the leased premises under a contraed with the municipality, and not under defendant\u2019s lease. Defendant then had no estate in or title to the demised lands; and plaintiff\u2019s rights under the lease had also been terminated, since its title was subordinate to the interest of the municipality under the tax sale certificate and it had been made a party to the foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The underlying tax lien was paramount. <em>B. S. </em>1937, 54:5-9. And if a municipality becomes a purchaser at a tax sale, it may foreclose the right of redemption. <em>Section </em>54:5-34. The decree barred the right of redemption and foreclosed all prior and subsequent alienations of the lands and encumbrances thereon, except municipal liens. <em>Section </em>54:5-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Plaintiff thereupon attorned to the municipality, and thereafter the rent was payable to it. Thus, plaintiff is entitled to a return of the money deposited to secure the payment of the last two months\u2019 rent reserved in the lease terminated by the foreclosure decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">But it is maintained that plaintiff \u201chas not proved that there has been any tax sale of the leased premises,\u201d inasmuch as the recitals of the sale embodied in the decree do not constitute proof of the fact, and that, even though they do, there is an utter lack of proof that \u201cthe lands described in the decree are the same lands as those described in the lease.\u201d This objection borders on the frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The recitals of the decree establish the sale of the lands to the municipality under the statute for arrears of taxes. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>decree is not subject to collateral attack. And there was evidence to prove that the tract of land described in the decree and that delineated in the lease are one and the same. The decree describes the lands as \u201cLot 0-5, Block 1730 Communipaw Avenue, on the Official Tax Duplicate and Assessment Map of the City of Jersey City;\u201d the lease refers to it as \u201cLot C-5, in Block 1730\u201d on the northerly side of Communipaw Avenue. This was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of identity; and defendant adduced no evidence <em>contra. </em>Lands may be sold for taxes merely by lot and block number in accordance with the assessment map of the municipality. <em>Section </em>54:5-48. And it goes without saying that they may be leased by the same description.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Lastly, it is said that there was error in the admission into evidence of the final decree in the foreclosure proceedings, in that the instrument does not disclose the acquisition of jurisdiction over defendant and was' not accompanied by \u2022proof of \u201cthe proceedings upon which it was founded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">This ruling has not been specified as a reason for reversal, and so it is not open to review. Rule 145 of this court. Moreover, the decree reveals that defendant was a party to the foreclosure proceedings; and his right of redemption was thereby barred. As stated, the decree is not subject to collateral attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
