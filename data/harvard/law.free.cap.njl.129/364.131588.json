P. O. E., PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT, v. ASBURY PARK LODGE NO. 128, OF THE BENEVOLENT AND PROTECTIVE ORDER OF ELKS, OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, DEFENDANT-RESPONDENT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b412-4\">Argued January 19, 1943</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ACZ\">Decided January 29, 1943.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b412-7\">Before Brogan, Chief Justice, and Justices Parker and Porter.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-8\">For the appellant, <em>Harry R.

The suit was on a demand note for $800 dated June 3d, 1933, made by respondent to the order of plaintiff-appellant. Eight separate defenses were pleaded, but we need to consider only the second, which sets up the six year statute of limitations. The reply as pleaded is merely a general denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">The suit was begun August 23d, 1940, so that the statute was effective unless something appeared that would toll it. The complaint alleged an interest payment of $48 to have been made on September 7th, 1934, and if this had been proved, the suit was begun in time; but there was no such proof. A check of $48 was put in evidence, dated August 20th, 1934, and stamped by the bank as paid on August 29th, 1934. The evidence indicates that the payment was reported at a meeting of the plaintiff lodge on September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>7th, 1934, but there is no proof of the date when the check was delivered: and if it was delivered at any time before August 23d, 1934, the statute would have run.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">As to the record, it would seem that proper pleading required that plaintiff should have replied specially, showing a payment within the six years before suit begun. <em>Van Dike </em>v. <em>Adm\u2019rs of Van Dike, </em>15 <em>N. J. L. </em>289, 296; <em>8. C., </em>17 <em>Id. </em>479: and the burden of proving such payment was on the plaintiff. <em>Id.; </em>also <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>53 <em>Id. </em>455. We need not pursue the question of pleading, as the failure of any proof that the interest check was delivered and received within the six year period fully justified the nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
