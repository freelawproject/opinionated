II. There is no rule, based upon statute or decisional law, requiring a workers\u2019 compensation insurer or self-insured employer to reserve its offset rights, when consenting to the settlement of a claimant\u2019s third-party settlement, if there is no waiver or compromise of an existing workers\u2019 compensation lien. <em>(Matter of Hilton v Truss Sys., </em>82 AD2d 711, 56 NY2d 877; <em>Matter of Robinette v Meyer Sign Co., </em>43 AD2d 458; <em>Matter of Millward v Meyer Sign Co., </em>28 AD2d 1027, 23 NY2d 966; <em>Matter of Angrisano v United Progress, </em>114 AD2d 536, 67 NY2d 607.) III. The County of Onondaga, in granting consent to the settlement of the third-party action, implicitly reserved its offset rights by requesting the amount of the net proceeds passing to the claimant. IV The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board and the Appellate Division, in the case at bar, failed to follow their own precedent. <em>(Matter of Whitcomb v Xerox Corp., </em>246 AD2d 947; <em>Matter of Parmelee v International Paper Co., </em>157 AD2d 878; <em>Matter of Miller v Arrow Carriers Corp., </em>130 AD2d 279; <em>Matter of Hilton v Truss Sys., </em>82 AD2d 711, 56 NY2d 877.)

We further conclude that substantial evidence supports the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board\u2019s finding that the self-insured employer in this case did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">On November 4, 1998, claimant Alan J. Brisson, who worked in Onondaga County\u2019s Department of Transportation, was injured when struck from behind by a van while he was picking up a \u201cMen Working\u201d sign from the shoulder of a road. Claimant sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits and, in July 2000, a Workers\u2019 Compensation Law Judge (WCLJ) issued a decision concluding that he had suffered a compensable injury to his lower back, and made awards for his periods of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Claimant also filed a third-party action against the driver and owner of the van. When asked by claimant\u2019s attorney to consent to settlement of this third-party action for $50,000, RMSCO, Inc., the third-party administrator for claimant\u2019s self-insured employer, Onondaga County, responded on August 17, 2001 as follows: \u201cOn behalf of [the County], consent is given to the third party settlement of $50,000.00. We are assuming that this is the policy limit. We need to know the net third party proceeds.\u201d Claimant\u2019s attorney on August 20, 2001 wrote RM-SCO that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">\u201cI am in receipt of your letter granting this firm consent to settle [claimant\u2019s] third party claim. It is our understanding that, based on the dollar amount of [claimant\u2019s] third party settlement, you have no lien as well as no right to a [payment] holiday. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>you have a different understanding, please contact this office within five business days or we will proceed with this third party settlement based on our understanding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In an undated letter, RMSCO replied that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">\u201c[t]his letter is in response to yours of 08/20/2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\u201cYou indicate that you believed we have no right to a [payment] holiday. This is not entirely correct. Once lost wages and medical exceed basic economic loss, then we can take credit against net third party proceeds. For example, once lost wages are paid on or after 11/04/2001, we can take credit against net third party proceeds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">The third-party action was, in fact, settled for $50,000 on September 24, 2001. After payment of taxable costs, disbursements and attorneys\u2019 fees, claimant netted $32,958.73.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">On October 5, 2001, RMSCO sent claimant a \u201cNotice that Payment of Compensation has been Stopped or Modified.\u201d The notice stated that claimant\u2019s benefits would cease on the three-year anniversary of the accident, November 4, 2001, and would not resume for 168.2 weeks, or until January 24, 2005, so as to offset net settlement proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">Claimant protested the suspension of his benefit payments at a hearing before a WCLJ on January 24, 2002. Another WCLJ concluded in a decision issued on July 10, 2002 that the County was, in fact, not entitled to offset claimant\u2019s future workers\u2019 compensation payments. While the County had indisputably consented to the settlement, \u201c[t]here was no specific reservation [of the County\u2019s] right to claim credit [for the settlement].\u201d The WCLJ relied upon <em>Matter of Hilton v Truss Sys. </em>(82 AD2d 711 [3d Dept 1981], <em>affd for reasons stated below </em>56 NY2d 877 [1982]) for the proposition that \u201can employer must unambiguously preserve its offset rights against future benefits, or such rights will be deemed waived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">On August 9, 2002, the County asked the Board to review the WCLJ\u2019s decision, disputing the WCLJ\u2019s reading of <em>Hilton </em>and arguing that \u201c[b]ecause, in consenting to the settlement . . . , the self-insured employer neither waived nor compromised a workers\u2019 compensation lien, there was no requirement that the self-insured employer expressly reserve its offset rights.\u201d Alternatively, the County contended that the correspondence between RMSCO and claimant\u2019s attorney, in fact, reserved its offset rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>In its decision issued on November 18, 2002, the Board rejected the County\u2019s arguments, and agreed with the WCLJ that a self-insured employer must \u201cunambiguously preserve its offset rights\u201d when consenting to settlement \u201cor such rights will be deemed waived.\u201d The Board further concurred with the WCLJ that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\">\u201cthe self-insured employer failed to unambiguously reserve its rights to an off set [sic] against future awards when it consented to the third party settlement. To preserve its rights in this case, the self insured employer\u2019s first correspondence on this issue should have contained a clear statement of its reservation of this right or the second correspondence should have withdrawn the consent, issued in the first, pending the resolution of the issue raised in the claimant\u2019s attorney\u2019s correspondence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Accordingly, the County was \u201cnot entitled to any offset of workers\u2019 compensation benefits against the third party settlement paid to the claimant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Upon the County\u2019s appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed, turning down the County\u2019s argument that <em>Hilton </em>mandates only that carriers with existing hens must preserve the right to offset future benefit payments plainly and unambiguously. The Appellate Division also observed that \u201cwhether the employer adequately preserved its right to a future offset in a particular case is a factual issue for the Board, and [its] decision will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence,\u201d which the Court found in this case (12 AD3d 976, 977-978 [3d Dept 2004]). We granted the County permission to appeal, and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1), a claimant may pursue a legal action against a third party for damages arising out of the accident underlying the workers\u2019 compensation claim, but the self-insured employer or carrier has a lien on any recovery to the extent of compensation and medical expenses already disbursed. Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (4) gives the employer or carrier a corollary right to offset a claimant\u2019s future compensation benefits with the proceeds of any recovery. Subdivision (1-a) of section 29, however, precludes a hen under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1) for benefits paid in lieu of first-party benefits which another insurer would have otherwise been obligated to pay under New York\u2019s No-Fault Law, and cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>respondingly limits the credit or offset provision in Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (4) <em>(see Matter of Fellner v Country Wide Ins., </em>95 AD2d 106 [3d Dept 1983]). The term \u201c[flirst party benefits\u201d refers to \u201cbasic economic loss,\u201d or up to $50,000 per person consisting of certain medical and other reasonable and necessary expenses as well as lost earnings for three years from the date of the accident (Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 [a], [b]; <em>see Matter of Johnson v Buffalo &amp; Erie County Private Indus. Council, </em>84 NY2d 13 [1994]). Finally, a claimant who compromises a third-party action for an amount less than the compensation benefits paid or payable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law must first obtain the written consent of the entity liable to pay the benefits, or an order on notice from the court within three months of its approval of the settlement (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 [5]).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Here, claimant\u2019s third-party action settled a little over one month before the three-year anniversary of the automobile accident in which he suffered his compensable injury. By operation of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1-a), therefore, there was no existing lien under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1) and the County could not yet enforce a payment holiday under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (4) because the benefits paid to claimant up to the point of settlement were all in lieu of first-party benefits. According to the County, the absence of an existing lien that might have been compromised or waived takes this case entirely outside <em>Hilton, </em>thereby relieving it of any obligation to reserve future offset rights explicitly when it consented to the settlement pursuant to Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In <em>Hilton, </em>a worker injured his spine when he fell from a train and was rendered paraplegic. As part of settlement negotiations in a third-party action, the workers\u2019 compensation carrier agreed to waive its then existing lien of approximately $70,000. At issue was whether or not the carrier had waived not only the lien, but also its right to offset the net proceeds of claimant\u2019s third-party recovery against his future compensation benefits. The Appellate Division held that if a carrier or employer desires to preserve its offset rights when consenting to a settlement, \u201cit is obliged to plainly and unambiguously so state. Doing so has the salutary effect of affording a claimant the opportunity to examine a proposed settlement from a proper perspective, for it enables him to weigh this offer against a potential loss of future compensation benefits\u201d <em>(Hilton, 82 </em>AD2d at 712 [citation omitted]). We affirmed for these reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>In the County\u2019s reading, however, <em>Hilton </em>hinges entirely on the existence of a lien because a carrier cannot dispel the inference that its waiver induced settlement absent an explicit reservation of future offset rights. The Board and the Appellate Division did not read <em>Hilton </em>so narrowly, and neither do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">As the Appellate Division noted, claimants are unable to assess the ramifications of a settlement unless they know the status of the employer\u2019s or carrier\u2019s claims against settlement proceeds. Moreover, regardless of lien status <em>\u201ca </em>carrier or self-insured employer and claimant are deemed to be involved in . . . settlement negotiations, [and] ambiguities [will] be resolved against the carrier\u201d (Brisson, 12 AD3d at 977 [citation and internal quotation marks omitted]). Further, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (5) does not distinguish between those instances where an employer or carrier has both an existing lien and prospective offset rights at the time of settlement and those cases, such as this one, where the employer or carrier possesses only the latter. In either circumstance, failure to secure the employer\u2019s or carrier\u2019s consent results in forfeiture of the claimant\u2019s future compensation benefits <em>(see Johnson, </em>84 NY2d at 19). Correspondingly, unless an employer or carrier unambiguously and expressly reserves a lien or the right to offset when giving consent, the lien or offset is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Finally, whether an employer adequately preserved its right to a future offset is a factual issue for the Board <em>(Matter of Whitcomb v Xerox Corp., </em>246 AD2d 947 [3d Dept 1998]). A finding of fact made by the Board \u201cis considered conclusive on the courts if supported by substantial evidence\u201d <em>(Matter of Gates v McBride Transp., </em>60 NY2d 670, 671 [1983] [citation omitted]). Where such evidence exists, the Board\u2019s decision may not be disturbed <em>(Matter of Pfeffer v Parkside Caterers, </em>42 NY2d 59, 60 [1977]).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In this case, claimant\u2019s attorney informed the County that he did not believe that the County had either a lien or a right to a payment holiday. In response, the County merely stated that claimant\u2019s attorney was \u201cnot entirely correct\u201d: the County did not withdraw its consent to the settlement; the County did not explicitly reserve its right to an offset as required by <em>Hilton. </em>Thus, substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s factual determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>R.S. Smith, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"ARF\">I join, with some misgivings, in the Court\u2019s main holding, that a compensation carrier or employer that consents to settlement of a third-party claim must expressly reserve its offset rights or lose them, even where it has no existing lien. I have misgivings because it is not completely clear to me where this requirement is to be found in the statute. I join nevertheless, because the Court establishes a clear, easy-to-foll\u00f3w rule in an area where clarity is much to be desired; workers\u2019 compensation claimants who settle third-party claims should never be left in doubt about how much of the settlement will go to them and how much to the compensation carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">But I cannot join the majority\u2019s application of the rule to this case. Surely the employer\u2019s reservation of its offset rights here was clear as day. The words \u201cwe can take credit against net third party proceeds\u201d are as unambiguous a statement as can be imagined that the employer retained its offset right, and the employer\u2019s letter to claimant\u2019s counsel said those words twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur with Judge Read; Judge R.S. Smith dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
