Allowing binding arbitration for other statutory proceedings is not dispositive of whether or not General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a benefits should be subject to binding arbitration.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b596-4\">Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Section 207-a of the General Municipal Law mandates payment of the full amount of regular salary or wages to a paid firefighter \u201cwho is injured in the performance of his duties\u201d or taken ill \u201cas a result of the performance of his duties so as to necessitate medical or other lawful remedial treatment\u201d (General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a [1]). These payments continue until the disability ceases, or the disabled firefighter is granted a disability retirement. Payments stop if the firefighter either performs, or refuses to perform, light-duty work. The municipality is also liable for all medical treatment and hospital care necessitated by the illness or injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In their 1995-1998 collective bargaining agreement, the City of Poughkeepsie and the Poughkeepsie Professional Firefighters\u2019 Association agreed to negotiate a procedure to implement section 207-a for the City\u2019s firefighters. After negotiations proved fruitless, the Association concluded that impasse had been reached and petitioned the New York State Public Employment Relations Board (PERB or the Board) for compulsory interest arbitration. The City responded by filing an improper practice charge, alleging that the Association had violated Public Employees\u2019 Fair Employment Act (Civil Service Law) \u00a7 209-a (2) (b), the Taylor Law. Specifically, the Association\u2019s demands included proposals for de novo arbitral review to resolve disputes over a firefighter\u2019s initial and continuing eligibility for General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a benefits. The City insisted that these proposals were not mandatory subjects of bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">PERB agreed. The Board viewed the Association\u2019s proposals for de novo review as infringing upon the City\u2019s exclusive statutory authority to make initial eligibility and termination decisions <em>(see Matter of City of Poughkeepsie [Poughkeepsie Professional Firefighters\u2019 Assn., Local 596, I.A.F.F., AFL-CIO-CLC], </em>33 PERB \u00b6 3029 [2000]). The Association had \u201cmisinterpreted the import\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 3078) <em>o\u00ed Matter of City of Watertown (Water-town Police Benevolent Assn.) </em>(30 PERB \u00b6 3072 [1997]), where PERB decided that a demand for arbitration of disputes involving eligibility for the benefits conferred by General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c\u2014section 207-a\u2019s counterpart for police officers\u2014 was a mandatory subject of negotiation. In <em>Watertown, </em>the union \u201cmerely requested\u201d that any dispute over the City\u2019s initial determination \u201cbe processed to arbitration pursuant to PERB\u2019s Voluntary Dispute Resolution Procedure. There was no refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>ence in the demand, either express or implied, that there would be a de novo review of the City\u2019s initial determination\u201d (33 PERB 1\u00cd 3029, at 3079). Accordingly, the demand in <em>Watertown </em>was for \u201ca substitute appeal procedure in order to avoid commencing an Article 78 proceeding,\u201d and was found on this basis to be a mandatory subject of negotiations <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">After PERB\u2019s decision in <em>Poughkeepsie, </em>the Association reworked its proposal and the parties resumed collective bargaining. This time around, the Association omitted \u201cde novo\u201d from the text of its proposed section 207-a procedures, which called for an arbitrator to review a firefighter\u2019s eligibility for benefits, the termination of benefits and assignment to light duty. The proposal also recited that the City would have \u201cexclusive authority to initially determine the applicant\u2019s eligibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Again, the parties were unable to negotiate an agreement, the Association petitioned PERB for compulsory interest arbitration and the City filed an improper practice charge in response. The City claimed that the modifications made by the Association to its previous demands were \u201ccosmetic\u201d only, and that its proposal still called for an arbitrator to make a decision on the merits of section 207-a claims. As a result, the demands \u201ceffectively wrest[ed] from the City the authority vested in it by GML \u00a7 207-a to make the initial determination,\u201d and were non-mandatory subjects of collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Once again, PERB sided with the City. PERB concluded that the Association\u2019s demands sought \u201creview not of the City\u2019s determinations of eligibility, termination of benefits and light duty but of the employees\u2019 underlying claims,\u201d and therefore \u201cinfringe[d] upon authority vested exclusively within municipalities by the statute\u201d <em>(Matter of City of Poughkeepsie [Poughkeepsie Professional Firefighters\u2019 Assn., Local 596,1.A.F.F., AFL-CIO, CLC], </em>36 PERB \u00b6 3014, at 3042 [2003]). Accordingly, the Association\u2019s demands were nonmandatory subjects of negotiation, and its submission of them to interest arbitration was an improper practice in violation of section 209-a (2) (b) of the Taylor Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The Association commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding, seeking annulment of PERB\u2019s determination. Supreme Court granted the Association\u2019s petition in its entirety. The Appellate Division subsequently reversed Supreme Court\u2019s judgment on the law, and dismissed the petition. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a authorizes municipalities to make initial determinations about a firefighter\u2019s eligibility for benefits, and this authority is not a mandatory subject of collective bargaining <em>(see Matter of Schenectady Police Benevolent Assn. v New York State Pub. Empl. Relations Bd., </em>85 NY2d 480 [1995]). A demand for a review procedure to contest a municipality\u2019s initial determination is, however, mandatorily negotiable <em>(see Matter of City of Watertown v State of N.Y. Pub. Empl. Relations Bd., </em>95 NY2d 73 [2000]). After examining the language in the Association\u2019s proposal in light of these related, established principles, PERB concluded that the disputed demands afforded a firefighter de novo review\u2014in effect, a fresh determination of the claim by an arbitrator\u2014rather than arbitral review of the City\u2019s initial determination, using a procedure and standard of review tailored by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">This appeal presents no question of statutory interpretation. Instead, the issue is whether PERB decided the City\u2019s improper practice charge based upon a reasonable reading of the Association\u2019s proposed contract language. PERB, as the agency charged with interpreting the Civil Service Law, is accorded deference in matters falling within its area of expertise, including the resolution of improper practice charges <em>(see Matter of County of Nassau [Nassau Community Coll.] v New York State Pub. Empl. Relations Bd., </em>76 NY2d 579, 585 [1990]). Because these matters are consigned to PERB\u2019s discretion, we may not disturb its determination unless irrational <em>(City of Watertown, </em>95 NY2d at 81).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Here, the proposed language calls for the arbitrator to resolve the firefighter\u2019s claim, not review the City\u2019s initial determination, and to decide all allegations and defenses, including assertions regarding timeliness; contemplates trial-type evidentiary hearings with witnesses; and even assigns burdens of proof according to the type of determination at issue. We therefore find no irrationality in PERB\u2019s conclusion that the disputed demands set forth not a review procedure, but a redetermination procedure in derogation of the City\u2019s nondelegable statutory right to make initial determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and R.S. Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
