Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The issue here is whether a tortfeasor whose liability is determined to be 50% or less can be found responsible for total indemnification of noneconomic loss despite CPLR article 16.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>We hold that a third-party defendant found to have only one ninth of the tortfeasors\u2019 total fault should be responsible for one ninth of the noneconomic loss. The order of the Appellate Division should, therefore, be reversed and remitted to Supreme Court for further proceedings to calculate the portion of the settlement properly allocated to noneconomic loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">On April 12, 1991, Stephen Frank was working at a building site in Clarence, New York, on property owned by the Meadow-lakes Development Corporation. Frank was attempting to carry a large bag of double insulation over his right shoulder up a staircase on the property. The left side of the staircase had no railing and Frank lost his balance and fell. As a result of the fall, Frank received several serious permanent injuries to his back and spine. Frank and his wife commenced an action for personal injury and loss of consortium against Meadowlakes and the general contractor, D.J.H. Enterprises, Inc. Meadow-lakes, in turn, filed a related third-party action for indemnification against Home Insulation and Supply, Inc., Frank\u2019s employer. After a bifurcated trial, the jury apportioned fault in the amount of 10% to Frank, 10% to Home and 80% to D.J.H. The court also directed a verdict against Meadowlakes and D.J.H. based upon a violation of Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">On January 17, 2003, the Franks settled with D.J.H. for $300,000. On January 24, 2003, the Franks settled with Meadowlakes for $1,400,000. Supreme Court then granted Meadow-lakes\u2019 motion for common-law indemnification against Home in the sum of $1,552,160, which included interest on the Franks\u2019 settlement, accruing from January 31, 2003 until February 12, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Home appealed this judgment, arguing that Supreme Court erred (1) in denying its motion for a directed verdict to dismiss the third-party complaint against it because Home was not negligent and, thus, the jury\u2019s 10% allocation of fault to Home should not stand, and (2) in granting Meadowlakes complete indemnification against Home, even if the 10% of fault remained undisturbed, because it should be liable only for its proportionate share of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">The Appellate Division held that Supreme Court properly denied the motion for a directed verdict dismissing the third-party complaint because Home\u2019s contention that there was no basis to allocate fault was without merit. The Court also disagreed with Home\u2019s argument that it should not be required to indemnify Meadowlakes for 100% of the settlement. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>\u201cIt is well settled that \u2018an owner or general contractor who is held strictly liable under Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) is entitled to full indemnification from the party actually responsible for the incident\u2019 <em>(Gillmore v Duke/Fluor Daniel, </em>221 AD2d 938, 939 [1995]). The principles of common-law indemnification allow the party held vicariously liable to shift the entire burden of the loss to the actual wrongdoer. Contrary to Home\u2019s contention, \u2018CPLR article 16 does not limit the owner\u2019s right of indemnification\u2019 because of the savings provision for indemnification claims set forth in CPLR 1602 (2) (ii) <em>(Salamone v Wincaf Props., </em>9 AD3d 127, 129 [2004], <em>lv dismissed </em>4 NY3d 794 [2005])\u201d (20 AD3d 874, 875-876 [2005] [citations omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Two Justices dissented, concluding that Home\u2019s liability should be limited to its proportionate share of fault. The Justices reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">\u201cApplication here of the rule of joint and several liability results in precisely the \u2018evil\u2019 intended to be \u2018suppressed]\u2019 by the enactment of article 16 (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 95)[,] a party whose equitable share of the fault has been adjudged to be but 10% liable is instead held liable for 100% of that loss. That is just the result that the Legislature sought to avoid by the enactment of article 16\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 881).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">We agree with the Appellate Division that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s determination. Therefore the motion for a directed verdict was properly denied. We disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s reasoning concerning complete indemnification. Although CPLR article 16 does not limit the right to indemnification, it does limit the amount that can be recovered when liability is 50% or less.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">\u201cA statute or legislative act is to be construed as a whole, and all parts of an act are to be read and construed together to determine the legislative intent\u201d (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 97). \u201cStatutes will not be construed as to render them ineffective\u201d (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 144). CPLR 1602 (1) provides, in part, that article 16 \u201cshall . . . apply to any claim for contribution or indemnification.\u201d CPLR 1602 (2) (ii) states, \u201cThe hmitations set forth in this article shall . . . not be construed to impair, alter, limit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>modify, enlarge, abrogate or restrict . . . any immunity or right of indemnification available to or conferred upon any defendant for any negligent or wrongful act or omission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">In <em>Salamone v Wincaf Props. </em>(9 AD3d 127 [1st Dept 2004]), the First Department addressed a substantially similar issue of whether a vicariously liable owner was limited in the amount of indemnification he could recover from a party whose proportionate share of fault was 50% or less. The Court found the savings provision in CPLR 1602 (2) (ii) did not limit an owner\u2019s right of indemnification against the partially liable party. The owner argued that CPLR 1602 (2) (ii) prevented its common-law right of indemnification from being limited or abrogated by CPLR article 16. The Court determined that the \u201cplain meaning of the highlighted statutory language (quoting a portion of CPLR 1602 [2] [ii]) appears to be that [the owner\u2019s] common-law right of indemnification against [third-party defendant] should operate just as it would have operated had CPLR article 16 never been enacted\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 135). It further reasoned that \u201cconstruing CPLR 1602 (2) (ii) to leave indemnification claims unaffected by the limitations of CPLR article 16 serves to shift liability from nonculpable to culpable parties, consistent with the general intent of the article as a whole, and, presumably, the specific intent behind CPLR 1602 (2) (ii)\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 138). The <em>Salamone </em>court saw an inconsistency between the opening clause of CPLR 1602 (1) and CPLR 1602 (2) (ii). The Court viewed CPLR 1602 (2) (ii) as the Legislature\u2019s paramount intention and CPLR 1602 (1) as a subordinate provision which furthered article 16\u2019s purpose in no discernable way. The <em>Salamone </em>court and the Appellate Division here concluded that there was an irreconcilable conflict between CPLR 1602 (1) and 1602 (2) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">\u201cThe legislative intent is to be ascertained from the words and language used, and the statutory language is generally construed according to its natural and most obvious sense, without resorting to an artificial or forced construction\u201d (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 94). It is clear that the Legislature wanted article 16\u2019s protections to apply to indemnification actions <em>(see </em>CPLR 1602 [1]). The purpose of article 16 was to place the risk of a principally-at-fault but impecunious defendant on those seeking recovery and not on a low-fault, deep pocket defendant <em>(see Rangolan v County of Nassau, </em>96 NY2d 42, 48 [2001] [\u201cTo construe 1602 (2) (iv) as an exception to apportionment would defeat the legislative goal of benefitting low-fault, \u2018deep pocket\u2019 defendants\u201d]; Insuring Our Future, Report of the Governor\u2019s Advisory Commission on Li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>ability Insurance, at 131 [Apr. 7, 1986] [\u201c(I)t is fundamentally unfair to require a defendant to pay a greater share of an award than corresponds to that defendant\u2019s adjudged share of the fault that caused the injury\u201d]). The <em>Salamone </em>decision ignores the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting article 16 in response to the rising costs of liability insurance \u201cto assure that no defendant who is assigned a minor degree of fault can be forced to pay an amount grossly out of proportion to that assignment\u201d (Insuring Our Future, Report of the Governor\u2019s Advisory Commission on Liability Insurance, at 132).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">In our view, there is no irreconcilable conflict between CPLR 1602 (1) and 1602 (2) (ii). In <em>Rangolan v County of Nassau </em>(96 NY2d 42 [2001]), this Court held that CPLR 1602 (2) (iv) did not preclude apportionment when a defendant\u2019s liability arose from a nondelegable duty because the subsection was a savings provision and not an exception. We stated that CPLR 1602 (2) (iv) \u201censures that a defendant is liable to the same extent as its delegate or employee, and that CPLR article 16 is not construed to alter this liability\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 47). CPLR 1602 (2) (ii) is, likewise, a savings provision intended to ensure the courts do not read article 16 as altering or limiting the preexisting right of indemnification. This does not, however, entitle a party to 100% recovery. Therefore, though Meadowlakes retained its right to indemnification, Home, as a party found 10% liable, was limited to its proportionate share with respect to noneconomic damages. To calculate Home\u2019s share, we divide indemnity among potential indemnitors and exclude Frank\u2019s 10% share of fault since he cannot be an indemnitor <em>(see </em>Weinstein-Kom-Miller, NY Civ Prac H 1601.01). Home\u2019s total indemnity to Meadowlakes will, therefore, be all economic loss and one ninth of noneconomic loss encompassed within the settlement, with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Defendant\u2019s remaining arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, without costs, by remitting to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo, Read and R.S. Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b765-7\"> This action was commenced in 1992, before the 1996 amendment to Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11, and thus Meadowlakes\u2019 right to indemnification is not affected by the amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
