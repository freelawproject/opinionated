On appeal, Mr. Stevenson challenges many of the circuit court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions. We find no error in any of the circuit court\u2019s rulings, hold that the evidence was sufficient, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">At about 2:30 p.m. on April 23, 2012, Noi Sipayboun was found dead by her sister Sonmai Sipayboun (\u201cSister\u201d) in the bathtub at a home she owned with Mr. Stevenson at 5406 Hillburn Avenue in Baltimore City. Ms. Sipayboun had sustained three stab wounds and 13 cutting wounds and also had \u201cinjuries to the vagina and on the anus which ... consisted of multiple bruises and tears and scratches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">At the time of Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s death, she and Mr. Stevenson had been romantically involved for thirteen years. The two were never married, but Mr. Stevenson was the beneficiary of a life insurance policy insuring Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s life. They had lived together for some time at 4425 Powell Avenue in Baltimore City with Sister and her two sons, but at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>of her death, Ms. Sipayboun was in the process of moving with the children to 5406 Hillburn Avenue, where she and Mr. Stevenson had lived previously. According to Sister, this was prompted by the tension between Ms. Sipayboun and Mr. Stevenson, who was angered by Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s decision to engage in an intimate relationship with another man, James Potter. During the week before Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s death, Sister witnessed multiple violent altercations between Mr. Stevenson and Ms. Sipayboun and Ms. Sipayboun told her that Mr. Stevenson had tried to force her to have sex with him against her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In the morning of the day Ms. Sipayboun was killed, Sister overheard Ms. Sipayboun and Mr. Stevenson arguing. At around noon, Ms. Sipayboun called Sister \u201cand told [her] that [Mr. Stevenson] had called her up and told her that she had to get all her stuff out of [5406 Hillburn Avenue] because the house was under contract and we couldn\u2019t move in there.\u201d As a result, Ms. Sipayboun asked Sister if she would come over and help move her belongings out of the house. After the phone call was finished, Sister was unable to reach Ms. Sipayboun by phone despite trying on several occasions. Sister did not have contact with Ms. Sipayboun again until she found her dead two hours later. Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s cell phone was not with her when she was discovered; police recovered it hours later from a storm drain near the 3500 block of North Point Road in Dundalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Baltimore City Police Detective Eric Ragland became the primary investigator into Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s death. He arrived on the scene at 3:51 p.m. and spoke with Sister and one of Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s neighbors. Detective Ragland determined that Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s injuries were not self-inflicted. He observed that there was no damage to the doors of the house, which suggested that Ms. Sipayboun was familiar with her perpetrator. Sister provided Detective Ragland with Mr. Stevenson\u2019s cell phone number, and Detective Ragland promptly enlisted the assistance of another detective to attempt to locate Mr. Stevenson.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Mr. Stevenson was eventually located and taken to police headquarters, where the police took pictures of his body as part of the investigation, including his swollen right hand. Detective Ragland also went to the store where Mr. Stevenson worked and determined that on the day that Ms. Sipayboun was killed, Mr. Stevenson arrived at work just before 8:00 a.m. and departed at 12:13 p.m., even though he had been scheduled to work from 5:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on that date. In Detective Ragland\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he evidence pointed to [Mr. Stevenson]\u201d as the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">During the investigation, Baltimore City Police Detective John Jendrek obtained \u201ccall detail records\u201d for cell phones belonging to Mr. Stevenson, Ms. Sipayboun, and Sister. Based on his analysis of these records, Detective Jendrek determined that Mr. Stevenson\u2019s cell phone was located in the area of Hillburn Avenue, in close proximity to where Ms. Sipayboun was killed, between 1:30 p.m. and 2:45 p.m. on the day of the murder. In addition, Mr. Stevenson\u2019s cell phone was located in close proximity to North Point Road in Dundalk at 3:19 p.m., where Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s cell phone was found by police.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">According to Mr. Stevenson, he left the Royal Farms store where he worked at around noon on the day Ms. Sipayboun was killed to drop off supplies to another Royal Farms store. While away from work, Mr. Stevenson went home and took a shower before going to the area of Golden Ring Mall to get a cake for his son\u2019s birthday. Mr. Stevenson stated emphatically that he did not go to 5406 Hillburn Avenue on that day and was not responsible for Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Mr. Stevenson was charged on June 28, 2012 with Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s murder and a number of other offenses. At the conclusion of an eight-day jury trial, Mr. Stevenson was convicted of first-degree murder, first-degree sexual offense, and two deadly-weapon counts. He noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Mr. Stevenson argues that the circuit court erred in several evidentiary rulings and asserts that there was insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>evidence to support his convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">A. The Circuit Court Did Not Err By Admitting Cellular Tower \u201cPing\u201d Evidence Without A <em>Frye-Reed </em>Hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">At trial, Detective Jendrek was qualified as an expert in the fields of cell phone \u201ccertification, detail analysis, mapping and location.\u201d He testified that he had reviewed the \u201ccall detail records\u201d for cell phones belonging to Mr. Stevenson, Ms. Sipayboun, and Sister and determined that Mr. Stevenson\u2019s cell phone had registered with a cell phone tower located near Hillburn Avenue from 1:40 p.m. to 2:45 p.m. on the date Ms. Sipayboun was killed. In other words, Detective Jendrek testified that Mr. Stevenson\u2019s cell phone was in the area where Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s body was found during the time she was killed. He testified further that Mr. Stevenson\u2019s cell phone registered with a cell phone tower near North Point Road in Dundalk at 3:19 p.m. that same day, which was in close proximity to where Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s cell phone was found by police later that day. In explaining how he was able to determine the cell phone tower with which Mr. Stevenson\u2019s cell phone had registered, Detective Jendrek testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>determined which \u201ccell site ... provided the cleanest, strongest available signal and as a general rule that is the cell site that\u2019s the closest to the cell [phone].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Before trial, Mr. Stevenson made a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude Detective Jendrek\u2019s testimony because, in his view, it was not generally accepted in the scientific community \u201cthat the location of a single cellular tower can accurately locate [a] cellular phone.\u201d Mr. Stevenson argued that the circuit court was required to conduct a <em>Frye/Reed </em>hearing to determine whether the technique the Detective employed to determine the location of his cell phone was generally accepted in the scientific community. In response, the circuit court found that \u201cI\u2019m not sure this is a <em>Frye/Reed </em>issue or that you\u2019ve established it as a <em>Frye/Reed </em>[issue] simply by saying so,\u201d and decided not to conduct a <em>Frye/Reed </em>hearing because Mr. Stevenson was not offering an expert who could dispute the acceptance of the Detective\u2019s technique. Detective Jendrek\u2019s testimony was admitted at trial over objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In his brief, Mr. Stevenson contends that \u201cthe trial court erred by not conducting a <em>Frye/Reed </em>hearing to test the prosecutor\u2019s theory that a target cell phone can be located by the use of data identifying cell phone towers used during communication.\u201d The State counters that a <em>Frye/Reed </em>hearing was unnecessary because \u201ccell phone location evidence is not novel scientific evidence.\u201d We agree and hold that the circuit court did not err in declining to hold a <em>Frye/Reed </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Maryland Rule 5-702 governs the admissibility of expert witness testimony and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">Expert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><em>Id. \u201cA </em>trial judge has wide latitude in determining whether expert testimony is sufficiently reliable to be admitted into evidence, and his sound discretion will not be disturbed on appeal unless the decision to admit the expert testimony was clearly erroneous or constituted an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Montgomery Mut. Ins. Co. v. Chesson, </em>399 Md. 314, 327, 923 A.2d 939 (2007) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">With regard to the admissibility of expert testimony regarding scientific evidence in particular,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">Maryland adheres to the standard set forth in <em>Frye v. United States, </em>293 F. 1013 (D.C.Cir.1923), for determining the admissibility of scientific evidence and expert scientific testimony. <em>Reed v. State, </em>283 Md. 374, 389 [391 A.2d 364] (1978) (adopting the <em>Frye </em>standard). Under the <em>Frye-Reed </em>test, a party must establish first that any novel scientific method is reliable and accepted generally in the scientific community before the court will admit expert testimony based upon the application of the questioned scientific technique. <em>Wilson v. State, </em>370 Md. 191, 201 [803 A.2d 1034] (2002). A trial court may take judicial notice of the reliability of scientific techniques and methodologies that are widely accepted within the scientific community. <em>Reed, </em>283 Md. at 380 [391 A.2d 364]. A trial court also may take notice that certain scientific theories are viewed as unreliable, bogus, or experimental. <em>Id. </em>However, when it is unclear whether the scientific community accepts the validity of a novel scientific theory or methodology, we have noted that before testimony based on the questioned technique may be admitted into evidence, the reliability must be demonstrated. <em>Wilson, </em>370 Md. at 201 [803 A.2d 1034]. While the most common practice will include witness testimony, a court may take judicial notice of journal articles from reliable sources and other publications which may shed light on the degree of acceptance <em>vel non </em>by recognized experts of a particular process or view. <em>Reed, </em>283 Md. at 380 [391 A.2d 364], The opinion of an \u201cexpert\u201d witness should be admitted only if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>court finds that \u201cthe basis of the opinion is generally accepted as reliable within the expert\u2019s particular scientific field.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>370 Md. at 201 [803 A.2d 1034].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Mr. Stevenson argues that the circuit court abused its discretion in declining to hold a <em>Frye/Reed </em>hearing to determine whether the cell phone location technique employed by Detective Jendrek was generally accepted in the scientific community. But he offered no evidence or argument, in the circuit court or here, to support the contention that the technique employed by Detective Jendrek was \u201cnovel\u201d or not generally accepted. He simply asserts that Detective Jen-drek\u2019s testimony \u201cshould not have been admitted because it did not meet the standard applicable to expert testimony commonly referred to as the <em>Frye/Reed </em>standard\u201d without providing any supporting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Although it is true that a witness using telephone call detail data to locate someone must be qualified as an expert, <em>see State v. Payne &amp; Bond, </em>440 Md. 680, 104 A.3d 142 (2014), that does not mean that there is any dispute about the general acceptance of the underlying techniques. The <em>Frye/Reed </em>standard is only applicable to determinations of the admissibility of <em>novel </em>scientific evidence. <em>See Aventis Pasteur, Inc. v. Skevofilax, </em>396 Md. 405, 431 n. 18, 914 A.2d 113 (2007) (\u201cThe <em>[.Frye/Reed </em>] standard continues to be the standard by which Maryland trial courts determine the admissibility of <em>novel </em>scientific evidence.\u201d (citation omitted) (emphasis added)); <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v. Miller, </em>159 Md.App. 123, 186-87, 858 A.2d 1025 (2004) (\u201cIt is only with respect to <em>new and novel </em>scientific techniques that a <em>[Frye/Reed </em>] assessment must be made ... What is contemplated [by <em>Frye/Reed </em>] are <em>new, and arguably questionable, </em>techniques such as lie detector tests, breathalyzer tests, paraffin tests, DNA identification, voiceprint identification, as in the <em>Reed </em>case itself, and the use of polarized light microscopy to identify asbestos fibers.\u201d (emphasis added)). The cell phone location evidence at issue here is not <em>novel </em>scientific evidence, so <em>Frye/Reed </em>is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Our decision in <em>Wilder v. State, </em>191 Md.App. 819, 991 A.2d 172 (2010), is instructive on this point. In that case, we were asked to determine whether cell phone location evidence required the presentation of expert testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 847, 991 A.2d 172. Although the issue of whether a <em>Frye/Reed </em>hearing was required to admit such evidence was not specifically before us, \u201c[w]e recognize[d] that cellular telephone technology has become generally understood [and] the use of telephone company cell phone records for investigative purposes has been noted in Maryland cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 991 A.2d 172 (citations omitted). We even went so far as to endorse a procedure for admitting cell phone location evidence: \u201c[W]e believe that the better approach [for admitting cell phone location evidence] is to require the prosecution to offer expert testimony to explain the functions of cell phone towers, derivative tracking, and the techniques of locating and/or plotting the origins of cell phone calls using cell phone records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365, 991 A.2d 172; <em>see also Coleman-Fuller v. State, </em>192 Md.App. 577, 619, 995 A.2d 985 (2010) (\u201c[Cell phone location] evidence may only be introduced through a witness qualified as an expert.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">That is precisely how the State offered cell phone location evidence against Mr. Stevenson. Moreover, \u201cthe use of cell phone location records to determine the general location of a cell phone has been widely accepted by numerous federal courts.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>918 F.Supp.2d 1, 5 (D.D.C. 2013) (citations omitted). In the absence of any evidence that that the cell phone location technique employed by Detective Jendrek was not generally accepted in the scientific community, <em>Chesson, </em>399 Md. at 327, 923 A.2d 939 (\u201c[T]he most common practice [for a <em>Frye/Reed </em>hearing] will include <em>witness </em>testimony.\u201d (emphasis added)), the circuit court did not err in declining to conduct a <em>Frye/Reed </em>hearing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">B. The Circuit Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In Qualifying Detective Jendrek As An Expert Witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">During trial, the State called Detective Jendrek as a witness and sought to have him qualified as an expert in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>area of \u201ccall detail record analysis, call detail interpretation and cell site mapping.\u201d He testified that for the last five years, he had been assigned to the Advanced Technology Team, \u201cthe unit that handles \u2014 assists any detective or detective unit that needs help with cell phone information, be it obtaining the records from the provider or finding cell phones.\u201d He testified that during his time with the Advanced Technology Team, and during a previous stint with the DEA, he had received an extensive amount of training regarding cell phones and call detail records. Detective Jendrek attended several courses regarding call detail records, which \u201cincluded two separate classes that were related directly to mapping of cell site and call detail record interpretation and analysis.\u201d From 2009 to the time of trial, Detective Jendrek was invited to teach numerous classes about call detail record analysis. And significantly, he testified that he had worked on 1,500 cases involving cell phone location. Based on this testimony, the circuit court, over objection, accepted Detective Jendrek as an expert in the field of cell phone location:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">The Court upon review of the testimony and <em>voir dire </em>of the witness, based on his background, training and experience, his teaching, as well as his practical experience, the Court accepts the witness as an expert in the area and will allow him to testify in the area of cellular detail certification, detail analysis, mapping and location.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Mr. Stevenson argues that the circuit court erred in qualifying Detective Jendrek as an expert witness. In his view, Detective Jendrek should not have been qualified as an expert witness because (1) the Detective \u201chad not studied telecommunications or network engineering in college[,] [rjather, his undergraduate degree was in history;\u201d (2) \u201c[h]e had not published any articles involving the subjects for which he was offered as an expert;\u201d and (3) \u201c[ajll of his experience was related to law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Md. Rule 5-702 directed the circuit court, in determining whether to admit expert witness testimony, to determine \u201cwhether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>edge, skill, experience, training, or education.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt is well settled in Maryland that Rule 5-702 vests trial judges with wide latitude in deciding whether to qualify a witness as an expert or to admit or exclude particular expert testimony.\u201d <em>Massie v. State, </em>349 Md. 834, 850-51, 709 A.2d 1316 (1998) (citations omitted). \u201cThe admissibility of expert testimony is within the discretion of the trial court, and therefore, the circuit court\u2019s decision to admit expert testimony \u2018will seldom constitute a ground for reversal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Donati v. State, </em>215 Md. App. 686, 742, 84 A.3d 156 <em>cert. denied, </em>438 Md. 143, 91 A.3d 614 (2014) (quoting <em>Bryant v. State, </em>393 Md. 196, 203, 900 A.2d 227 (2006)). \u201cThe trial court is free to consider any aspect of a witness\u2019s background in determining whether the witness is sufficiently familiar with the subject to render an expert opinion, including the witness\u2019s formal education, professional training, personal observations, and actual experience.\u201d <em>Massie, </em>349 Md. at 851, 709 A.2d 1316 (citations omitted). And \u201c[t]o qualify as an expert, one need only possess such skill, knowledge, or experience in that field or calling as to make it appear that [the] opinion or inference will probably aid the trier [of fact] in his search for the truth.\u201d <em>Donati, </em>215 Md.App. at 742, 84 A.3d 156 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">We find no abuse of discretion in the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that Detective Jendrek qualified as an expert through his experience, training, and education. The Detective described his extensive first-hand training and experience in analyzing cell phone call detail data, including: (1) training related to cell phones and call detail records from DEA and the Baltimore Police Department; (2) several courses, including a 40-hour course taught by the National Technical Investigators\u2019 Association; (3) lectures he had given regarding cell phone location techniques; and (4) 1,500 cases worth of direct experience. Although Detective Jendrek\u2019s undergraduate degree was in history and he had not published any articles involving cell phone location, \u201cthe qualifications he did have supported the circuit court\u2019s decision to accept him as an expert witness,\u201d <em>Donati, </em>215 Md.App. at 743, 84 A.3d 156 and amply so.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>C. The Circuit Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In Qualifying Detective Allen As An Expert Witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The State also called Baltimore City Police Detective Kevin Allen and sought to have him qualified as an expert witness in the field of digital forensics. Detective Allen testified that (1) he had 20 years of police experience; (2) had worked in the field of cell phone forensics specifically from 2009 to 2013; (3) had taken classes and received certifications \u201c[w]ith the Department of Homeland Security and Mobile Device Investigations, CMD Labs, which is a certification for Cellebrite National White Collar Crimes Association, NW3C, BK Forensics for digital mobile seizure, Image Scan, which is with the FBI, and a host of other training;\u201d (4) had been qualified as an expert witness in the field of digital forensics on a prior occasion; and (5) had analyzed over 1,000 cell phones. Over objection, the circuit court qualified Detective Allen as an expert in the field of digital forensics, and he testified that he had extracted data from Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s cell phone and, utilizing computer software, generated a report revealing the data stored on the cell phone. The report was later admitted into evidence by the State and used to adduce testimony from other witnesses about messages they had sent her.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Mr. Stevenson claims that the circuit court abused its discretion in qualifying Detective Allen as an expert because \u201cDetective Allen had not received any degrees in the fields of telecommunications, network technology, electronics or radio frequency; his training was limited to mobile devices; he had been qualified as an expert witness only once before the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">We recently affirmed a circuit court\u2019s decision to qualify a witness with similar credentials as an expert in the field of digital forensics in <em>Donati, </em>215 Md.App. at 741-43, 84 A.3d 156. As here, the witness\u2019s experience in that case primarily took the form of on-the-job training and experience:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">Detective Heverly testified that he had completed more than 240 hours of training in computer forensics, as a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>of which he had been \u201ccertified by the Department of Defense as a computer forensic examiner.\u201d He was a member of the \u201cNational White Collar Crime Center,\u201d the \u201cInternational Association of Computer Investigative Specialists,\u201d the Department of Defense \u201cCyber Investigative Training Academy,\u201d and he was a deputized member of the \u201cUnited States Secret Service, Washington Metro Electronic Crimes Task Force.\u201d In addition, he took a Windows Forensic Examinations course and a mobile forensic examination course for cell phones, GPS, and other mobile devices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 742-43, 84 A.3d 156. We held that \u201c[although [he] did not have post-graduate degrees in computer science, and he had not testified previously, the qualifications he did have supported the circuit court\u2019s decision to accept him as an expert witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 743, 84 A.3d 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Detective Allen has taken classes and received multiple certifications in the field of digital forensics. <em>Id. </em>In addition, and unlike the witness in <em>Donati, </em>Detective Allen had been qualified as an expert witness in the field of digital forensics on a prior occasion, <em>id. </em>at 743, 84 A.3d 156 and had analyzed over 1,000 cell phones. His lack of degrees in the fields of telecommunications did not disqualify him from serving as an expert, and the court acted within his discretion in qualifying him here.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">D. Mr. Stevenson Failed To Preserve His Contention That The Circuit Court Erroneously Admitted Inadmissible Hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">At trial, Lashawn Stevenson, Mr. Stevenson\u2019s niece, was called to testify on behalf of the State. During the State\u2019s direct examination of Ms. Stevenson, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay.

Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Mr. Stevenson argues that the circuit court erred in allowing Ms. Stevenson to testify that her father, Mr. Stevenson\u2019s brother, had told her that Ms. Sipayboun had been cut, which he says is inadmissible hearsay. The State counters that Mr. Stevenson failed to preserve his objection for appellate review because Mr. Stevenson objected only on the grounds that the prosecutor was harassing the witness. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Objections to the admissibility of evidence are governed by Maryland Rule 4-323, which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">(a) An objection to the admission of evidence shall be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent. Otherwise, the objection is waived. The grounds for the objection need not be stated unless the court, at the request of a party or on its own initiative, so directs. The court shall rule upon the objection promptly. When the relevancy of evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court may admit the evidence subject to the introduction of additional evidence sufficient to support a finding of the fulfillment of the condition. The objection is waived unless, at some time before final argument in a jury trial or before the entry of judgment in a court trial, the objecting party moves to strike the evidence on the ground that the condition was not fulfilled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-9\"><em>Id. </em>\u201cUnless a party properly raises an objection [to the admissibility of evidence] with the trial court, any error is deemed waived and ordinarily will not be considered on appeal.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Litzenberg, </em>115 Md.App. 549, 568, 694 A.2d 150 (1997) (citations omitted); <em>see also </em>Md.

With respect to the preservation of an objection to the admissibility of evidence, we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">Generally, Maryland litigants are not required to state the specific ground for an objection unless requested to do so by the trial court. Consequently, if a court overrules an objection, all grounds for the objection may be raised on appeal. On the other hand, counsel may state with particularity the grounds for an objection, either voluntarily or at the trial judge\u2019s request. If counsel provides the trial judge with specific grounds for an objection, the litigant may raise on appeal only those grounds actually presented to the trial judge. <em>All other grounds for the objection, including those appearing for the first time in a party\u2019s appellate brief, are deemed waived.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 569, 694 A.2d 150 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Here, as he acknowledges in his brief, Mr. Stevenson objected to the admissibility of Ms. Stevenson\u2019s testimony specifically on the grounds that the prosecutor was harassing Ms. Stevenson and that Ms. Stevenson had been asked the same question twice. Mr. Stevenson did not object to Ms. Stevenson\u2019s testimony as hearsay. That leaves any hearsay objection unasserted at trial and unpreserved for appeal. <em>See Banks v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 582, 588, 581 A.2d 439 (1990) (\u201cAlthough not required, when the grounds for an objection are stated by the objecting party, either on a volunteered basis or at the request of the court, only those specifically stated are preserved for appellate review; those not stated are deemed waived.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">E. The Circuit Court Did Not Err In Admitting Photographs of Mir. Stevenson\u2019s Hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">After Mr. Stevenson was taken to police headquarters the day Ms. Sipayboun was killed, police took photographs of his hand and torso. On the first day of trial, Mr. Stevenson moved to suppress these photographs. Although it initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>denied the motion, the circuit court ultimately prohibited the State from using photographs of Mr. Stevenson\u2019s torso, but permitted the State to use photographs of Mr. Stevenson\u2019s hands. Mr. Stevenson contends that the circuit court erred in allowing the State to use even these because, he says, their probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The State counters that the photographs were probative to the issue of Mr. Stevenson\u2019s alleged criminal agency and therefore admissible. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Maryland Rule 5-408 provides that relevant \u201cevidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Ayala v. State, </em>174 Md.App. 647, 923 A.2d 952 (2007), we set forth the general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">[T]he general rule regarding admission of photographs is that their prejudicial effect must not substantially outweigh their probative value. This balancing of probative value against prejudicial effect is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge. The trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed unless \u2018plainly arbitrary,\u2019 ... because the trial judge is in the best position to make this assessment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">Photographs must also be relevant to be admissible ... The relevancy determination is also committed to the trial judge\u2019s discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 679-80, 923 A.2d 952 (quoting <em>State v. Broberg, </em>342 Md. 544, 552, 677 A.2d 602 (1996)). In addition, \u201cphotographs may be relevant and possess probative value even though they often illustrate something that has already been presented in testimony.\u201d <em>Lovelace v. State, </em>214 Md.App. 512, 548-49, 78 A.3d 449 (2013) (quoting <em>Broberg, </em>342 Md. at 553, 677 A.2d 602). \u201cOn review, we will not disturb a trial court\u2019s determination that the probative value of a photograph is not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice \u2018unless plainly arbitrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549, 78 A.3d 449 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>These photographs, which were taken by police only hours after Ms. Sipayboun was killed, had substantial probative value, and Mr. Stevenson acknowledges as much. In his brief, he admits, correctly, that they \u201cadvanced the prosecution\u2019s theory that [Mr. Stevenson] had an injury to his hand, therefore [suggesting], he may have been involved in the fatal struggle with [Ms. Sipayboun].\u201d They also corroborate testimony that the State adduced from Detective Ragland, who indicated that Mr. Stevenson\u2019s right hand was swollen when he encountered him hours after Ms. Sipayboun was killed. No other photographs showed Mr. Stevenson\u2019s hands during the relevant time frame. And aside from being helpful to the State\u2019s case, Mr. Stevenson does not explain in what way the photographs were <em>unfairly </em>prejudicial. <em>See id. </em>at 547, 550, 677 A.2d 602 (holding that circuit court did not abuse its discretion in admitting a photograph depicting a murder victim with a young female family member because it demonstrated that the victim was wearing a gold chain that was later recovered from the defendant and \u201c[n]o other photograph showed [the victim\u2019s] face with the necklace\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">F. The Circuit Court Did Not Err In Admitting Testimony Establishing That Mr. Stevenson Initially Refused To Give A DNA Sample To Police.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">During the State\u2019s direct examination of Detective Ragland at trial, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"au-dedup-0\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did you have a warrant for [Mr. Stevenson\u2019s] DNA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">[DETECTIVE RAGLAND]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: And what, if anything, happened during the attempt to recover his DNA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: During the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-11\">[THE COURT]: Sustained. Sustained. You want to approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-13\">[THE COURT]: Then you have to ask.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>(Counsel and Defendant approached the bench, and the following occurred:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, it is the State\u2019s position that the Defendant\u2019s hesitancy to \u2014 about giving his DNA sample, goes to consciousness of guilt and therefore I believe that it is pertinent and relevant in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\"><em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">[THE COURT]: I\u2019m going to overrule. If it is what I just heard, I\u2019ll allow it \u2014 what I\u2019ve just heard. But I \u2014 let\u2019s move along.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">(Counsel and Defendant returned to the trial tables, and the following occurred in open court:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">[THE COURT]: Be mindful of the question and I\u2019m going to overrule. I\u2019ll allow the question based on the proffered statement of the State. Ladies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: What, if anything, occurred during the recovery of the sample of Mr. Stevenson\u2019s DNA? [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection for the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">[THE COURT]: Objection noted. Overruled. You may answer. Briefly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-12\">[DETECTIVE RAGLAND]: He refused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did he eventually give his DNA? [DETECTIVE RAGLAND]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: And what, if anything, transpired between his initial refusal and his giving DNA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-15\">[DETECTIVE RAGLAND]: I had to get a supervisor to reiterate that this was a Court order for him to give the DNA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-16\">Mr. Stevenson contends that the circuit court erred in allowing Detective Ragland to give this testimony. In response, the State argues that the circuit court properly admitted the testimony as evidence of Mr. Stevenson\u2019s consciousness of guilt. Again, we agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>A person\u2019s behavior after a crime can qualify as circumstantial evidence, or lead to reasonable inferences, that he is conscious of his guilt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">A person\u2019s behavior after the commission of a crime may be admissible as circumstantial evidence from which guilt may be inferred. This category of circumstantial evidence is referred to as \u2018consciousness of guilt.\u2019 We observed in <em>Snyder v. State, </em>361 Md. 580, 591 [762 A.2d 125] (2000), that \u201c[i]f relevant, circumstantial evidence regarding a defendant\u2019s conduct may be admissible under Md. Rule 5-403, not as conclusive evidence of guilt, but as a circumstance tending to show a consciousness of guilt.\u201d Conduct typically argued to show consciousness of guilt includes flight after a crime, escape from confinement, use of a false name, and destruction or concealment of evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">A person\u2019s post-crime behavior often is considered relevant to the question of guilt because the particular behavior provides clues to the person\u2019s state of mind. The reason why a person\u2019s post-crime state of mind may be relevant is because, as Professor Wigmore suggested, the commission of a crime can be expected to leave some mental traces on the criminal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\"><em>Thomas v. State, </em>397 Md. 557, 575-76, 919 A.2d 49 (2007) (citations omitted). A defendant\u2019s resistance to submit to a police-administered blood test as evidence of consciousness of guilt can fall into this category:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">The relevance of the evidence as circumstantial evidence of ... guilt depends on whether the following four inferences can be drawn: (1) from [the] resistance to the blood test, a desire to conceal evidence; (2) from a desire to conceal evidence, a consciousness of guilt; (3) from a consciousness of guilt, a consciousness of guilt of the murder ...; and (4) from a consciousness of guilt of the murderf,] ... actual guilt of the murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">To be relevant, it is not necessary that evidence of this nature conclusively establish guilt. The proper inquiry is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>whether the evidence could support an inference that the defendant\u2019s conduct demonstrates a consciousness of guilt. If so, the evidence is relevant and generally admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeR\"><em>Id. </em>at 576-77, 919 A.2d 49 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Detective Ragland testified that when he initially attempted to recover Mr. Stevenson\u2019s DNA pursuant to a search warrant and as part of the police\u2019s investigation into Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s murder, Mr. Stevenson refused. He further testified that Mr. Stevenson only agreed to provide his DNA after his supervisor informed Mr. Stevenson that his compliance was required by a court order. Mr. Stevenson claims that the circuit court erred in admitting Detective Ragland\u2019s testimony because \u201c[o]nce he was fully informed about the legal authority of the police to obtain the [DNA] sample, [he] cooperated.\u201d In his view, \u201chis initial hesitancy or resistance cannot be connected to consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged\u201d because there was another explanation for his behavior: that he was merely \u201casking about his constitutional rights to counsel and whether or not he could see the warrant and whether or not he had to produce same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The Court of Appeals has rejected the distinction Mr. Stevenson tries to make here. In <em>Thomas, </em>397 Md. 557, 919 A.2d 49, the defendant argued that the circuit court erred in admitting testimony indicating that he resisted a police-administered blood test during a murder investigation because \u201cnumerous other factors could have explained his reluctance to submit to the testing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577, 919 A.2d 49. The Court of Appeals found this argument unconvincing, and said that it is up to the defendant to offer an alternative explanation for his resistance, not the State\u2019s burden to prove that there isn\u2019t one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADd\">Simply because there is a possibility that there exists some innocent, or alternate, explanation for the conduct does not mean that the proffered evidence is <em>per se </em>inadmissible. If it was the position of petitioner that he feared needles, or that the drawing of blood violated some religious belief he held, or any other innocent explanation for his conduct, it was incumbent upon him to generate that issue. He had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the opportunity at trial to offer alternative theories explaining his resistance to the blood test, and the record is completely devoid of any such evidence. The State is not required to anticipate any or all conceivable innocent explanations for a party\u2019s refusal to submit to a blood test, and its failure to do so is not a basis to exclude the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoF\"><em>Id. </em>at 578, 919 A.2d 49 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Similarly, to the extent Mr. Stevenson is suggesting that his initial refusal to provide a DNA sample to police during Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s murder investigation was due to his concern for his constitutional rights, \u201cit was incumbent upon him to generate that issue\u201d at trial. <em>Id. </em>Like the defendant in <em>Thomas, </em>Mr. Stevenson \u201chad the opportunity at trial to offer alternative theories explaining his resistance to [submitting a DNA sample], and the record is completely devoid of any such evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, Mr. Stevenson does not dispute that he knew that Detective Ragland wanted to take a DNA sample as part of his investigation. We see no abuse of the circuit court\u2019s discretion in its decision to admit this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">G. The Circuit Court Did Not Err In Admitting Evidence Indicating That Mr. Stevenson Was Physically Abusive To Ms. Sipayboun Less Than A Month Before She Was Killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Mr. Stevenson claims next that the circuit court erred in admitting evidence of \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts\u201d in violation of Maryland Rule 5-404(b), specifically Sister\u2019s testimony that he physically abused Ms. Sipayboun less than a month before she was killed. Before trial, Mr. Stevenson argued that this testimony would be inadmissible because he \u201chad not been convicted of any offenses and [Ms. Sipayboun] had not reported any incidents of violence to law enforcement officers.\u201d The State countered that it had a strong factual basis for the evidence it sought to admit, noting that Sister \u201cactually lived with Mr. Shawn Stevenson and [Ms. Sipayboun] and she was able to observe several of the fights between [Mr.] Stevenson and [Ms. Sipayboun].\u201d The circuit court denied the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Well, the motion is denied based on the facts and circumstances of the assertions, the dates and times, the type of abuse that\u2019s being suggested and the relevant time area in close proximity to the crime in question. Therefore, the Court does find it to be relevant information subject to cross-examination as to credibility and the extent thereof and the motion is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">During the trial, the State elicited testimony from Sister that (1) she witnessed arguments between Mr. Stevenson and Ms. Sipayboun less than a week before Ms. Sipayboun was killed; (2) Ms. Sipayboun had told her that Mr. Stevenson had tried to force her to have sex with him against her will; and (3) two weeks before she was killed, Ms. Sipayboun had a slap mark on her face and a knot on her chin. This testimony was corroborated by Mr. Potter, who testified that he saw a bruise on Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s face two weeks before she was killed and that she had told him that Mr. Stevenson had punched her in the face and was abusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Mr. Stevenson contends that the circuit court admitted this testimony in violation of Md. Rule 5 \u2014 404(b). The Rule directs courts to look at whether there is special relevance to the testimony and then, if so, to balance that enhanced probativity against the possibility of unfair prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">Maryland Rule 5-404(b) limits evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior \u201cbad act[s],\u201d and specifically precludes bad acts evidence offered for the purpose of proving that the defendant\u2019s character \u201cin order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Md. Rule 5 \u2014 404(b); <em>Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 546 [735 A.2d 1061] (1999). A \u201cbad act\u201d is an act or conduct \u201cthat tends to impugn or reflect adversely upon one\u2019s character, taking into consideration the facts of the underlying lawsuit.\u201d <em>Klauenberg, </em>355 Md. at 549 [735 A.2d 1061]. This rule plays a role similar to the prohibition against unfairly prejudicial evidence, <em>i.e., </em>to prevent the jury from \u201c \u2018developing a predisposition of guilt\u2019 \u201d based on unrelated conduct of the defendant. <em>Sinclair v. State, </em>214 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Md.App. 309, 334 [76 A.3d 442] (2013) (quoting <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 633 [552 A.2d 896] (1989)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2p\">Although \u201cbad act\u201d evidence is inadmissible to prove a defendant\u2019s criminal character, Rule 5-404(b) does allow \u201cbad act\u201d evidence that has \u201cspecial relevance \u2014 that it \u2018is substantially relevant to some contested issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wynn v. State, </em>351 Md. 307, 316 [718 A.2d 588] (1998) (quoting <em>State v. Taylor, </em>347 Md. 363, 368 [701 A.2d 389] (1997)). \u201cBad act\u201d evidence has a \u201cspecial relevance if it shows notice, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>Md. Rule 5M:04(b). Whether \u201cbad act\u201d evidence demonstrates one of these alternate purposes is a \u201c \u2018legal determination and does not involve any exercise of discretion\u2019 \u201d by the trial court; we review this determination <em>de novo. Wynn, </em>351 Md. at 317 [718 A.2d 588] (quoting <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634 [552 A.2d 896]).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">This leads to a two-step analysis. If we determine that the \u201cbad act\u201d evidence in question has special relevance, then we balance the probative value of and need for the evidence against the likelihood of undue prejudice. \u201c \u2018This segment of the analysis implicates the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion,\u2019 \u201d and we will only reverse the court\u2019s balancing determination if the court abused its discretion. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634-35 [552 A.2d 896]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\"><em>Smith v.

Both Sister and Mr. Potter witnessed recent acts or recent evidence of violent and physically abusive acts by Mr. Stevenson against Ms. Sipay-boun. In <em>Snyder v. State, </em>361 Md. 580, 762 A.2d 125 (2000), the Court of Appeals noted that \u201c[e]vidence of previous quarrels and difficulties between a victim and a defendant is generally admissible to show motive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605, 762 A.2d 125 (citation omitted). The circumstances in that case parallel this one closely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>as we have seen, the evidence consisted of the July 30, 1985 physical dispute between [Mr. Snyder] and the victim, testimony that [Mr. Snyder] and the victim had a \u201cstormy\u201d relationship, and testimony from a friend of the victim concerning a fight the night before the murder in which the petitioner allegedly stated that the victim was \u201ca dead woman.\u201d Thus, the jury heard testimony indicating that there was disharmony in the household. That evidence was probative of a continuing hostility and animosity, on the part of [Mr. Snyder], toward the victim and, therefore, of a motive to murder, not simply the propensity to commit murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 608-09, 762 A.2d 125. As in Snyder, the testimony here \u201cwas probative of a continuing hostility and animosity, on the part of [Mr. Stevenson], toward [Ms. Sipayboun] and, therefore, of a motive to murder.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Jones v. State, </em>182 Md. 653, 657, 35 A.2d 916 (1944) (holding that circuit court properly admitted evidence of certain violent acts defendant directed toward his wife during their marriage as evidence of the defendant\u2019s motive to murder his wife). The circuit court did not err in admitting this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">H. There Was Sufficient Evidence To Support Mr. Stevenson\u2019s Convictions For First-Degree Murder And First-Degree Sexual Offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\"><em>Finally, </em>Mr. Stevenson contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. He grounds this challenge solely on the claim that there was'not sufficient evidence to show that <em>he </em>was responsible for the murder and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>sexual assault of Ms. Sipayboun because \u201cthe prosecution presented a purely circumstantial case.\u201d He notes that there were no eyewitnesses to the murder, no witness putting him at the scene of the crime, and no forensic evidence connecting him to the crime. The State responds that \u201cthere was strong evidence of motive\u201d given Mr. Stevenson\u2019s \u201crecent violent acts toward [Ms. Sipayboun]\u201d and testimony indicating that \u201c[Ms. Sipayboun] was not only having an affair, but she was leaving [Mr. Stevenson] and she was taking his children.\u201d Moreover, the State argues, \u201cthe cell phone evidence provided strong circumstantial evidence of criminal agency.\u201d We find that there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Evidence is sufficient to support a conviction if, \u201c \u2018after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Coleman, </em>423 Md. 666, 672, 33 A.3d 468 (2011) (quoting <em>Facon v. State, </em>375 Md. 435, 454, 825 A.2d 1096 (2003)). Our concern is not with whether the verdict tracks the weight of the evidence, \u201cbut rather is only with whether the verdicts were supported with sufficient evidence \u2014 that is, evidence that either showed directly, or circumstantially, or supported a rational inference of facts which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 479, 649 A.2d 336 (1994). \u201cWe \u2018must give deference to all reasonable inferences [that] the fact-finder draws, regardless of whether [the appellate court] would have chosen a different reasonable inference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cox v. State, </em>421 Md. 630, 657, 28 A.3d 687 (2011) (quoting <em>Bible v. State, </em>411 Md. 138, 156, 982 A.2d 348 (2009)). Further, we do not \u201c \u2018distinguish between circumstantial and direct evidence because [a] conviction may be sustained on the basis of a single strand of direct evidence or successive links of circumstantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montgomery v. State, </em>206 Md.App. 357, 385, 47 A.3d 1140 (quoting <em>Morris v. State, </em>192 Md.App. 1, 31, 993 A.2d 716 (2010)), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 Md. 83, 54 A.3d 761 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>There was, as the State contends, strong circumstantial evidence establishing Mr. Stevenson\u2019s motive to murder Ms. Sipayboun. The State presented evidence that Mr. Stevenson was the beneficiary of a significant life insurance policy insuring her life, and at the time she was killed, Ms. Sipayboun was in the process of moving out of their home over tension in their relationship, which had been caused by her intimate relationship with Mr. Potter. The trial included evidence that on the day Ms. Sipayboun was killed, Mr. Stevenson called her and demanded she move her belongings out of the house to which she had moved. And as we discussed above, Sister and Mr. Potter offered testimony demonstrating that Mr. Stevenson had physically abused Ms. Sipayboun in the weeks immediately preceding Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Strong circumstantial evidence also connected Mr. Stevenson to the crimes. Detective Ragland testified that there was no damage to the doors of Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s house, which suggested that she was killed by someone familiar. Detective Jendrek\u2019s testimony established that Mr. Stevenson was in close proximity to the scene of the crime when Ms. Sipayboun was killed, which contradicted Mr. Stevenson\u2019s claim that he was in the area of Golden Ring Mall at the time. Detective Jendrek also connected Mr. Stevenson\u2019s cell phone to North Point Road in Dundalk, where Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s abandoned cell phone was found later on. And Mr. Stevenson\u2019s contemporaneous (and otherwise unexplained) hand injury also suggested that he could have been involved in Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s violent death. There was more than enough here for a jury reasonably to conclude that Mr. Stevenson killed and sexually assaulted Ms. Sipayboun.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\">. Mr. Stevenson presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">1. Did the hearing court err by denying Appellant\u2019s pre-trial motion to preclude the use of \"cellular tower ping\u201d evidence at trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">2. Did the trial court err by permitting a State\u2019s witness, Detective John Jendrek, to be qualified as an expert witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">3. Did the trial court commit reversible error by admitting testimony that cell phones belonging to Appellant, the murder victim, and Ms. Sipayboun\u2019s sister connected to specific cell phone towers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">4. Were the trial court's rulings admitting evidence of Appellant\u2019s prior bad acts erroneous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-12\">5. Did the trial court abuse discretion by permitting the introduction of inadmissible hearsay during the testimony of LaShawn Stevenson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-13\">6. Did the trial court err by admitting into evidence photographs of Appellant\u2019s hands?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-14\">7. Did the trial court\u2019s ruling permitting testimony that Appellant refused to give a DNA sample cause reversible error?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-15\">8. Did the trial court err by permitting Detective Kevin Allen to be qualified as an expert witness in the field of digital forensics?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-16\">9. Is the evidence legally insufficient to sustain Appellant\u2019s convictions?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\">. Actually, there is an intervening step: after determining that a piece of \"bad act\u201d evidence has special relevance, the court must decide whether the State proved the defendant's involvement in the \u201cbad act\u201d by \u201c \u2018clear and convincing evidence.' \" <em>Wynn, </em>351 Md. at 317, 718 A.2d 588 (quoting <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634-35, 552 A.2d 896). But in this case, Mr. Stevenson does not challenge that the State proved he physically abused Ms. Sipayboun in the weeks before she was killed by \"clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In any event, the testimony offered by Sister and Mr. Potter was sufficient to support a finding that Mr. Stevenson acted in the manner they described.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
