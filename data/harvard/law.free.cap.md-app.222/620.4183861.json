Murray was found deceased, having suffered approximately 331 individual injuries. Norwood was found bound with zip-ties, with a laceration on her forehead and scratches on her abdomen. Norwood\u2019s pants were torn at the crotch. A check of Norwood\u2019s neck, back, and extremities revealed no injuries. Norwood was placed on a stretcher and transported to a hospital for medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Over the course of the next several days, authorities investigated the incident and subsequently came to view Norwood as a suspect rather than a victim. Norwood was ultimately arrested on March 18, 2011 and was subsequently charged with murder. Following an eight-day trial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, the sole charges submitted to the jury were first-degree premeditated murder and second-degree specific intent to kill murder. On November 2, 2011, the jury found Norwood guilty of first-degree murder. On January 27, 2012, the court sentenced Norwood to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Norwood presents two issues for our review on appeal, which we have rephrased and reordered as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">1. Whether the trial court erred by denying Norwood\u2019s motion to suppress statements she made to the police on March 16 and 18, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">2. Whether the trial court abused its discretion by permitting a witness to testify about a laceration he saw on Norwood\u2019s hand and about knife wounds he had seen in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">For the reasons stated herein, we shall affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Many of the underlying facts of this case are not relevant to the rather limited issues raised on appeal. We set forth the facts significant to the issues presented and further facts that are relevant to the overall context in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Norwood and Murray were co-workers at the Bethesda Lululemon Athletica retail store. They had worked together at the store on the night of March 11, 2011. After closing the store, both Norwood and Murray left the building. At 9:51 p.m., Norwood telephoned Eila Rab, another sales associate at Lululemon, and told her that she had left her wallet at the store. Norwood asked Ms. Rab for Murray\u2019s telephone number so that she could call Murray and ask her to meet her at the store to let her in. Ms. Rab sent Murray\u2019s phone number to Norwood via a text message.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Norwood telephoned Murray, and Murray agreed to meet Norwood at the store. Once Norwood and Murray met at the Lululemon store, a violent encounter occurred which resulted in Murray\u2019s death. Employees at the Bethesda Apple Store, which adjoined the Lululemon store, heard noises coming from the Lululemon store shortly after 10:00 p.m., including sounds of dragging, grunting, thudding, and high-pitched squealing. One Apple Store employee asked a security guard to check the nature of the disturbance and spoke to another manager about the noises. The employee continued to hear noises, including screaming and yelling. The employee heard one female voice which sounded hysterical and another female voice saying, \u201cTalk to me. Don\u2019t do this. Talk to me. What\u2019s going on?\u201d The employee heard additional screaming, yelps, and yells, and heard a voice say, \u201cGod help me. Please help me.\u201d She did not believe the voice pleading to God was the same voice that had said, \u201cTalk to me. Don\u2019t do this.\u201d The employee left the Apple Store shortly after 11:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Norwood attacked Murray with multiple weapons, causing approximately 331 individual injuries and ultimately Murray\u2019s death. Murray had injuries to her head, face, neck, back, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>extremities. According to the medical examiner, Murray was alive when she incurred the majority of her injuries. A stab wound to the back of Murray\u2019s head hastened her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Norwood doctored the scene in order to make it appear that a robbery had occurred and that both Murray and Norwood had been victims of an attack. Norwood used a pair of men\u2019s size fourteen Reebok tennis shoes to create bloody footprints at the crime scene.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Norwood moved Murray\u2019s car to a parking lot further from the Lululemon store and moved various items in the Lululemon store in an attempt to make it appear that a robbery had occurred. Norwood opened the safe in the store and removed three bags of money from it. Norwood inflicted various superficial injuries upon herself, cut a slit in the crotch of her pants, bound her hands and feet with zip ties, and laid on the floor. Norwood then waited to be discovered the following morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">On the morning of March 12, 2011, manager Rachel Oertli arrived at the Lululemon store shortly before 8:00 a.m. She noticed that the door was unlocked and initially believed that someone had arrived just before her and had forgotten to lock the door. When she entered the store, the lights were on and things were out of place, leading her to believe an altercation had occurred. Ms. Oertli called out and heard someone moaning. She left the store and immediately called 911. Ms. Oertli saw a man, Ryan Haugh, waiting outside the Apple Store<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and asked him if he would accompany her into the Lululemon store. Although he did not know Ms. Oertli, Mr. Haugh agreed to enter Lululemon with her. After they entered, Mr. Haugh went toward the back of the store by himself at Ms. Oertli\u2019s request. Mr. Haugh saw a body lying face down and called out to Ms. Oertli to call the police because it appeared as if someone was dead. As Mr. Haugh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>walked back toward Ms. Oertli, he saw a second person who was tied up but breathing. Mr. Haugh told Ms. Oertli that there was one person who was dead and another person who was alive and appeared to have been sexually assaulted. Ms. Oertli called police for a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Several officers arrived shortly thereafter. When the police approached Norwood, she appeared to be unresponsive. The police found Murray face down in a pool of blood with no pulse. An ambulance arrived at approximately 8:00 a.m. Norwood was placed on a stretcher and transported to Suburban Hospital. Officer Colin O\u2019Brien was working part-time for Suburban Hospital performing security work as a uniformed police officer on March 12. He met the ambulance carrying Norwood when it arrived and followed her stretcher into the trauma bay. Officer O\u2019Brien observed a number of cuts on Norwood\u2019s chest, legs, arms, and forehead. In particular, Officer O\u2019Brien noticed a one to two-inch laceration on Norwood\u2019s right hand that ran parallel to Norwood\u2019s thumb. While at the hospital, Norwood was examined by a sexual assault nurse examiner. The examination revealed no evidence of sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Over the next several days, multiple police officers engaged in various conversations with Norwood. Norwood\u2019s statements to police officers during conversations were later the subject of a motion to suppress. Specifically, Norwood sought to suppress statements made on March 12, 14, 16, and 18.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6M\">\n<em>The March 12 Interview</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Detective Deana Mackie of the Montgomery County Police Department met with Norwood at Suburban Hospital at 10:25 a.m. on March 12, 2011 for approximately forty-five to fifty minutes. After her conversation with Norwood, Detective Mackie went to the Lululemon store before returning to Suburban Hospital at approximately 2:35 p.m. to speak with Norwood further. Detective Mackie viewed Norwood as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>victim and spoke with her to obtain information in order to develop a suspect. Norwood spoke freely and responded appropriately to Detective Mackie\u2019s questions during both sessions. Norwood told Detective Mackie that she and Murray had been attacked by two men wearing masks. She described an attack by two men in significant detail. Nor-wood told Detective Mackie that she had been raped and sexually assaulted with a clothing hanger. In addition to speaking with Norwood, while at Suburban Hospital, Detective Mackie spoke with various medical professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">\n<em>The March 14 Interview</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">On March 14, 2011, at approximately 8:00 p.m., Detective Dimitry Ruvin and Detective James Drewry met with Nor-wood at her residence. The detectives were wearing plainclothes attire. The meeting had been arranged through telephone conversations with Norwood\u2019s family members. The detectives\u2019 purpose in visiting Norwood was to introduce themselves and inquire as to whether Norwood remembered any additional details of the incident. Detective Ruvin testified that he still considered Norwood a victim during the March 14 interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">When the detectives arrived, they met several of Norwood\u2019s family members. Norwood emerged and the detectives introduced themselves and told her that they wanted to see if she had remembered anything else. At Norwood\u2019s suggestion, the detectives and Norwood went downstairs to her living area and sat around a table in the living room area. Norwood recounted her story regarding the events of March 11-12, 2011 while the detectives took notes and recorded a portion of the interview.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The atmosphere of the conversation was very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>casual, and Norwood was coherent and cooperative. Norwood told the detectives that she was sexually assaulted. Norwood explained that the attacker told her that the only reason she was not killed was because she was \u201cfun to fuck.\u201d Norwood said that one attacker pushed her onto Murray\u2019s body. Nor-wood told detectives that the attackers knew her name and address, which she presumed the attackers found on Comcast and Washington Gas bills which had been in her purse. Norwood told detectives that the attacker swore at her and called her a \u201cdirty slut\u201d and a racial epithet while sexually assaulting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Detective Ruvin testified that Norwood became emotional during the conversation about the sexual assault. She had tears in her eyes and looked down a lot, but continued to talk to the detectives. At the end of the interview, Norwood spoke with the detectives about what she was going to do in the future. Norwood told the detectives that her family wanted her to move back to Seattle, but that she had been recently offered a new job in Bethesda, which she planned to begin after she recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The detectives recommended that Norwood inform her family members that the attackers knew her address. She told her family members in front of the detectives. Detective Ruvin testified that Norwood\u2019s family members were \u201cvery, very concerned.\u201d The detectives advised Norwood\u2019s family members to contact the police if they saw anything suspicious. Detective Ruvin testified that at the end of the March 14 interview, he still viewed Norwood as a victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">\n<em>The March 16 Interview</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The detectives met with Norwood a third time on March 16, 2011. Norwood came to the police headquarters at the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>quest of Detective Drewry. By this time, Detective Drewry had begun to view Norwood as a suspect. Detective Drewry asked Norwood to come to headquarters in order to provide elimination fingerprints and hair samples. Detective Drewry testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress that Nor-wood was asked to come in both to provide elimination prints and because \u201cit was also a ruse to get her to come in\u201d to talk to the detectives. Norwood arrived at approximately 5:00 p.m. with two of her siblings. Norwood\u2019s siblings left to get something to eat and Norwood was asked to sit in an interview room.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The interview, which was video recorded, took place in an interview room at police headquarters.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The interview room had two doors, one of which was often left open and the other of which was occasionally open. During the first approximately one hour of the interview, Norwood spoke informally with Detective Drewry while waiting for evidence technicians to take hair samples, photographs, and fingerprints. Norwood again described being attacked by two assailants. When asked whether she knew the type of car Murray drove, Norwood replied that she did not know. At the end of the interview, Norwood left the station with her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The following day, Norwood\u2019s brother, Chris Norwood, and sister, Marissa Norwood, contacted the detectives via telephone. Norwood\u2019s siblings explained that Norwood had been withholding information from the detectives because she was afraid that the suspects would harm her. Specifically, one of Norwood\u2019s siblings told Detective Drewry that the attackers had forced her to move Murray\u2019s car. An additional interview was scheduled, at Marissa Norwood\u2019s request, for March 18, 2011 at 10:00 a.m.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>\n<em>The March 18 Interview</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">On March 18, Norwood arrived at police headquarters accompanied by her siblings, Marissa and Chris Norwood. Nor-wood went into an interview room with Detectives Drewry and Ruvin. At the beginning of the interview, Norwood discussed her plans for the future, including the possibility of moving back to her hometown of Seattle to move in with her brother, Chris. Norwood told Detective Drewry that her \u201conly concern\u201d with respect to moving to Seattle was that she wanted to be reachable by police during the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Unprompted, Norwood initiated a conversation regarding Murray\u2019s car, saying, \u201cAll right, I\u2019m here because....\u201d Nor-wood told detectives that prior to the sexual assault, the attackers made her move Murray\u2019s car to a different parking lot. According to Norwood, the attackers told her they would be watching her the entire time and threatened to kill her if she talked to anyone. She explained that she went, alone, to move Murray\u2019s car. While moving Murray\u2019s car, Norwood saw a police officer in a patrol vehicle but did not flag down the officer or attempt to contact him because she was too afraid. When asked why she returned to the Lululemon store after moving Murray\u2019s car instead of driving away and attempting to contact police, Norwood explained that she was \u201cafraid for [her] life\u201d and that the attackers knew where she lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">At one point during the interview, Norwood expressed, \u201cwe\u2019ve been over this.\u201d Detective Drewry responded, \u201cYeah, but every time we go over it something else comes out or changes a little so I\u2019m just trying to get it as straight as possible.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court suppressed the statements made after this exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Eventually, Detective Drewry told Norwood that he did not believe her story and explained to her why the evidence demonstrated that her story was a lie.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Norwood\u2019s siblings were brought into the interview room, and Detective Drewry explained to them why he believed Norwood had murdered Murray. Ultimately, Norwood was placed under arrest later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Following an eight-day trial in late October and early November of 2011, the charges submitted to the jury were first-degree premeditated murder and second-degree specific intent to kill murder. The jury found Norwood guilty of first-degree murder. On January 27, 2012, the court sentenced Norwood to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Additional facts shall be included as necessitated by our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">Norwood maintains that the trial court erred by denying her motion to suppress statements made during the March 16, 2011 interview and during a portion of the March 18, 2011 interview. Norwood asserts that the circumstances of the March 16 and March 18 interviews would have led a reasonable person to believe that he or she was in custody, and therefore, <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required. Having reviewed the video recordings of each interview and the transcript of the motion to suppress, we are persuaded that the trial court correctly determined that Norwood was not in custody and, therefore, Norwood was not entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings during the relevant time periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>When reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence \u201cwe confine ourselves to what occurred at the suppression hearing.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. State, </em>429 Md. 632, 647, 57 A.3d 484 (2012) (quoting <em>Lee v. State, </em>418 Md. 136, 148, 12 A.3d 1238 (2011)). Moreover, \u201c[w]e view the evidence and inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion, here, the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe credibility of the witnesses, the weight to be given to the evidence, and the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence come within the province of the suppression court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 647-48, 57 A.3d 484 (citing <em>Long-shore v. State, </em>399 Md. 486, 499, 924 A.2d 1129 (2007)); <em>see also Wilkes v. State, </em>364 Md. 554, 569, 774 A.2d 420 (2001) (\u201cWe extend great deference to the fact finding of the suppression court and accept the facts as found by that court unless clearly erroneous.\u201d). We review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether, based on the facts presented, a constitutional right has been violated. <em>Williams v. State, </em>372 Md. 386, 401, 813 A.2d 231 (2002) (citing <em>Wilkes v. State, </em>364 Md. 554, 569, 774 A.2d 420 (2001)). <em>See also Upshur v. State, </em>208 Md.App. 383, 392, 56 A.3d 620 (2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 Md. 646, 62 A.3d 732 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects individuals from being compelled to make self-incriminating statements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> U.S. Const. Amend. V. In <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 467, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), the United States Supreme Court recognized that a \u201cpolice-dominated atmosphere\u201d can be coercive and potentially \u201cundermine the individual\u2019s will to resist and ... compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.\u201d The <em>Miranda </em>Court held that, \u201c[i]n order to combat these pressures and to permit a full opportunity to exercise the privilege against self-incrimination, the accused must be adequately and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>effectively apprised of his rights and the exercise of those rights must be fully honored.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467, 86 S.Ct. 1602. The Court of Appeals described the warnings required by <em>Miranda </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">The prophylactic measures developed in <em>Miranda </em>are the now-familiar warnings that law enforcement personnel are required to convey to a suspect before embarking on any custodial interrogation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">[A suspect] must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\"><em>Gonzalez v. State, </em>429 Md. 632, 650, 57 A.3d 484 (2012) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 U.S. at 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">The requirements of <em>Miranda </em>only apply when a defendant is both (1) in custody; and (2) subject to interrogation. We have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">The Supreme Court has recognized, however, that, although \u201c[a]ny police interview of an individual suspected of a crime has \u2018coercive aspects to it,\u2019 \u201d the <em>Miranda </em>requirements apply only to custodial interrogation. <em>J.D.B. v. North Carolina, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2394, 2401-02, 180 L.Ed.2d 310 (2011). Thus, before a defendant can claim the benefit of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the defendant must establish two things: (1) custody; and (2) interrogation. <em>Smith v. State, </em>186 Md.App. 498, 518, 974 A.2d 991 (2009), <em>aff'd, </em>414 Md. 357, 995 A.2d 685 (2010). The burden of \u201cshowing the applicability of the <em>Miranda </em>requirements,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>that there was custody and interrogation, is on the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 520, 974 A.2d 991.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-12\"><em>State v. Thomas, </em>202 Md.App. 545, 565, 33 A.3d 494 (2011), <em>aff'd, </em>429 Md. 246, 55 A.3d 680 (2012) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">It is undisputed that Norwood was subjected to interrogation during the March 16 and March 18 interviews. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>cordingly, we consider only whether Norwood was in custody. \u201c \u2018[Wjhether a suspect is \u2018in custody\u2019 is an objective inquiry.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565, 33 A.3d 494 (quoting <em>J.D.B., supra, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2402). In <em>Thomas, supra, </em>we quoted from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>J.D.B., supra, </em>which explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\">\u201cTwo discrete inquiries are essential to the determination: first, what were the circumstances surrounding the interrogation; and second, given those circumstances, would a reasonable person have felt he or she was at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave. Once the scene is set and the players\u2019 lines and actions are reconstructed, the court must apply an objective test to resolve the ultimate inquiry: was there a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with formal arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\"><em>Thomas, supra, </em>202 Md.App. at 566, 33 A.3d 494 (quoting <em>J.D.B., supra, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2402 (quoting <em>Thompson v. Keo-hane, </em>516 U.S. 99, 112, 116 S.Ct. 457, 133 L.Ed.2d 383 (1995))).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Courts consider multiple factors when determining whether a defendant is in custody, considering the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 567, 33 A.3d 494. The factors considered include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">[W]hen and where it occurred, how long it lasted, how many police were present, what the officers and the defendant said and did, the presence of actual physical restraint on the defendant or things equivalent to actual restraint such as drawn weapons or a guard stationed at the door, and whether the defendant was being questioned as a suspect or as a witness. Facts pertaining to events before the interrogation are also relevant, especially how the defendant got to the place of questioning!],] whether he came completely on his own, in response to a police request or escorted by police officers. Finally, what happened after the interrogation!],] whether the defendant left freely, was detained or arrested may assist the court in determining whether the defendant, as a reasonable person, would have felt free to break off the questioning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 567-68, 33 A.3d 494 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Owens v.

State, </em>287 Md. 124, 141, 411 A.2d 415 (1980))).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In the present case, the trial court determined that <em>Miranda </em>rulings were required at approximately fifty-two minutes into the March 18 interview. The trial court concluded that Norwood was not in custody when she spoke to detectives on March 16 and during the initial portion of the March 18 interview. With respect the March 16 interview, the trial court ruled as follows:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">The fourth statement that is the subject of challenge is contained in the video recorded on March 16 which was taken at police headquarters. And during this period of time, at least in the initial part, the defendant, who was brought to the police station by family members and left with them at the end is fingerprinted and hair samples were obtained from her at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">In fact, she chatted quite amiably with the evidence technicians.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">It was amiable. She was animated. She was polite. She didn\u2019t appear to be intimidated by anything that happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">And then the interview that takes place afterwards \u2014 you know, I\u2019ll remark to you, another thing that was just \u2014 it was uncanny to me \u2014 besides the facility with which she answered questions, having been a prosecutor and defense attorney for many years before coming on the bench and now being on the bench and watching videos for many years, I\u2019ve seen instances where the police were interrogating a suspect and then they get up and leave and the camera is still running.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>And you see defendants picking at themselves, moving around, jumping around, standing up, pounding their fists. I had to fast forward through several of the intervals when the police left the room on the 16th to see any movement in the defendant at all. She didn\u2019t appear to be nervous. She was composed.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Just, you know, to suggest from that that there was some overbearing of her will, that these officers were subjecting [her] to a pressure-filled situation where her will was overborne, to me is just almost \u2014 it\u2019s almost absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Again, the offering of detail that wasn\u2019t asked for. The appropriate affect at times when emotions ought to be seen. Even, you know, \u201cDo you want a glass of water?\u201d I think those of us who have tried criminal cases always would tell people who we were defending, \u201cStop drinking the water. You\u2019re making yourself look nervous here. And you\u2019re going to have to go to the bathroom at some point.\u201d She\u2019s offered beverages a couple of times and doesn\u2019t even want a glass of water.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">And you know, I mean, these thing[s] by themselves are not dispositive. But when you put them together, it just indicates to me a person who is totally in control of [the] situation. At least as far as March 16, I think \u2014 and who knows, this is just surmising, and I\u2019m candid to admit that\u2014 she thought she had everybody duped.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">So I don\u2019t find any <em>Miranda </em>violation on the 16th, you know, the bathroom, as [the prosecutor] pointed out, she got up and went to the bathroom. I\u2019ve been in and out of police stations. You can walk right on through the door. Right on through the door. Bye-bye.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">She came right back. So the sense to me was that she knew that the police were continuing to investigate this crime. She was going to play along with it to the extent that she could. And of course, I\u2019m not the trier of fact here. I\u2019m not convicting her of this crime. This is for the purpose of the motions only.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>But I am saying that, based upon what I saw, this was a young woman who was totally facile, totally with it, knew what she was doing, and was not being overborne by police conduct. So as to the voluntariness of the statement, I find the statement voluntary under both tests and I find that <em>Miranda </em>does not apply because she was not in custody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">We agree with the trial court that Norwood was not in custody during the March 16 interview. Although the interview occurred at police headquarters, Norwood came to police headquarters voluntarily, accompanied by her brother and sister. The trial court found that Norwood spoke casually, calmly, and amiably and did not appear to be intimidated. Based upon our review of the video recording, we agree with the trial court\u2019s findings regarding Norwood\u2019s demeanor. Although the interview occurred in a police interview room, the two doors to the room were left open at various times throughout the interview. When Norwood requested to use the restroom, she was shown to an employee restroom on the same hall through which Norwood entered. The same hallway had doors which led to the outside of the building, through which Norwood could have exited.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Although Detective Drewry acknowledged that he had begun to view Norwood as a suspect prior to the March 16 interview, he was careful not to convey his suspicions to Norwood. The circuit court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">[T]he test for <em>Miranda </em>is an objective one. And [Detective Drewry] did a pretty darn good job of not conveying [his suspicions] to her in my view, because as I said in an offhand comment he made, he had me convinced, for instance, that he was hard of hearing. On several occasions during one of the interviews he says, \u201cI can\u2019t hear you. You have to speak up.\u201d I though[t], well, maybe he\u2019s like me. He\u2019s getting old. He can\u2019t hear well. He says today that\u2019s really not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">But I didn\u2019t detect in watching the defendant that there was any sense on her part that he really was of the mind that we now know he was. So while it may be true that as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>early as March 16 \u2014 and maybe it was earlier. Maybe [defense counsel] is right, that the police were suspicious. It\u2019s still an objective test as to what Ms. Norwood believed and I don\u2019t see any evidence at all that Ms. Norwood believed that she was in custody. And again, I guess the litmus test is at the end of March 16, she left. Not in handcuffs. She left.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Our review of the video recording leads us to agree with the trial court that Detective Drewry did not convey his suspicions to Norwood in any way. Furthermore, as the circuit court properly found, Norwood was permitted to leave with her brother and sister at the end of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">We are unpersuaded by Norwood\u2019s contention that she was in custody because at one point she told the detectives she did not want to talk anymore. Norwood expressed concern about answering questions posed by the detectives, saying that she was afraid of the two men who had attacked her at the Lululemon store. After Detective Drewry reassured Norwood that the attackers were \u201ca million miles away\u201d and that she did not need to be afraid of the attackers, Norwood agreed to speak with the detectives further. Through this exchange, Norwood appears to have been attempting to convince the detectives to believe her story regarding the two attackers. In our view, this exchange does not indicate that Norwood believed that she was not free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Based on the totality of the circumstances, we hold that the circuit court did not err when it concluded that Norwood was not in custody at any point during the March 16 interview. Although the total time Norwood spent at police headquarters was somewhat lengthy,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that time frame included time when Norwood was chatting casually with detectives while waiting for the evidence technicians. Furthermore, the time frame included time for the collection of hair samples and fingerprints. Throughout the interview, Norwood acted as a victim and appeared to think that she had convinced the police to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>believe her story. Norwood was not restrained and was not prevented from exiting the building at any time. Finally, Norwood left police headquarters and returned home with her family at the conclusion of the interview. For all these reasons, we agree with the trial court that Norwood was not in custody..</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">We reach the same conclusion with respect to the initial portion of the March 18 interview.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The trial court ruled that Norwood was not in custody during the first approximately fifty-two minutes of the March 18 interview. The trial court observed that the March 18 interview was arranged at Nor-wood\u2019s request because a family member telephoned the detectives on March 17 and told them that there was additional information that Norwood wanted to share with them. The detectives agreed to schedule an additional interview on March 18 rather than on March 17 because that date was more convenient for Norwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The trial court explained its ruling as follows:<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahy-dedup-0\">So then we get to [March] 18th ... this is at the request of either the defendant or members of her family. And again, I noted, because there was some small talk in the beginning. And suddenly, she jumps right into it and says, \u201cAll right, I\u2019m here because ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">And she starts to explain why she\u2019s there. Because there was some information she hadn\u2019t provided to them again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">There is this conversation about her moving to Seattle. And what I also noted here is \u2014 and I guess this is maybe to sort of be able to fudge things, continually when she would describe what had purportedly happened, she would say like in response to a question \u2014 I\u2019ll give you an example. This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>not verbatim, but like, \u201cwell, did you see him?\u201d And she would say, \u201cI feel like,\u201d or \u201cI want to say,\u201d and I made note of how many times she said that. \u201cI feel like\u201d such and such happened. Or \u201cI want to say\u201d such and such. You know, it all just came across as very calculated. And again, I do not sit here as the trier of fact in this case. A jury is going to decide this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">But I only offer it because to me in determining whether this statement was voluntary or not, it occurs to me that the control that she takes and manner in which she expresses herself is just very, very key. And with that viewpoint, it bolsters the argument the State is making here that these statements were voluntary simply because she really perceived herself to be in control of the situation and objectively, at least, because we don\u2019t know what was going on in her mind, and I\u2019m not suggesting I do \u2014 objectively at least, she gave that appearance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">And it was not until ... towards the end of that session on March 18, objectively to me it appeared for the first time that she perhaps was getting a little bit uncomfortable about why this questioning was persisting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">And \u2014 bear with me one second. It\u2019s at that point she says, \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this.\u201d And Detective Drewry says, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get it as straight as possible.\u201d And then there\u2019s another \u201cAnd I want to say,\u201d in response to a question that I\u2019ve noted here. But then the interview doesn\u2019t last much longer, and then she does say, \u201cCan I go?\u201d And Detective Drewry says \u201cprobably in a couple of minutes.\u201d And that\u2019s where the break is taken and the State has conceded that thereafter <em>Miranda </em>should have been administered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">But I do find that the statement that was given in the morning, 10:52 to 11:44 to be voluntary under both tests. Again, I do not think she was in custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>But out of an abundance of caution, I\u2019m going to exclude on a <em>Miranda </em>basis, that testimony that occurred after she said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this.\u201d I think it\u2019s really, to be candid with you, very little ... [0]ut of an abundance of caution and in fairness[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">It\u2019s going to be [suppressed] from the point where [Nor-wood] says, \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Again, we are in agreement with the trial court that Norwood was not in custody during the relevant portion of the March 18 interview. The interview was scheduled at Nor-wood\u2019s request, when Norwood realized that there was information she had omitted during the previous interview. Nor-wood arrived at police headquarters for the interview with her brother and sister, and initiated the conversation, saying \u201cAll right, I\u2019m here because----\u201d Norwood appeared to believe that she was in control of the situation throughout the relevant portion of the interview. Accordingly, based upon the totality of the circumstances, we hold that the trial court did not err by concluding that Norwood was not in custody during the relevant portion of the March 18 interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">Norwood further contends that a police officer\u2019s testimony regarding a cut on Norwood\u2019s hand constituted inappropriate opinion testimony under <em>Ragland v. State, </em>385 Md. 706, 870 A.2d 609 (2005). Norwood contends that the trial court erred in admitting an expert opinion that was based upon the officer\u2019s \u201cspecialized training and experience as any army medic\u201d without providing the defense with required notice. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">We review a circuit court\u2019s decisions to admit or exclude evidence applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Kelly v. State, </em>392 Md. 511, 530, 898 A.2d 419 (2006). The Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Trial judges are afforded broad discretion in the conduct of trials in such areas as the reception of evidence. Accordingly, in our appellate review, we extend the trial court great deference in determining the admissibility of evidence and will reverse only if the court abused its discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 530, 898 A.2d 419 (internal quotations and citations omitted). \u201c[O]nce a trial court has made a finding of relevance, we are generally loath to reverse [the] trial court unless the evidence is plainly inadmissible under a specific rule or principle of law or there is a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Decker v. State, </em>408 Md. 631, 649, 971 A.2d 268 (2009) (alteration in original) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">\u2018\u201c[A] ruling reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would not have made the same ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alexis v. State, </em>437 Md. 457, 478, 87 A.3d 1243 (2014) (emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 14, 648 A.2d 1025 (1994)). \u201cRather, \u2018[a] court\u2019s decision is an abuse of discretion when it is \u2018well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gray v. State, </em>388 Md. 366, 383, 879 A.2d 1064 (2005) (quoting <em>Dehn v. Edgecombe, </em>384 Md. 606, 628, 865 A.2d 603 (2005)) (some internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">At trial, Officer Colin O\u2019Brien testified for the State. Officer O\u2019Brien was working part-time for Suburban Hospital doing security work as a uniformed police officer on March 12, 2011. He met the ambulance in which Norwood was riding, followed her stretcher into the trauma bay, and began bagging her clothing for evidence. Officer O\u2019Brien observed cuts on Norwood\u2019s chest, legs, arms, and forehead. He particularly noticed a one to two-inch cut on the palm of Norwood\u2019s right hand. Officer O\u2019Brien explained that his attention was drawn to that cut because it was typical of a common injury caused when a blade slips from one\u2019s grip and slides down the hand. Critically, that portion of Officer O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>stricken by the trial court. The trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\">THE COURT: All right. Ladies and gentlemen, you just heard testimony from the witness as to how this particular type of injury struck him as to how he thinks it happened, you are instructed to disregard that conclusion. You can certainly judge the credibility of the witness with regard to the other part of his statement as to what he saw, but not as to what he thinks that meant or how it was caused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">At the bench, the trial court stated that Officer O\u2019Brien was not \u201cqualified to say how that injury occurs\u201d but permitted the State to lay a foundation for Officer O\u2019Brien\u2019s knowledge about knife injuries. Thereafter, Officer O\u2019Brien testified regarding his experience with knife injuries as an Army medic. Officer O\u2019Brien testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">[Officer O\u2019Brien]: A lot of times you can see knife injuries, particularly when you cause them to yourself, that are lacerations that are straight to the hand that was holding the blade. They tend to be clean and typically will run parallel to the thumb.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">[The Prosecutor]: When you observed these injuries occur and, could you tell exactly how that, how you observed those injuries that, that went parallel to the thumb with the knife, how did it occur?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">[Officer O\u2019Brien]: The blade would slip through a grip and slide down the hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">[The Prosecutor]: Now, when you observed Brittany Nor-wood, on March 12th of 2011, can you describe the injury you saw on her thumb?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-10\">[Officer O\u2019Brien]: There was an approximately one to two inch laceration on her, on her hand that ran parallel to her thumb.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-11\">[The Prosecutor]: And can you describe how it, how it appeared in relation to the knife injuries that you had observed in the past that you\u2019ve just described to us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>[Defense Counsel]: Objection, Your Honor. Can we, again, approach just to put something on the record?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">At the bench, defense counsel argued that he was \u201centitled to notice if they\u2019re going to elicit an expert opinion from someone in terms of how these injuries occurred.\u201d The trial court inquired as to the relevance of the evidence, and the prosecutor, apparently anticipating that the defense might advance a theory of voluntary manslaughter based upon a mutual affray, answered that counsel had referred in opening statement to \u201ca mutual affray\u201d between Norwood and Murray. The prosecutor argued that the cause of the injury would be relevant to whether a mutual affray in fact occurred. With respect to any opinion testimony by Officer O\u2019Brien, the prosecutor argued that Officer O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony was not expert testimony because \u201cit\u2019s not outside the realm of an average person\u2019s ability to, to use everyday life experience and observe knife wounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The trial court did not permit Officer O\u2019Brien to testify as to the cause of Norwood\u2019s injury, commenting that any testimony would include \u201cconclusions as to how [the cut] happened.\u201d The court ruled that Officer O\u2019Brien \u201ccan certainly testify he\u2019s seen this type of wound before and he saw this one. He\u2019s described what it is, so let\u2019s move on from that, then.\u201d The prosecutor moved to a different line of questioning and did not return to the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Norwood asserts on appeal that Officer O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony was impermissible under <em>Ragland, supra, </em>385 Md. 706, 870 A.2d 609. In <em>Ragland, </em>the Court of Appeals distinguished between expert and lay opinion testimony, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdS\">Expert opinion testimony is testimony that is based on specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education. Expert opinions need not be confined to matters actually perceived by the witness. Lay opinion testimony is testimony that is rationally based on the perception of the witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 717, 870 A.2d 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">The <em>Ragland </em>Court held that police officers\u2019 testimony characterizing a particular series of observed events as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\u201cdrug transaction\u201d was expert testimony because the characterization was based upon the officers\u2019 specialized knowledge, experience, and training. <em>Id. </em>at 726, 870 A.2d 609. The Court explained that \u201camong the numerous possible explanations for the events [observed by the officers] on Northwest Drive, the correct one was that a drug transaction had taken place.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">In contrast to expert testimony, lay opinion testimony requires no specialized knowledge or experience but instead is \u201cderived from first-hand knowledge\u201d and is \u201crationally based.\u201d <em>Bruce v. State, </em>328 Md. 594, 630, 616 A.2d 392 (1992). For example, we have explained that an opinion regarding the odor of marijuana is lay opinion rather than expert testimony. <em>In re Ondrel M., </em>173 Md.App. 223, 243, 918 A.2d 543 (2007) (\u201cNo specialized knowledge or experience is required in order to be familiar with the smell of marijuana. A witness need only to have encountered the smoking of marijuana in daily life to be able to recognize the odor.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">First, we observe that Officer O\u2019Brien never offered any opinion, lay or expert, regarding the cause of Norwood\u2019s hand injury. His testimony regarding the cause of Norwood\u2019s injury was stricken by the trial court and the jury was instructed not to consider \u201chow [Officer O\u2019Brien] thinks [the injury] happened.\u201d Rather, Officer O\u2019Brien testified about injuries he had observed in the past from slipped knives and described the injury he observed on Norwood\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Furthermore, assuming <em>arguendo </em>the testimony was improper, our review of the record indicates that the error would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Bellamy v. State, </em>403 Md. 308, 332, 941 A.2d 1107 (2008) (\u201cOnce it has been determined that error was committed, reversal is required unless the error did not influence the verdict; the error is harmless only if it did not play any role in the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d) (internal quotation and citation omitted). The evidence of Norwood\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. Indeed, Nor-wood conceded that she intentionally killed Murray by repeatedly stabbing her with a knife and assaulting her with various other objects. Given Norwood\u2019s concession, the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>issue before the jury was whether Norwood acted with premeditation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Evidence suggesting that the knife slipped in Norwood\u2019s hand during the attack is irrelevant to whether Norwood acted with premeditation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Even if the testimony were relevant to premeditation, there is overwhelming evidence that Murray\u2019s murder was premeditated. Dr. Mary Ripple, the Deputy Chief Medical Examiner, testified that Murray had at least 331 distinct injuries, including 105 defensive wounds. Dr. Ripple explained that Murray was alive for much of the assault. The time that it took Norwood to inflict 331 injuries strongly supports a finding of premeditation. Dr. Ripple further testified that Murray\u2019s injuries were caused by at least five weapons, including a wrench, a merchandising peg, a hammer, a box cutter, and an x-acto knife. The time that it took Norwood to gather the weapons from various locations in the store further supports a conclusion that Murray\u2019s murder was premeditated. Finally, we note that employees of the neighboring Apple Store heard sounds of a confrontation coming from the Lululemon store and listened at the wall for approximately nine minutes. In light of the overwhelming evidence of premeditation presented at trial, any alleged error regarding Officer O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying Norwood\u2019s motion to suppress the statements she made to the police on March 16 and 18, 2011. We further hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting a witness to testify about a laceration he observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>on Norwood\u2019s hand and about knife wounds he had seen in the past. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED. APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-7\">.

An approximately 4-minute segment of the interview was recorded. The recorded portion included an explanation of when the two men entered the Lululemon store and what occurred thereafter.

Norwood told detectives that she heard her attacker unzip his pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Norwood described Murray\u2019s attacker as approximately six feet tall with an average build.

The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">No person shall ... be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">U.S. Const., Amend. V.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b658-10\">. The trial court ruled on the issue of voluntariness as well as on the issue of <em>Miranda. </em>Norwood does not raise any issues related to voluntariness on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b661-8\">. The video recording indicates that Norwood was in the interview room for approximately two hours and fifty minutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b662-9\">. We express no opinion on whether Norwood was in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes after the first approximately fifty-two minutes of the March 18 interview.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b662-10\">. The trial court issued its ruling with respect to voluntariness in addition to <em>Miranda. </em>Although we do not address the voluntariness issue on appeal, we include certain observations made by the trial court which are relevant to both voluntariness and the <em>Miranda </em>issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b669-6\">. Although the State at one point argued that the evidence regarding the knife would be relevant to rebut a defense theory of voluntary manslaughter based upon the legally adequate provocation of a mutual affray, the defense never sought a voluntary manslaughter instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b669-7\">. We are unpersuaded by Norwood\u2019s contention that the State, in closing argument, highlighted Officer O\u2019Brien's testimony as evidence in premeditation. Our review of the record indicates that the State referenced Officer O\u2019Brien's testimony only to support the argument that Norwood was wielding a knife and had killed Murray, and that Norwood's injury was self-inflicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
