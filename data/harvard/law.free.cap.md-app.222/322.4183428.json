The court sentenced appellant to 20 years, all but seven years suspended, followed by five years of supervised probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">On appeal, appellant presents four questions for our review, which we have rephrased, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">1. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion when it allowed the State, in closing arguments: (a) to reference appellant\u2019s changed appearance; and (b) to rebut appellant\u2019s argument that the State could have performed forensic tests on the victim\u2019s iPhone case?</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">2. Did the circuit court commit plain error in giving the jury an instruction on eyewitness identification?</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>3. Did the circuit court commit plain error in admitting photographs from a surveillance camera?</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">4. Did the circuit court err in excluding evidence that a \u201cFind My iPhone\u201d app on the victim\u2019s cell phone located the stolen phone at a residence other than appellant\u2019s?</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The charges against appellant arose out of the robbery and assault of Samer El-Amine in Silver Spring, Maryland on February 10, 2013. Mr. El-Amine, who was 16 years old at the time of the assault, testified that at approximately 1:30 a.m., he left his friend\u2019s house and began walking home. He stopped at a 7-Eleven convenience store to purchase gummy worms. In the parking lot, approximately 20-30 feet away, he noticed a light brown car with two people inside. Although Mr. El-Amine could not \u201creally see\u201d the faces of the two individuals in the car, he did notice that the individual in the front passenger seat had a \u201chigh-top fade\u201d haircut.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Twenty to thirty seconds after Mr. El-Amine left the 7-Eleven store, \u201cthe same car ... or I think it was the same car \u2014 it looked like it,\u201d pulled up next to him and \u201cthe person in the passenger side got out.\u201d He described the car as \u201cthe same color and the same shape.\u201d The two individuals in the car were wearing ski masks, so Mr. El-Amine could not see their faces or their hair. The person who got out of the car put a small, black gun to Mr. El-Amine\u2019s head and said: \u201cGive me your shit.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The person then reached into Mr. El-Amine\u2019s pocket and removed his iPhone5, which was covered by a blue \u201cOtterBox\u201d phone case. The person also told him: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\u201cGive me this Helly, too,\u201d referring to Mr. El-Amine\u2019s red and white Helly Hansen brand jacket. Mr. El-Amine hesitated, at which point he was forced to the ground. The person removed his jacket, got back into the car, and the driver of the car drove away \u201cvery fast.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Mr. El-Amine walked to his mother\u2019s house, approximately two minutes away. He told his mother what had happened, and she called the police. In the 911 call, Mr. El-Amine described the person who got out of the car as \u201cwearing a colorful jacket. He was kind of dark-skinned or brown-skinned, probably brown-skinned, and he had a long ... high-top fade.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">When the police arrived at his mother\u2019s house that night, Mr. El-Amine gave a description of the passenger and drew a picture of the haircut that he saw on the passenger of the car when he walked out of the 7-Eleven. A few days later, Mr. El-Amine went to the police station to look at photographs of potential suspects. He identified a photograph of an individual that he thought \u201cwas him, but The] wasn\u2019t sure.\u201d He explained that he chose the photograph based on the skin tone of the individual depicted, noting that, during the robbery, he was able to see the individual\u2019s \u201ceyes and the skin around his eyes and part of the nose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Detective Adam Hart, a member of the Montgomery County Police Department, testified that, on February 15, 2013, he executed two search warrants, one at 816 Easley Street and the other at 632 Potomac Avenue. When he executed the Easley Street warrant, there were four individuals inside: appellant, Dayquan Tyler, Michael Tyler, and Diante Tyler.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Detective Hart identified a photograph of appellant taken that day, at the time of appellant\u2019s arrest. The photograph was admitted into evidence as State\u2019s Exhibit 7, and it depicted appellant with a high-top fade haircut.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">When Detective Hart executed the warrant at 816 Easley Street, Dayquan was sleeping on the floor in the living room, and appellant was sleeping on a bed in the master bedroom. Detective Hart found appellant\u2019s birth certificate and social security card at the residence. In the middle of the living room, there was a ladder with a red and white Helly Hansen ski jacket on top of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Detective Hart then executed the warrant at 632 Potomac Avenue. In the bedroom basement of that residence, behind a locked door to which he had retrieved the keys from Day-quan\u2019s pocket during the search at 816 Easley Street, Detective Hart found a birth certificate and social security application for Dayquan Tyler. He also found a blue \u201cOtterBox\u201d case for an iPhone5. A functional firearm was recovered from a dog house behind Dayquan\u2019s residence. The mixture of DNA recovered from the firearm was not suitable for comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Detective Jesse Dickensheets, a member of the Montgomery County Police Department, testified that, on February 13, 2013, three days after the robbery, he saw appellant walk out of 816 Easley Street wearing a red and white Helly Hansen jacket. Detective Dickensheets identified a photograph of the jacket and identified appellant in court as the individual who had been wearing the jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">At trial, Mr. El-Amine identified the OtterBox and the jacket that had been stolen from him. His iPhone5 was not recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">Appellant\u2019s first argument is that the court \u201cerred in permitting the State\u2019s improper argument about facts not in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>record.\u201d Specifically, he contends that the court should not have permitted the State to: (1) point out that appellant had changed his hairstyle between the time of his arrest and the trial; and (2) insinuate that appellant\u2019s DNA and fingerprints were found on the OtterBox iPhone case recovered from Dayquan\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">The State disagrees. It contends that the court properly exercised its discretion in controlling closing argument, asserting that: (1) the comments regarding appellant\u2019s hair were \u201cappropriate and relevant\u201d where identity was an issue, and (2) appellant mischaracterizes the argument regarding the OtterBox.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">It is well established that \u201cattorneys are afforded great leeway in presenting closing arguments to the jury.\u201d <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 429, 722 A.2d 887 (1999). <em>Accord Sivells v. State, </em>196 Md.App. 254, 270, 9 A.3d 123 (2010), <em>cert. dis\u2019d as improv. granted, </em>421 Md. 659, 28 A.3d 704 (2011). The Court of Appeals defined the boundaries of permissible summation in <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 326 A.2d 707 (1974), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aoo-dedup-0\">As to summation, it is, as a general rule, within the range of legitimate argument for counsel to state and discuss the evidence and all reasonable and legitimate inferences which may be drawn from the facts in evidence; and such comment or argument is afforded a wide range. Counsel is free to use the testimony most favorable to his side of the argument to the jury, and the evidence may be examined, collated, sifted and treated in his own way. Moreover, if counsel does not make any statement of fact not fairly deducible from the evidence^] his argument is not improper, although the inferences discussed are illogical and erroneous. Generally, counsel has the right to make any comment or argument that is warranted by the evidence proved or inferences therefrom; the prosecuting attorney is as free to comment legitimately and to speak fully, although harshly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>on the accused\u2019s action and conduct if the evidence supports his comments, as is accused\u2019s counsel to comment on the nature of the evidence and the character of witnesses which the (prosecution) produces....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABk\">While arguments of counsel are required to be confined to the issues in the cases on trial, the evidence and fair and reasonable deductions therefrom, and to arguments of opposing counsel, generally speaking, liberal freedom of speech should be allowed. There are no hard-and-fast limitations within which the argument of earnest counsel must be confined \u2014 no well-defined bounds beyond which the eloquence of an advocate shall not soar. He may discuss the facts proved or admitted in the pleadings, assess the conduct of the parties, and attack the credibility of witnesses. He may indulge in oratorical conceit or flourish and in illustrations and metaphorical allusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 412-13, 326 A.2d 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Nevertheless, there are limitations upon the scope of a proper closing argument. The Court of Appeals has emphasized that \u201ccounsel should not be permitted by the court, over proper objection, to state and comment upon facts not in evidence or to state what he could have proven. Persistence in such course of conduct may furnish good grounds for a new trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 326 A.2d 707. <em>Accord Lee v. State, </em>405 Md. 148, 166, 950 A.2d 125 (2008) (improper to make comments \u201cthat invite the jury to draw inferences from information that was not admitted at trial\u201d). Reversal is required, however, only \u201c \u2018where it appears that the remarks of the prosecutor actually misled the jury or were likely to have misled or influenced the jury to the prejudice of the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spain v. State, </em>386 Md. 145, 158, 872 A.2d 25 (2005) (quoting <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 431, 722 A.2d 887).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The determination and scope of closing argument is within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Wise v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 127, 142, 751 A.2d 24, <em>cert. denied, </em>360 Md. 276, 757 A.2d 811 (2000). An appellate court should not \u201cinterfere with that judgment unless there has been an <em>abuse of discre</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number><em>tion </em>by the trial judge of a character likely to have injured the complaining party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Washington v. State, </em>180 Md.App. 458, 473, 951 A.2d 885 (2008) (quoting <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 413, 326 A.2d 707). \u201c \u2018Abuse of discretion\u2019 ... has been said to occur \u2018where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court,\u2019 or when the court acts \u2018without reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nash v. State, </em>439 Md. 53, 67, 94 A.3d 23 (quoting <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 13, 648 A.2d 1025 (1994)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 284, 190 L.Ed.2d 209 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">With these principles in mind, we address appellant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Appellant\u2019s Changed Appearance</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">At the close of the evidence, the court and counsel discussed jury instructions. The court declined to give an instruction on consciousness of guilt, despite the State\u2019s argument that appellant\u2019s change in hairstyle could be construed as such. The court stated that \u201ccutting your hair, alone\u201d was not enough to warrant that instruction. It stated, however, that the State could address that issue in closing, stating: \u201cI think that the Defense is certainly free to argue that he cut his hair. From February \u2014 it\u2019s now December. I think both of you have that argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">During the State\u2019s closing arguments, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Now, what did George Pickett look like on February 15? Here we go.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] What does George Pickett look like today? Do you think that was an accident that Mr. Pickett cut his hair? Black\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-13\">[THE COURT]: overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: \u2014 male, shorter than the victim, dark skin, high top fade. That\u2019s what George Pickett looked like on the night that he robbed Mr. El-Amine, but he is smarter than to look like that today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Defense counsel, in his closing argument, challenged Mr. El-Amine\u2019s identification of appellant, noting that when Mr. El-Amine identified appellant\u2019s photograph, he did not say: \u201c \u2018That\u2019s the guy. I\u2019m 100 percent certain that\u2019s the guy. He doesn\u2019t say that. He says: T think so.\u2019 And on the witness stand he said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m not really sure.\u2019 \u201d Counsel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5-\">But you know what the most telling thing ... is? He\u2019s in the same courtroom \u2014 I was going to say \u2014 maybe is that 20 feet away? Maybe. Was he asked yesterday in court, \u201cDo you see the person who robbed you?\u201d He wasn\u2019t even asked that. You know why? Because he couldn\u2019t say yes. He couldn\u2019t say yes. He doesn\u2019t know. That\u2019s the truth. He doesn\u2019t know who did this robbery. What he has done is he has assumed that the people in the parking lot of the 7/11 that that\u2019s the same people. That\u2019s what he\u2019s done. He\u2019s made an assumption. You can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t assume that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">In rebuttal, the State responded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">You heard that there is no difference between direct evidence which would be [Mr. El-Amine] standing over there saying it\u2019s him. He\u2019s drastically changed his appearance ladies and gentleman, drastically.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">The court overruled appellant\u2019s objection, and the State continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">He identified him three days after the crime occurred. Three days. And that same day he\u2019s wearing [Mr. El-Amine\u2019s] property and his co-conspirator is found to be in possession of further property and the weapon. He saw him in the 7/11 parking lot and with no equivocation he knew it was the exact same person. And that was something [appellant\u2019s counsel] did not focus on. She focused on the actual 30 seconds of the robbery. I\u2019m asking you to focus on all of it together. Not to exclude what he says he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>saw at the 7/11. Because when he calls 911, what does he say? It\u2019s the guy with the high top fade. He did not see that high top fade in the actual 30 seconds of the robbery. He made that identification based on knowing that it was the same two men in the exact same car that followed him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOX\">Appellant contends that the State\u2019s references in closing arguments to his changed hairstyle between the time of assault and the time of trial were improper for two reasons: (1) the State could not rely on appellant\u2019s appearance because he did not testify, and therefore, there was no evidence to establish what appellant\u2019s hairstyle looked like at trial; and (2) the evidence was not relevant because \u201cpost-apprehension changes in appearance do not constitute proper consciousness-of-guilt evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The State contends that where, as here, identity was at issue, it \u201cwas appropriate for the prosecutor to emphasize to the jury that [appellant] looked different at trial than he did on the day of the crime.\u201d That argument, it asserts, accomplished three legitimate purposes: (1) it reminded the jury that appellant looked different in court from how he looked on the day of the crime; (2) it explained why Mr. El-Amine may not have been able to make an in-court identification; and (3) it appropriately suggested consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In any event, the State argues, even if there was error, it was harmless. The jury had the opportunity to observe appellant\u2019s hairstyle; thus, the jury \u201ccould make its own decision about whether [he] had the same or a different hairstyle from the man whom [Mr.] El-Amine described as his assailant, the man in the still photographs taken shortly before the crime and the man in the photo array.\u201d And the court specifically instructed the jury that it must base its decision on evidence, and that closing arguments are not evidence, but are only intended to help the jury understand the evidence and apply the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">We begin our analysis with <em>Bryant v. State, </em>129 Md.App. 150, 741 A.2d 495 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 Md. 164, 747 A.2d 645 (2000), upon which appellant relies. In that case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>prosecutor commented in closing argument on the defendant\u2019s demeanor during trial, asking the jury if it noticed the failure of the defendant to look a witness in the eye. This Court held that the argument was improper, stating that prosecutorial comment \u201con the passive courtroom demeanor of a non-testifying defendant\u201d was not appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 161, 741 A.2d 495. We further stated that the prosecutor compounded the impropriety by adding her personal assurance that the alleged conduct occurred, saying: \u2018We all saw it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 161, 741 A.2d 495. The Court stated: \u201c \u2018Generally, it has been held improper to remark on the personal appearance of an accused, except where identity is in issue or where the remark is with respect to the accused\u2019s appearance while testifying.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159, 741 A.2d 495 (quoting <em>Campbell v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 498, 505, 501 A.2d 111 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">This case is distinguishable from <em>Bryant. </em>Unlike in that case, the prosecutor here was not commenting on appellant\u2019s demeanor or off-the-witness-stand courtroom conduct. Rather, the comments focused on appellant\u2019s hairstyle, an objective fact that the jury could see. There is a significant difference between comment on passive courtroom demeanor and comment on an undisputed, and significant, change in physical appearance. <em>See Diggs &amp; Allen v. State, </em>213 Md.App. 28, 81, 73 A.3d 306 (2013) (where prosecutor \u201csimply asked the jury to compare an aspect of the physical appearance and mannerisms of the man in the video, who is clearly visible on screen, to the physical appearance and mannerisms of Diggs, who sat in the courtroom before the jury\u201d argument was not improper), <em>ajfd on other grounds sub nom., </em>440 Md. 643, 103 A.3d 700 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Other courts have addressed whether it is appropriate for a prosecutor to comment on a defendant\u2019s change in appearance between the time of the crime and the time of trial. Such a comment has been held to be appropriate where, as here, identity is at issue. <em>See Commonwealth v. Horwat, </em>511 Pa. 398, 515 A.2d 514, 516 (1986) (appropriate for prosecutor to comment on change in appearance where change may affect ability of witness to identify the defendant); <em>People v. Sand</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>ers, </em>213 A.D.2d 432, 622 N.Y.S.2d 986, 987 (1995) (\u201c[Ijdentifi-cation of the defendant was a relevant factor in this trial, the prosecutor\u2019s reference during summation to the defendant\u2019s changed hair style, as evidenced by a photograph of the defendant at the time of his arrest, was fair comment upon the \u2018four corners of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Moreover, where there is an undisputed significant change in appearance, other courts have held that it is not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to permit the prosecutor to argue that the change permits an inference of the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt. <em>See United States v. Foppe, </em>993 F.2d 1444, 1450 (9th Cir.) (no error for prosecutor to argue that Foppe grew beard to disguise himself and prevent the eyewitness and the jury from identifying him as the robber), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1017, 114 S.Ct. 615, 126 L.Ed.2d 579 (1993); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>476 F.2d 249, 251-53 (7th Cir.1973) (prosecutor may comment on a marked change in defendant\u2019s physical appearance, i.e., cropping Afro haircut short, shaving mustache and growing a goatee, as some evidence of guilt); <em>People v. Cunningham, </em>25 Cal.4th 926, 108 Cal.Rptr.2d 291, 25 P.3d 519, 568 (2001) (comment on defendant\u2019s change of appearance between crime and trial not improper because it relates to identity and consciousness of guilt), cert. <em>denied, </em>534 U.S. 1141, 122 S.Ct. 1092, 151 L.Ed.2d 991 (2002). <em>See also Commonwealth v. Brown, </em>544 Pa. 406, 676 A.2d 1178, 1183 (court properly admitted evidence that appellant grew a beard shortly after his arrest because \u201cfa] jury may infer consciousness of guilt upon finding that a defendant intentionally altered his physical appearance for the purpose of avoiding identification\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1043, 117 S.Ct. 614, 136 L.Ed.2d 538 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">We agree with this analysis. Accordingly, we hold that it is not an abuse of discretion for a trial court to allow a prosecutor to comment on a significant change in the physical appearance of the defendant between the time of the crime and the trial where the change relates to identity and consciousness of guilt. Here, identity was the primary issue, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the prosecutor to argue that appellant\u2019s change in hairstyle was made to avoid identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Lack of Forensic Testing on OtterBox Case</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Appellant\u2019s next complaint about the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument is that the court erred in allowing the prosecutor, in rebuttal closing argument, to insinuate that appellant\u2019s DNA and fingerprints were found on the OtterBox iPhone case, even though it \u201cpresented absolutely no forensic evidence, whatsoever.\u201d The State contends that appellant mischaracterizes the prosecutor\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">In closing argument, appellant\u2019s counsel criticized the State for not examining the iPhone case, the blue Otterbox, for fingerprints and DNA. Counsel stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">What else could the State have done? WTiat else could they have given to the crime lab, to Mary Green ... to try to test for DNA? [<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] How about this? How about the blue Otter-Box? According to [Mr. El-Amine] the robber took this in his hand. Obviously gave it to [Dayquan]. But they could have tested this. Mary Green told you and you\u2019ll be able to touch it yourself. They can get DNA off plastic surfaces like this. They didn\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t know why. They could have. It wouldn\u2019t have been that hard, but they chose not to. I wish they had. So, no OtterBox DNA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">What about fingerprints? I know in the age of DNA it seems a little outmoded maybe, but there are still people who do fingerprints. The State chose not to do that. Could have done that. Could have tried on both the gun and the OtterBox, but they did neither. Again, wish they had.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>In the State\u2019s rebuttal argument, the prosecutor responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-4\">[THE STATE]: And putting out DNA, finger prints, that is all a red herring to confuse you. Because if we had that ... OtterBox, [appellant\u2019s counsel] would be up here saying oh all it does is show\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">[THE STATE]: \u2014 that [appellant] touched the OtterBox. Not that he committed the robbery. What if there was his DNA on the OtterBox? Oh he touched it, they\u2019re together all the time. They sleep over at each other\u2019s houses, they\u2019re riding around in cars together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">[THE STATE]: That\u2019s exactly what would be said. It is a red herring and we\u2019re asking you to focus on the evidence that we have given you which beyond all doubt proves that....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">We disagree with appellant\u2019s characterization of the State\u2019s closing argument. The State\u2019s argument did not, as appellant contends, insinuate that appellant\u2019s DNA and fingerprint were found on the iPhone case. Rather, it was merely a response to appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s argument regarding forensic evidence, asserting that the lack of DNA evidence and fingerprints was irrelevant, a \u201cred herring.\u201d The prosecutor asked the jury to focus, not on this \u201cred herring,\u201d but \u201con the evidence that we have given you.\u201d We perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">Appellant\u2019s next contention involves the court\u2019s instruction to the jury regarding eyewitness identification. He asserts that the instruction was improper because Mr. ElAmine\u2019s eyewitness identification was \u201cuncertain\u201d and \u201cdubious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The State contends that we should not review this claim because appellant affirmatively agreed to the instruction given. Moreover, it asserts that there was no error, much less plain error, because Mr. El-Amine\u2019s selection of appellant\u2019s photo in the photo array constituted \u201csome evidence\u201d to generate the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Prior to instructing the jury, the court discussed the jury instructions, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">THE COURT: Okay. Pattern instruction 3.30: identification of Defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">The court then gave an instruction consistent with Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction (\u201cMPJI-Cr\u201d) 3:30,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">The burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense was committed and that George Pickett was the person who committed it. You have heard evidence about the identification of George Pickett as the person who committed the crime. You should consider the witness\u2019s opportunity to observe the criminal act and the person committing it including the length of time the witness had to observe the person committing the crime, the witness\u2019s state of mind, and any other circumstance surrounding the event. You should also consider the witness\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>certainty or lack of certainty, the accuracy of any prior description, and the witness\u2019s credibility or lack of credibility as well as any other factors surrounding the identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">You have heard evidence that prior to this trial a witness identified George Pickett in a photo array. The identification of George Pickett by a single eye witness as the person who committed the crime if believed beyond a reasonable doubt can be enough evidence to convict George Pickett. However, you should examine the identification of George Pickett with great care. It is for you to determine the reliability of any identification and give it the weight you believe it deserves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Appellant made no objection to the instruction as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Appellant acknowledges that, because he did not object to the instruction, his contention in this regard is not preserved for this Court\u2019s review. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-325(e) (\u201cNo party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection.\u201d); Md. Rule 8-131 (a) (An appellate court ordinarily will not decide an issue \u201cunless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d). Not only did appellant fail to argue below that the court\u2019s instructions were erroneous, he affirmatively agreed to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Appellant argues, however, that we should review this claim for plain error. In <em>Kelly v. State, </em>195 Md.App. 403, 6 A.3d 396 (2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 Md. 502, 10 A.3d 1181 <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2119, 179 L.Ed.2d 912 (2011), this Court recognized that we have discretion under Md. Rule 8-131(a) to address an unpreserved issue. We stated, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">[i]t is a discretion that appellate courts should rarely exercise, as considerations of both fairness and judicial efficiency ordinarily require that all challenges that a party desires to make to a trial court\u2019s ruling, action, or conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>be presented in the first instance to the trial court so that (1) a proper record can be made with respect to the challenge, and (2) the other parties and the trial judge are given an opportunity to consider and respond to the challenge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 431, 6 A.3d 396 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">We further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">\u201cPlain error is \u2018error which vitally affects a defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial.\u2019 \u201d Appellate courts will exercise their discretion to review an unpreserved error under the plain error doctrine \u201conly when the \u2018unobjected to error [is] compelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d \u201c[A]ppellate review under the plain error doctrine \u20181) always has been, 2) still is, and 3) will continue to be a rare, rare phenomenon.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 431-32,131 S.Ct. 2119 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Appellant has not convinced us to exercise our discretion to engage in plain error review in this case, where the court gave a pattern instruction, to which appellant\u2019s counsel agreed and referenced in her closing argument.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This is not one of those rare cases that warrants plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">Admission of Photographs</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">Appellant\u2019s next contention involves the admission of photographs. He asserts that the court erred in admitting these photographs because the State failed to authenticate them, and they were prejudicial. The State contends that this Court should decline to engage in plain error review of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Prior to trial, the State moved <em>in limine </em>to introduce a video captured by a Montgomery County Police surveillance camera approximately two hours before the robbery of Mr. El-Amine. The videotape depicted appellant and Dayquan attempting to steal a police \u201cbait car\u201d located at 525 Thayer Avenue, 7/10 of a mile from the scene of the crime at issue in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The trial court agreed with appellant that the videotape of the bait car incident should be excluded as impermissible other crimes evidence that was unduly prejudicial. It ruled, however, that the State could introduce photographs derived from the video that \u201cdistinctively show [appellant] and his hairstyle,\u201d as well as appellant and Dayquan together. It stated that the photographs were to be admitted in a \u201cvery controlled\u201d manner, with no reference to auto theft. Rather, the photographs would be accompanied by testimony that they were \u201ctaken by Montgomery County Police equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">At a subsequent hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel asked the court to revisit the issue of allowing the State to introduce the photographs as those taken by police equipment. After the court noted that it made that ruling to prevent an authentication issue, appellant\u2019s counsel suggested that the photographs be identified as taken by \u201cMontgomery County government equipment\u201d at 525 Thayer Avenue at 12:24 a.m. on February 10, 2013. Appellant stated that he was willing to stipulate to the admission of the photographs so identified, as long as he could preserve his earlier objection on \u201cother crimes\u201d and prejudice grounds. The prosecutor, however, stated that she would introduce the photographs through the testimony of Detective Hart. The court clarified that the State could ask Detective Hart about \u201cwhere it was taken, the time, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>location\u201d and establish that the photographs were taken by \u201cMontgomery County government equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Consistent with appellant\u2019s suggestion and the court\u2019s ruling, Detective Hart identified the photographs, stating only that they were taken by \u201cMontgomery County government equipment\u201d on February 10, 2013, at 12:24 a.m., at 525 Thayer Avenue in Silver Spring. He further testified that the photographs were taken 7/10 of a mile from were Mr. El-Amine was robbed, approximately two hours prior to the robbery. Appellant did not object to Detective Hart\u2019s testimony or to the introduction of the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Appellant\u2019s Contention</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Appellant argues on appeal that, because Detective Hart \u201cfailed to offer first-hand knowledge about the photographs or the process used to produce them,\u201d and \u201cfailed to establish a chain of custody,\u201d the State failed to authenticate the photographs. He also contends that the photos were prejudicial, asserting that the photographs were the \u201conly evidence\u201d placing him in the vicinity of the 7-Eleven during the period of time leading up to the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">As we previously indicated, plain error review is a \u201crare, rare phenomenon,\u201d undertaken only when unobjected to error is extraordinary. <em>Kelly, </em>195 Md.App. at 432, 6 A.3d 396. Here, where appellant initially stipulated to the admission of the photos, and the State\u2019s limited questioning was at the request of appellant, we decline to exercise our discretion to engage in plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">Exclusion of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that the court improperly excluded evidence of GPS data that would have shown that the stolen iPhone was in Dayquan\u2019s possession in the days following the crime. The State contends that this claim is moot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>because appellant\u2019s counsel stated that he was not seeking to admit such evidence, and he never made a proffer regarding the evidence he wanted to elicit. In any event, the State asserts that the claim is without merit because evidence that the \u201cFind My iPhone\u201d app located the phone at Dayquan\u2019s residence \u201cwas neither relevant nor authenticated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Mr. El-Amine\u2019s iPhone5 was never recovered. Mr. El-Amine testified that he had an application on his iPhone5 called \u201cFind My iPhone App,\u201d the purpose of which is to locate a cellular phone that is missing or stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">On cross-examination, appellant\u2019s counsel asked Mr. El-Amine whether he tried to use the app on the night of the robbery. Mr. El-Amine responded in the affirmative, and defense counsel asked if he was able to do that. The prosecution objected, and the following ensued at a bench conference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: This is going to bring the phone back to [Dayquan\u2019s] ... house, but it\u2019s like three days later. I mean, we never heard from, nor were we able to get any verified reference from Apple, so this is just like a screen-shot of where he saw his phone pop up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">And none of it is verifiable. One ping comes across from [Dayquan\u2019s]; we next have pings that were on 16th Street. So, all of this could be hearsay as to where these pings popped up and what he read off of his mom\u2019s phone that he was using to try to find his phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-11\">[2nd PROSECUTOR]: Those pings have to come in through Apple....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-12\">THE COURT: Well, she\u2019s not asking about the pinging. [PROSECUTOR]: She\u2019s about to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-13\">THE COURT: She\u2019s just asking him what it says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: Well, asking what it says is a ping. What it said is where the phone is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">So, that\u2019s hearsay that\u2019s coming over this device, his mom\u2019s device to him. That is not admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">THE COURT: Yeah, but it\u2019s someone he saw. [PROSECUTOR]: Yeah, but it\u2019s still not admissible if he\u2019s not allowed to say that, \u201cApple sent me a text that said \u2018this\u2019.\u201d We would need to have records from Apple that say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, right now I\u2019m not asking about what it said, <em>I\u2019m just asking if he has the application and if he tried to use it. </em>So I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gone\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: All right. Well, if we go any further, that\u2019s what we thought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">[2nd PROSECUTOR]: The result of where that ping comes ... would be hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-10\">THE COURT: Okay. <em>But she\u2019s not asking any of that. She\u2019s asking did he have the app and did he try to use it, is as far as we got.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-12\">THE COURT: So, overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">Immediately after the court overruled the State\u2019s objection, the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-15\">THE COURT: Okay. You want to restate the question or repeat it so he\u2019ll understand. <em>Do you remember the question?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-16\">[MR. EL-AMINE]: <em>Yes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-17\">THE COURT: Okay. Well then we got to \u2014 okay. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-18\">[MR. EL-AMINE]: <em>Well, I was able [to] log onto the computer to that </em>\u2014 I\u2019m <em>not sure if they located the phone that night. I know everyday that night and everyday after that, I looked for it. </em>I remember there was a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: <em>So, you did try to use that application?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">[MR. EL-AMINE]: <em>Yes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. All right. Let me ask you some other questions. Excuse me, one moment. A couple days later did you get a phone call? Is that what happened? From the police asking you to come to the station?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">[MR. EL-AMINE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">(Emphasis added). Appellant\u2019s counsel did not ask any further questions regarding the \u201cFind My iPhone\u201d app.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">On appeal, appellant claims that the court erred in excluding, on hearsay grounds, \u201cexculpatory evidence tending to show that [Dayquan], and not [appellant], was the assailant.\u201d He asserts that the data on the \u201cFind My iPhone App\u201d was \u201cadmissible to show that the stolen iPhone was in [Dayquan\u2019s] possession in the days following the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">The colloquy listed above, however, shows that appellant did not present that issue to the trial court. Appellant\u2019s counsel initially stated that she was \u201cjust asking\u201d if Mr. El-Amine had the \u201cFind My iPhone\u201d app and \u201cwhether he tried to use it.\u201d That testimony was elicited. When Mr. El-Amine subsequently began to answer a question beyond that which was asked, the prosecutor objected. As the State notes, the court may have sustained the objection because Mr. El-Amine was exceeding the scope of the question, or because he was going to give an answer to a question that appellant had assured the court he would not elicit. Appellant did not ask any further questions on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">Nor did counsel make any proffer regarding the evidence that she sought to elicit. \u201cWhere evidence is excluded, a proffer of substance and relevance must be made in order to preserve the issue for appeal.\u201d <em>South Kaywood Cmty. Ass\u2019n v. Long, </em>208 Md.App. 135, 163, 56 A.3d 365 (2012) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>(quoting <em>Sutton v.

Espinal-Almeida, </em>699 F.3d 588 (1st Cir.2012) (discussing foundational requirements for admission of GPS data). Because appellant\u2019s counsel did not ask a question seeking to elicit an answer that he now says was improperly excluded, and because counsel did not proffer how such an answer was properly admissible, this issue is not preserved for appeal.
