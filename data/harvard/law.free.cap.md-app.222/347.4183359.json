The employer in the first case, appellant, Maryland Transit Administration (\u201cMTA\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision regarding MTA employee, Salvatore Glorioso\u2019s, claim in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on December 26, 2013. Following a hearing on April 21, 2014, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision. The employer in the second case, appellant, Baltimore County (\u201cCounty\u201d), filed a petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision regarding County firefighter, Gary Shipp\u2019s, claim in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on December 18, 2013. Subsequently, the County and SIF filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Following a hearing on July 29, 2014, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County granted SIF\u2019s motion and denied the County\u2019s. Both MTA and the County timely appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">We are asked to determine whether LE requires employers to pay the 6.5% assessment to SIF based on the full amount of all permanent disability awards regardless of any offset for retirement benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We answer this question in the affirmative and, accordingly, affirm the circuit courts\u2019 judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">SIF is a State agency created by the Maryland General Assembly to pay part of a workers\u2019 compensation claim when an injured employee has a preexisting medical or physical condition that exacerbates his or her work-related injury. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-802. When an employee who is injured on the job has this type of preexisting condition, the employer compensates the employee only for any disability directly attributable to the employment-related incident, and SIF compensates the employee for the additional extent of the disability attributable to the preexisting condition. <em>Id.; Subsequent Injury Fund v. Kraus, </em>301 Md. 111, 115, 482 A.2d 468 (1984). In establishing SIF, the General Assembly sought to encourage employers to hire individuals with preexisting medical or physical conditions. <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Pack, </em>250 Md. 306, 308, 242 A.2d 506 (1968) (\u201cIts purpose was to persuade the employer to employ the handicapped individual by limiting the liability, which the employer may otherwise have incurred\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">SIF\u2019s sole revenue source is a statutory assessment that the Commission imposes on an employer or its insurer whenever the Commission makes an \u201caward ... for permanent disability or death\u201d or approves a settlement. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7. 9-806(a). The assessment is \u201c6.5%, payable to [SIF], on: (i) each award against an employer or its insurer for permanent disability or death, including awards for disfigurement and mutilation;\u201d or \u201c(ii) ... each amount payable by an employer or its insurer under a settlement agreement approved by the Commission[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">A. The MTA Award</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">It is undisputed that in 2010, Glorioso suffered a work-related injury and subsequently filed a claim with the Corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>mission. After hearing the matter on August 80, 2012, the Commission issued a decision on September 11, 2012, finding that Glorioso had a permanent partial disability \u201camounting to 30% industrial loss of use of the body as a result of an injury to the back.\u201d As a result, the Commission awarded $46,050.00, which it detailed as follows: \u201cat the rate of $307.00, payable weekly, beginning May 3, 2012, for a period of 150 weeks.\u201d Because Glorioso also received disability retirement benefits from the MTA, however, the Commission added that pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-610,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the compensation was \u201csubject to an offset effective April 1, 2012 in the amount of $118.27,\u201d thus lowering the award to $28,309.50. In addition, the Commission noted that the award was \u201csubject to a total assessment of ... 6.5% ... on the amount payable pursuant to [LE] \u00a7 9-806[.]\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">On August 9, 2013, SIF filed Issues with the Commission, asserting that that MTA and its insurer \u201crefuse to pay the 6.5% assessment on the award dated 9/11/12.\u201d SIF requested a hearing and took \u201cthe position ... that the assessment is due on the amount of the award regardless of any offset for retirement benefits,\u201d for a total of $2,993.25. Following a hearing on November 20, 2013, the Commission issued an order on December 17, 2013, directing MTA to \u201cpay the assessment of 6.5% on the award of 30% loss of use of the body, as awarded [on] September 11, 2012[.]\u201d The Commission reasoned that the General Assembly specifically used the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>term \u201camount payable\u201d when imposing the assessment on settlement agreements but not when imposing it on awards for permanent disability or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">B. The County Award</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">It is undisputed that in 2002, Shipp became disabled as a result of hypertension and coronary artery disease and, thereafter, filed a claim with the Commission. After hearing the matter on February 9, 2012, the Commission issued a decision on March 5, 2012, finding that Shipp had a permanent partial disability \u201camounting to 50% industrial loss of use of the body.\u201d As a result, the Commission awarded $174,825.00, which it detailed as follows: \u201cat the rate of $525.00, payable weekly, beginning May 14, 2012, for a period of 333 weeks[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">On March 7, 2012, upon realizing that the Commission did not account for the statutory offset resulting from Shipp\u2019s service retirement, the County filed a request for rehearing. Subsequently, the Commission issued a new order, adding the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">The Commission finds that the claimant is receiving a service retirement effective year 2002 in the amount of $31,488.54 per year or $605.55 per week. Pursuant to LE [\u00a7] 9-503(e),[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] the employer is entitled to offset as follows: Average Weekly Wage: $800.00 minus $605.55 = $194.45. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Therefore, the claimant\u2019s permanent partial disability shall be paid at the weekly rate of $194.45.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">This modification lowered the Commission\u2019s award to $64,751.85. In its order, the Commission also noted that the award was \u201csubject to a total assessment of ... 6.5% ... on the amount payable pursuant to [LE] \u00a7 9-806[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Thereafter, the County made payment to SIF in the amount of $4,208.87, or 6.5% of the award that resulted after subtracting the statutory offset. SIF requested a hearing, arguing that it was entitled to the balance of $11,363.68, which was 6.5% of the total award made by the Commission prior to accounting for the offset. Following a hearing on October 29, 2013, the Commission issued an order on December 12, 2013, directing the County to \u201cpay the assessment of 6.5% on the award of 50% loss of use of the body, as awarded [on] March 29, 2012[.]\u201d As in the MTA\u2019s and Glorioso\u2019s case, the Commission reasoned that the General Assembly specifically used the term \u201camount payable\u201d when imposing the assessment on settlement agreements but not when imposing it on awards for permanent disability or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">An appellate court reviews a grant of summary judgment by the Commission for \u201clegal correctness.\u201d <em>Wal Mart Stores, Inc. v. Holmes, </em>416 Md. 346, 358, 7 A.3d 13 (2010). Our role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is \u201cnarrow,\u201d however, and \u201cis limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>W.M. Schlosser Co. v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>414 Md. 195, 204, 994 A.2d 956 (2010) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Generally, \u201cthe decision of the Commission is presumed to be prima facie correct[.]\u201d LE \u00a7 9 \u2014 745(b)(1); <em>see also Cmty. Realty Co., Inc. v. Siskos, </em>31 Md.App. 99, 105, 354 A.2d 181 (1976) (citations omitted); <em>Ackerhalt v. Hanline </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>Bros., Inc., </em>253 Md. 13, 20, 252 A.2d 1 (1969) (citation omitted); <em>Krell v. Maryland Drydock Co., </em>184 Md. 428, 435, 41 A.2d 502 (1945). Although this presumption of correctness \u201cdoes not extend to questions of law,\u201d we nonetheless \u201cafford the Commission a degree of deference, as appropriate, in its formal interpretations of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Montgomery Cnty. v. Deibler, </em>423 Md. 54, 60, 31 A.3d 191 (2011) (citations omitted); <em>see also W.M. Schlosser Co., </em>414 Md. at 205, 994 A.2d 956 (\u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Hart v. Subsequent Injury Fund, </em>172 Md.App. 159, 166, 913 A.2d 666 (2006) (\u201cwe give due deference to the Commission\u2019s own interpretation of the statute it administers\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Appellants argue that SIF\u2019s assessment should be calculated using the amount payable to the claimant after the offset is granted. According to MTA, when LE \u00a7 9-806 is read in its entirety, \u201c[t]he most commonsensical and natural reading would be that the amount awarded is the amount actually [ ] paid,\u201d which then \u201cforms the basis of the calculation for the SIF assessment.\u201d Meanwhile, the County argues that the Commission did not have jurisdiction to determine the calculation of the assessment and, furthermore, that the Commission\u2019s decision goes against \u201cclear legislative intent.\u201d Based upon these contentions, appellants ask us to reverse the circuit court\u2019s judgment and remand with instructions to send the case back to the Commission for the purpose of recalculating SIF\u2019s assessment using the amount payable to the claimant after the offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In response, SIF argues that the Commission had jurisdiction to determine the correct amount of the assessment, and that its decision was correct because \u201cthe plain language of [LE \u00a7 9-806(a) ] requires that the Commission order a 6.5% assessment on the full amount of all awards for permanent disability or death.\u201d Alternatively, SIF asserts that, \u201ceven if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>the statute were ambiguous, this Court should defer to the Commission\u2019s reasonable interpretation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">At the outset, we address the County\u2019s assertion that the Commission did not have jurisdiction to determine the calculation of the assessment pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-806 because \u201cthe SIF assessment is clearly a tax\u201d and \u201cthe Commission\u2019s jurisdiction does not extend beyond administrative imposition of the same.\u201d As SIF correctly notes, the County\u2019s argument is \u201cbased entirely on a Court of Appeals opinion that the General Assembly later abrogated by statute.\u201d <em>See Workmen\u2019s Comp. Comm\u2019n v. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Guar. Corp., </em>319 Md. 1, 570 A.2d 323 (1990), <em>abrogated by </em>1995 Md. Laws, ch. 293. Indeed, the Court in <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Comm\u2019n </em>held that the assessment under LE \u00a7 9-806 was a \u201ctax[j\u201d for purposes of a statute exempting the Property and Casualty Guaranty Insurance Corporation from \u201call taxes levied by this State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4, 6, 570 A.2d 323. In 1995, however, the General Assembly amended LE \u00a7 9-806 \u2014 specifically subsection (e) \u2014 to clarify that \u201c[t]he assessment imposed under this section is for payment of claims submitted to the Subsequent Injury Fund and is <em>not a, tax </em>intended to benefit the State.\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>See </em>1995 Md. Laws, ch. 293 (\u201cAN ACT concerning Subsequent Injury Fund \u2014 Assessments Not a Tax FOR the purpose of providing that the assessment payable to the Subsequent Injury Fund is not a tax; and providing that the Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Corporation is subject to the assessment.\u201d). As such, we agree with SIF that even if the rationale in <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Comm\u2019n </em>could be extended to this context, it no longer has any force.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Having established that the Commission had jurisdiction over this matter, we turn to determine whether it was legally correct in reaching its conclusion. The relevant statute in this case, LE \u00a7 9-806, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">(a)(1) The Commission shall impose an assessment of 6.5%, payable to the Subsequent Injury Fund, on:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>(i) each award against an employer or its insurer for permanent disability or death, including awards for disfigurement and mutilation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">(ii) except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, each amount payable by an employer or its insurer under a settlement agreement approved by the Commission; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">(iii) each amount payable under item (i) or (ii) of this paragraph by the Property and Casualty Guaranty Corporation on behalf of an insolvent insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In interpreting this section, we begin by looking at the statutory language. <em>Philip Electronics N. Am. v. Wright, </em>348 Md. 209, 216-17, 703 A.2d 150 (1997), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Swedo, </em>439 Md. 441, 96 A.3d 210 (2014). If its plain meaning \u201cis clear and unambiguous, and consistent with both the broad purposes of the legislation, and the specific purpose of the provision being interpreted, our inquiry is at an end.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 703 A.2d 150 (citations omitted). Only \u201cwhen the meaning of the plain language is ambiguous or unclear [do] we seek to discern the intent of the legislature from surrounding circumstances, such as legislative history, prior case law, and the purposes upon which the statutory framework was based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">LE \u00a7 9-806(a)(l)(i) directs the Commission to \u201cimpose an assessment of 6.5%, payable to [SIF], on ... <em>each award </em>against an employer or its insurer <em>for permanent disability or death </em>[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). When the Commission issues an award for permanent disability, as it did in these consolidated cases, it determines the percentage loss of the body that the employee has suffered. Although that percentage is then used to calculate the dollar amount due to the claimant, the \u201caward\u201d itself is based on the claimant\u2019s \u201cpermanent disability,\u201d which does not change simply because the employer is entitled to an offset for some other reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Stated differently, the Commission awards the claimant a particular sum of money based on the extent of his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>injury. The final amount payable directly by the insurer or employer under the award may be reduced because of an offset for retirement benefits, but the \u201caward ... for permanent disability\u201d remains the same. Accordingly, regardless of whether there is an offset for retirement benefits, the claimant is still entitled to receive the full dollar amount of the award before the offset; however, a portion of the award is instead paid by the retirement system rather than directly by the employer. As SIF notes in its brief, \u201cthis in no way absolves the employer (or its insurer) from paying the assessment based on the full award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Other provisions of the statute further show that the \u201caward against an employer or its insurer for permanent disability or death\u201d must include more than just the \u201camount payable\u201d for purposes of calculating SIF\u2019s assessment. As the Commission noted, in contrast to LE \u00a7 9-806(a)(l)(i), which imposes the assessment on \u201ceach award,\u201d LE \u00a7 9-806(a)(l)(ii) imposes the assessment on the <em>\u201camount payable </em>by an employer or its insurer under a settlement agreement approved by the Commission!)]\u201d (Emphasis added). The General Assembly specifically chose not to use the same language when imposing the assessment on Commission awards. Had the General Assembly intended to limit SIF\u2019s assessment to the \u201camount payable\u201d under the award, it could have specified as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Moreover, the Commission\u2019s interpretation is consistent with the purpose of the assessment statute, which is to provide the \u201cprimary sources of monies for [SIF].\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Cooper v. Wicom-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>ico Cnty., Dep\u2019t of Pub. Works, </em>284 Md. 576, 578, 398 A.2d 1237 (1979). The assessment is \u201cessential to [SIF\u2019s] solvency\u201d and its mission to compensate employees with preexisting medical conditions after work-related accidents. <em>Id. </em>at 583, 398 A.2d 1237. If we adopt the appellants\u2019 argument, SIF would lose revenue whenever the employer or insurer is entitled to an offset for retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Appellants argue that it would be unfair to impose SIF\u2019s assessment on the full amount of the award when they are not actually paying the full amount of the award themselves. The assessment, as interpreted by the Commission, however, does not place a double burden on the public employer when the amount is based on the total award because the employer or its insurer pays no more to SIF than it would have paid had the employee not received any offsetting disability retirement benefits. Thus, the Legislature\u2019s goal of preventing government employers from having to pay disability benefits to an employee twice for the same injury would still be satisfied. <em>See Tsottles v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>55 Md. App. 58, 59, 460 A.2d 636 (1983) (\u201cthe Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act ... attempts to prevent double payment from the public treasury to civil servants for an injury arising out of the employment relationship\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Nooe v. City of Baltimore, </em>28 Md.App. 348, 352, 345 A.2d 134 (1975) (\u201cthe General Assembly was concerned with, and attempted to prohibit, governmental authorities being obliged to pay benefits to an employee twice as a result of the same injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Finally, the MTA cites two unrelated statutes, LE \u00a7\u00a7 9\u2014 804(b)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> &amp; 9-656(b),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to support its proposed interpretation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Those statutes, however, do not have any direct bearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>meaning of an \u201caward ... for permanent disability or death\u201d as stated in LE \u00a7 9-806. For example, LE \u00a7 9 \u2014 656(b) does not even use the word \u201caward,\u201d but rather focuses on SIF\u2019s liability for preexisting diseases or infirmities. And, although LE \u00a7 9-804(b) uses the word \u201caward,\u201d its usage supports to an extent our holding as to LE \u00a7 9-806 by differentiating between an \u201caward\u201d and a \u201cfinal compromise and settlement agreement\u201d when it provides that any prior permanent disability payment received by the covered employee must be deducted. In other words, LE \u00a7 9 \u2014 804(b) creates a further distinction between those two separate sums of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Therefore, having found no error in the Commission\u2019s interpretation of LE \u00a7 9-806, we uphold its ruling in both cases and affirm the circuit courts\u2019 judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AND THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.

That section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">(e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, any paid firefighter ... who is eligible for benefits under subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section or the dependents of those individuals shall receive the benefits in addition to any benefits that the individual or the dependents of the individual are entitled to receive under the retirement system in which the individual was a participant at the time of the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">(2) The benefits received under this title shall be adjusted so that the weekly total of those benefits and retirement benefits does not exceed the weekly salary that was paid to the ... firefighter....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">LE \u00a7 9-503(e). Because Shipp was a firefighter, the County\u2019s offset was based on LE \u00a7 9-503(e) instead of LE \u00a7 9-610. As SIF notes, \"it does not appear that there is any functional difference between an offset for retirement benefits under LE \u00a7 9-503(e) and the more common offset under LE \u00a7 9-610.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b379-6\">.

Whereas here, the Commission in these two cases carefully considered the statutory language during an adversarial adjudicatory proceeding and issued formal, written opinions that detailed the reasons for reaching its conclusion, we would have deferred to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Commission's interpretation had we found the language of LE \u00a7 9-806 to be ambiguous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\">.

MTA also notes that, in Glorioso's case, the amount paid to the attorney was calculated using the amount after the offset. According to MTA, it follows that \u201cthe Employer and Insurer should not have to pay the SIF Assessment\u201d based on the amount prior to the offset. This argument is flawed. Had the Commission intended for the employer to calculate SIF\u2019s assessment after the offset, it would have so specified as it did when it \"lurther ORDERED that from the final weeks of compensation the following fees shall be paid: Todd L.
