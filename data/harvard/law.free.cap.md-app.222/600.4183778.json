Consequently, the Montgomery County circuit court granted a mistrial as to those two charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Although the State initially announced its intention to retry Jones for first-degree felony murder, it later changed its mind, upon agreeing with Jones that there was no underlying felony to support that charge. Consequently, the State requested that the circuit court rule that, together with the handgun charge, second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault </em>was a charge \u201cpending\u201d against Jones. Over Jones\u2019s objection, the circuit court so ruled. This interlocutory appeal, from that ruling, followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">However, because second-degree murder <em>with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm, </em>the offense of which Jones was acquitted, and second degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault, </em>the charge upon which the State now wishes to proceed, are the same offense for double jeopardy purposes, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Shortly before midnight on August 20, 2010, Julian Kelly was beaten, robbed, and shot by a group of men while on his way home from work. This criminal episode began when, according to witnesses, Kelly was surrounded by \u201cmaybe ... five\u201d men who began \u201ckicking and punching\u201d him, upon his refusal to surrender his backpack and necklace. After he was knocked to the ground, one of Kelly\u2019s assailants stood over him and shot him five times, three times in the torso and twice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>in the head, wounds from which Kelly died several weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Identified as one of Kelly\u2019s assailants, Jones was tried before a jury, in the Montgomery County circuit court, for his purported participation in Kelly\u2019s robbery and murder. At trial, the State advanced two different theories of the role Jones played in the perpetration of those crimes. The first theory alleged that Jones, although not a participant in the robbery and the beating, shot Kelly after mistaking him for someone else. The second suggested that Jones had, in fact, participated in both the robbery and the beating and had shot Kelly when Kelly had refused to relinquish his belongings. In response, Jones, who did not testify at trial, attempted to establish through the testimony of several witnesses that he had merely been a bystander to the incident and that it had been one of Kelly\u2019s assailants, not he, who had fired the fatal shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">At the close of evidence, the court instructed the jury on first-degree murder, first-degree felony murder, second-degree murder <em>with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm, </em>armed robbery, robbery, and the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence. With respect to first-degree felony murder, the court instructed the jury that, in order to convict Jones of that offense, it must find that Jones murdered Kelly \u201cduring the commission\u201d of an underlying felony and that, here, the underlying felony could have been either armed robbery, robbery, or assault in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Section 2 \u2014 201(a)(4) of the Criminal Law Article<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> states that a murder \u201cis in the first degree\u201d if it is \u201ccommitted in the perpetration of or an attempt to perpetrate\u201d a number of enumerated felonies. Although robbery and armed robbery, two of the three offenses the court below included in its instructions, could underlie a finding of first-degree felony murder, first-degree assault cannot. Thus, both Jones and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>the State agree that that portion of the circuit court\u2019s instructions was an incorrect statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The jury found Jones not guilty of first-degree murder, second-degree murder <em>with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm, </em>robbery, and armed robbery. But, as previously noted, it was unable to reach a verdict on the charges of first-degree felony murder and the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence. When Jones moved for a mistrial with respect to those charges, the court granted that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The State then informed Jones of its intention to retry him on the two verdictless counts, that is, first-degree felony murder and the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence. Jones responded by moving for a judgment of acquittal as to the first-degree felony murder charge,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> asserting that, since first-degree assault was not a \u201cpredicate felony\u201d for a charge of first-degree felony murder, his acquittal on the charges of robbery and armed robbery meant that there was no felony that could serve as the underlying offense for the charge of first-degree felony murder. While conceding in its opposition to Jones\u2019s motion that it could not retry Jones on first-degree felony murder, the State insisted that it could retry him on the charge of second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault </em>because, though first-degree assault is not an underlying felony for a charge of first-degree felony murder, it can serve as an underlying felony for a charge of second-degree felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">After the court, at the hearing that ensued on Jones\u2019s motion, granted a judgment of acquittal as to first-degree felony murder, it turned to the State\u2019s request to retry Jones on the charge of second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number><em>degree assault. </em>Jones asserted that the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy barred the State from proceeding on such a charge. The circuit court, however, flatly rejected that claim. It stated that second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault </em>was a \u201cviable\u201d charge as it arose \u201cout of the facts of this case\u201d and because Jones had \u201cnot been acquitted\u201d of it or of the underlying offense of first-degree assault. Consequently, the court declared that \u201cdouble jeopardy would not bar the prosecution\u201d of Jones on the charge of second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault. </em>This interlocutory appeal followed, after which the circuit court stayed all proceedings pending our resolution of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Jones contends that his acquittal of second-degree murder <em>with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm </em>bars the State from re-prosecuting him for second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault. </em>He maintains that, since all of the elements of second-degree murder <em>with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm </em>are to be found in the elements of second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault, </em>and because only one of those two offenses includes an element that the other does not, the two offenses must be deemed to be the same for the purposes of double jeopardy, and, in that event, his acquittal of one offense would bar a subsequent prosecution for the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Preliminarily, we note that there is no dispute as to the propriety of this interlocutory appeal, given that a defendant \u201chas the right to immediate appellate review of an adverse ruling concerning a double jeopardy claim.\u201d <em>Kendall v. State, </em>429 Md. 476, 484 n. 10, 56 A.3d 223 (2012). And, in conducting that review, we give \u201cno deference to the lower court\u2019s resolution of the matter.\u201d <em>Scriber v. State, </em>437 Md. 399, 407, 86 A.3d 1260 (2014) (citing <em>Giddins v. State, </em>393 Md. 1, 15, 899 A.2d 139 (2006)). In short, we perform a review de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>With that guiding principle in mind, we begin our analysis by noting that the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution precludes any person from being \u201ctwice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const, amend V. In other words, an accused cannot be made \u201ctwice accountable for the same offense.\u201d <em>State v. Long, </em>405 Md. 527, 536, 954 A.2d 1083 (2008), a prohibition that is applicable to the states \u201cthrough the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d <em>Scriber, </em>437 Md. at 407, 86 A.3d 1260. What is more, \u201cMaryland common law provides well-established protections for individuals against being twice put in jeopardy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408, 86 A.3d 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Specifically, the prohibition against double jeopardy bars \u201cmultiple punishments and trials for the same offense.\u201d <em>Long, </em>405 Md. at 536, 954 A.2d 1083 (citing <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332, 343, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975)). The \u201cappropriate test for determining whether [two] different statutory or common law offenses\u201d are to be \u201ctreated as the same offense for double jeopardy purposes\u201d is the \u201crequired evidence test.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>364 Md. 354, 369-70, 772 A.2d 1240 (2001). That test \u201cfocuses upon the evidence necessary to sustain a conviction on each offense.\u201d <em>Thomas v. State, </em>277 Md. 257, 262, 353 A.2d 240 (1976). If each offense \u201crequires proof of a fact which the other does not, or ... if each offense contains an element which the other does not, the offenses are not the same for double jeopardy purposes even though arising from the same conduct or episode.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, 353 A.2d 240. But, of particular relevance to the issue before us in this appeal, two offenses are considered \u201cthe same within the meaning of the prohibition against double jeopardy,\u201d and thus successive prosecutions are barred, \u201cwhere only one offense requires proof of an additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>fact, so that all elements of one offense are present in the other.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">In the instant case, the question before us is whether the offense of second-degree murder <em>with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm </em>\u2014 of which Jones was acquitted \u2014 and the offense of second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault </em>\u2014 on which the State now wishes to proceed \u2014 must be \u201cdeemed to be the same\u201d for \u201cdouble jeopardy purposes,\u201d under the required evidence test. To answer this question, we must decide whether all the elements of the latter offense are elements of the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Under section 2-204(a) of the Criminal Law Article, a \u201cmurder that is not in the first degree ... is in the second degree.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Md. Code Crim. Law \u00a7 2-204(a) (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.) (\u201cCL\u201d). Although the statute itself does not further define that offense, there are, according to Maryland decisional law, \u201cfour different types\u201d of second-degree murder. They are: first, the killing of another person, other than by poison or lying in wait, with the intent to kill but without the deliberation and premeditation required for first-degree murder; second, the killing of another person with the intent to inflict such serious bodily harm that death would be the likely result; third, \u201cdepraved heart murder,\u201d which is to say, \u201ca killing resulting from \u2018the deliberate perpetration of a knowingly dangerous act with reckless and wanton unconcern and indifference as to whether anyone is harmed or not\u2019 \u201d; and fourth, \u201cmurder committed in the perpetration of a felony other than those enumerated in the first-degree murder stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>utes.\u201d <em>Thornton v. State, </em>397 Md. 704, 721-22, 721 n. 6, 919 A.2d 678 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The second of these four \u201ctypes\u201d of second-degree murder was the one on which the jury was instructed at Jones\u2019s trial, namely, second-degree murder <em>with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm. </em>Although this type of second-degree murder is a specific-intent crime, it does not require the State to prove a \u201cconscious or purposeful design\u201d on the part of the defendant \u201cto kill the victim,\u201d but only a specific intent to inflict \u201cserious\u201d or \u201cgrievous bodily harm\u201d; in other words, the intent \u201cto cause such severe harm that death would be the likely result, not merely a possible result,\u201d of the defendant\u2019s intentional conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 730-31, 919 A.2d 678 (emphasis in original). That is to say, \u201ca defendant should only be held liable\u201d for second-degree murder <em>with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm </em>\u201cif death would be the likely result of the harm he [or she] intended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730, 919 A.2d 678. To ascertain that \u201cintent,\u201d we employ an objective standard, specifically: whether \u201ca reasonable person, under the circumstances,\u201d could or should have \u201cforeseen that death would likely ensue as a result of his or her conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713, 919 A.2d 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In sum, the elements of second-degree murder <em>with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm, </em>as articulated by the Court of Appeals, are: first, that the defendant\u2019s conduct caused the victim\u2019s death, and, second, that the defendant, at the time he engaged in the conduct, intended to inflict such serious bodily harm that the victim\u2019s death would be the likely result of the defendant\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">We next turn to the offense for which the State now wishes to prosecute Jones: second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault. </em>Second-degree felony murder, the fourth of the four \u201ctypes\u201d of second-degree murder recognized under Maryland law, <em>Thornton, </em>397 Md. at 721 n. 6, 919 A.2d 678, is a homicide \u201ccommitted in the perpetration of a felony other than one enumerated in the first degree murder statute,\u201d <em>Fisher v. State, </em>367 Md. 218, 225, 786 A.2d 706 (2001), which we shall refer to as either the \u201cunderlying felony\u201d or the \u201cpredicate felony.\u201d Recognizing second-degree felony murder as an offense in Maryland furthers the \u201cprimary purpose of the modern felony murder rule,\u201d explained the Court of Appeals, by punishing as murder \u201ca homicide resulting from dangerous conduct in the perpetration of a felony, even if the defendant did not intend to kill.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262, 786 A.2d 706. \u201cIf the felonious conduct,\u201d that is, the underlying felony or predicate felony, \u201cunder all of the circumstances, made death a foreseeable consequence, it is reasonable,\u201d Maryland\u2019s highest Court excogitated, \u201cfor the law to infer from the commission of the felony under those circumstances the malice that qualifies the homicide as murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The foreseeability of death \u201cis determined by the nature of the crime or by the manner in which it was perpetrated in a given set of circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 263, 786 A.2d 706 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Subsequently, in <em>Roary v. State, </em>the Court of Appeals was asked to determine whether a first-degree assault that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>required, under section 3-202(a)(l) of the Criminal Law Article,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the intent to \u201ccause or attempt to cause serious physical injury to another,\u201d was a \u201cproper underlying felony to support a second-degree felony-murder conviction.\u201d 385 Md. 217, 230, 867 A.2d 1095 (2005). In concluding that the assault in that case \u2014 specifically, Roary\u2019s repeatedly dropping a 20-30 pound boulder on the victim\u2019s head \u2014 could support such a conviction, the Court stressed that, to secure a conviction for second-degree felony murder, the underlying felony must be \u201csufficiently dangerous to life to justify application\u201d of the felony-murder doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 222, 229-30, 867 A.2d 1095. The <em>Roary </em>Court then observed that a first-degree assault that \u201cintentionally cause[s] or attempt[s] to cause serious physical injury to another\u201d and that \u201ccreates a substantial risk of death\u201d is \u201cundoubtedly dangerous to human life\u201d and that the \u201cmanner in which\u201d the particular assault in that case had been committed, that is, by repeatedly dropping a boulder on the victim\u2019s head, was \u201calso clearly dangerous to human life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230, 867 A.2d 1095. The Court ended its discussion of this issue by stating that \u201can assault in the first degree, when committed in a manner inherently dangerous to human life, as in this case, may be a predicate felony for second-degree felony-murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236, 867 A.2d 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Following the <em>Roary </em>decision, the Maryland State Bar Association\u2019s Standing Committee on Pattern Jury Instructions prepared an instruction on second-degree felony murder. <em>See </em>Comment, MPJI-Cr 4:17.7.2 (2006). The instruction is divided into two \u201cparts.\u201d The first, \u201cPart A,\u201d is captioned \u201cSecond Degree Felony Murder \u2014 Inherently Dangerous Nature of Felony: First Degree Assault\u201d and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuM\">The defendant is charged with the crime of second degree felony murder. Felony murder does not require the State to prove that the defendant intended to kill the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>person who was killed. In order to convict the defendant of second degree felony murder, the State must prove:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">(1) that [the defendant] committed the crime of first degree assault;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">(2) that [the defendant] killed (name); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">(3) that the act resulting in the death of (name) occurred during the first degree assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">To convict the defendant of first degree assault, the State must prove:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">(1) that the defendant intentionally caused serious physical injury to (name); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">(2) that the injury was not [consented to by (name)] [legally justified].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">For second degree felony murder, serious physical injury means injury that creates a substantial and foreseeable risk of death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">MPJI-Cr. 4:17.7.2A.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">The \u201cNotes on Use\u201d that accompany this pattern jury instruction advise the circuit courts to give Part A of the instruction \u201cif the defendant is charged with second degree felony murder and the predicate felony is first degree assault under Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. \u00a7 3-202(a)(l)\u201d; that is, a first-degree assault committed by \u201cintentionally caus[ing] or attempting] to cause serious physical injury to another.\u201d The \u201cNotes on Use\u201d further advise that, if the defendant is \u201ccharged with second degree felony murder and the predicate felony is one that is inherently dangerous to human life because of the way it was committed,\u201d the circuit courts should give \u201cPart B\u201d of the pattern jury instruction. Part B is captioned \u201cSecond Degree Felony Murder \u2014 Inherently Dangerous Manner in which Felony was Perpetrated\u201d and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a3z-dedup-0\">The defendant is charged with the crime of second degree felony murder. Felony murder does not require the State to prove that the defendant intended to kill the person who was killed. In order to convict the defendant of second degree felony murder, the State must prove:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>(1) that [the defendant] [[committed] [attempted to commit]] (identify the crime), a felony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">(2) that the way in which (identify the crime) was committed or attempted, under all of the circumstances, created a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or of serious physical injury likely to result in death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">(3) that as a result of the way in which (identify the crime) was committed or attempted, (name) was killed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">(4) that the act resulting in the death of (name) occurred during the [[commission] [attempted commission] [escape from the immediate scene]] of the (identify the crime).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">MPJI-Cr. 4:17.7.2B.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Both at the hearing below and on appeal, Jones has addressed only the elements of second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault </em>as they are set out in Part A of the pattern jury instructions. In other words, his focus has been solely on the elements of that offense when it is based on a first-degree assault committed by intentionally causing a serious physical injury to another. But the State could arguably prosecute Jones, at his retrial, for second-degree felony murder predicated on either form (or both forms) of first-degree assault, that is, a first-degree assault committed by intentionally causing or attempting to cause \u201cserious physical injury to another,\u201d or a first-degree assault committed by \u201ccommitting] an assault with a firearm.\u201d CL \u00a7 3-202(a)(l)~ (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">If the State proceeds on a theory of second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault </em>where the underlying first-degree assault was committed by intentionally causing, or attempting to cause, a serious physical injury to the victim, then, in accordance with the \u201cNotes on Use\u201d accompanying the pattern jury instructions, Part A of the second-degree felony murder instruction would apply. In that event, the State would be required to prove: first, that Jones committed a first-degree assault; second, that Jones killed Kelly; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>third, that the act that killed Kelly occurred during Jones\u2019s commission of the first-degree assault. <em>See </em>MPJI-Cr 4:17.7.2A. Furthermore, to prove that Jones committed a first-degree assault that would be \u201csufficiently dangerous to life to justify application\u201d of the felony-murder doctrine, <em>Roary, </em>385 Md. at 229-30, 867 A.2d 1095, the State would have to show that Jones \u201cintentionally caused serious physical injury\u201d to Kelly, that is, an \u201cinjury that creates a substantial and foreseeable risk of death,\u201d MPJI-Cr 4:17.7.2A.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">On the other hand, the State could arguably proceed, at Jones\u2019s retrial, on a theory of second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault </em>where the underlying first-degree assault was an assault committed with a firearm. Because no Maryland court has yet specifically addressed this form of second-degree felony murder, it is incumbent upon us to determine, now, what elements the State must prove to convict Jones of that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">We begin that determination by reiterating that, under Maryland law, an underlying felony can support a conviction for second-degree felony murder when it is committed in such a manner that it is dangerous to life. <em>See, e.g., Fisher, </em>367 Md. at 263, 786 A.2d 706. In the instant case, Jones purportedly used a firearm to shoot Kelly five times\u2014 three times in the torso, and two times in the head. Just as the Court of Appeals held, in <em>Roary v. State, </em>that a first-degree assault was dangerous to life \u201cby the manner in which it was perpetrated\u201d when it was committed by dropping a boulder onto a victim\u2019s head, we conclude that a first-degree assault is committed in a manner that is \u201cdangerous to life\u201d and \u201cmade death a foreseeable consequence\u201d when it is committed by using a firearm to shoot the victim multiple times, including twice in the head. 385 Md. at 229-30, 867 A.2d 1095. <em>See also Evans v. State, </em>28 Md.App. 640, 705-06, 349 A.2d 300 (1975) (explaining that \u201cthe intent to kill or the intent to do grievous bodily harm\u201d may be inferred from the use of a \u201cdeadly weapon directed at a vital part of the human body\u201d); <em>Jenkins v. State, </em>146 Md.App. 83, 135, 806 A.2d 682 (2002), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number><em>rev\u2019d on other grounds </em>375 Md. 284, 825 A.2d 1008 (2003) (stating that \u201can intent to cause serious physical injury can be inferred\u201d from the use of a firearm to commit a first-degree assault).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">As the \u201cNotes on Use\u201d accompanying the pattern jury instructions make clear, Part B of the pattern jury instructions sets forth the elements of the offense of second-degree felony murder predicated on an underlying felony \u201cthat is inherently dangerous to human life because of the way it was committed.\u201d So if the State chooses to proceed on a theory of second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault, </em>where the underlying first-degree assault was an assault committed with a firearm, it would be required to prove: first, that Jones committed, or attempted to commit, the felony of first-degree assault with a firearm; second, that the way in which the assault with a firearm was committed created a \u201creasonably foreseeable risk of death or of serious physical injury likely to result in death\u201d; third, that Kelly was killed as a result of Jones committing or attempting an assault with a fireaim; and fourth, that the act resulting in Kelly\u2019s death occurred during the commission, attempted commission, or escape from the scene of that felony. <em>See </em>MPJI-Cr 4:17.7.2B.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Having identified the elements of the offenses of second-degree murder <em>with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm </em>and second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault, </em>we now apply the \u201crequired evidence test\u201d to determine whether those offenses are the same for double jeopardy purposes. As we stated above, two offenses are \u201cdeemed to be the same for double jeopardy purposes\u201d when \u201conly one offense requires proof of an additional fact, so that all elements of one offense are present in the other.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>277 Md. at 267, 353 A.2d 240. We believe that all the elements of the offense of second-degree murder <em>with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm </em>are elements of the offense of second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault, </em>and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the two offenses qualify as the same offense under the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">As we previously explained, second-degree murder <em>with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm, </em>requires proof that the defendant intended to cause such severe harm that the victim\u2019s death would be the likely result of the defendant\u2019s actions and that the defendant\u2019s intentional conduct did, in fact, cause the victim\u2019s death. <em>Thornton, </em>397 Md. at 730, 733, 919 A.2d 678. Second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault </em>requires, using admittedly different words, proof of these same elements. To prove the commission of that offense, the State must show that the defendant\u2019s intentional conduct created either \u201ca substantial and foreseeable risk of death\u201d or \u201creasonably foreseeable risk of death or of serious physical injury likely to result in death\u201d and that the victim died as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct. MPJI-Cr 4:17.7.2A-B.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Although, as noted, the two offenses do not use precisely the same words to describe the degree of bodily harm that must result from the defendant\u2019s intentional conduct, their descriptions of that harm are essentially the same. The injury, which second-degree murder <em>with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm, </em>addresses, is an injury to the victim that is so serious that death would be the likely result. Such an injury is the same as an injury that creates \u201ca substantial and foreseeable risk of death\u201d or a \u201cserious physical injury likely to result in death,\u201d as required for a conviction for second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Having concluded that the two offenses address the infliction of a potentially mortal injury, we must now determine whether either of the offenses, or both of them, include an element that the other does not have, that is to say, whether each offense \u201crequires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Scriber, 437 </em>Md. at 408, 86 A.3d 1260. And, in this instance, only one of the offenses \u2014 second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault </em>\u2014 requires proof of a fact that the other offense \u2014 second-degree murder <em>with the intent to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number><em>inflict serious bodily harm </em>\u2014 does not. Although both offenses require proof that the defendant\u2019s intentional conduct caused the victim\u2019s death and that the defendant\u2019s conduct was so dangerous to life that it made death a foreseeable result, second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault </em>goes on to require proof of an additional element, that is, that the defendant committed or attempted to commit the felony of first-degree assault, either by causing or attempting to cause serious physical injury to another or by committing an assault with a firearm. The reverse, however, is not true. Second-degree murder <em>with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm </em>does not require proof of an element that is not present in the offense of second-degree felony murder <em>based, on first-degree assault. </em>Indeed, to prove all of the elements of second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault, </em>the State must first prove all the elements of second-degree murder <em>with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In short, the offenses at issue here must, under the required evidence test, be deemed to be the same for double jeopardy purposes. A subsequent prosecution on the charge of second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault </em>would therefore violate the prohibition against double jeopardy, and the circuit court erred in concluding that a prosecution of Jones on that charge could proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED.
