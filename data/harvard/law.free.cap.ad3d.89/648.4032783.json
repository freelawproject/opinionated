The plaintiff did not seek to vacate the award of the master arbitrator, and, once the plaintiff properly invoked its right to de novo review, the issue of whether the award was arbitrary and capricious was rendered academic. For the same reason, the Supreme Court also erred in granting the defendant\u2019s cross motion to confirm the award of the master arbitrator and for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and on his counterclaims, based on the conclusion that the award was not arbitrary and capricious <em>(see Progressive Ins. Co. v Strough, </em>55 AD3d 1402 [2008]; <em>Matter of Capuano v Allstate Ins. Co., </em>122 AD2d 138 [1986]; <em>see also Matter of Gersten v American Tr. Ins. Co., </em>161 Misc 2d 57 [1994]).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Since the Supreme Court did not consider the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s motion or those branches of the defendant\u2019s cross motion which were for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and on his counterclaims, the matter must be remitted to the Supreme Court, Kings County, for a consideration of the merits of the motion and those branches of the cross motion, and a new determination thereafter <em>(see Hunter Sports Shooting Grounds, Inc. v Foley, </em>73 AD3d 702, 705 [2010]).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">In light of our determination, we need not reach the plaintiffs remaining contentions. Rivera, J.E, Florio, Austin and Sgroi, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
