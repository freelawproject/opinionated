(Code Civ.

Section 1989 is as follows: \u201cA witness is not obliged to attend as a witness before any court, judge, justice, or any other officer, out of the county in which he resides, unless the distance be less than thirty miles from his place of residence to the place of trial.\u201d And subdivision 8 of \u00a7 1870: \u201c In conformity with the preceding provisions, evidence may be given upon a trial of the following facts : * * * 8. The testimony of a witness deceased, or out of the jurisdiction, or unable to testify, given in a former action between the same parties, relating to the same matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">It is claimed that Mrs. Taylor was \u201c out of the jurisidiction\u201d of the court, and that therefore, under the provision of the law last quoted, her testimony given on the former trial was admissible. But it is manifest that this is not so. The jurisdiction of the late District Courts was not limited to their own .county. The <em>personal attendance </em>of Mrs. Taylor at the trial could not have been compelled, under \u00a7 1909 of the Code of Procedure, cited by respondent\u2019s counsel; but her deposition could have been taken (\u00a7 2021, Code of Proc.), and her attendance before the officer appointed to take such deposition could have been compelled. (\u00a7\u00a7 1986 and 1991, Code of Proc.)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">We think it clear, that the Court below erred in admitting in evidence the testimony of the witness given on the former trial, against the objections of the defendant; and for this reason, the judgment and order are reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">McKinstry, J., and Morrisoh, C. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
