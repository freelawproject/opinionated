Held, </em>that as it was specially found by the Court below that all the matters of account set up in the defendant\u2019s answer were litigated by the parties, and passed upon by the jury in the former action, the presumption in favor of the action of a court of general jurisdiction, like the one in question, must prevail over any doubt that the Court might otherwise entertain as to the admissibility of passing upon a matter of set-off, under the pleadings in the former action.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b198-8\">Pleading at Common Law\u2014Assumpsit\u2014The General Issue\u2014Set-off.\u2014 Although in point of form the plea of <em>non-assumpsit </em>(at common law) puts nothing in issue except the making of the promise, it has been long settled that nearly every defense is admissible under that plea, which shows that there was not a subsisting cause of action at the time the suit was brought; and <em>tender </em>and <em>set-off, </em>which must he specially pleaded, are not exceptions to the rule; because those defenses admit a good cause of action.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-9\">Appeal from a, judgment for the plaintiff, and from an order denying a new trial, in the Twentieth District Court, County of Santa Clara.

(Maryland Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 13, art. 75, p. 508 (read in evidence); <em>Burch </em>v. <em>The State, </em>4 Gill &amp; J. 451; <em>Sangston </em>v. <em>Maitland, </em>11 id. 297.)

Proc. \u00a7 456; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>52 Cal. 407; <em>Low </em>v. <em>Burrows, </em>12 id. 181.) The defendant was entitled to retain or claim, by way of <em>deduction </em>from the account sued upon in the former action, all just allowances or demands accruing to him, or payments made by him, in respect of the <em>same </em>transaction or account which forms ground of action. But this cannot be termed a <em>set-off </em>in the strict legal sense of the word, because it is not in the nature of a <em>cross </em>demand, or a <em>mutual </em>debt, but rather constitutes a <em>deduction, </em>rendering the sum to be recovered by the plaintiff so much less. (Chitty on Pleading, 568; <em>Steigleman </em>v. <em>Jeffries, </em>1 Serg. &amp; E. 477; <em>Cornell </em>v. <em>Green, </em>10 id. 14; <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Badger, </em>12 id. 275.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-6\">It may always be shown by parol evidence that any matter which the issue was broad enough to cover arose and was determined in the prior suit. ( <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Gailliard, </em>26 Ala. 504; <em>Dunckel </em>v. <em>Wiles, </em>1 Kern. 420; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>36 Barb. 88; <em>Lawrence v. Hunt, </em>10 Wend. 80; <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Buckbee, </em>3 Cow. 120; <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>15 Pick. 276; and see Freeman on Judgments, \u00a7 273.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b199-7\">Sharpstein, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">This is an action upon a judgment, and the allegation, \u201c That on the 3rd day of November, a. d. 1877, at Baltimore, in the State of Maryland, the Baltimore City\" Court, being a court of general jurisdiction, in an action therein pending between the above-named plaintiff and defendant, by its judgment duly given and made, adjudged that the plaintiff have and recover of the defendant the sum of @10,350,\u201d etc., is a sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>averment of the jurisdiction of that Court, and the demurrer to the complaint was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\">The defendant in this action set up a counter-claim in its answer, and introduced evidence tending to establish it. The only finding of the Court upon the issue thereby raised is, \u201c That at the trial of said cause in said Baltimore City Court each and all the matters of account, and items set forth in the answer of the defendant in this case, were upon said trial fully presented by said defendant, evidence offered concerning the same, and each and all of the said items and amounts were in said cause and trial fully litigated by said parties, and submitted to the jury in said cause, and by said jury passed upon.\u201d There is nothing in the record of the former action which shows that the subject of the defendant\u2019s counter-claim was in any way involved in that action. The plaintiff brought that action to recover the value of services which he alleged that he had rendered for the defendant. The counter-claim is for money received by the plaintiff to the use of the defendant. Under the laws of the State of Maryland, in which the former action was brought and prosecuted to judgment, a system of pleading prevails which is sometimes denominated the common-law system, and in that action the defendant pleaded the general issue and the Statute of Limitations, under neither of which was evidence of set-off admissible. The Court, however, admitted <em>parol </em>evidence in this action, to prove that the subject of the defendant\u2019s counter-claim herein was submitted to the jury in the former action. If under the issues in the former action the subject of the counterclaim in this action might have been proven and submitted to the jury, the weight of authority is, that the fact of its having been so proven and submitted might be established by parol evidence. But in order to make such evidence admissible; the matters alleged to have been passed upon in the former action must be such as might legitimately have been given in evidence under the issue joined in that action. In <em>Sintzenick </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>1 Esp. R. 43, Lord Kenyon lays it down, that, to make a record evidence to conclude any matter, it should appear that the matter was in issue, which should appear from the record itself; nor should evidence be admitted that under such a record any particular matter came in issue. And in <em>Manny </em>v. <em>Harris, 2 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Johns. 24, Spencer, J., quotes Lord Kenyon approvingly, and says, in effect, that unless the issue in the former action embraced the consideration of the present cause of action, evidence ought not to be received that the jury did decide upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">There is some conflict upon tile question whether parol evidence can ever be resorted to for the purpose of showing what matters, <em>within the issues, </em>were not submitted to a jury in -a former action. But none as to the inadmissibility of such evidence to prove that matters <em>outside </em>of the issues were submitted and passed upon. In Maryland, a set-off, to be available as such, must always be pleaded or filed in bar. <em>(Burch </em>v. <em>State, </em>4 Gill &amp; J. 444; <em>Sangston </em>v. <em>Maitland, </em>11 id. 286.) And this is undoubtedly the rule wherever the system of practice and pleading is similar to that which prevails in that State.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The record would not in all cases necessarily disclose what had been proved and passed upon under a plea of the general issue. In the former action for the recovery of the value of services, the defendant, under his plea of the general issue, without pleading set-off, might have shown that the services were improperly rendered, or were of less than the alleged value, or that the defendant supported and maintained the plaintiff and his family while the services were being rendered, with a view to the reduction of damages. <em>(Carroll\u2019s Adm\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Quynn, </em>13 Md. 379.) If in a subsequent action between the same parties it became material to show that any of these matters had been passed upon in a former action, parol evidence would be admissible to establish the fact, simply because those were matters which might be shown under the general issue. But matters which must be specially pleaded, like set-off, cannot be shown by parol evidence to have been introduced and passed upon in an action in which they were not specially pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">It is nevertheless an established fact in this case, that the matters which are set up in the defendant\u2019s counter-claim were introduced on the former trial, and passed upon by the jury. The Court below has so found, and there was evidence before it to support that finding. The presumption that a Court of general jurisdiction, like that of the Baltimore City Court, would not allow matter to be introduced in evidence and submitted to the jury which was not admissible under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>pleadings, must prevail over any doubt which we may entertain upon the point. It is incredible that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel would have permitted such matter to be introduced without objection, if it had been inadmissible under the law of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\">The plaintiff in the former action filed a declaration in the following form :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">\u201c Declaration, Baltimore City, to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">\u201c J. II. Meredith, by George G. Hooper, his attorney, sues the Santa Clara Mining Association of Baltimore, a body corporate duly incorporated under the laws of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">\u201c 1st. For money payable by the defendant to the plaintiff for goods bargained and sold by the plaintiff to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">\u201c 2nd. And for work done and material provided by the plaintiff for the defendant at its request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">\u201c 3rd. And for money lent by the plaintiff to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">\u201c 4th. And for money paid by the plaintiff for the defendant at its request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-10\">\u201c 5th. And for money received by the defendant for the use of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-11\">\u201c 6th.

H. Meredith:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-15\">\u201c For services rendered during 1870, 1871, 1872, 1873, and 1874, in obtaining patents, negotiating loan in London, and various duties in California, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Hew York:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-17\">\u201c Gold........................'............$10,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-18\">Credited by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-19\">October 7tli, 1874, cash received on account of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-20\">ditto, gold.............................. 1,835.18</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-21\">Balance due, gold.....................$9,161.82.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-22\">To which the defendant pleaded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-23\">\u201c And the said Santa Clara Mining Association of Baltimore, the defendant in this action, by J. D. Ilambleton, its attorney, says: That it never was indebted as alleged. And for a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>plea says: That it did not promise as alleged. And for a third plea says: That the alleged cause of action did not accrue within three years before this suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Prior to 1834, a defendant might in England, under a plea of <em>non assumpsit, </em>give in evidence matters which showed that, at the time of the commencement of the suit the plaintiff had no subsisting cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Egarn, </em>4 Taunt. 164, Mansfield, C. J., says: \u201c It is an extraordinary thing that <em>nil debet </em>expresses the sense of the general issue in <em>assumpsit, </em>much better than <em>non assumpsit. </em>For in <em>non assumpsit </em>may be given in evidence a release, or payment, or anything which shows that there was no cause of action at the time of the action brought: although the form of the issue is that the defendant did not undertake, whereas the truth may be that he has undertaken and has performed.\u201d That the same rule prevailed in this country until changed in most of the States by statutes, is sufficiently evident. In <em>Young </em>v. <em>Black, </em>7 Cranch, 565, the Court, Story, J., delivering the opinion, says: \u201c It has been long since established, that, under <em>non assumpsit, </em>the defendant may give in evidence anything which shows that no debt was due at the time when the action was commenced, whether it arise from an inherent defect in the original promise, or a subsequent discharge and satisfaction.\u201d In <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Aaron, </em>1 Johns. 129, Kent, C. J., says: \u201c And generally, whatever will constitute a good plea in bar may be given in evidence under <em>non </em>assumpsit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The cases in which it was held, under the former system of pleading which prevailed in this country, that anything which showed that the plaintiff at the time of the commencement of his action had no subsisting cause of action might be taken advantage of under the general issue, are numerous. ( <em>Wilt </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>13 Johns. 56; <em>Edson </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>7 Cow. 278; <em>Sill </em>v. <em>Rood, </em>15 Johns. 230; <em>Taft </em>v. <em>Montague, </em>14 Mass. 282; <em>Manchester Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Sweeting, </em>10 Wend. 163; <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>12 Ohio, 120.)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">In <em>Young </em>v. <em>Rummell, </em>2 Hill, 478, Bronson, J., for the Court, says: \u201cAlthough in point of form the plea of <em>non assumpsit </em>puts nothing in issue but the making of the promise, it has been long settled that nearly every defense is admissible under that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>plea which shows that there was not a subsisting cause of action at the time the suit was brought. Tender and set-off, which must be specially pleaded, are exceptions to the rule, because those defenses admit a good cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\">It is unnecessary to cite any more authorities upon the point that the defendant might, under the system of pleading which prevails in Maryland, have introduced in evidence, under the. plea of <em>non </em>assumpsit, anything which would show that at the time of the commencement of his action the plaintiff had no subsisting cause of action. But the plea of <em>non assumpsit </em>was preceded by a plea that the defendant \u201c never was indebted as alleged,\u201d and that, under the rule above commented on, as Lord Mansfield says in <em>Brennan </em>v. Egarn, supra, \u201c expresses the sense of the general issue in <em>assumpsit </em>much better than <em>non assumpsit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The rules of pleading in Maryland, so far as we are advised, are the same as they were when the rule to which we have alluded generally prevailed. If we treat the \u201c account \u201d filed by the plaintiff with his declaration as a bill of particulars, it appears that his claim was for services performed for the defendant. That being so, might not the defendant, under either the plea of <em>munquam indebitatus </em>or of <em>non asstimpsit, </em>have introduced evidence to show that at the time of the commencement of that action the plaintiff had in his hands money which he had received for the use of the defendant while in its employment, and, as its agent, sufficient, or more than sufficient, to compensate him for said services ?</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">We are not prepared to say, that, under the rules of pleading which prevailed in Maryland at that time, it could not. And it necessarily follows that, until convinced that it could not, we cannot, in view of the established fact that it did introduce such evidence, reverse the judgment and order of the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Thornton, J., and Myrick, J.,. concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
