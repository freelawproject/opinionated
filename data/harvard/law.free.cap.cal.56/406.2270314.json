This error is fatal. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Holden, </em>2 McCord, 337; <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>Conf. Rep. 210; <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>State, </em>6 Am.

No demurrer was interposed. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>1 Ired. 125, it was held, that in an indictment the word \u201c assalt \u201d should read ,\u201c assault,\u201d the word \u201c fifty-too \u201d should read \u201cfifty-two,\u201d and the word \u201cmake\u201d was held to mean \u201cmark,\u201d in an indictment for putting a false mark on sheep.

Code, \u00a7 459.) There is no such felony as \u201c larcey \u201d known to our \"law. \u201cLarcey \u201d is certainly not \u201clarceny,\u201d nor does the maxim, <em>idem sonans, </em>apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">It is said that the Court must give judgment without regard to the technical errors or defects, or to exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1258.) But this is more than a departure from an established form; nor is it a case in which facts are averred in the indictment, which sufficiently indicate the sense in which the word purporting to <em>name the crime </em>is employed; but is a failure to describe any of\u00edense.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
