The complaint avers, that the plaintiff is entitled to \u201c five hundred inches, measured under a four-inch pressure, of the waters \u201d in controversy, but nowhere makes any reference to \u201c miners\u2019 measurement.\u201d It was admitted at the argument, that these latter terms have no fixed meaning, and that an inch of water according to \u201c miners\u2019 measurement \u201d in one locality is sometimes a very different quantity from an inch according to \u201c miners\u2019 measurement \u201d in another locality. As already observed, the pleadings make no reference to such measurement, nor is there anything anywhere in the record to indicate what is meant by the \u201c forty inches, miners\u2019 measurement, of the waters,\u201d awarded by the jury and the Court below to the plaintiff. For aught that the record shows, and for aught that we know, the quantity thus awarded him may exeeed the \u201c five hundred inches, measured under a four-inch pressure,\u201d claimed in his complaint. It was suggested by counsel for the respondent, that the words \u201c miners\u2019 measurement,\u201d used by the jury in its verdict, and by the Court in its decree, might be treated as surplusage, and disregarded, and the verdict and decree read as giving to the plaintiff \u201c forty inches, measured under a four-inch pressure.\u201d It is clear that we cannot thus alter the language and intent of the Court and the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The judgment and order must be reversed, and the cause remanded to the Court below for a new trial, with leave to the plaintiff to amend his complaint if he shall be so advised. Ordered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">McKinstry, Jt and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
