The discharge operated to release them from personal liability for all debts, whether contracted by the individuals or by the partnership. <em>(Boedefield </em>v. <em>Bowers &amp; Reed, </em>55 Cal. 299; <em>Freeman </em>&amp; <em>Klemmer </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>Spurgeon, id. 197; Hittell\u2019s Codes, \u00a7 15505; Hilliard on Bankruptcy and Insolvency, 79; <em>Lothrop </em>v. Tilden, 8 Cush. 375.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-11\">The decree in insolvency dissolves the copartnership, so that a judgment subsequently rendered against the copartnership, as such, would be a judgment against a non-existing thing, and could only be valid as against the individuals who had composed the firm.

The defense is, that the defendants have been individually discharged in insolvency from their debts. We have already held, in <em>Glenn </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>v. <em>Arnold, ante, </em>631, that, such discharges did not operate to release the partnership indebtedness, for the reason that the insolvency court, by the proceedings, had upon the. individual petitions of the insolvents, acquired no jurisdiction over the partnership property.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Thornton, J., and Myrick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
