Said board of trustees shall have further power, directed by vote of their district, to purchase, receive, hold, and convey real or personal property for school purposes <em>; </em>to build, purchase, hire, and repair schoolhouses, and supply the same with necessary furniture, and to fix the location of school-houses.\u201d (Art. 6692, Hitt. Gen. Laws.) This section has no application to a <em>dedication </em>of land for school purposes. In discussing the \"principle in question, the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of <em>New Orleans </em>v. <em>The United States, </em>10 Peters, 712, said: \u201c It is not essential that this right of use should be vested in a corporate body; it may exist in the public, and have no other limitation than the wants of the community at large \u201d; and in the same case the Court asserts or assents <em>to </em>the following principles: (1) That it is not essential to a dedication that the legal title should pass from the owner; (2) nor is it essential that there should be any grantee of the use or easement <em>in esse </em>to take the fee, such cases being exceptions to the general rule requiring' a grantee; (3) nor is a deed or writing necessary to constitute a valid dedication; it may be by parol; (4) no specific length of possession is necessary to constitute a valid dedication.\u201d In <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>McCandless, </em>7 Ohio R. 476, it was held, that dedications of land for public or charitable uses are good without a donee to take title, and that the <em>Legislature, </em>as well as Chancery, may <em>directly </em>appoint trustees, who may recover in ejectment. (See also, 2 Dillon on Mun. Corp. \u00a7 <em>510; Klinkener </em>v. <em>School District, </em>11 Pa. St. 444.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">These authorities are sufficient to establish the validity of the dedication shown to have been made in this case. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The action was properly brought by the plaintiff under \u00a7 1575 of the Political Code, which reads thus: \u201c Every school district must be designated by the name and style of !- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>district \u2019 (using the name of the district), of6-county \u2019 (using the name of county in which such district is situated); and in that manner the trustees may sue and be sued, and hold and convey property for the use and benefit of such district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Discovering no error in the record, the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">McKinstry, J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
