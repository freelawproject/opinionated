P. alleged (besides jurisdictional facts), that he was the illegitimate son of A. P., deceased, and that he had been recognized by A. P. in his lifetime as his son and heir, by an instrument in writing for that purpose, made as provided by law; that P. P. had been appointed administrator, and that he had wasted and mismanaged the estate; and prayed for the removal of P. P., and the appointment of E. P. The Court, after hearing evidence as to the management of the estate, made an order removing P. P. from his office; and afterwards, after hearing evidence as to the right of E. P. to the administration, found in effect, that the allegations of the petition were true; but also found, that, before the filing of the present petition, E. P. and P. P. had filed petitions for letters, the former alleging that he was the son and heir, and the latter, that he was the brother and one of the heirs of the deceased; that upon the contest thus arising, the jury found that E. P. was the illegitimate son of the deceased, and that said deceased, in his lifetime, publicly acknowledged him as his son, and received him as such in his family, and otherwise treated him as such; that the said E. P. was not a minor on the 1st day of January, 1873, and that the deceased did not in his lifetime, in writing, signed in the presence of a competent witness, acknowledge himself to be the father of the said E. P.; that, upon these findings, E. P. was appointed administrator, but that upon appeal the order was reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to dismiss the petition of E. P., on the ground that he was not a minor on the 1st day of January, 1873, and that his petition was accordingly dismissed by the Probate Court, and P. P. appointed administrator; but the Court further found, that the question, whether the deceased in his lifetime, ip writing, signed in the presence of a competent witness, acknowledged himself to be the father of saidE. P., was not within the issues, and was not determined by the former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>proceedings. <em>Held, </em>that the former adjudication, as found, estopped E. P. from making any claim to letters of administrationby virtue of his being son and heir of the deceased; but that, inasmuch as the Court removed F. P. for neglect, mismanagement, and incompetency, it had the power, under \u00a7 1365 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to grant letters to It.

Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1383-1386) is in effect a suit by the petitioner against the administrator in his personal and in his representative capacity, and cannot be carried on where there is no administrator. Hence, there was no jurisdiction in the Court to hear the petition under \u00a7 1383; an acting administrator t\u00f3 be removed being the first requisite jurisdictional fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-9\">Nor can the rights of the <em>legitimate </em>heirs of the estate be determined and concluded in a proceeding to which they are not parties, and from which the administrator, their representative, had been dismissed. ( <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>1 How. 282; <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Farley, </em>24 Cal. 502.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-10\">Nor can the further proceedings of the Court, and the appointment of Eomulo as administrator, be sustained on the ground claimed by respondent\u2019s attorneys, namely, under \u00a7 1137 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-11\">The proceeding was not under art. iv (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1371, <em>et scq.'), </em>nor was there any proceeding initiated by Eomulo under this article.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-12\">If we should consider the petition as being under this article, it would be totally void. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-13\">For so long as there is an administrator, the Court has no jurisdiction to appoint another, or to consider any application therefor, except under the provisions of art. v, Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1383-1386; and any proceeding for that purpose is absolutely void. <em>(Haynes </em>v. <em>Meeks, </em>20 Cal. 310, <em>311; Estate of Hamilton, </em>34 id. 468.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-14\">It was absolutely essential, therefore, in order to justify Eomulo\u2019s appointment under the general provisions relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the appointment of administrator (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1871, <em>et seq.), </em>that a. petition should have been filed <em>after the removal of Pio. </em>And the Court no more had power to appoint him upon a petition filed for a different purpose, and before the administration became vacant, than it would have had upon a petition filed in the lifetime of Andres.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-5\">The petitioner Romulo Pico was estopped by the former proceedings and order dismissing his first petition and the decree awarding the administration to Pio Pico. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1908; <em>Garwood </em>v. <em>Garwood, </em>29 Cal. 521.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-6\">The judge below expressly finds the former petition by Romulo, the contest and petition by Pio, the verdict of the jury, the order appointing Romulo, the judgment of the Supreme Court reversing the order, the dismissal of Romulo\u2019s petition in pursuance of the remittitur, and the appointment of Pio,</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-7\">The other portions of the finding are mere statements of legal conclusions, erroneously drawn from the facts found, and are mere surplusage.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-8\"><em>Cameron E. Thom, </em>and <em>Brunson </em>&amp; <em>Wells, </em>for Respondent,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-9\">The only questions before this Court arc:</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-10\">1. Had the Probate Court jurisdiction of the proceeding, and are the proceedings regular ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-11\">2. Is the order of the Court sustained by the findings ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-12\">The question is simply as between Romulo petitioner, and Pio contestant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-13\">It is urged by demurrer that the petition of Romulo Pico is insufficient, because with it is united a petition for the removal of Pio'Pico and the appointment of himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-14\">Should the Court hold that the effect of the written recognition provided for in \u00a7 1387 of the Civil Code is to make the illegitimate a <em>son in fact, </em>then the proceeding was proper under \u00a7 1383 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-15\">We, however, take the ground that the proceedings to remove and appoint may be conducted at the same time. The Court taking the proof on the question of removal first, and having determined to remove, then hearing evidence on the appointment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>This course is reasonable, expedient, prevents a hiatus, saves expense, and is the method pointed out in \u00a71426 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-5\">If this is not the method pointed out in the Code, then we say that there is certainly <em>no </em>practice provided on the subject; and in this event the Court may adopt any reasonable practice as incident to the exercise of its jurisdiction. <em>(Mawson </em>v. Mawson, 50 Cal. 539; Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 187.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-6\">As to the estoppel, <em>under the Code there are two distinct ways ' of recognizing illegitimate offspring.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-7\">It is provided by \u00a7 230, Civil Code:</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-8\">\u201c The father of an illegitimate child, by publicly acknowledging it as his own, <em>* </em>* * and otherwise treating it as if it were a <em>legitimate child, </em>thereby adopts it as <em>such, </em>and such child is thereupon deemed for all purposes <em>legitimate from the time of its birth.\"</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-10\">This can only be done during the minority of the child. <em>(Estate of Pico, </em>52 Cal. 84.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-12\">The effect of this treatment towards the minor child makes him, in <em>fact, </em>a <em>child </em>legitimate in all respects, like children born in wedlock. He is no longer illegitimate. Ho becomes a brother of the half-blood to the other children of his father by a different mother.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-13\">But under \u00a7 1387 of the Civil Code, the effect is only to make the child simply <em>an heir. </em>See the language:</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-14\">\u201c Every illegitimate son is the <em>heir </em>of the person who, in writing,\u201d etc. This section is found in the chapter on Succession ; \u00a7 230, in the chapter on Adoption.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-15\">It is only the \u201c children \u201d who are entitled to administration, and the heir under \u00a7 1387 of the Civil Code has no right as such to administer. The acknowledgment in writing gives to the illegitimate the simple quality of inheritance, and nothing else.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-16\">We call attention to this manifest distinction, in order to show that <em>the question of heirship by acknowledgment in writing was not in issue on the application for letters in </em>1876; and therefore the verdict of the jury upon the application was a nullity, and works no estoppel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-18\"><em>Estoppel can be set up only of such matters as were in issue. (Boggs </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>37 Cal. 236; Bigelow on Estoppel, p. 84, <em>el seq.; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number><em>Striker </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>7 Hill, 9; <em>Florence </em>v.

The matters came on to be heard, and on the 25th of October, 1879, the Court removed Pio Pico from the administration, revoked and annulled his letters, and granted letters to the petitioner Romulo.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">By its findings and order, the Court found and adjudged that Romulo Pico was the illegitimate child of the intestate, and that . the intestate in his lifetime, in writing, signed in the presence of a competent witness, duly acknowledged himself to be the father of Romulo ; and further adjudged that Romulo was the heir of Andres Pico, deceased, and entitled to letters of administration on his estate. From this order Pio Pico appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">As to this adjudication, the Court found as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-10\">\u201c Shortly after the death of said deceased, to wit, on the 23rd of February, 1876, the said Romulo Pico filed his petition in this Court, praying for the issuance of letters of administration on said estate to him, and alleging as grounds therefor that he was the son of said deceased. Afterwards, to wit, on February 25th, 1876, the said Pio Pico filed his petition in said Court, alleging that he was the brother and one of the heirs of said deceased, and on the 6th day of March, 1876, also filed a written opposition to the issuance of letters to the said Romulo, alleging that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>he was the sole surviving brother of said deceased, and therefore entitled to letters of administration, and denying that said Pomulo was the surviving son of said deceased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">\u201cAfterwards, to wit, on the-day of -, 1876, a jury was empannelcd to try the said issues between the said Pomulo and the said Pio Pico; and on the 4th of April, 1876, the jury returned their verdict, wherein they found, among other things, that the said Pomulo was the illegitimate son of the said Andres Pico. That the said Andres did, in his lifetime, publicly acknowledge him, the said Pomulo, as his son, and received him as such into his family, and otherwise treated him, the said Pomulo, as if he was the legitimate son of said Andres ; and further, that on the first day of January, 1873, the said Pomulo was not a minor under the age of twenty-one years. The jury also found, that the said Andres did not, in his lifetime, in writing signed in the presence of a competent witness, acknowledge himself to be the father of said Romulo, and also that the said Andres was never married. Afterwards, to wit, on the 24th day of July, 1876, an order was made and entered by this Court, reciting the said verdict, and directing letters of administration to be issued to the said Pomulo on said estate. After-wards, said cause having been taken to the Supreme Court of said State on appeal, the said order was reversed, and cause remanded by that Court, with directions to this Court to dismiss the petition of said Pomulo, on the ground that he was not a minor under the age of twenty-one years on the 1st day of January, 1873, when \u00a7 230 of the Civil Code of said State went into effect, under which the said Pomulo alone claimed in the proceedings in this finding mentioned. The petition of said Pomulo was accordingly dismissed; and afterward, an order was made by this Court directing letters of administration on said estate to be issued to the said Pio Pico, which was accordingly done on the 30th day of October, 1877, as herein before stated in finding number two. The said petition of said Pomulo, and the said contest of said Pio Pico of 1876, did not present the same issues as to the right of the said Romulo to letters of administration on said estate, or as to his relationship to said deceased, as are presented by the present petition of said Pomulo and the present contest of said Pico. The ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>tion whether the said deceased ever in his lifetime, in writing, signed in the presence of a competent witness, acknowledged himself to be the father of said Romulo, was not within the issues, and was not determined by any of the aforesaid proceedings of 1876 and 1877.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">We arc of opinion, that this adjudication, as found, estopped Romulo from making any claim to letters of administration by virtue of his being the son and heir of the deceased intestate. All his rights as such to letters was passed on and decided against him in the proceedings commenced in 1876. Whether he was the legitimate son of Andres Pico, or his illegitimate son, and duly adopted or legitimated, was concluded by the order made in that case. Iiis right, if he ever had any, existed in 1876; he had an opportunity of then bringing it forward to be passed on, and whether he did or not, he is alike concluded by the judgment rendered in that proceeding. The allegations of the petition in the proceedings of 1876, and the denials thereof, as found by the Court (see above finding), put all the matters in issue as to Romulo being a son of Andres, and therefore entitled to letters of administration. All the evidence, of whatever character, to establish such a fact could have been introduced under the issues of that proceeding. The adjudication in that proceeding is an estoppel in this. <em>(Garwood </em>v. Garwood, 29 Cal. 521; \u00a7 1908, Code Civ. Proc.)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">But inasmuch as the Court removed Pio Pico from the administration for neglect, mismanagement, and incompetency, it had the power, under \u00a7 1365 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to grant letters to the petitioner. There is nothing in \u00a7 1379 of the Code of Civil Procedure which deprives the Court of this power.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">We do not intend to herein decide anything as to the conclusiveness of the adjudication upon the rights of Romulo on the final distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">We have considered the other points discussed on the argument arising on the demurrer of Pio Pico to the petition of Romulo, and the appeal of Oxarat, and find no error in the case in relation to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">We must, therefore, affirm the order of the Court below, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Shabpstein, J., and Mtbick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
