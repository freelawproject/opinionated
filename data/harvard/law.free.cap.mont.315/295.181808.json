The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The District Court denied Renville\u2019s motion, granted Farmers\u2019 motion, and dismissed Renville\u2019s declaratory action. Renville appeals from the District Court\u2019s order. We reverse the order and judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it dismissed Renville\u2019s request for a declaratory judgment on the issue of past medical expenses?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it dismissed Renville\u2019s request for a declaratory judgment on the issue of ongoing medical expenses?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">\u00b65 On April 1, 1995, Maria Renville was involved in an automobile collision in Great Falls, Montana. At the time of the collision, Renville was a passenger in a vehicle driven by Matthew MacDonald. MacDonald\u2019s vehicle collided with a vehicle driven by Ursula Taylor. Renville alleged that she sustained injuries as a result of the collision, and sued Taylor to recover damages. Prior to the trial, Taylor admitted that she had negligently caused the collision. The jury was then asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>to determine whether the collision caused injuries to Renville and, if so, to determine the amount of her damages. On December 10, 1998, the jury found that Renville had sustained injuries as a result of the collision, and awarded damages in the amount of $17,553.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\">\u00b66 Renville filed an appeal with this Court in which she argued that the jury\u2019s damage award was not supported by substantial evidence because it failed to compensate her for damages other than past medical expenses. See <em>Renville v. Talyor, </em>2000 MT 217, \u00b6 16, 301 Mont. 99, \u00b6 16, 7 P.3d 400, \u00b6 16 <em>(Renville I). </em>We held that because the jury\u2019s award was limited to past medical expenses, and provided no recovery for Renville\u2019s pain and suffering, it was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Renville I, </em>\u00b6 26. We remanded this case to the District Court for a new trial on the issue of damages on August 11, 2000. <em>Renville I, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b67 At the time of the collision, Taylor was insured by Farmers Insurance Exchange. Farmers paid approximately $13,000 of Renville\u2019s medical expenses prior to the December 1998 trial. Farmers has since refused to make any additional payments to Renville. With re-trial of her case still pending in the District Court, Renville filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against Farmers on January 16, 2002. Renville\u2019s complaint requested that: (1) Farmers pay the remainder of the jury\u2019s $17,553 damage award; (2) Farmers pay her ongoing medical expenses; and (3) the District Court award her compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b68 On April 12, 2002, Renville filed a motion for partial summary judgment. Farmers filed a motion for summary judgment on April 26, 2002. On August 9, 2002, the District Court issued an order in which it denied Renville\u2019s motion, granted Farmers\u2019 motion, and dismissed Renville\u2019s complaint for declaratory judgment. Renville appealed the District Court\u2019s order on September 10, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u00b69 The decision to dismiss a complaint for declaratory relief is within the sound discretion of the district court. <em>Northfield Ins. v. Ass\u2019n of Counties, </em>2000 MT 256, \u00b6 8, 301 Mont. 472, \u00b6 8, 10 P.3d 813, \u00b6 8. We will not disturb the court\u2019s decision absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Northfield, </em>\u00b6 8 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aak\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">\u00b610 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it dismissed Renville\u2019s request for a declaratory judgment on the issue of past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>medical expenses?</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u00b611 Renville sought a declaratory judgment that Farmers is required to pay her the $17,553 which the jury awarded her for past medical expenses. However, the District Court concluded that the effect of our holding in <em>Renville I </em>was to remand the entire issue of damages to the District Court for a new trial. The District Court further concluded that factual issues existed with regard to the amount of Renville\u2019s past medical expenses, and that such factual issues were for a jury to determine upon re-trial. Therefore, the District Court dismissed Renville\u2019s request for a declaratory judgment on the issue of past medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u00b612 On appeal, Renville contends that the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to follow our holding in <em>Renville I </em>with regard to past medical expenses. Renville asserts that our holding in <em>Renville I: </em>(1) established that she had incurred past medical expenses in the amount of $17,553; and (2) remanded the issue of further damages to the District Court for re-trial. We conclude that Renville\u2019s interpretation of our prior decision is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b613 The relevant language from <em>Renville I </em>is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">Even though the jury was instructed to award damages for past and future medical expense, loss of earnings and earning capacity, pain and suffering, loss of ability to pursue an occupation, and loss of ability to pursue an established course of life, the jury\u2019s general verdict was limited to the amount of the past medical expenses. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-8\"><em>Renville I, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">We conclude that [Renville] was entitled to some award of damages for the pain and suffering proven in this case. We further conclude that the jury\u2019s award limited to past medical expenses is not supported by substantial evidence and should be set aside.... For that reason, we set aside the jury\u2019s verdict on damages and remand to the District Court for a new trial limited to the issue of damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-10\"><em>Renville I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26, 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">\u00b614 The above language from <em>Renville I </em>clearly states that the jury\u2019s award was limited to Renville\u2019s past medical expenses. The jury awarded Renville $17,553 in spite of the defendant\u2019s argument on appeal that the award included other elements of damage. Implicit in our holding was that past medical expenses in the amount $17,553 had been proven and awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">\u00b615 We have previously held that: \u201cUnder the doctrine of law of the case, a prior decision of this Court resolving a particular issue between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>the same parties in the same case is binding and cannot be relitigated.\u201d <em>Calcaterra v. Montana Resources, </em>2001 MT 193, \u00b6 10, 306 Mont. 249, \u00b6 10, 32 P.3d 764, \u00b6 10. We have further noted that \u201cthe law of the case doctrine applies only to those principles or rules of law enunciated by this Court which are \u2018necessary to the decision\u2019 before it,\u201d as \u201cthe doctrine does not extend so far as to include matter which was consequential, incidental, or not decided by the court.\u201d <em>Sanders v. State, </em>1998 MT 62, \u00b6 16, 288 Mont. 143, \u00b6 16, 955 P.2d 1356, \u00b6 16 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\">\u00b616 The sole issue, with regard to damages, examined by this Court in <em>Renville I </em>was whether the jury\u2019s award was supported by substantial evidence. Essential to our conclusion that the verdict was not supported by substantial evidence was our conclusion that the jury\u2019s award in the amount of $17,553 was limited to Renville\u2019s past medical expenses. Therefore, we hold that the law of the case doctrine applies and that our holding in <em>Renville I </em>established that Renville had incurred past medical expenses in the amount of $17,553.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b617  The law of the case doctrine precludes subsequent evidentiary hearings on issues finally adjudicated by this Court. It thus promotes judicial economy. <em>State v. Gilder, </em>2001 MT 121, \u00b6 16, 305 Mont. 362, \u00b6 16, 28 P.3d 488, \u00b6 16. Therefore, the District Court was precluded from revisiting the issue of Renville\u2019s past medical damages on remand. A district court\u2019s failure to properly apply the law of the case constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>Gilder, </em>\u00b6 18. Here, the District Court failed to treat our decision in <em>Renville I </em>as the law of the case when it concluded that factual issues existed as to the amount of Renville\u2019s past medical expenses. Accordingly, the District Court abused its discretion when it denied Renville\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed her request for a declaratory judgment on the issue of past medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b618 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it dismissed Renville\u2019s request for a declaratory judgment on the issue of ongoing medical expenses?</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b619 Renville\u2019s declaratory judgment action also requested that the District Court order Farmers to pay the medical expenses which she incurred subsequent to trial (hereinafter referred to as ongoing medical expenses). However, the District Court concluded that factual issues existed with regard to the cause of Renville\u2019s ongoing medical expenses which must be determined by a jury upon re-trial. Accordingly, the District Court also dismissed Renville\u2019s request for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>declaratory judgment on the issue of ongoing medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b620 Renville maintains that the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to comply with this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ridley v. Guaranty Nat. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 325, 951 P.2d 987. <em>InRidley, </em>Keith Ridley was a passenger in a vehicle that was involved in a collision. The driver of the other vehicle was insured by Guaranty National Insurance Company. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 327-28, 951 P.2d at 988. Guaranty admitted that its insured had the majority of fault for the accident, however, it refused to pay for Ridley\u2019s ongoing medical expenses. Guaranty explained that its refusal to pay was based on its uncertainty about the causal relationship between the accident and the extent of Ridley\u2019s injuries. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 328, 951 P.2d at 989. Ridley brought a declaratory action in which he requested that the District Court determine that pursuant to \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, Guaranty had an obligation to pay his medical expenses. The District Court declined to grant Ridley the requested relief. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 328, 951 P.2d at 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b621 On appeal, this Court analyzed Ridley\u2019s claim in the context of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 332-33, 951 P.2d at 991. Section 33-18-201, MCA, provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">No person may, with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice, do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">(6) neglect to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">(13) fail to promptly settle claims, if liability has become reasonably clear, under one portion of the insurance policy coverage in order to influence settlements under other portions of the insurance policy coverage ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">\u00b622 We concluded that both subsections (6) and (13) of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, require an insurer to pay an injured third party\u2019s medical expenses before final settlement when liability is reasonably clear. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 334, 951 P.2d at 992. Consequently, we reversed the order of the District Court and entered declaratory judgment in favor of Ridley. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 338, 951 P.2d at 994-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">\u00b623 The facts of the instant case are nearly identical to those in <em>Ridley. </em>In <em>Renville I, </em>we noted that Taylor admitted negligently causing the automobile collision and that Taylor did not contest the jury\u2019s finding that Renville was injured as a result of the collision. <em>Renville I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12, 28. Accordingly, Taylor is liable for all of Renville\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>medical expenses which are causally related to the collision. Farmers, however, refuses to pay Renville\u2019s ongoing medical expenses because it contends that Renville\u2019s expenses were not causally related to the collision. Farmers relies on the following language from <em>Ridley:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-3\">[Our holding in Ridley] does not mean that an insurer is responsible for all medical expenses submitted by an injured plaintiff. Liability must be reasonably clear for the expense that is submitted. That is, even though liability for the accident may be reasonably clear, an insurer may still dispute a medical expense if it is not reasonably clear that the expense is causally related to the accident in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 334, 951 P.2d at 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b624 Farmers correctly contends that an insurer may dispute its obligation to pay a medical expense. However, it may not do so without any factual basis. In this case, Farmers has failed to submit evidence to support its claim that Renville\u2019s ongoing medical expenses were not causally related to the collision. Renville, on the other hand, offered expert testimony on causation, from three separate expert witnesses, which is uncontroverted. Farmers chose to rely on testimony from the prior trial. That evidence was obviously disregarded by the jury and is not relevant to the issue of ongoing medical expenses. To hold otherwise would fly in the face of what we previously stated about the law of the case. Furthermore, it is well stated that \u201cparties on appeal are bound by the record and may not add additional matters in briefs or appendices.\u201d <em>Janow v. Conoco Pipe Line Co., </em>2000 MT 242, \u00b6 14, 301 Mont. 402, \u00b6 14, 10 P.3d 79, \u00b6 14. Thus, Farmers may not rely on evidence that is not a part of the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b625  Pursuant to <em>Renville I, </em>it is clear that Taylor is liable for all of Renville\u2019s medical expenses which are causally related to the collision. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 28. Therefore, because Farmers failed to present facts to controvert deposition testimony which established that Renville\u2019s ongoing medical expenses are causally related to the collision, Farmers is required to pay Renville\u2019s ongoing medical expenses pursuant to our holding in <em>Ridley. </em>See <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 334, 951 P.2d at 992. Accordingly, the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to follow our holding in <em>Ridley </em>and dismissed Renville\u2019s request for a declaratory judgment on the issue of ongoing medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u00b626 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the District Court, and remand this case for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-8\">JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"A6r\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"A1X\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>\u00b627 I respectfully dissent from Issue 1. The Court\u2019s holding and instructions on remand in <em>Renville I </em>were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the jury\u2019s damage award was not supported by substantial credible evidence. For that reason, we set aside the jury\u2019s verdict on damages and remand to the District Court <em>for a new trial limited to the issue of damages. </em>We note that Taylor has not appealed the jury\u2019s finding that Maria was injured as a result of the parties\u2019 collision. Therefore, upon retrial that fact need not be re-established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">We reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand to the District Court <em>for a new trial limited to the issue of damages.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3G\"><em>Renville I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28, 37 (emphasis added). The Court\u2019s intent in <em>Renville I </em>may very well have been to order judgment for Renville\u2019s past medical expenses on the basis of the jury\u2019s verdict, but I cannot fault the District Court\u2019s denial thereof, given the language of the holding and the instructions in <em>Renville I, </em>which failed to express this intention or instruct that a partial judgment be entered. The Court distinctly ordered a new trial on damages and exempted only the necessity of proving that Maria\u2019s injury was caused by the collision from re-trial. The law of the case is what the Court held, not what it otherwise intended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">On <em>remand, </em>the trial court may consider or decide any matters <em>left open by the appellate court </em>and is free to make any order in further progress of the case, not inconsistent with the decision of the appellate court, <em>as to any question not presented or settled by that decision .... </em>5 Am. Jur. 2d 420, 421, Appeal and Error, \u00a7\u00a7 992 (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\"><em>State v. Gilder, </em>2001 MT 121, \u00b6 14, 305 Mont. 362, \u00b6 14, 28 P.3d 488, \u00b614, quoting <em>Zavarelli v. Might </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 120, 125, 779 P.2d 489, 492-93. Here, the issue of damages was \u201cnot settled\u201d by the decision, but rather, remanded for re-trial. Because the issue, intentionally or not, was \u201cleft open\u201d by <em>Renville I, </em>I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b628 Further, for that very reason-that <em>Renville I </em>left open the issue of damages for retrial -I cannot agree with the Court that evidence introduced at the first trial is \u201cnot relevant to the issue of ongoing medical bills\u201d for purposes of applying <em>Ridley, </em>and thus, because causation of some of the medical bills remains in dispute, I would affirm the District Court on Issue 2.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
