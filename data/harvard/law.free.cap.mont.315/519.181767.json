(D-2), in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County. Respondent Canal Insurance Company (Canal), intervened in the case. The Shilhaneks filed a cross-claim against Canal, alleging that Canal had violated the Montana Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA). Canal filed a motion for summary judgment, which was denied by the District Court. Canal then filed a second motion for summary judgment, which the District Court granted. The Shilhaneks appeal. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it determined that Canal did not have a duty in 1997 or 1998 to pay the Shilhaneks\u2019 undisputed medical expenses until it obtained a release for its insureds?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">\u00b64 2. Did Canal act in bad faith when it conditioned its payment of policy limits on the Shilhaneks providing it with a release of all claims against its insureds?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err when it granted Canal\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to the Shilhaneks\u2019 claim that Canal violated \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA (1997)?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u00b66 On May 4, 1997, Roxy Shilhanek and her son, Corey Shilhanek, were involved in a motor vehicle accident in Billings, Montana. The accident occurred when a truck driven by Ceklarz collided with Roxy\u2019s vehicle. The truck was owned by Cwikla and D-2. The Shilhaneks brought a lawsuit against Ceklarz, Cwikla, and D-2 on August 11, 1997. The case proceeded to trial, and a jury awarded the Shilhaneks compensatory and punitive damages on July 24, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b67 Following the jury\u2019s verdict, several post-trial motions were filed. On February 1, 1999, Canal, the liability insurer for D-2, Cwikla and Ceklarz, filed a motion to intervene in the case for the limited purpose of challenging one of the District Court\u2019s orders regarding a post-trial motion. On February 17, 1999, the District Court granted Canal\u2019s motion to intervene; however, it declared that Canal would be treated as a full party to the action. The Shilhaneks subsequently filed a cross-claim against Canal on February 19, 1999, alleging that Canal had violated the UTPA. Canal then appealed the District Court\u2019s decision to declare it a full party to the action. We affirmed the District Court with regard to this issue on January 20, 2000. See <em>Shilhanek v. D-2 Trucking, Inc., </em>2000 MT 16, \u00b6\u00b6 44-48, 298 Mont. 101, \u00b6\u00b6 44-48, 994 P.2d 1105, \u00b6\u00b6 44-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u00b68 On March 1, 2000, Canal filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging that its actions were not in violation of any portion of the UTPA. The District Court denied Canal\u2019s motion on June 26,2000. On July 16, 2001, Canal filed a second motion for summary judgment, which was similar in content to its original summary judgment motion. Canal\u2019s second motion requested that the District Court revisit its claims in light of discovery that had occurred in the case. The District Court granted Canal\u2019s second motion for summary judgment on August 28, 2001. This appeals follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\u00b69 Our review of a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment is <em>de novo. Hickey v. Baker School Dist. No. 12, </em>2002 MT 322, \u00b6 12, 313 Mont. 162, \u00b6 12, 60 P.3d 966, \u00b6 12. Therefore, we apply the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P, criteria as applied by the district court. <em>Hickey, </em>\u00b6 12. Pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><em>Hickey, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u00b610 The District Court\u2019s resolution of the Shilhaneks\u2019 cross-claim left some issues unresolved. Accordingly, we have restated the issues to address the unresolved questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err when it determined that Canal did not have a duty in 1997 or 1998 to pay the Shilhaneks\u2019 undisputed medical expenses until it obtained a release for its insureds?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">\u00b612 Canal offered to settle the Shilhaneks\u2019 claims against D-2, Cwikla and Ceklarz (hereinafter Canal\u2019s insureds) on February 27, 1998. Canal\u2019s offer provided that it would pay the Shilhaneks the policy limit of $1,000,000, in exchange for a full release of all claims against its insureds. The Shilhaneks refused to provide such a release. The case then proceeded to trial, and the Shilhaneks were awarded damages in excess of $3,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">\u00b613 The Shilhaneks subsequently filed a cross-claim against Canal, asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that Canal\u2019s refusal to pay their undisputed medical expenses without a release violated subsections (6) and (13) of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA (1997). Section 33-18-201, MCA (1997), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-11\">No person may, with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice, do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-12\">(6) neglect to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-13\">(13) fail to promptly settle claims, if liability has become reasonably clear, under one portion of the insurance policy coverage in order to influence settlements under other portions of the insurance policy coverage!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">\u00b614 Our holding in <em>Ridley v. Guaranty Nat. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 325, 951 P.2d 987, is dispositive of this issue. In <em>Ridley, </em>Keith Ridley was a passenger in a vehicle that was involved in a collision. The driver of the other vehicle was insured by Guaranty National <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Insurance Company. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 327-28, 951 P.2d at 988. Guaranty admitted that its insured had the majority of fault for the accident; however, it refused to pay for Ridley\u2019s ongoing medical expenses. Ridley brought a declaratory action, requesting that the District Court determine that pursuant to \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, Guaranty had an obligation to pay medical expenses when liability was reasonably clear, regardless of whether a final settlement had been agreed upon. The District Court declined to grant Ridley the requested relief, and Ridley appealed. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 328, 951 P.2d at 989.</p>\n<p id=\"ALV\">\u00b615  This Court analyzed Ridley\u2019s claim in the context of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, and noted that the purpose of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, is to assure prompt payment of damages for which an insurer is clearly obligated. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 335, 951 P.2d at 993. Accordingly, we held that subsections (6) and (13) of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, require an insurer to pay an injured third party\u2019s medical expenses before final settlement when liability is reasonably clear. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 334, 951 P.2d at 992. Therefore, we reversed the order of the District Court and entered declaratory judgment in favor of Ridley. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 338, 951 P.2d at 994-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b616  Pursuant to <em>Ridley, </em>insurers are obligated to pay an injured third party\u2019s medical expenses prior to final settlement when liability for such expenses is reasonably clear. <em>Ridley </em>was decided on December 24, 1997. Consequently, Canal\u2019s obligation under <em>Ridley </em>arose on December 24, 1997. Canal does not contest the fact that its insureds are liable for the Shilhaneks\u2019 injuries. Therefore, we hold that Canal had a duty to pay the Shilhaneks\u2019 undisputed medical expenses, up to the limits of its coverage, without the benefit of a settlement agreement, after December 24, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b617 As an alternative argument, Canal maintains that if our holding in <em>Ridley </em>imposed on it the obligation to pay the Shilhaneks\u2019 undisputed medical expenses before final settlement, such obligation was limited to the mandatory minimum coverage required by the Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Act (MVRA). Section 61-6-103(2)(b)(i)-(iii), MCA (1997), a provision of the MVRA, provides that all owners and operators of motor vehicles must carry mandatory liability insurance, in the minimum amount of: (1) $25,000 because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident; (2) $50,000 because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident; and (3) $10,000 because of injury to or destruction of property of others in any one accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u00b618 This Court addressed the nexus between \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>\u00a7 61-6-103(2), MCA, in <em>Watters v. Guaranty Nat. Ins. </em>Co., 2000 MT 150, 300 Mont. 91, 3 P.3d 626. The plaintiffs in <em>Watters </em>were injured when their vehicle was involved in a collision with another vehicle. The driver of the other vehicle was insured by Guaranty National Insurance Company for the minimum amount of coverage required by \u00a7 61-6-103(2), MCA. Guaranty investigated the accident and determined that its insured was at fault for the collision, and that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the policy limits of $50,000. <em>Watters, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Guaranty refused to tender policy limits, however, until the plaintiffs provided Guaranty with a full and final release of all claims. <em>Watters, </em>\u00b6 12. The plaintiffs subsequently rejected Guaranty\u2019s offer, and alleged that Guaranty\u2019s actions violated \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA. <em>Watters, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\u00b619 On appeal, we determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">[W]here an insured\u2019s liability for damages caused to a third party in an auto accident is reasonably clear, and those damages undisputedly exceed the mandatory limits set forth under \u00a7 61-6-103(2), MCA, it is an unfair trade practice <em>per se </em>under \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, for an insurer to condition the payment of the owed mandatory minimum policy limits on the third party\u2019s agreement to provide a full and final release of all liability in favor of an insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\"><em>Watters, </em>\u00b6 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\u00b620 However, we also noted that \u201cour decision [in Watters] does not affect excess coverage that an insured chooses to carry ....\u201d <em>Watters, </em>\u00b6 63. Accordingly, Canal argues that <em>Watters </em>left open the question of whether an insurer\u2019s obligation under <em>Ridley </em>is limited to the minimum amount of coverage required by \u00a7 61-6-103(2), MCA. Given the facts of the instant case, we now answer this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">\u00b621 Our holding in <em>Ridley </em>regarding \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, of the UTPA, is not circumscribed by the requirements of \u00a7 61-6-103(2), MCA, of the MVRA. Thus, to interpret <em>Ridley </em>as applying only to medical expenses which are within the mandatory minimums required by the MVRA, is to interpret <em>Ridley </em>too narrowly. We further note that the UTPA itself contains no reference to the MVRA. That is, the UTPA, which was enacted to regulate trade practices in the business of insurance, contains no language indicating that it is limited by the MVRA, which lists the responsibilities of vehicle owners and users. Consequently, we conclude that an insurer\u2019s obligation to pay an injured third party\u2019s undisputed medical expenses before final settlement is not limited to the minimum coverage required by \u00a7 61-6-103(2), MCA, of the MVRA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>We further conclude that to the extent that there is language in <em>Watters </em>which might be read to imply that an insurer\u2019s obligation under <em>Ridley </em>is limited to the minimum coverage required by the MVRA, that language is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">\u00b622  In summary, we hold that Canal had a duty to pay the Shilhaneks\u2019 undisputed medical expenses, up to the limits of its coverage and without the benefit of a settlement agreement, after December 24, 1997. As such, we reverse the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Canal with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u00b623 Did Canal act in bad faith when it conditioned its payment of policy limits on the Shilhaneks providing it with a release of all claims against its insureds?</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u00b624 The Shilhaneks\u2019 cross-claim also alleged that Canal\u2019s refusal to tender policy limits without a release violated subsection (6) of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA (1997). Section 33-18-201, MCA (1997), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">No person may, with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice, do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">(6) neglect to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">\u00b625 The District Court considered the Shilhaneks\u2019 claim and determined that, pursuant to our holding in <em>Juedeman v. National Farmers Union </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 278, 833 P.2d 191, Canal was not in violation of \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA (1997). The District Court relied on the following language from <em>Juedeman:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-11\">In this case, plaintiff refused to release [the insureds] from liability in return for payment of the policy limits.... This Court has held that without an agreement to release, there is no offer for settlement. <em>Thompson v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. </em>(1973), 161 Mont. 207, 219-220, 505 P.2d 423, 430. Here, the plaintiffs conduct prevented [the insurer] from effectuating a prompt, fair and equitable settlement.... Accordingly, the plaintiff has no bad faith claim against [the insurer],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-12\"><em>Juedeman, </em>253 Mont. at 281, 833 P.2d at 193. The District Court concluded that because <em>Juedeman </em>held that it was permissible for an insurer to condition settlement upon obtaining a release of claims against its insured, Canal had not acted in bad faith, as contemplated in \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u00b626 <em>Juedeman </em>was the applicable law regarding this issue until <em>Ridley </em>was decided on December 24, 1997. As we noted above, <em>Ridley </em>held that an insurer was required to pay an injured third party1 s medical expenses before final settlement when liability is reasonably clear. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 334, 951 P.2d at 992. What <em>Ridley </em>declined to address, however, was the payment of other types of expenses. This Court later addressed such other expenses in <em>Watters, </em>as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\">[Wjhere an insured\u2019s liability for damages caused to a third party in an auto accident is reasonably clear, and those damages undisputedly exceed the mandatory limits set forth under \u00a7 61-6-103(2), MCA, it is an unfair trade practice <em>per se </em>under \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, for an insurer to condition the payment of the owed mandatory minimum policy limits on the third party\u2019s agreement to provide a full and final release of all liability in favor of an insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><em>Watters, </em>\u00b6 61 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\u00b627 The above holding from <em>Watters </em>expanded the requirements of <em>Ridley, </em>providing that it was a violation of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, for <em>an </em>insurer to condition the payment of owed mandatory minimum policy limits on a third party\u2019s agreement to provide a full and final release of all liability against an insured. <em>Watters, </em>\u00b6 61. Thus, Canal\u2019s offer of settlement, which provided that it would not pay policy limits unless the Shilhaneks provided it with a full and final release of all claims against its insured, violated \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA. However, <em>Watters </em>was decided on June 6, 2000. Canal made its offer of settlement to the Shilhaneks on February 27, 1998. Accordingly, Canal has raised a defense under \u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\u00b628 Section 33-18-242, MCA (1997), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">(1) An insured or a third-party claimant has an independent cause of action against an insurer for actual damages caused by the insurer\u2019s violation of subsection (1), (4), (5), (6), (9), or (13) of 33-18-201.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">(5) An insurer may not be held liable under this section if the insurer had a reasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting the claim or the amount of the claim, whichever is in issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">\u00b629 We addressed \u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA, in <em>Watters, </em>when the insurer, relying on <em>Juedeman, </em>also refused to tender policy limits in the absence of a release of all claims against its insured. The plaintiffs in <em>Watters </em>responded by asserting that the insurer\u2019s actions violated \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA. On \u00e1ppeal, we concluded that the insurer had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>defense to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim under \u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\">[A]t the time this dispute arose, <em>Juedeman </em>was the lone precedent from Montana case law upon which [the insurer] could rely under the circumstances.... We must therefore conclude that a plain reading of the available case law at the time gave [the insurer] a reasonable basis in law upon which it could deny payment of policy limits. That is, <em>Juedeman </em>was legally conclusive to the extent there was simply no other authority in Montana at the time suggesting that in order to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of a third-party claim in good faith, an insurer must, under certain circumstances, pay policy limits without a full and final release for its insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-5\"><em>Watters, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 71-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u00b630  In this case, Canal made its offer of settlement to the Shilhaneks over two years before <em>Watters </em>was decided. Consequently, like the insurer in <em>Watters, </em>Canal had an arguably reasonable basis in law for asserting that it was entitled to condition its payment of policy limits on the Shilhaneks providing it with a release of all claims against its insureds. Therefore, pursuant to \u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA (1997), we conclude that Canal cannot be held liable for acting in bad faith in violation of \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u00b631  In light of our above conclusion, we hold that Canal did not violate \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA (1997), when it attempted to condition its payment of policy limits on the Shilhaneks providing it with a release of all claims against its insureds. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Canal with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AVU\">\u00b632  Further, so as to fully and finally clarify the law in this regard, we hereby hold that <em>Juedeman, </em>which was overruled in part by both <em>Ridley </em>and <em>Watters, </em>is overruled in its entirety. We further hold that nothing in the UTPA requires a general release of the insured or the insurer as a condition to a \u00a7 33-18-201(6) or (13), MCA, settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">\u00b633 Did the District Court err when it granted Canal\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to the Shilhaneks\u2019 claim that Canal violated \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA (1997)?</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">\u00b634 The Shilhaneks maintain that on the date of the accident, Officer Gary McVay of the Billings Police Department completed a thorough investigation of the collision and determined that Ceklarz was entirely at fault. The Shilhaneks further allege that neither Canal nor its employees ever contacted Officer McVay to obtain the results of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>investigation. Finally, the Shilhaneks contend that although they repeatedly provided Canal with medical documentation regarding Roxy and Corey\u2019s injuries, Canal refused to make advance payments to the Shilhaneks to cover their medical expenses. Consequently, the Shilhaneks assert that Canal\u2019s conduct was in violation of \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA (1997), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-4\">No person may, with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice, do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">(4) refuse to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation based upon all available information[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\u00b635 The District Court examined the Shilhaneks\u2019 claim and determined that Canal had attempted to discover the amount of the Shilhaneks\u2019 outstanding medical expenses. The District Court further determined that although the Shilhaneks failed to provide Canal with information regarding their outstanding medical expenses, Canal forwarded a check in the amount of $5,000 to the Shilhaneks to cover outstanding medical expenses, which the Shilhaneks rejected. Accordingly, the District Court concluded that Canal had not violated \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA (1997), and granted Canal\u2019s motion for summary judgment with regard to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\u00b636 We note however, that the District Court neglected to address the Shilhaneks\u2019 contention that Canal declined payment without first conducting a reasonable investigation. Summary judgment is proper only where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of establishing that no genuine issue of fact exists, and only when that burden is met does the burden shift to the opposing party to show that there is a genuine issue as to some material fact. <em>Walker v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 256, 258, 786 P.2d 1157,1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">\u00b637  We conclude that Canal did not meet its burden in the instant case. That is, the record before the District Court illuminated several material facts in dispute between the parties regarding Canal\u2019s potential violation of \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA (1997), including Canal\u2019s failure to obtain Officer McVay\u2019s police report. Therefore, we conclude that this issue was not properly resolved with summary judgment. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Canal with respect to this issue, and remand this issue to the District Court for trial on the merits of the Shilhaneks\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">\u00b638 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b554-4\">JUSTICE RICE and DISTRICT JUDGE McNEIL, sitting for JUSTICE REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b554-5\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AIV\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\u00b639 Although I concur in Issues 2 and 3, I do not agree with the majority\u2019s analysis or decision as to Issue 1. Specifically, it is my view that <em>Ridley\u2019s </em>discussion of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, of the UTPA was circumscribed by the requirements of \u00a7 61-6-103(2), MCA, of the MVRA. In point of fact we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">Furthermore, our interpretation of subsection (6) is more consistent with the purpose of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, which is to assure prompt payment of damages for which an insurer is clearly obligated. It is also more consistent with this state\u2019s public policy, as established by the \u201cmandatory liability protection\u201d provisions of Montana law found at \u00a7\u00a7 61-6-301 to -304, MCA. We have held that \u201c[i]t is clear that the mandatory liability insurance law seeks to protect members of the general public who are innocent victims of automobile accidents.\u201d <em>Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. Davis </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 166, 170, 752 P.2d 166, 169.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">One of the most significant obligations that innocent victims of automobile accidents incur and for which mandatory liability insurance laws were enacted, is the obligation to pay the costs of medical treatment. If the insurer has no obligation to pay those expenses in a timely fashion, even though liability is reasonably clear, then the protection provided by Montana\u2019s mandatory liability laws would be of little value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">Medical expenses from even minor injuries can be devastating to a family of average income. The inability to pay them can damage credit and, as alleged in this case, sometimes preclude adequate treatment and recovery from the very injuries caused. Just as importantly, the financial stress of being unable to pay medical expenses can lead to the ill-advised settlement of other legitimate claims in order to secure a benefit to which an innocent victim of an automobile accident is clearly entitled. We conclude that this is not what was intended by the Montana Legislature when mandatory liability insurance laws and unfair claims practice laws were enacted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-10\"><em>Ridley v. Guaranty Nat. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 325, 335, 951 P.2d. 987, 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">\u00b640 Nothing in <em>Ridley </em>suggests, much less requires, that it applies to coverage in excess of the mandatory minimums of the MVRA. Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>the proposition for which <em>Ridley </em>is now being cited-i.e., that \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, of the UTPA was not circumscribed by the requirements of \u00a7 61-6-103(2), MCA, of the MVRA-was not even at issue in <em>Ridley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ARM\">\u00b641 I submit that this interpretation is further supported by and consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dubray v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, </em>2001 MT 251, \u00b6 14-15, 307 Mont. 134, \u00b6 14-15, 36 P.3d 897, \u00b6 14-15, wherein we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\">The essence of our holding in <em>Ridley </em>is that where liability is reasonably clear, injured victims are entitled to payment of those damages which are not reasonably in dispute without first executing a settlement agreement and final release. In arriving at this conclusion, we relied on Montana\u2019s public policy of protecting innocent victims of automobile accidents, as established by the \u201cmandatory liability protection\u201d provisions found at \u00a7\u00a7 61-6-301 to -304, MCA. We noted that \u201c[i]t is clear that the mandatory liability insurance law seeks to protect members of the general public who are innocent victims of automobile accidents.\u201d <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 335, 951 P.2d at 993 (citations omitted.) Finally, we concluded that <em>\u201c[o]ne of the most significant obligations </em>that innocent victims of automobile accidents incur and for which mandatory liability insurance laws were enacted, is the obligation to pay the costs of medical treatment.\u201d [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">Nothing in <em>Ridley </em>suggests that its scope should be categorically limited to medical expenses. Rather, medical expenses are just one of the obligations incurred by victims that mandatory liability insurance laws were designed to alleviate. Lost wages which are reasonably certain and directly related to an insured\u2019s negligence or wrongful act are another example.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\u00b642 It seems to me that both <em>Ridley </em>and <em>Dubray </em>were tied into the limits of the MVRA. And, while it may be argued that the above-quoted language is dicta, I am not persuaded that those who read and relied on those opinions necessarily read the quoted language in the context that we are now interpreting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">\u00b643 That we have now chosen to advance the <em>Ridley, Watters </em>and <em>Dubray </em>rationale the next incremental step-i.e., that the plain language of the UTPA is not circumscribed by the plain language of the MVRA-is based on that argument which was finally raised in this case, but not, in my view, in the foregoing trilogy. That is why the language at \u00b6 61 in <em>Watters v. Guaranty Nat. Ins. Co., 2000 </em>MT 150, 300 Mont. 91, 3 P.3d 626, which we now overrule, was included in our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Opinion. <em>See Watters, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">\u00b644 I would provide Canal a \u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA, defense; therefore, I dissent as to Issue 1.</p>\n<judges id=\"b556-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY and JUSTICE LEAPHART join in the foregoing concurrence and dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b556-6\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AB9\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\u00b645 I join the majority\u2019s resolution of issues 1 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">\u00b646 I concur with the majority\u2019s conclusions that following our decision in <em>Ridley v. Guaranty Nat. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 325, 951 P.2d 987, the Defendant, Canal Insurance Company had a duty to pay the Plaintiffs their undisputed medical expenses without the benefit of a release for its insureds. I also concur with the majority\u2019s conclusions that Canal\u2019s obligation arose from \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-201(6) and (13), MCA (1997), and was independent of any obligation established by the Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Act; to the extent it is inconsistent, our decision in <em>Watters v. Guaranty Nat. Ins. Co., </em>2000 MT 150, 300 Mont. 91, 3 P.3d 626, should be reversed; and, that our decision in <em>Juedeman v. National Farmers Union </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 278, 833 P.2d 191, should be reversed in its entirety. Finally, I concur with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the District Court erred when it granted summary judgment with respect to the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Canal breached its duty to conduct a reasonable investigation pursuant to \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">\u00b647 However, I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that Canal had a reasonable basis in law or fact for contesting the Shilhaneks\u2019 claim even after our decision in <em>Ridley. </em>To the extent that the <em>Watters </em>decision suggests otherwise, that was not my intent when I joined it.</p>\n<p id=\"A1H\">\u00b648 In analyzing the issues presented in this case, it is important to keep in mind that the insurer\u2019s obligation to pay claims for which liability is reasonably clear does not originate with <em>Ridley. </em>The source of the obligation is \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA. (Part of what is known as the Unfair Claims Practices Act.) All this Court did in <em>Ridley </em>is interpret the word \u201csettlements\u201d as used in that section. <em>Ridley </em>was not based on the nature of damages being claimed, nor the amount of liability insurance available, nor the Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Act which is found at Title 61, Chapter 6, and pertains to an entirely different subject. (The minimum amount and types of liability insurance that motor vehicle owners and operators are required to carry.) All we held in <em>Ridley </em>is that \u201csettlements\u201d as used in \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA, do not require a release.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">\u00b649 The question then, following <em>Ridley, </em>is whether \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-201(6) or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>(13), MCA, by themselves provide any basis for limiting the insurer\u2019s obligation to a specific type of claim or to claims against insureds who have only mandatory minimum amounts of liability insurance coverage. The simple answer is that there is no such language in the statute. Insurers have tried to add that language on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">\u00b650 We have had to repeatedly deal with this issue not only in the cases cited by the majority, but in <em>DuBray v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, </em>2001 MT 251, 307 Mont. 134, 36 P.3d 897. In that case, the insurer contended that <em>Ridley </em>applied only to medical bills. We held otherwise. We had to deal with the issue in <em>Watters </em>because the insurance company argued that \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA, should not apply where the settlement would exhaust policy limits. We discussed the obligation in terms of the mandatory liability coverage statute because that is the context in which it was presented to us. However, both of these arguments were far fetched and in no way justified by the language of \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-201(6) or (13), MCA. The statute, itself, simply places no limit on an insurer\u2019s obligation. The only limits are whether there is a reasonable dispute about the amount of damage or liability and the terms of the insurer\u2019s policy with its insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\u00b651 In this case, Canal argues that it had a right to rely on <em>Juedeman </em>because the portion of that decision which conditioned an insurer\u2019s obligation to pay on a settlement agreement was not reversed by <em>Ridley. </em>The simple answer is that there is no actual discussion of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, in that case which could have been analyzed or reversed. The Court simply held in <em>Juedeman, </em>253 Mont. at 281, 833 P.2d at 193, based on the facts that the \u201cplaintiffs conduct prevented Farmers Union from effectuating a prompt, fair and equitable settlement.\u201d There is no discussion in that case of what \u201csettlement\u201d meant or how the Court otherwise arrived at its conclusion. In <em>Ridley, </em>we explained for the first time what \u201csettlements\u201d means in the context of \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\u00b652 The reason <em>Watters </em>was limited to the Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Act is simple. In that Opinion, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">As argued by both parties, this issue must first be properly cast within the framework of Montana\u2019s Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-8\"><em>Watters, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">\u00b653 The parties in <em>Watters </em>apparently chose to limit their arguments to policies provided in satisfaction of the Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Act because that is the policy that was at issue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number><em>Watters </em>and because of the bolstering language used in <em>Ridley </em>which listed the act as another example of the legislature\u2019s intent that innocent third-party victims be protected. However, there is nothing in the rationale of the <em>Watters </em>decision for limiting its application to cases involving mandatory minimum liability coverage. We rejected the argument that a full and final release was required before the obligation to pay arose based, once again, on the plain language of \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">\u00b654 In <em>DuBray, </em>the insurer insisted that <em>Ridley </em>only applied to medical bills because medical bills were what had been involved in <em>Ridley. </em>However, we held that the rationale in <em>Ridley </em>was equally applicable to wage loss. In <em>DuBray, </em>wage loss was the issue presented to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\u00b655 The issue here is not what shelter from the law can be found in isolated language specific to the facts of each of our prior cases. The issue is simply what is required of a law-abiding insurer pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-201(4)(6) and (13), MCA. To me, that has been abundantly clear since December 24, 1997, the date of our decision in <em>Ridley v. Guaranty National Ins. Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\u00b656 For these reasons, I concur in part with, and dissent in part from, the majority Opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
