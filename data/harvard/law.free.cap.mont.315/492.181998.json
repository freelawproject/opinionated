(Westmark) filed a complaint to quiet title in the First Judicial District Court, Broadwater County. Although the complaint named several defendants, Appellant Gold Hill Placers, Inc. (Gold Hill) was the only defendant to appear. As the case proceeded, Westmark and Gold Hill were unable to agree upon a final pretrial order. Frustrated by this delay, the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>stated that if the parties failed to present a final pretrial order by February 25,2002, the trial date set for the case would be vacated. The parties failed to present a final pretrial order by February 25, 2002; however, the case proceeded to trial as scheduled. Gold Hill failed to appear at the trial, and the District Court entered judgment in favor of Westmark. Gold Hill subsequently filed a motion for a new trial. The District Court denied the motion, and Gold Hill appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A0z\">\u00b62 We restate the sole issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b63 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Gold Hill\u2019s motion for a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b64 On August 27,1998, Westmark filed a complaint to quiet title on certain real property located in Broadwater County, Montana. The complaint named several defendants; however, Gold Hill was the only defendant to appear. The District Court subsequently entered judgment by default against the remaining defendants. On November 10, 1998, Gold Hill filed a counterclaim against Westmark, asserting that it was entitled to take possession of the disputed property, or in the alternative, to recover damages from Westmark in the amount of $3,700,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\u00b65 A pretrial conference was held on February 22, 2002. Counsel for both Westmark and Gold Hill appeared at the conference; however, the parties were not able to agree upon a final pretrial order. Frustrated by this delay, the District Court stated that if the parties failed to present a final pretrial order by February 25, 2002, the trial date set for the case would be vacated. The case was set for trial on March 4, 2002. On February 27, 2002, Gold Hill filed a motion to stay the trial date, as the parties failed to reach an agreement regarding the final pretrial order. The District Court denied Gold Hill\u2019s motion on February 28, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\u00b66 Gold Hill failed to appear at the March 4, 2002, trial. On March 5, 2002, the District Court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgment, in which it quieted title of the disputed property in favor of Westmark. Gold Hill filed a motion for a new trial on March 15, 2002. On March 22, 2002, the District Court issued an order, stating that Westmark was entitled to recover $23,507.50 in attorney\u2019s fees, and $1,904.10 in costs, from Gold Hill. The District Court denied Gold Hill\u2019s motion for a new trial on March 26, 2002. Gold Hill appealed the District Court\u2019s: (1) findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgment; (2) March 22, 2002, order; and (3) denial of its motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>for a new trial, on April 23, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b67 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial is manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Satterfield v. Medlin, </em>2002 MT 260, \u00b6 14, 312 Mont. 234, \u00b6 14, 59 P.3d 33, \u00b6 14. The decision to grant or deny a new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent a showing of manifest abuse of that discretion. <em>Satterfield, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u00b68 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Gold Hill\u2019s motion for a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u00b69 The District Court\u2019s minute entry from the pretrial conference on February 22, 2002, contained the following statement: \u201cThe Court ordered the parties to present the Final Pretrial Order by Monday, February 25,2002, or the Trial date will be vacated.\u201d The parties failed to present a final pretrial order by February 25, 2002; however, the case proceeded to trial on March 4, 2002, as scheduled. Gold Hill did not appear at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">\u00b610 The District Court entered judgment in favor of Westmark on March 5, 2002. Gold Hill subsequently filed a motion for a new trial. Gold Hill\u2019s motion asserted that because the parties did not present a final pretrial order by February 25,2002, it believed that the trial date was vacated. Therefore, Gold Hill alleged that it was deprived of its substantive rights by: (1) an irregularity in the proceedings; or (2) an accident or surprise, when the District Court conducted the trial in its absence. Accordingly, Gold Hill maintained that it was entitled to a new trial pursuant to either subsection (1) or (3) of \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqs\">\u00b611 Section 25-11-102, MCA, provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">The former verdict or other decision may be vacated and a new trial granted on the application of the party aggrieved for any of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights of such party:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">(1) irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, or adverse party or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\">(3) accident or surprise which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">\u00b612 When considering Gold Hill\u2019s motion for a new trial, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Court noted that at no point did it ever vacate the March 4, 2002 trial date. Gold Hill apparently recognized that the trial was still scheduled because shortly after the pretrial conference it filed a motion requesting that the District Court continue the trial date. The District Court denied this motion on February 28, 2002. As such, the District Court found that it was unreasonable for Gold Hill to have assumed, in light of the above facts, that the March 4, 2002, trial date was vacated. Therefore, the District Court denied Gold Hill\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b613 It is apparent that the District Court was exasperated with Gold Hill\u2019s conduct in this matter. In fact, in its order denying the motion for a new trial, the District Court concluded that Gold Hill\u2019s strategy was to \u201cmuck up\u201d the water so that Westmark would have difficulty proceeding. Also, the District Court was convinced that Gold Hill\u2019s counsel refused to sign the final pretrial order presented by Westmark\u2019s counsel in order to frustrate the process. Regardless of what the District Court may have stated out of frustration at the pretrial conference, it is obvious that Gold Hill knew it was obligated to file a formal motion seeking a continuance if the trial date was to be vacated. When Gold Hill filed the motion, the District Court denied the request. Therefore, we conclude that it is not plausible that Gold Hill believed that the trial date had been vacated by the parties\u2019 failure to file a final pretrial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u00b614  In light of our above conclusion, we hold that Gold Hill was not deprived of its substantive rights by either: (1) an irregularity in the proceedings; or (2) an accident or surprise, as contemplated in subsections (1) and (3) of \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion when it denied Gold Hill\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u00b615 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b520-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b520-8\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"A9x2\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">\u00b616 I dissent from the majority Opinion. I conclude that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied the Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on an irregularity in the proceedings which prevented a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">\u00b617 The District Court\u2019s February 22, 2002, minute entry which records what was said by the court to the parties on that date clearly states that if the parties cannot agree on a pretrial order by February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>25, 2002, the trial will be vacated. That statement is unequivocal. No pretrial order was agreed upon on February 25, 2002. It is understandable that anyone paying attention to the court on February 22 would have assumed that the trial date was continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">\u00b618 The majority states in \u00b6 12 that Gold Hill must have recognized that the trial had not been continued because it filed a motion requesting an order to that effect from the District Court. However, I find nothing inconsistent about assuming that a trial date has been continued based on representations made verbally by the District Court and asking the District Court to reduce its decision to a written order. In that same paragraph, the majority states that the District Court denied the motion for a continuance on February 28,2002. While it is true that the District Court\u2019s order denying the motion to continue is dated February 28,2002, it was not filed with the clerk of court until Friday, March 1,2002, and was not mailed by the clerk of court to the Defendant\u2019s attorney until March 4, 2002-the date on which the trial proceeded without the Defendant or its attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b619 If the District Court Judge told the Defendant and its attorney on February 22 that the trial date would be continued unless there was a pretrial order signed by both parties, the parties had a right to take the trial judge\u2019s statement at face value. I do not buy the argument that they should have assumed he was just letting off steam or expressing frustration. While greater caution by Defendant\u2019s attorney might have been the more prudent course, when the Defendant did not show up based on the confusion created by the District Court\u2019s representation, the trial should have been continued. When it proceeded without the Defendant, an \u201cirregularity in the proceedings\u201d resulted which denied the Defendant a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u00b620 For these reasons, I dissent from the majority Opinion. I would reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
