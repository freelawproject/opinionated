Muralt\u2019s is insured by the Respondent, Liberty Northwest Insurance. Schmill contended that because \u00a7 39-72-706, MCA, of the Occupational Disease Act required reduction of disability benefits for non-occupational factors, while the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act did not, her right to equal protection was violated. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court held that \u00a7 39-72-706, MCA, violates the equal protection clause of the United States and Montana Constitutions and awarded Schmill full benefits without reduction for non-occupational factors. Liberty Northwest appeals that conclusion. We affirm the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is, whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred when it concluded that \u00a7 39-72-706, MCA, violates the equal protection clause of the United States and Montana Constitutions?</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"As\">\u00b63 In the Spring of 1999 the Respondent, Cassandra Schmill, had been working at Muralt\u2019s Travel Plaza as a waitress for approximately five years when she began experiencing discomfort in her left heel. She was subsequently diagnosed with chronic left Achilles peritendonitis and tendonosis, an occupational disease. Schmill began physical therapy for her condition and filed a temporary total disability claim with Muralt\u2019s insurer, Liberty Northwest Insurance. Liberty Northwest accepted the claim pursuant to Montana\u2019s Occupational Disease Act. Despite physical therapy and treatment for the pain, her condition did not improve and surgery was performed by Dr. Glenn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Jarrett in February of 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\">\u00b64 After Schmill reached maximum medical improvement, she was given a 3% physical impairment rating of the whole body by Dr. Jarrett. Dr. Jarrett indicated that it would be difficult for Schmill to walk continuously and a job that allowed her to rest periodically was more appropriate to her condition. In spite of her limitations, Schmill did not suffer an actual wage loss as the result of her occupational disease. Therefore, Schmill requested an impairment award for the disability caused by her occupational disease pursuant to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. That request was denied by Liberty Northwest. Schmill sought benefits pursuant to the WCA rather than the ODA because the ODA did not provide partial disability or impairment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\u00b65 On March 12, 2001, Schmill filed a petition in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court in which she alleged that she was entitled to the same impairment award that was available pursuant to the WCA. Liberty Northwest filed a motion for summary judgment and argued that Schmill\u2019s impairment was the result of an occupational disease and that, therefore, she was not entitled by statute to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b66 Subsequently, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court issued its decision in <em>Stavenjord v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>2001 MTWCC 25, which required that permanent partial disability benefits be paid to occupational disease claimants pursuant to the WCA. Schmill filed a response to Liberty Northwest\u2019s motion for summary judgment, which cited the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stavenjord </em>in support of her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u00b67 Based on the <em>Stavenjord </em>decision, Liberty Northwest agreed to pay Schmill\u2019s impairment award. However, Liberty Northwest deducted twenty percent from her award for non-occupational factors that contributed to her disability pursuant to \u00a7 39-72-706, MCA. Schmill maintained that she was entitled to a full payment pursuant to the WCA and that the apportionment of benefits pursuant to \u00a7 39-72-706, MCA, violated her right to equal protection of the law. The issue that remained for the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court was whether the apportionment statute of the ODA, found at \u00a7 39-72-706, MCA, violated Schmill\u2019s constitutional right to equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">\u00b68 On June 22, 2001, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court concluded that \u00a7 39-72-706, MCA, violated the Montana and United States Constitutions\u2019 guarantees of equal protection because it provided disparate treatment to injured workers and those with what are now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>defined as occupational diseases. Consequently, it held that Schmill was entitled to the full amount of the impairment award without a reduction for non-occupational factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b69 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision on the merits was based on its construction of constitutional law. Our review of questions of constitutional law is plenary. <em>In re Custody of Krause, </em>2001 MT 37, \u00b6 16, 304 Mont. 202, \u00b6 16, 19 P.3d 811, \u00b6 16. We review conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Henry v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>1999 MT 126, \u00b6 10, 294 Mont. 449, \u00b6 10, 982 P.2d 456, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u00b610 All legislative enactments are presumed to be constitutional. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 11. The party challenging the constitutionality of a statute bears the burden of proving the statute unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">\u00b611 Liberty Northwest contends that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred when it concluded that the ODA\u2019s apportionment statute is unconstitutional because the equal protection clause does not require that diseased and injured workers be treated in the same manner. In the alternative, Liberty Northwest maintains that there is a legitimate government interest for apportioning compensation based on the percentage of a disease that is attributable to non-occupational factors. Finally, Liberty Northwest contends that the WCA reduces compensation in a similar fashion and that, therefore, workers are not treated differently by the ODA and the WCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\u00b612 Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be denied equal protection of the laws.\u201d The equal protection clause requires that \u201call persons be treated alike under like circumstances.\u201d <em>Grooms v. Ponderosa Inn </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 459, 467, 942 P.2d 699, 703. An equal protection claim brought by an injured or diseased worker is reviewed pursuant to the rational basis test. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 33. \u201cThe rational basis test requires the government to show (1) that the statute\u2019s objective was legitimate, and (2) that the statute\u2019s objective bears a rational relationship to the classification used by the legislature/\u2019 <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 33. \u2018\u201cA classification that is patently arbitrary and bears no rational relationship to a legitimate government interest offends equal protection of the law.\u2019\u201d <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 36 (quoting <em>Davis v. Union Pacific R. Co. </em>(1987), 282 Mont 233, 242-43, 937 P.2d 27, 32 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>(citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u00b613 Liberty Northwest argues that the apportionment clause is valid pursuant to this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Eastman v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 332, 777 P.2d 862. In <em>Eastman </em>we considered a <em>pro se </em>appellant\u2019s equal protection challenge of the ODA that was raised for the first time on appeal. We held Eastman was only entitled to $10,000 pursuant to the ODAbecause he suffered from an occupational disease despite the fact the WCA would provide greater compensation. <em>Eastman, </em>237 Mont. at 340, 777 P.2d at 866. We noted that while Eastman was unable to prove an equal protection violation, review of the ODA indicated there were \u201cserious questions which should be addressed by the legislature.\u201d <em>Eastman, </em>237 Mont. at 340, 777 P.2d at 866. In recent years, <em>Eastman </em>has been both criticized and distinguished by this Court <em>in Henry </em>and <em>Stavenjord v. Montana State Fund, </em>2003 MT 67, 314 Mont. 466, 67 P.3d 229. Due to the circumstances of Eastman\u2019s appeal, <em>Eastman </em>would likely be a non-cite Opinion if decided today.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b614 In <em>Henry, </em>this Court considered the disparate treatment of a worker who suffered a disability as the result of an \u201coccupational disease.\u201d Henry was precluded from receiving vocational rehabilitation benefits by the ODA in spite of the fact that the WCA provided vocational rehabilitation benefits to workers with a similar disability. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 24. We noted that when the legislature revised the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201coccupational disease\u201d in 1987, two classes of workers were created which depended solely upon the number of shifts over which an affliction occurred. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15,18. A worker who suffered from a herniated disc that was contracted during one shift was \u201cinjured\u201d and entitled to benefits pursuant to the WCA. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 21. However, a worker who developed the same injury over more than one shift suffered from an \u201coccupational disease\u201d and provided fewer benefits pursuant to the ODA. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 21. We concluded that the two classes of workers were similarly situated for equal protection purposes. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b615 This Court held that there was no rational basis for treating a worker who contracted a herniated disc during one shift differently than a worker who contracted a herniated disc over more than one shift. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-40. Economic justifications were dismissed as an insufficient reason to treat the two classes of workers differently and were not considered a legitimate government interest. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 40. We distinguished <em>Eastman </em>from <em>Henry </em>and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">Second, Eastman filed his claim for compensation benefits in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>1985, prior to the 1987 amendments to the WCA and the ODA. As pointed out earlier, after the 1987 amendments to the WCA and ODA, the definitions of \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201coccupational disease\u201d no longer focus on the nature of the medical condition, but rather focus on the number of work shifts over which the worker incurs an injury. Thus, the historical justification for treating workers differently under the WCA and the ODA no longer exists. Indeed, the entire underpinnings of <em>Eastman </em>have evaporated, rendering its continued validity questionable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u00b616 In <em>Stavenjord v. Montana State Fund, </em>2003 MT 67, 314 Mont. 466, 67 P.3d 229, we recently affirmed the reasoning the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court relied upon when it determined the ODA\u2019s apportionment clause violated Schmill\u2019s right to equal protection. <em>Stavenjord </em>followed the reasoning set forth in <em>Henry </em>and further questioned the validity of <em>Eastman. </em>We recognized that <em>Eastman </em>held that a difference in the degree of benefits available to the two classes of workers did not violate equal protection, while <em>Henry </em>held that denying one class of worker a specific type of benefit violated equal protection. <em>Stavenjord, </em>\u00b6 42. However, that distinction was dismissed in light of the 1987 amendments to the ODA and WCA. <em>Stavenjord, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u00b617 Consistent with <em>Henry, </em>we concluded that the two classes of workers created by the ODA and the WCA were distinguished only by the time over which ah affliction was contracted, and that the two classes of workers were similarly situated for equal protection purposes. <em>Stavenjord, </em>\u00b6 46. We noted that the government\u2019s objective pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-105, MCA, was to provide a wage loss benefit that was reasonably related to the actual wages lost as the result of a work-related injury or disease and, therefore, concluded that the disparate treatment of workers based upon the time over which their injury or disease was contracted was not reasonably related to the stated governmental interest. <em>Stavenjord, </em>\u00b6 47 (citing \u00a7 39-71-105(1), MCA (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u00b618 For these same reasons, Liberty Northwest\u2019s continued reliance on <em>Eastman </em>is not well founded. We continue to recognize that the ODA and WCA create two classes of workers: (1) a class of workers who suffer a work-related affliction during one shift; and (2) a class of workers who contract a work-related affliction over more than one shift. <em>See Stavenjord, </em>\u00b6 46; <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 27. We conclude that a worker who seeks an impairment award for a physical impairment caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>an \u201coccupational disease\u201d is similarly situated to a worker who seeks an impairment award for a work-related \u201cinjury.\u201d The time over which the injury occurred remains the only distinction between the two. Regardless of the time frame over which their affliction was contracted or the name assigned to the affliction, both workers are physically impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b619 Liberty Northwest cites \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA, to support its contention that the WCA apportions non-occupational disability factors in a manner similar to the ODA and that, therefore, the similarly situated classes of injured workers are not treated differently. However, it does not provide any specific reference to the apportionment language relied upon. Nor is it clear how \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA, of the WCA and \u00a7 39-72-706, MCA, of the ODA apportion nonoccupational factors from a worker\u2019s impairment award in a similar manner. A plain reading of \u00a7 39-71-703(7), MCA, indicates that the provision prevents an injured worker from receiving duplicate coverage. A reduction only occurs, however, when there is a previous injury or disability rating for which the worker already received compensation. Nothing cited by Liberty Northwest suggests that the WCA apportions non-occupational factors in its impairment award calculation. Section 39-72-706, MCA, does require that compensation be reduced by the percentage that an injury is attributable to nonoccupational factors. We conclude that the WCA does not apportion a worker\u2019s impairment award in the same manner as \u00a7 39-72-706, MCA, of the ODA.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\u00b620 Consequently, we must determine whether the disparate treatment of workers by the ODA apportionment statute is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Liberty Northwest concedes that the public policy pronouncement in \u00a7 39-71-105, MCA, constitutes the government objective for the WCA and the ODA. Section 39-71-105, MCA, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">It is an objective of the Montana workers\u2019 compensation system to provide, without regard to fault, wage supplement and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease. Wage-loss benefits are not intended to make an injured worker whole; they are intended to assist a worker at a reasonable cost to the employer. Within that limitation, the wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost as a result of a work-related injury or disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\u00b621 Liberty Northwest maintains that public policy dictates that compensation is only available for a work-related injury or disease. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Therefore, the apportionment statute in the ODA is consistent with public policy because it apportions an impairment award for nonoccupational factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b622 Liberty Northwest has missed the point. The WCA does not take non-occupational factors into consideration while the ODA does. The fact that the workers\u2019 compensation system seeks to provide benefits for work-related afflictions does not justify treating the two classes of workers identified above differently. The issue before this Court is whether the disparate treatment of workers by the ODA violates Schmill\u2019s right to equal protection. We conclude that it does. Liberty Northwest has not demonstrated how treating the two similarly situated classes of workers differently furthers the stated objective of limiting benefits to job related disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b623  We conclude that the ODA and the WCA treat similarly situated classes of workers differently. Furthermore, apportioning Schmill\u2019s permanent impairment award for her occupational disease pursuant to \u00a7 39-72-706, MCA, of the ODA while providing full benefits for injured workers pursuant to the WCA is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. Therefore, we conclude that \u00a7 39-72-706, MCA, violates the equal protection guarantee found at Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution. The judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b82-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b82-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY</author>\n<p id=\"ALc\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\u00b624 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion for the reasons set forth in the dissent in <em>Stavenjord v.

Applying that rationale to the present case, I would reverse the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 39-72-706, MCA, violates the equal protection clauses of the United States and Montana Constitutions.
