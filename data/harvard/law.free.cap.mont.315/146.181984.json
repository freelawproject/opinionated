Following a jury trial, Jefferson was convicted of that charge. He appeals the District Court order that denied his motion to dismiss and appeals his conviction. We vacate Jefferson\u2019s conviction and remand this case to the District Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\u00b62 Jefferson raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it denied Jefferson\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">\u00b64 2. Did Jefferson\u2019s attorney provide ineffective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err when it permitted the State to amend the Information on the day of his trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court err when it denied Jefferson\u2019s motion for a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AgE\">\u00b67 On May 18, 1998, the Defendant, Leonard Jefferson, was living with his ex-wife, Felicia Jefferson, and their nine-year-old son. At approximately 2:30 a.m., Jefferson returned to their home intoxicated, and began to argue with Felicia in their bedroom. The argument escalated and Jefferson retrieved his SKS assault rifle from outside of the bedroom. The State contends that Jefferson loaded one round into the chamber of the rifle and placed it beside the bed as the argument continued. Jefferson maintains that he did not load the rifle at that time. He pushed Felicia down on the bed and physically assaulted her with his fist, causing facial cuts.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">\u00b68 J efferson then placed the barrel of the rifle against Felicia\u2019s head and threatened to kill her. He left the bedroom and returned with their nine-year-old son. The State alleges that he also made threats against Felicia and their son at that time. Jefferson\u2019s mood changed and he became apologetic. He ceased the attack and placed the barrel of the rifle against his own head and asked Felicia to kill him. Jefferson claims that he loaded one bullet in the chamber just before placing the rifle against his head. At this point Felicia fled from the room with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>rifle and her son and went next door to her mother\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b69 Later that morning, Felicia went to the hospital where she received stitches for her lacerations. However, she did not report the incident to the police until May 21, 1998, because she was afraid Jefferson would kill her if she did so. Jefferson had approximately seven months of probation to serve for a prior federal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u00b610 On May 26, 1998, Jefferson was charged by Information with attempted deliberate homicide and entered a not guilty plea at his arraignment. The District Court set his bond at $150,000. The United States filed a petition to revoke Jefferson\u2019s probation for violating the terms of his probation. Release on bond was not provided for in that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u00b611 Trial was scheduled for September 28, 1998. Although neither party filed for a continuance, and Jefferson did not waive his right to a speedy trial, a trial was not held on that date. The delay occurred because the State\u2019s evidence against Jefferson had not been returned from the Montana Crime Lab. On December 15, 1998, 203 days after charges were filed, Jefferson filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him for lack of a speedy trial. Jefferson alleged that he had been prejudiced, his relations with his new wife had been impaired, and he lost his job as a result of the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\u00b612 The District Court rescheduled his trial for February 8,1999. On that day, Jefferson entered a plea agreement in which he agreed to plead guilty to one count of felony assault in exchange for the State\u2019s promise to request a 20 year sentence, to request that the United States withdraw its petition to revoke Jefferson\u2019s probation, and not to request persistent felony status in the District Court. The State amended the Information from attempted deliberate homicide to felony assault pursuant to the agreement. However, at Jefferson\u2019s request, the District Court granted a continuance pending resolution of his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\u00b613 On February 23,1999, Jefferson informed Judge Russell Fagg, by letter, that he had entered the plea agreement based upon inadequate advice from his counsel. Consequently, he wished to withdraw his guilty plea and exercise his constitutional right to a trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">\u00b614 OnApril30,1999, the District Court concluded that Jefferson had not been prejudiced by the delay of his trial and denied his motion to dismiss. On July 1, 1999, the State requested leave to amend the Information to the original charge of attempted deliberate homicide and requested a trial date. A trial by jury was scheduled for July 12, 1999. On the morning of trial, the State amended the Information to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>the original charge of attempted deliberate homicide. Following a two-day trial, a jury found Jefferson guilty of that charge. Jefferson\u2019s defense counsel was permitted to withdraw as counsel of record two weeks later. Following a psychological evaluation conducted by Dr. William Bredehoft, Jefferson\u2019s post-trial attorney moved for a new trial on March 6,2000. He alleged that Jefferson was entitled to a new trial because the psychological evaluation indicated that he suffered from a mental disease or defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b615 Due to a conflict of interest, Judge Blair Jones substituted for Judge Fagg in the proceeding. Judge Jones denied Jefferson\u2019s motion for a new trial and later sentenced him to be committed to the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services for a period of sixty years. Jefferson contends that the District Court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial, permitted the State to amend the Information on the day of trial, and refused his motion for a new trial. Jefferson further maintains that he was denied his right to a fair trial because his trial attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AMm\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b616 Did the District Court err when it denied Jefferson\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b617 Jefferson contends that he was entitled to have the charges against him dismissed because of the State\u2019s delay in bringing him to trial. The State responds that, while it is responsible for the delay, his incarceration was inevitable and Jefferson was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">\u00b618 Whether a defendant has been denied the right to a speedy trial is a question of constitutional law. <em>City of Billings v. Bruce, </em>1998 MT 186, \u00b6 18, 290 Mont. 148, \u00b6 18, 965 P.2d 866, \u00b6 18. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether its interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">\u00b619 A criminal defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and by Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. We review speedy trial claims on a case-by-case basis pursuant to the four factors set forth in <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 19. The four factors are: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the defendant\u2019s assertion of the right to a speedy trial; and (4) the prejudice the delay caused to the defense. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530, 92 S.Ct. at 2192; <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>\u00b620  Our analysis of whether the defendant has been prejudiced considers the harm the right to a speedy trial was intended to prevent. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S.Ct. at 2193; <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 68. The right to a speedy trial was intended to: (1) prevent pretrial incarceration; (2) minimize anxiety and concern of the defendant; and (3) prevent impairment of the defense. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S.Ct. at 2193; <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">1. Length of Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b621  First, we must consider the length of the delay. A delay of 200 days or more triggers speedy trial analysis. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 55. The total delay between Jefferson\u2019s arraignment and trial was 413 days. Jefferson\u2019s motion to dismiss was filed 203 days after he was charged. The delay in this case is sufficient to trigger further analysis of whether Jefferson was denied his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">2. Reason for Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b622  Second, we consider the reason for the delay. When the delay attributable to the prosecution exceeds 275 days, the burden of proving that the defendant was not prejudiced shifts to the prosecution. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 56. The State concedes that it is responsible for more than 275 days of the delay. Therefore, we conclude that the State bears the burden of proving that Jefferson was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">3. Assertion of Right</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">\u00b623  Third, we consider whether Jefferson asserted the right to a speedy trial in a timely fashion. A defendant asserts the right to a speedy trial in a timely manner when a motion to dismiss is filed prior to the commencement of the trial. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 57. Jefferson filed his motion to dismiss for denial of a speedy trial 203 days after charges were filed and well before a trial was conducted. Consequently, we conclude that Jefferson asserted his right to a speedy trial in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">4. Prejudice to the Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">\u00b624 Our forth consideration is whether Jefferson was prejudiced by the delay in this case. The importance of this factor, and the degree of prejudice required to establish that a defendant was denied his right to a speedy trial, is determined on a case-by-case basis in which we consider the length of the delay and the reason for the delay. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 58. This inquiry requires that we consider: (1) pretrial incarceration; (2) anxiety and concern of the defendant; and (3) impairment of the defense. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 58, 68. The State should offer proof on the three factors to the extent possible, but at a minimum, it must address whether the defense has been impaired. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 56. The fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>pretrial incarceration can hinder a defendant\u2019s ability to prepare his defense makes impairment of the defense the most serious consideration in our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">A. Pretrial Incarceration</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b625 Jefferson\u2019s pretrial incarceration lasted for 413 days; from the day of his arraignment on May 26, 1998, to the day of his conviction on July 14, 1999. The District Court concluded that the pretrial incarceration attributable to the State was mitigated by the fact that the United States filed a petition to revoke Jefferson\u2019s probation and, consequently, Jefferson would have been incarcerated for that time period regardless of the State\u2019s delay. It concluded any harm caused by the lengthy pretrial incarceration was inevitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b626 On appeal, Jefferson asserts that only seven months remained on his federal probation. Therefore, only seven months of his pretrial incarceration can be mitigated by the United States\u2019 petition to revoke his probation. The State counters that Jefferson would have been re-sentenced to prison for violating his probation pursuant to statute. Additionally, it maintains that the delay was primarily institutional and not oppressive in nature and, therefore, not the type of incarceration the speedy trial guarantee is concerned with.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u00b627  We recognize that the right to a speedy trial is not intended to prevent all pretrial incarceration. It is designed to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration. <em>State v. Longhorn, 2002 </em>MT 135, \u00b6 36, 310 Mont. 172, \u00b6 36, 49 P.3d 48, \u00b6 36. Our inquiry focuses on whether Jefferson was <em>\u201cunduly prejudiced </em>by his pretrial incarceration.\u201d <em>Longhorn, </em>\u00b6 36 (quoting <em>State v. Johnson, 2000 </em>MT 180, \u00b6 26, 300 Mont. 367, \u00b6 26, 4 P.3d 654, \u00b6 26).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">\u00b628 There is no dispute that the United States filed a petition to revoke Jefferson\u2019s probation and that no bond was provided for. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(b), Jefferson\u2019s possession of a firearm mandated the revocation of his probation and further required that Jefferson be re-sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Jefferson testified at trial that his probation officer warned him that he would be sentenced to five or ten years in prison if he possessed a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"ACf\">\u00b629 The original trial date was scheduled for September 28, 1998. That date passed because the Crime Lab failed to return the State\u2019s evidence in a timely fashion. Jefferson entered a plea agreement on February 8, 1999, the rescheduled trial date. However, rather than enter the Alford plea, Jefferson requested a continuance until the District Court ruled on his speedy trial motion. Therefore, the District Court continued the matter until March 15,1999. Soon after the plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>was agreed to, on February 23,1999, Jefferson withdrew from the plea agreement and requested a jury trial. The court could not reschedule Jefferson\u2019s trial until after it ruled on his motion to dismiss on April 30, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b630  While only seven months remained in Jefferson\u2019s probation, federal law and the testimony at trial indicate Jefferson would have inevitably been incarcerated for a longer period of time. Furthermore, the record indicates that the initial delay was not intentional and aspects of the subsequent delay were attributable to Jefferson\u2019s own actions. We conclude that Jefferson\u2019s incarceration was inevitable due to the petition to revoke probation and that the pretrial incarceration in this case was not oppressive and not unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">B. Anxiety and Concern</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b631 Jefferson maintains that his pretrial delay caused significant depression and anxiety. The District Court concluded that the presence of anxiety and concern caused by the pretrial delay weighed slightly in favor of Jefferson. Regardless, it concluded that when the other considerations were balanced, the anxiety and concern caused by the delay was insufficient to outweigh the other factors. The State contends that the pending probation revocation was equally responsible for any anxiety and concern that troubled Jefferson during his pretrial incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u00b632 Anxiety and concern are an inherent part of being charged with a crime. Our inquiry considers the extent to which a defendant\u2019s anxiety and concern is aggravated by the delay. <em>Longhorn, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">\u00b633  The record indicates that Jefferson was unable to attend to his ill mother, lost his job, and suffered strains on his personal relationships as a result of his pretrial incarceration. However, we noted above that Jefferson\u2019s incarceration was inevitable and he was aware he would be re-sentenced by the United States for violating his probation. Consequently, the hardships experienced by Jefferson were also inevitable and only aggravated in part by the State\u2019s delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\u00b634 Therefore, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the anxiety and concern attributable to the delay in Jefferson\u2019s trial was slight and is not significant to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">C. Impairment of the Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">\u00b635 Jefferson contends that his decision to withdraw from the plea agreement for felony assault and go to trial on the attempted homicide charges was irrational and was attributable to the length of his pretrial incarceration. He maintains that this irrational behavior is evidence that he was not thinking clearly and, therefore, his defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>was impaired. The District Court concluded that the availability of witnesses and existence of written testimony indicated that it was improbable that Jefferson\u2019s defense was impaired as a result of the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b636 The inquiry into whether the defense has been impaired concerns itself with issues of evidence, witness reliability, and the defendant\u2019s ability to prepare a defense. We recognize that pretrial incarceration impedes the defendant\u2019s ability to gather evidence and prepare a defense. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 534, 92 S.Ct. at 2193. Moreover, time may erode the accuracy of witness testimony and exculpatory evidence. Consequently, this factor often carries more weight than the other bas\u00e9s for concluding a defendant has been prejudiced by a pretrial delay. <em>Longhorn, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b637 The facts indicate that the District Court appointed counsel and an investigator on Jefferson\u2019s behalf soon after he was charged. The record further indicates that both of the witnesses to the crime were able to testify at trial and that written testimony had been taken to preserve witness accounts of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b638  We conclude that the District Court was correct when it held that the State satisfied its burden of proving that Jefferson\u2019s defense was not impaired by the pretrial delay and his pretrial incarceration. In light of the foregoing considerations, we conclude that Jefferson was not prejudiced by the pretrial delay and incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">5. Balancing the Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">\u00b639  No single factor in the speedy trial analysis is determinative and each factor must be weighed in light of the facts presented. <em>Longhorn, </em>\u00b6 44. We conclude that: (1) the length of delay triggered speedy trial analysis; (2) the State bore the burden of proving a lack of prejudice; (3) Jefferson asserted the right to a speedy trial in a timely manner; and (4) the State proved that Jefferson was not prejudiced by the delay. When the speedy trial factors are balanced in this case, we further conclude that Jefferson was not denied his right to a speedy trial. Consequently, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Jefferson\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">ISSUE II</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">\u00b640 Did Jefferson\u2019s attorney provide ineffective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"Am0\">\u00b641 Jefferson alleges that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney stated that Jefferson was guilty of felony assault in his opening and closing statements. Jefferson further argues that his attorney\u2019s failure to conduct a psychological evaluation prior to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>trial, in light of his history of mental disease, constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b642 Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions of law and fact. Therefore, this Court uses <em>de novo </em>review. <em>State v. Turner, </em>2000 MT 270, \u00b6 47, 302 Mont. 69, \u00b6 47, 12 P.3d 934, \u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b643 The right to effective counsel is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. A criminal defendant who brings an ineffective assistance of counsel claim bears the burden of proving that: 1) his counsel\u2019s representation fell below of the objective standard of reasonableness; and 2) his counsel\u2019s failure was prejudicial. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Rose, </em>1998 MT 342, \u00b6 12, 292 Mont. 350, \u00b6 12, 972 P.2d 321, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">A. Reasonable Range of Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u00b644 The first factor we consider is whether Price\u2019s counsel\u2019s conduct falls below the objectively reasonable representation demanded by the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">\u00b645 In his opening statement, Jefferson\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">[A]t the end of this case the evidence will show - because Mr. Jefferson will tell you - that he is guilty, no doubt, of a partner/family member assault and perhaps felony assault, but I submit to you ... that beyond a reasonable doubt you will not find Leonard Jefferson Guilty of attempted deliberate homicide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">\u00b646 Jefferson\u2019s counsel made the following statement in his closing argument: \u201cThere is no doubt that [Jefferson] assaulted Felicia. He admitted it. There is no doubt that he pointed a gun. That in and of itself is felony assault.\u201d Jefferson maintains that these admissions are indefensible in light of the fact that he could have entered a plea agreement for felony assault and not faced the risk of being convicted for the more serious attempted deliberate homicide charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">\u00b647 The State counters that the record is silent as to why Jefferson\u2019s counsel admitted guilt and cannot rebut the presumption of adequate assistance. Therefore, Jefferson\u2019s reliance upon the result as evidence of incompetence is insufficient to prove that he received inadequate assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">\u00b648 There is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional conduct. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688-89, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65. \u201c[T]he defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065 <em>(quoting Michel v. Louisiana </em>(1955), 350 U.S. 91, 101). The acts or omissions that a defendant alleges were not the product of professional judgment are reviewed by this Court to determine whether \u201cthe identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. Counsels conduct must be reviewed in consideration of all of the circumstances of the case. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b649 When an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is based on facts of record, it is properly raised on direct appeal. <em>State v. Fields, </em>2002 MT 84, \u00b6 31, 309 Mont. 300, \u00b6 31, 46 P.3d 612, \u00b6 31. Normally, the record on appeal must adequately document why counsel acted in a particular manner in order for this Court to determine whether counsel\u2019s action falls below the reasonable standard for professional conduct. <em>State v. Harris, </em>2001 MT 231, \u00b6 21, 306 Mont. 525, \u00b6 21, 36 P.3d 372, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b650  The record on appeal does not contain any direct evidence of why Jefferson\u2019s counsel made the challenged statements. However, there is no plausible justification for counsel\u2019s conduct under these circumstances. Jefferson\u2019s letter to Judge Fagg on February 23,1999, by which he withdrew from his agreement to plead guilty to felony assault, indicates that Jefferson wanted the opportunity to be acquitted, or to be convicted of a less serious offense than felony assault. However, at trial, counsel admitted guilt to felony assault during the opening and closing statements, and undermined the very purpose for which Jefferson withdrew from the plea agreement. His remarks had the effect of entering a plea for Jefferson without his consent and by which the jury was not bound. Counsel\u2019s statements directly contravene the reason Jefferson accepted the risk involved in facing the more serious charge of attempted deliberate homicide in a jury trial. Counsel\u2019s admission cannot be considered a trial strategy or tactical decision under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b651 We conclude that counsel\u2019s conduct falls below the reasonable range of professional conduct required and that the first element of the <em>Strickland </em>test has been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">B. Prejudice to Jefferson</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u00b652 Next, we must determine whether Jefferson was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s conduct. Jefferson contends that he was prejudiced because he was ultimately convicted of attempted deliberate homicide when he could have pled guilty to a lesser offense and received a shorter sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>\u00b653 The second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test requires that Jefferson demonstrate the existence of a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional conduct, the result of the proceedings would have been different. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. The prejudice inquiry focuses on whether counsel\u2019s deficient performance renders the trial result unreliable or the proceeding fundamentally unfair. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 696, 104 S.Ct. at 2069. The ultimate inquiry is concerned with the fundamental fairness of the proceeding. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 696, 104 S.Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b654 We note that Sixth Amendment criminal proceedings begin with a formal charge, a prehminary hearing, the filing of an information, an indictment, or an arraignment. <em>State v. Schoffner </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 260, 265, 811 P.2d 548, 552; <em>see also Rosebud County v. Finn </em>(1940), 109 Mont. 537, 98 P.2d 330. To determine whether Jefferson was prejudiced, we must consider the circumstances of the entire proceeding: Jefferson\u2019s withdrawal from the plea agreement for felony assault; counsel\u2019s admission of guilt in spite of that withdrawal; the evidence at trial; and his final conviction for attempted deliberate homicide. The circumstances in this case present a unique issue. Rather than contemplating the final result absent counsel\u2019s conduct, the facts of this case require that we consider how the result of this case affected Jefferson\u2019s right to deny guilt to any offense and to have the benefit of the bargain in the event he admitted guilt to a lesser offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b655 In this case, Jefferson withdrew a plea to felony assault for the opportunity to prove he was not guilty, or was guilty of a less serious offense. He had the right to do so. However, his counsel precluded him from making a case for a lesser offense when he initiated the trial with an admission of guilt to felony assault. Consequently, he was denied both his right to deny guilt and the benefit of his previous agreement to admit guilt. He was left with the worst of both options.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u00b656  There would have been no reason for Jefferson to withdraw from the plea agreement for felony assault if he had been aware that his counsel would concede his guilt to that charge at trial. Instead, he was convicted of the more serious charge of attempted deliberate homicide. The fact that the evidence at trial may have supported a conviction regardless of the statement is irrelevant. Jefferson would not have gone to trial at all if he had been aware that his counsel would admit he was guilty of felony assault and highlight evidence of that offense at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u00b657  We conclude that Jefferson was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>conduct and that his counsel\u2019s conduct rendered the criminal proceeding in Jefferson\u2019s case fundamentally unfair. We conclude that Jefferson has satisfied the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. Consequently, we conclude that Jefferson is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"ApE\">\u00b658 Our resolution of the second issue in this case is dispositive. Therefore, it is unnecessary to reach the third and fourth issues on appeal. Jefferson\u2019s conviction in the District Court is vacated and we remand this case to the District Court for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b183-4\">JUSTICES REGNIER, COTTER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b183-5\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"Aq-\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u00b659 I concur with the Court on Issue 1 that the District Court correctly denied Jefferson\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision on Issue 2, and conclude that Jefferson was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s conduct nor were the criminal proceedings in this matter fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\u00b660 I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that Jefferson satisfied the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, namely, that Jefferson satisfied his burden of showing that his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness by twice admitting to the jury that Jefferson\u2019s conduct constituted felony assault. While this Court has repeatedly held that the trial record must adequately document a challenged act or omission and that the record available to this Court on appeal must afford sufficient understanding of the reasons for counsel\u2019s act or omission to answer the threshold question of whether the alleged error expresses a trial strategy or tactical decision, <em>see State v. Harris, </em>2001 MT 231, \u00b6 21, 306 Mont. 525, \u00b6 21, 36 P.3d 372, \u00b6 21, I am in agreement with the Court that it is immaterial in this particular case what defense counsel\u2019s rationale may have been in admitting Jefferson\u2019s guilt to the offense of felony assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\u00b661 Defense counsel\u2019s admission of Jefferson\u2019s guilt of the offense in the rejected plea agreement left Jefferson in a position that could not possibly be any better than if Jefferson had followed through on the agreement and entered his Alford plea to the charge of felony assault. In other words, defense counsel\u2019s admission nullified the purpose for which Jefferson rejected the plea agreement and requested a jury trial: risking conviction of a greater offense but potentially obtaining an acquittal or conviction of an offense less than felony assault. Under these facts, defense counsel\u2019s admission of guilt cannot be considered sound trial strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">\u00b662 I conclude, however, that Jefferson failed to satisfy the second</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, and thus, failed to demonstrate that he suffered prejudice from defense counsel\u2019s actions. The second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test examines the prejudicial impact of counsel\u2019s errors, and required Jefferson to demonstrate the existence of a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different absent defense counsel\u2019s error in admitting Jefferson\u2019s guilt to the charge of felony assault. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 697-98; <em>Strickler v. Greene </em>(1999), 527 U.S. 263, 290-91, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 1952, 144 L.Ed.2d 286, 307. As clearly stated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland, </em>an error by counsel, \u201ceven if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b663 I understand the Court\u2019s concern regarding defense counsel\u2019s admission to the jury of Jefferson\u2019s guilt to a lesser offense than that charged in the Information, as I share the same concern and agree that such admission falls below an objective standard of reasonableness. However, rather than engaging in an analysis of the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, the Court bypasses the second prong and states in \u00b6 54 that, \u201c[rjather than contemplating the final result absent counsel\u2019s conduct, the facts of this case require that we consider how the result of this case affected Jefferson\u2019s right to deny guilt to any offense and to have the benefit of the bargain in the event he admitted guilt to a lesser offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b664 <em>Strickland </em>requires that a reviewing court also contemplate the final result to determine whether the defendant suffered prejudice, and the Court here is erroneously bypassing this requirement. In the instant case, Jefferson was ultimately convicted of a greater charge than that offered in the rejected plea agreement and a greater charge than the one admitted to by defense counsel. In light of Jefferson\u2019s conviction of attempted deliberate homicide, Jefferson clearly did not \u201csuffer the results of his counsel\u2019s trial admission\u201d that his conduct amounted to felony assault, and Jefferson failed to demonstrate that there existed a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different absent defense counsel\u2019s professionally unreasonable error. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2088, 80 L.Ed.2d at 697-98; <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 291, 119 S.Ct. at 1953, 144 L.Ed.2d at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b665 While the Court concludes that defense counsel\u2019s admission of Jefferson\u2019s guilt to felony assault rendered the proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>fundamentally unfair, thus precluding the need to contemplate the final result in light of defense counsel\u2019s conduct, such conclusion amounts to a finding of \u201cper se\u201d prejudice in this circumstance. Such conclusion is unwarranted and inconsistent with United States Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b666 Initially, I note that it is elementary that no matter how uncontroverted the State\u2019s evidence, the Montana and the United States Constitutions guarantee a defendant the right to have his guilt determined by a jury of his peers. <em>See </em>Article II, Sections 24 and 26, Montana Constitution; <em>State v. DeVore, </em>1998 MT 340, \u00b6 39, 292 Mont. 325, \u00b6 39, 972 P.2d 816, \u00b6 39 (overruled on other grounds); <em>see also United States v. Mentz </em>(6th Cir. 1988), 840 F.2d 315, 319 (\u201c[t]he Sixth Amendment to the Constitution guarantees to a defendant the opportunity for a jury to decide guilt or innocence\u201d) (citing <em>Duncan v. Louisiana </em>(1968), 391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491). The decision to plead guilty or not guilty is reserved solely for the accused based on his or her intelligent and voluntary choice and waiver of numerous constitutional protections. <em>See State v. Boucher, </em>2002 MT 114, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 309 Mont. 514, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 48 P.3d 21, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23; <em>see also Wiley v. Sowders </em>(6th Cir. 1981), 647 F.2d 642, 649-50 (\u201cIn those rare cases where counsel advises his client that the latter\u2019s guilt should be admitted, the client\u2019s knowing consent to such trial strategy must appear outside the presence of the jury on the trial record ....\u201d) (citing <em>Boykin v. Alabama </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274). \u201cSimilarly, an attorney may not admit his client\u2019s guilt which is contrary to his client\u2019s earlier entered plea of \u2018not guilty\u2019 unless the defendant unequivocally understands the consequences of the admission.\u201d <em>Wiley, </em>647 F.2d at 649 (citing <em>Brookhart v. Janis </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 1, 8, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 1249, 16 L.Ed.2d 314).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b667 In <em>Wiley, </em>defense counsel, in closing argument, repeatedly and unequivocally admitted the guilt of both defendants to the offenses charged. Such admission runs counter to the constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel because the right to effective assistance \u201cenvisions counsel\u2019s playing a role that is critical to the ability of the adversarial system to produce just results.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 685, 104 S.Ct. at 2063, 80 L.Ed.2d at 692 (citations omitted). Defense counsel\u2019s admission of guilt denied the defendant the right to have guilt or innocence decided by a jury. Further, as stated in <em>Wiley, </em>\u201c[petitioner, in pleading not guilty, was entitled to have the issue of his guilt or innocence presented to the jury as an adversarial issue. Counsel\u2019s complete concession of petitioner\u2019s guilt nullified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>adversarial quality of this fundamental issue.\u201d <em>Wiley, </em>647 F.2d at 650.</p>\n<p id=\"ArF\">\u00b6 68 The United States Supreme Court, in both <em>Strickland </em>and <em>United States v. Cronic </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657, identified specific factual situations involving easily identifiable impairment of Sixth Amendment rights where prejudice is presinned because prejudice in such a situation is so likely that case-by-case inquiry into prejudice is not worth the cost. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 692, 104 S.Ct. at 2067, 80 L.Ed.2d at 696 (\u201cprejudice is presumed when counsel is burdened by an actual conflict of interest\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>see also Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 656-57, 104 S.Ct. at 2045-46, 80 L.Ed.2d at 666-67 (\u201cWhen a true adversarial criminal trial has been conducted-even if defense counsel may have made demonstrable errors-the kind of testing envisioned by the Sixth Amendment has occurred. But if the process loses its character as a confrontation between adversaries, the constitutional guarantee is violated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b669 Relying on <em>Cronic </em>and <em>Strickland, </em>the Illinois Supreme Court in <em>People v. Hattery </em>(Ill. 1985), 488 N.E.2d 513, held that a concession of a defendant\u2019s guilt by defense counsel, thereby failing to subject the prosecution to the meaningful adversarial testing required by the Sixth Amendment, constitutes <em>per se </em>ineffective assistance of counsel abdicating the need to apply the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Hattery, </em>488 N.E.2d at 518-19. The Court subsequently narrowly construed the <em>Hattery </em>holding in <em>People v. Johnson </em>(Ill. 1989), 538 N.E.2d 1118, to be more consistent with the language set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Cronic, </em>to situations where defense counsel entirely failed to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing, rather than simply to situations where defense counsel concedes to the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Johnson, </em>538 N.E.2d at 1125; <em>see Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 656-57, 104 S.Ct. at 2045-46, 80 L.Ed.2d at 666-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b670 The present case is unlike <em>Wiley </em>or <em>Hattery </em>in that defense counsel for Jefferson did not admit Jefferson\u2019s guilt to the offense charged in the Information, but admitted guilt to a lesser offense. Such admission to a lesser offense may not normally be of constitutional import, as defense counsel must often work with facts to which there is no bona fide defense, and neither the Sixth Amendment nor Article II, Section 24, require that counsel do what is impossible or unethical. Such admission, therefore, maybe an objectively reasonable tactical decision where defense counsel is presented with a factual situation which affords limited possible bona fide strategies, and where the best strategy may be to argue that the defendant is guilty of a lesser offense than that charged in the Information. Ostensibly, defense counsel may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>do his or her client a disservice in such a situation by attempting to create a defense that does not exist. \u201cAt the same time [however], even when no theory of defense is available, if the decision to stand trial has been made, counsel must hold the prosecution to its heavy burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt. And, of course, even when there is a bona fide defense, counsel may still advise his client to plead guilty if that advice falls within the range of reasonable competence under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at n. 19, 104 S.Ct. at n. 19, 80 L.Ed.2d at n. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b671 Upon review of the trial transcript, it is clear that the State\u2019s witnesses as well as Jefferson\u2019s own testimony was very damaging to Jefferson\u2019s case, and that defense counsel\u2019s admission of guilt to the offense of felony assault was likely a tactical decision based upon the small amount of disputed testimony in Jefferson\u2019s favor. Such assumption is especially likely considering defense counsel\u2019s use of Jefferson\u2019s candor to argue a strong case for Jefferson\u2019s honesty in all of his testimony. The transcript reveals that the State presented strong evidence at trial that Jefferson hit Felicia and pointed his assault rifle at her while threatening to kill her. Jefferson himself not only did not deny doing these things, but admitted to the acts when he chose to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b672 Aside from admitting Jefferson\u2019s guilt to the lesser offense of felony assault, Jefferson\u2019s counsel also pursued an adversarial posture in an attempt to achieve just results, as guaranteed by Article II, Section 24, and the Sixth Amendment, when he attempted to refute the evidence that the gun was loaded by cross-examination of State witnesses and on direct with Jefferson\u2019s testimony. Ostensibly, therefore, Jefferson\u2019s counsel did not entirely fail to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing, and there is, therefore, no \u201cper se\u201d ineffective assistance based upon defense counsel\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b673 The record reveals that it was Jefferson\u2019s own decision to reject the plea agreement and forgo entering an Alford plea to the offense of felony assault in an attempt to receive an acquittal or conviction of a lesser offense while exposing himself to the greater risk of conviction of attempted deliberate homicide. He does not dispute this intention on appeal. Had Jefferson been convicted of the offense admitted to by defense counsel, Jefferson would be arguing from a different vantage point. However, I find it significant that the jury convicted Jefferson of an offense greater than the felony assault admitted by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u00b674 In \u00b6 56, the Court states that there \u201cwould have been no reason for Jefferson to withdraw from the plea agreement for felony assault if he had been aware that his counsel would concede his guilt to that charge at trial.\u201d This statement is more qualitative than objective. A truer statement would be that there would have been no \u201cgood\u201d reason for Jefferson to withdraw from the plea agreement if he had been aware that his counsel would concede his guilt to felony assault at trial. The record does not reveal whether Jefferson was aware or unaware of defense counsel\u2019s specific strategy to utilize Jefferson\u2019s honesty, in admitting to the actions constituting the felony assault, to argue that Jefferson was also testifying honestly that the gun was unloaded when he pointed it at Felicia.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b675 Regardless, whether Jefferson knew of defense counsel\u2019s specific strategy and whether he had a good reason for agreeing to such strategy, is immaterial. Jefferson failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the result of the trial would have been different but for defense counsel\u2019s error. While the Court further states in \u00b6 56 that \u201cJefferson would not have gone to trial at all if he had been aware that his counsel would admit he was guilty of felony assault and highlight evidence of that offense at trial,\u201d such conclusion is something that we simply cannot know from the record before this Court. Concluding that Jefferson suffered prejudice as a result of defense counsel\u2019s actions amounts to an unwarranted finding of per se prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b676 I conclude, therefore, that defense counsel\u2019s admission of guilt to the offense of felony assault does not warrant setting aside the judgment of the criminal proceeding, as the jury convicted Jefferson of a charge greater than that admitted to the jury by defense counsel. I further conclude that Jefferson has failed to demonstrate that, but for defense counsel's errors, there was a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different. I would therefore hold that Jefferson has failed to satisfy the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test as properly applied, and would affirm his conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b188-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY joins in the concurring and dissenting opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
