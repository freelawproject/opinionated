He raises eight issues on appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">\u00b62 Weldele challenged several aspects of the District Court\u2019s ruling. The restatement of the issues presented to this Court is:</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">1. Did the District Court err when it denied Weldele\u2019s motion to dismiss after finding that Weldele knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel when he pled guilty to DUI in Oregon in 1987?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">2. Did the District Court err when it denied Weldele\u2019s motion to dismiss and subsequently used Weldele\u2019s 1984 and 1987 DUI guilty pleas to raise his 2000 DUI offense to a felony despite a law in effect between 1981 and 1989 that required expungement, under certain circumstances, of DUIs after five years?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-15\">3. Does the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>preclude enhancing punishment based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>factors that have not been charged and proved beyond reasonable doubt?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">4. Did the District Court erroneously deny Weldele\u2019s motion in hmine to preclude the use of the results of the breath tests at trial on the basis that the State had failed to provide full discovery regarding these tests?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">5. Did the District Court erroneously deny Weldele\u2019s motion in hmine to preclude the use of the results of the preliminary breath test (PBT), a/k/a preliminary alcohol screening test (PAST), at trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">6. Did the District Court err when it denied various motions filed by Weldele at the pretrial conference as untimely?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">7. Was Weldele\u2019s counsel ineffective for failing to file the denied motions in a timely manner?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">8. Did the District Court err in refusing to grant a mistrial when a witness repeatedly referred to alleged prior bad acts by Weldele?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">\u00b63 We address each of these issues below.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">\u00b64 Weldele and Susan Sheridan (Sheridan), who had been dating for several months, drove to Sheridan\u2019s Helena residence on the evening of February 14,2000, after completing some errands. Sheridan alleges that Weldele was angry with her when they returned. They had been drinking and according to Sheridan, Weldele was drinking heavily and quickly. Sheridan asserts that Weldele became verbally abusive to her ten-year old daughter, J.B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, and was \u201ctormenting\u201d and physically \u201cfighting\u201d with J.B., while Weldele characterizes the event as one of \u201chorseplay\u201d between him and J.B. During this incident between Weldele and J.B., Weldele was struck in the eye by J.B.\u2019s finger or by a pencil that J.B. had been holding. Sheridan claims that Weldele responded by grabbing J.B. by the hair and dragging her across the room and that this was done with enough force to pull out some of J.B.\u2019s hair. When Sheridan attempted to intervene, she claims Weldele grabbed her by her hair as well. Sheridan immediately told Weldele to leave which he did. Sheridan thereafter called the police. Sheridan reported that Weldele had assaulted her daughter and her, that he had left her residence, presumably en route to his own, and that he was driving while possibly intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">\u00b65 Deputy Sheriff Ken Goetz and Sergeant Dirk Anderson of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Lewis and Clark Sheriffs Department were dispatched separately in response to Sheridan\u2019s call. Goetz observed Weldele traveling toward his residence on 1-15 northbound just south of the Lincoln Road interchange. Goetz pursued Weldele and overtook him as Weldele pulled into a grocery store parking lot on Lincoln Road. Goetz activated his emergency lights, pulled in and parked behind Weldele\u2019s vehicle. The deputy approached Weldele and advised him that he was investigating a reported assault. Goetz noted that Weldele appeared \u201cunsteady on his feet,\u201d and was weaving while standing and walking. Goetz also noticed that Weldele\u2019s motor skills seemed impaired and his speech was slurred. In response to Goetz\u2019s question, Weldele said he had a few beers and that he \u201chad committed a little domestic violence tonight.\u201d He also told Goetz that he had perhaps been a \u201clittle rough on [J.B.].\u201d Based on his observations, Goetz asked Weldele if he would perform some field sobriety tests. Weldele agreed. Weldele subsequently attempted to perform the one-legged stand and the walk and turn tests. According to Goetz, Weldele either failed these tests or performed them poorly.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u00b66 After waiting the prescribed observation period and advising Weldele of his rights vis-a-vis the PBT, Goetz administered the field PBT to Weldele with Weldele\u2019s permission. Weldele\u2019s PBT indicated an estimated breath alcohol concentration (BAC) of .154. Goetz thereafter arrested Weldele for DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u00b67 Most of this investigation was videotaped by Officer Joseph Cohenour of the Montana Highway Patrol. Cohenour had heard the dispatcher, offered his assistance and arrived on the scene approximately two minutes after Goetz. He immediately positioned his vehicle and activated his patrol car\u2019s video camera. The camera proceeded to videotape Weldele as he took the field sobriety tests. Additionally, Cohenour spoke with Weldele and he too observed that Weldele smelled of alcohol, slurred his words and was unsteady on his feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u00b68 While Goetz was in the field with Weldele, Anderson was interviewing Sheridan and J.B. at the Sheridan residence. Based upon these interviews, Anderson notified Goetz that Weldele should also be arrested for partner assault against Sheridan and assault on a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"AVC\">\u00b69 Goetz transported Weldele to the detention center where Weldele once again performed the one-legged stand and walk and turn tests. Additionally, he consented to and took the Intoxilizer breath analysis test. The result of the Intoxilizer test was .171.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">\u00b610 Weldele was charged by Information on February 18, 2000, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>felony DUI, driving without valid insurance (subsequently dropped), partner assault, and assault on a minor. The DUI charge was enhanced to a felony based on three previous DUI convictions on Weldele\u2019s record, occurring in October 1984, October 1987, and March 1991. After multiple continuances of his trial date, Weldele\u2019s jury trial was scheduled for November 13-14,2000. At his November 1st pretrial conference, Weldele submitted a motion in limine and a motion to suppress evidence, both of which were denied by the District Court as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">\u00b611 During trial, Sheridan made several references to an alleged prior domestic assault by Weldele even though a motion in limine excluding mention of prior bad acts had been granted. Following Sheridan\u2019s testimony, Weldele\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial based upon these prior bad act references. The motion was denied but a curative jury instruction was delivered. Ultimately, the jury found Weldele not guilty of partner assault against Sheridan and guilty of felony DUI and assault on a minor. He was subsequently sentenced to house arrest for six months, followed by three years probation for the DUI charge and one year suspended, subject to specific conditions, for the assault charge. Additionally, Weldele was required to pay certain surcharges and a $1,000 fine. Weldele filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\n<em>The enhancement of Weldele\u2019s DUI to felony status</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJg6\">\u00b612 Weldele challenges the enhancement of his February 14, 2000 DUI charge to a felony DUI on three separate grounds: 1) he did not knowingly waive his right to counsel for his 1987 DUI charge; 2) the law in effect at the time he pled guilty to two previous DUIs in 1984 and 1987 stated that those offenses would be expunged from his record after five years; and 3) under <em>Apprendi, </em>prior offenses not included in the charging document or proved beyond a reasonable doubt cannot be used to enhance his DUI charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\u00b613 The first issue we address is whether the District Court erred when it denied Weldele\u2019s motion to dismiss after finding that Weldele knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel when he pled guilty to DUI in Oregon in 1987. The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a question of law which we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal. Our standard of review is plenary, and we determine whether a district court\u2019s conclusion is correct. <em>State v. Hardaway, </em>2001 MT 252, 307 Mont. 139, 36 P.3d 900 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">\u00b614 Weldele was arrested and charged with DUI in La Grande, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Oregon, on September 29, 1987. He appeared before District Court Judge Eric Valentine on October 12, 1987, and pled guilty to the charge. Weldele asserts that he was not represented by an attorney nor does he recall being told that he had the right to an attorney and that an attorney would be appointed to represent him if he could not afford one.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\u00b615 The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution guarantee the fundamental right to the assistance of counsel. <em>Gideon v. Wainwright </em>(1963), 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799; <em>State v. Okland, </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 10, 14, 941 P.2d 431, 433. However, a defendant may waive this fundamental right if he or she does so specifically, voluntarily, and knowingly. <em>State v. Howard, </em>2002 MT 276, \u00b6 12, 312 Mont. 359, \u00b6 12, 59 P.3d 1075, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b616  While it is well established that the State may not use a constitutionally infirm conviction to support an enhanced punishment, such as a felony DUI, there is a rebuttable presumption of regularity that attaches to prior criminal convictions, including prior DUI convictions. <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 10. <em>See also State v. Peterson, </em>2002 MT 65, \u00b6 6, 309 Mont. 199, \u00b6 6, 44 P.3d 499, \u00b6 6 (citation omitted) (A presumption of regularity, including the presumption that a defendant was properly informed of and waived any constitutional rights at issue, attaches to a prior DUI conviction used to enhance a subsequent conviction to a felony). This presumption may be overcome, however, by direct evidence of irregularity from the defendant. <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 6 <em>(citing State v. Big Hair, </em>1998 MT 61, \u00b6 16, 288 Mont. 135, \u00b6 16, 955 P.2d 1352, \u00b6 16). Once the defendant has presented evidence of irregularity, the burden then shifts to the State to prove by a preponderance of evidence that the prior conviction was not obtained in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights. <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 6 <em>(citing State v. Ailport, </em>1998 MT 315, \u00b6 7, 292 Mont. 172, \u00b6 7, 970 P.2d 1044, \u00b6 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b617 As indicated above, a rebuttable presumption of regularity attaches to Weldele\u2019s 1987 DUI conviction; however, Weldele may overcome this presumption by direct evidence of irregularity. By way of direct evidence, Weldele submitted an affidavit in which he claimed that when he pled guilty to the charge in Oregon, he did not recall being told that he had the right to an attorney and that an attorney would be appointed to represent him if he could not afford one. However, Weldele\u2019s equivocal recollection is at a variance with the transcript of Weldele\u2019s 1987 audio-taped arraignment before Judge Valentine, which reveals the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Judge Valentine: You have the right to remain silent. The right to a trial by jury. The right to have an attorney represent you. And if you cannot afford an attorney to have one appointed free. Do you understand those rights? Weldele: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">Judge Valentine: ... Are you going to want to see an attorney? Weldele: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">\u00b618 In addition to the arraignment transcript unequivocally demonstrating that Weldele was told of his rights, Judge Valentine submitted an affidavit stating that he had advised Weldele of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">\u00b619 As to Weldele\u2019s claim that under <em>Faretta v. California </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, he also should have been advised of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation in order for his waiver to be knowing, voluntary and intelligent, we note that it is not within this Court\u2019s jurisdiction to determine whether the Oregon court correctly applied or failed to apply <em>Faretta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">\u00b620  Based on the foregoing, we conclude the District Court did not err in denying Weldele\u2019s motion to dismiss his felony DUI on the grounds that Weldele had not knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel prior to pleading guilty to Oregon DUI charges in 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">\u00b621 We next consider whether the District Court erred when it denied Weldele\u2019s motion to dismiss and subsequently used Weldele\u2019s 1984 and 1987 DUI guilty pleas to raise his 2000 DUI offense to a felony, despite the existence of a law in effect between 1981 and 1989 that required expungement, under certain circumstances, of DUIs after five years.</p>\n<p id=\"AiM\">\u00b622 Weldele has been charged with four DUIs. His first DUI charge was on October 2,1984, and he was convicted on October 15,1984. He was charged with his second DUI on September 29, 1987, and convicted on October 12,1987. He was charged with his third DUI on September 29,1990, and convicted on March 15,1991. He was charged with his fourth DUI on February 14, 2000. Weldele argues that because the law in effect at the time of his 1984 and 1987 DUIs provided that those DUI charges could not be used against him after five years, those DUIs should not have been counted as previous convictions and used to enhance the DUI in the case at bar to a felony. Section 61-8-714(5), MCA, in effect from 1981 through September 30, 1989, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-14\">For the purpose of determining the number of convictions under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>this section,.... An offender is considered to have been previously convicted for the purposes of this section if less than 5 years have elapsed between the commission of the present offense and a previous conviction. If there has been no additional conviction for an offense under this section for a period of 5 years after a prior conviction hereunder, then such prior offense shall be expunged from the defendant\u2019s record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b623 Weldele argues that because more than five years have elapsed between any of his prior convictions and the present offense, his 1984 and 1987 convictions cannot be used against him. Weldele misinterprets the statute on which he relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b624 Section 61-8-714(5), MCA, recited above, was in effect at the time Weldele was convicted of both the 1984 and 1987 DUIs. Because Weldele\u2019s 1987 DUI conviction followed his 1984 conviction by only three years, his 1984 DUI was not expunged, ceased to qualify for expungement and remains on his record. <em>State v. Thibert, </em>1998 MT 207, \u00b6 10, 290 Mont. 408, \u00b6 10, 965 P.2d 251, \u00b6 10. For the same reason, Weldele\u2019s 1987 DUI conviction remains on his record as a result of his 1990/1991 DUI and conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b625 Subsequently, \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA, was amended, effective October 1, 1989. This version reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">For the purpose of determining the number of convictions under this section,.... An offender is considered to have been previously convicted for the purposes of this section if less than 5 years have elapsed between the commission of the present offense and a previous conviction. If there has been no additional conviction for an offense under this section for a period of 5 years after a prior conviction hereunder, then all records and data relating to the prior conviction are confidential criminal justice information ... and public access to the information may only be obtained by district court order upon good cause shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">\u00b626  This version of the law was in effect at the time Weldele committed his 1990 DUI and at the time he was convicted of it in March 1991. This statute informs Weldele that if he remains DUI-conviction-free for five years from the time of his 1990 conviction, the 1990 conviction will not be expunged but will become confidential criminal justice information. The distinction between expungement and confidential classification is significant. <em>State v. Brander </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 148, 156, 930 P.2d 31, 36. An expunged conviction may not be used for calculating penalties for subsequent DUIs, whereas confidential criminal justice information is available for review by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>court. <em>Brander, </em>280 Mont. at 156, 930 P.2d at 36. \u201cTherefore, while a court cannot review expunged records because those records effectively do not exist, a court is in no way restricted from reviewing criminal records simply because those records are classified as confidential.\u201d <em>Brander, </em>280 Mont. at 156, 930 P.2d at 36. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 44-5-303, MCA (1999). Thus, at this stage in Weldele\u2019s DUI-history, he had two DUIs that would remain on his record permanently, and one that could qualify for confidentiality but would still be available for court review. \u00b627 In 1995, the Montana Legislature again amended \u00a7 61-8-714, MCA, by adding a new subsection which provides for a felony sanction for offenders on a fourth or subsequent DUI conviction. Section 61-8-714(4), MCA (1995). In conjunction with this new subsection of the statute, the Legislature amended \u00a7 61-8-714(6), MCA (formerly subsection (5)), to provide, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\">An offender is considered to have been previously convicted for the purposes of sentencing if less than 5 years have elapsed between the commission of the present offense and a previous conviction, unless the offense is the offender\u2019s fourth or subsequent offense, in which case all previous convictions must be used for sentencing purposes.... (Emphasis provided.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKg\">\u00b628 Therefore, as of 1995, Weldele was on notice that a fourth DUI qualified as a felony and that all of his previous DUI convictions would be counted for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b629 The Legislature dramatically revised the DUI statutory scheme in 1997 by creating separate misdemeanor DUI statutes and felony DUI statutes. Section 61-8-714, MCA, became the misdemeanor statute establishing the penalty for the first through third DUI offenses. As a result, \u00a7 61-8-714, MCA, no longer included language referencing a fourth offense or sentencing for fourth or subsequent offenses. That language was moved to the felony DUI statutes. Section 61-8-731, MCA (1997), created the penalty applicable to felony DUIs, <em>i.e., </em>fourth or subsequent DUI offenses, and \u00a7 61-8-734(b), MCA, adopted the language formerly found in \u00a7 61-8-714(6), MCA, informing prospective DUI defendants that after the fourth DUI all previous DUIs would be used for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u00b630 The new DUI statutory scheme, separating felony DUI from misdemeanor DUI, became effective on October 1,1997, and expressly applied to offenses committed on or after October 1,1997. This version of the law was in effect at the time Weldele committed his February 2000 DUI. As did the 1995 statute, this law once again notified Weldele that with a fourth DUI offense, all previous DUI convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>would be counted for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b631 Weldele argues that \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d dictates that the State not go back on its word to Weldele that his 1984 and 1987 convictions would not be used against him. Had Weldele managed to comply with the law in effect at the time he entered his 1984 guilty plea and not committed a subsequent DUI within five years of his 1984 conviction, the law would have \u201ckept its word\u201d and expunged the 1984 conviction. Likewise, had Weldele postponed his third DUI until after October 12,1992, the State would have once again \u201ckept its word\u201d and expunged his 1987 conviction. However, as forbearance did not prevail, both Weldele\u2019s 1984 and 1987 DUI convictions did not qualify for expungement and remain on his record.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u00b632  Thus, there is no \u201cfundamental fairness,\u201d due process, or <em>ex post facto </em>issue in this case. The accurate and lawful application of the laws in effect at the time Weldele committed and was convicted of each of his multiple DUIs allows for the enhancement of his sentence based upon his complete DUI record of four offenses. Thus, the District Court did not err in denying Weldele\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">\u00b633 Does the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi </em>preclude the enhancement of Weldele\u2019s punishment based on factors that have not been charged and proved beyond reasonable doubt?</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u00b634 The District Court\u2019s determination of whether <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435, was applicable to the case at bar is a conclusion of law and will be reviewed by this Court for correctness. We take into account the fact that the District Court imposed a sentence, in part, based upon the inapplicability of <em>Apprendi. </em>We review the District Court\u2019s sentence of Weldele for legality. Because we are reviewing a legal conclusion and the application of sentencing guidelines, our review is <em>de novo. State v. Kaufmann, </em>2002 MT 294, \u00b6 12, 313 Mont. 1, \u00b6 12, 59 P.3d 1166, \u00b6 12. <em>See also U.S. v. Martin </em>(9th Cir. 2002), 278 F.3d 988, 1005 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">\u00b635 <em>Apprendi </em>was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 26, 2000. Neither party referenced it in any pretrial motions nor was its applicability mentioned during the November 2000 trial. In February 2001, Weldele submitted a Sentencing Memorandum which included, for the first time, his <em>Apprendi </em>argument. Relying on <em>Apprendi, </em>Weldele argued that the District Court could not enhance his DUI to a felony DUI because the State had failed to charge and prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, prior convictions that it intended to use to increase the penalty for a driving under the influence offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>\u00b636 On April 2,2001, the District Court issued its Judgment, in which it made no reference to <em>Apprendi. </em>The court sentenced Weldele to six months house arrest for felony DUI, followed by three years probation. He was fined $1,000. Under \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA (1999), the penalty for felony DUI is no less than six months nor more than thirteen months imprisonment; no less than one year nor more than four years probation, and a fine of no less than $1,000 nor more than $10,000. We note that Weldele\u2019s sentence is within the range of felony DUI sentences available under \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA (1999). Weldele argues that his case should be remanded for sentencing as a first offense DUI because the State failed to comply with the rule set out in <em>Apprendi. </em>Weldele\u2019s reliance on <em>Apprendi </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b637 First, we note that <em>Apprendi </em>contains the following express language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">[0]ur reexamination of our cases in this area, and of the history upon which they rely, confirms the opinion that we expressed in <em>Jones. </em>Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\"><em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490. Here, it was the prior convictions <em>alone </em>that led to Weldele\u2019s enhanced penalty. Clearly, under <em>Apprendi, </em>the fact of a prior conviction need not be submitted to the jury, or proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\u00b638 Second, in <em>Apprendi, </em>Apprendi was charged with, indicted for and pled guilty to weapons offenses. Subsequently, the judge determined that Apprendi had also violated the State\u2019s \u201chate crime\u201d statute. The judge then applied the \u201chate crime\u201d sentence enhancement statute and sentenced Apprendi to a sentence that exceeded the statutory maximum for the weapons offenses. Significantly, he was never charged with violation of the hate crime statute nor did a jury find him guilty of it. The Supreme Court concluded that Apprendi\u2019s sentence violated his right to \u201ca jury determination that [he] is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d <em>(Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 477) and that such right attached not only to his weapons offense but also to the \u201chate crime\u201d aggravating circumstance. Additionally, the Supreme Court explained that the Sixth Amendment does not permit a defendant to be \u201cexpose[d] ... to a penalty <em>exceeding </em>the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 483 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>\u00b639 In the case at bar, Weldele was charged with felony DUI in accordance with statutes that had been in effect for several years. The jury found him guilty of the offense for which he was charged and the judge imposed a sentence which was within the range of statutorily-authorized sentences for that offense. The judge, subsequent to the jury\u2019s verdict, did not find Weldele guilty of another offense for which he had not been charged, nor did he impose a sentence on Weldele that surpassed the maximum allowed sentence for the offense for which the jury had found him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b640 For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the District Court did not err in declining to apply the <em>Apprendi </em>holding to Weldele\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"AFX\">\n<em>The denial of Weldele\u2019s motion in limine to preclude admission of PBT/PAST results at trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b641 We next consider whether the District Court erred in denying Weldele\u2019s motion in limine to preclude the use of the results of the breath tests at trial, on the basis that the State had failed to provide full discovery regarding these tests. We have held that a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion in limine is an evidentiary ruling and that the court has broad discretion in determining whether evidence is relevant and admissible. As such, this Court will not overturn a district court\u2019s determination absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>Somont Oil Co., Inc. v. A&amp; G Drilling, </em>2002 MT 141, 310 Mont. 221, 49 P.3d 598 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">\u00b642 Litigating parties are entitled to seek relevant information from one other through the process of discovery. Rule 26, M.R.Civ.P. In the case at bar, Weldele sought to have the State produce an extensive array of documents that would confirm that the breath testing devices used to establish Weldele\u2019s BAC were certified, operated, maintained and stored in a manner compliant with applicable regulations, and that the operators of the equipment were appropriately trained and certified. While the State provided some of the documents requested, it did not produce each document listed in Weldele\u2019s motion for discovery. Weldele subsequently filed a motion in limine to preclude admission of the results of the breath tests on the grounds that the State had failed to provide the full scope of discovery requested and that the State had failed to establish the necessary foundation to render the test results admissible. The District Court denied the motion, concluding that the State had provided sufficient information with which Weldele could prepare his defense. The breath test results were admitted at trial. Weldele appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion in limine and argues that the State\u2019s failure to fully produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>requested documents and failure to adequately establish the foundation of the admissibility of the tests rendered the tests inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b643  In deciding whether the District Court abused its discretion when it denied Weldele\u2019s motion in limine, we acknowledge that a district court has broad discretion to determine the relevance and admissibility of specific evidence. <em>State v. Woods </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 124, 947 P.2d 62. We presume that within this broad discretion is the sagacity to determine adequate compliance with pretrial discovery requests. Additionally, it is within the district court\u2019s sound discretion to determine whether an adequate foundation has been established to warrant admissibility of evidence. <em>State v. Delaney, </em>1999 MT 317, \u00b6 14, 297 Mont. 263, \u00b6 14, 991 P.2d 461, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b644  The purpose of Weldele\u2019s extensive document request was to obtain information with which to prepare his defense with regard to the equipment used for BAC measurement. Conversely, the produced documents were intended by the State to establish the necessary foundation for admission of the breath test results into evidence. The District Court concluded that the information provided in response to the request for production was adequate for both Weldele\u2019s and the State\u2019s purposes. While the State\u2019s production was not as extensive as requested, and while we may believe that more information could and should have been produced by the State, we cannot conclude the District Court abused its discretion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b645 As the District Court found, the documents provided confirmed that 1) the officers were certified to operate both the PBT equipment and the Intoxilizer; 2) the Intoxilizer had received an annual certification less than five months before Weldele\u2019s use of it; 3) the Intoxilizer solution was approved and used in compliance with applicable regulations; 4) the Intoxilizer was properly calibrated before and after Weldele\u2019s test; and 5) the PBT instrument was properly field certified. Thus, the documents produced by the State appeared to the District Court to adequately satisfy Weldele\u2019s concerns. We will not disturb this conclusion of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u00b646 We next consider whether the District Court erred in denying Weldele\u2019s motion in limine to preclude the use of the results of the preliminary breath test (PBT), a/k/a preliminary alcohol screening test (PAST), at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\u00b647 Weldele argues that use of the PBT result should have been precluded at trial based upon the unreliability of PBT equipment when used in the field. He finds support for his argument in our decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>State v. Strizich </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 1, 952 P.2d 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b648 In <em>Strizich, </em>we reviewed the applicable statutes in effect at the time<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, the legislative history of those statutes, and the applicable administrative regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time of Strizich\u2019s conviction, the statutes specifically provided that the results of blood or breath tests taken after arrest were admissible as evidence at a DUI trial, but that the results of preliminary breath tests taken in the field before arrest were to be used for probable cause purposes only and were not admissible at trial. Additionally, we reviewed the expert testimony presented to the District Court during the <em>Strizich </em>trials. The reason for precluding trial admission of the PBTs, according to both parties\u2019 expert witnesses, was that the equipment used in the field had a high degree of variability and unreliability. As a result, the <em>Strizich </em>Court concluded that use of the PBT/PAST results should be restricted to estimating alcohol concentration for probable cause purposes, and should not be relied upon for an exact BAC to be used as trial evidence. <em>Strizich, </em>286 Mont. at 12, 952 P.2d at 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u00b649 Weldele maintains that our ruling in <em>Strizich </em>remains viable despite statutory changes and should be applied to his case. The State counters that because the Legislature revised the applicable statute, \u00a7 61-8-404, MCA, in 1997 and specifically authorized admissibility of PAST results as trial evidence, <em>Strizich </em>is no longer applicable. Upon careful analysis, we must disagree with the State for the reasons presented below.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u00b650 As a preliminary matter, we note that the Legislature did not change the language of \u00a7 61-8-409(1), MCA, which continues to provide that the purpose of the PAST is <em>\u201cestimating </em>the person\u2019s alcohol concentration.\u201d (Court\u2019s emphasis). Moreover, the regulations in effect at the time Weldele was convicted of his 2000 DUI continue to restrict consideration of the results as \u201cprobable cause evidence only.\u201d Rule 23.4.201(7)(b), ARM (1995). We turn now to the 1997 statutory revisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\u00b651 There is no doubt that the Legislature has the power to enact laws, including laws prescribing rules regarding evidence admissibility. This is a well-settled legislative prerogative in Montana. <em>City of Missoula v. Robertson, </em>2000 MT 52, \u00b6 53, 298 Mont. 419, \u00b6 53, 998 P.2d 144, \u00b6 53. And while the actions and words of the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>carry great weight with this Court, there are, nonetheless, times when state statutes and judicial rules of procedure followed by this Court, as a member of an independent branch of government, directly conflict. This is such a time. The determination of the admissibility, reliability and relevance of evidence has long been a matter of judicial discretion. As we recently stated in <em>City of Missoula, </em>\u00b6 55, the existence of admissibility language in a statute, while persuasive, \u201cby no means ... usurp[s] all discretion from the judiciary in making sound decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b652 Clearly, the 1997 amendments directly conflict with the result we reached in <em>Strizich. </em>In an effort to resolve this conflict, we carefully reviewed the scientific information provided during the <em>Strizich </em>trials as well as the legislative history behind the 1997 amendment to the statute. We were searching for convincing scientific evidence estabhshing that PBTs performed in the field are precise and reliable. Such a search, however, proved fruitless and for the reasons explained below failed to assuage our concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u00b653 During the <em>Strizich </em>trials of April and August, 1996, two experts testified repeatedly, while under oath, that the sole function of the PBT is to establish probable cause and that under field conditions, the results can be influenced by numerous physiological, instrumental and operator-induced factors. One of the experts, Phil Lively, testified to a margin of error of 10%-an extremely wide variable when a variation of .01% can conceivably mean the difference between conviction and acquittal. A scant five months later during statute amendment deliberations, when questioned by the Senate Judiciary Committee (Committee) specifically about the reliability of the equipment, the same expert explained pre-distribution approval processes, post-distribution testing and maintenance programs, and a 5% accuracy requirement, but at no time did he mention any of the many factors that can influence the reliability of the equipment under field conditions. In fact, the oral testimony and most of the written material presented to the Committee appeared designed to ensure support for revising the statute rather than to dispel any concerns about the unreliability of the equipment. We further note that while the transcript of the <em>Strizich </em>expert testimony was within the voluminous written material provided to the Committee, it does not appear that the Legislature took account of the experts\u2019 unequivocal testimony from that trial that the PBT was unreliable as conclusive evidence of intoxication. Significantly, in neither the oral testimony nor the written exhibits presented to the Committee did we find any evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>that the science of PBTs or PBT equipment had changed or improved between the <em>Strizich </em>trial in August 1996 and the legislative amendment deliberations in January 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b654 It is also notable that numerous witnesses testified during the Committee hearings that they were not seeking to have the PBT results admitted as \u201cstand alone\u201d evidence. Rather, they wanted PBT results to be given \u201cat least as much value in terms of competent evidence in assessing whether an individual was under the influence of alcohol as we are currently comporting officer observations, HGNs and field sobriety tests which are routinely admitted in DUI prosecutions.\u201d However, when the Legislature revised the statute, it did not incorporate the caveat that the results of the PBT be used only in conjunction with other field tests and observations. As written, the statute can be interpreted to allow admission of PBT results either with or without this additional corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u00b655 PBTs are qualitatively different from field tests, which call for a subjective analysis of a person\u2019s behavior. A PBT utilizes a scientific instrument to test a person\u2019s chemistry. In this scientific age, it is indisputable that, fairly or not, the result of a PBT, given its scientific nature, will be weighed heavily by a jury and will likely be accorded more weight than the other field tests. We conclude, therefore, that our many concerns pertaining to the PBT, i.e., its unreliability, lack of regulation and potentially inappropriate evidentiary weight, are not addressed or cured by admitting the PBT result into evidence in conjunction with the arresting officer\u2019s observations and field sobriety test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b656 We also note that our position on this issue is not a unique one. According to the \u201cSummary of State and Federal Court Decisions and Rules Governing Admissibility of Preliminary Breath Test Results\u201d provided by Amicus Curiae in the case at bar, the majority of states in the country still allow PBT results to be used only for probable cause rather than as substantive evidence of intoxication. This fact further supports our continuing reluctance to expand its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u00b657 Our analysis of this issue thus returns us to the conclusion that preliminary breath testing in the field as it is currently administered remains statistically unreliable. Because the statistical result of such a test could upon admission at trial determine guilt, the test result must be demonstrably accurate. This is not to say that we will never approve trial admission of this evidence. The State may take the opportunity at any time to establish PBT reliability. If the State in any given case establishes that the PBT results it seeks to admit are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>reliable and accurate, the results could then be admissible if they otherwise satisfy all other requirements for admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b658 In sum, the current law relative to the admissibility of PBT evidence remains the law as set forth in Strizich; it has not been overruled and district courts are bound by it. Under <em>Strizich, </em>Weldele was not obligated to prove that the PBT was unreliable. Rather, the State had the burden of offering scientific and expert testimony to establish the test\u2019s reliability. Because it did not do so, the District Court did not have the opportunity to determine, based upon scientific evidence, whether the PBT equipment used to test Weldele produced reliable and accurate results. Instead, the District Court relied upon the newly enacted statutory language of \u00a7 61-8-404, MCA, and denied Weldele\u2019s motion in limine, thereby allowing the State to enter the PBT results into evidence at trial. This was an understandable but erroneous legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b659  However, while we conclude that the District Court erred by admitting Weldele\u2019s PBT reading of .154 into evidence at trial, we also conclude that in this case such error was harmless under our holding in <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b660 In <em>Van Kirk, </em>we adopted a two-step analysis to determine whether an alleged error prejudices a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial and is therefore reversible. The first step in the analysis is an inquiry of whether the claimed error is categorized as \u201cstructural\u201d error or \u201ctrial\u201d error. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 37. Structural error is automatically reversible and requires no additional analysis or review. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 39. Examples of structural error include errors in the jury selection process <em>(State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, 298 Mont. 358, 2 P.3d 204); total deprivation of the right to counsel <em>(Gideon, </em>372 U.S. 335); and lack of an impartial trial judge <em>(Tumey v. Ohio </em>(1927), 273 U.S. 510, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u00b661 Trial error, on the other hand, is not presumptively prejudicial and therefore not automatically reversible, and is subject to review under our harmless error statute, \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA. Trial error typically occurs during the presentation of a case to the jury. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the error occurred when the inadmissible evidence was presented during the trial, and thus, this was trial error.</p>\n<p id=\"AjN\">\u00b662 As we did in <em>Van Kirk, </em>we analyze whether inadmissible evidence was erroneously admitted, and whether the defendant was prejudiced by such erroneous admission, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cwhether there was a reasonable possibility that the erroneously admitted evidence might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 43. To answer this query, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>we utilize the \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d test developed in <em>Van </em>Kirk. Under this test, we determine whether the fact-finder was presented with admissible evidence that proved the same facts as the tainted evidence proved. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 43. Additionally, the State would be required to demonstrate that the quality of the tainted evidence was such that there was no reasonable possibility that it might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 44. We drew an important distinction in <em>Van Kirk </em>between tainted evidence tending to prove an element of the crime charged and tainted evidence that does not go to the proof of an element of the crime charged. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 45-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b663 The \u201ctainted evidence\u201d in the case at bar was Weldele\u2019s PBT result which was admitted to prove intoxication, an element of the crime with which he was charged. Thus, under <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u201c[t]he State ... must demonstrate that (a) there was other admissible (cumulative) evidence demonstrating the \u2018under the influence\u2019 element of the crime charged; and (b) that, qualitatively no reasonable possibility exists that the tainted evidence might have contributed to [Weldele\u2019s] conviction.\u201d Van <em>Kirk, </em>\u00b6 48. Weldele\u2019s PBT result was not the <em>only </em>evidence presented to prove intoxication. Also admitted were the arresting officer\u2019s field observations, the results of Weldele\u2019s field sobriety tests, and his Intoxilizer result of .171. The accuracy, reliability, and admissibility of the Intoxilizer result were not challenged. The Intoxilizer result, on its own, established the \u201cunder the influence\u201d element of the crime charged, thereby rendering the PBT result redundant, unnecessary, non-prejudicial and harmless. As a result, we will not disturb the District Court\u2019s ruling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\n<em>The District Court\u2019s denial of untimely pretrial motions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b664 We next consider whether the District Court erred when it denied various motions filed by Weldele at the pretrial conference as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">\u00b665 The District Court entered an Order on July 17,2000, instructing counsel that all pretrial motions including motions in limine had to be filed with the court by July 28, 2000. Weldele filed a motion in limine and a motion to suppress evidence on November 1, 2000. The District Court denied the motions as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">\u00b666 While it may have been within the court\u2019s discretion to modify the scheduling order and accept the motions, it was also within its discretion to deny such motions as untimely based upon Weldele\u2019s failure to comply with the scheduling order. Section 46-13-101(2), MCA, allows, \u201cFailure of a party to raise defenses or objections or to make requests that must be made prior to trial, at the time set by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>court, constitutes a waiver of the defense, objection, or request.\u201d We find no fault with the District Court\u2019s decision, recognizing that the court is in the best position to determine which sanctions are most appropriate for the offending conduct. Denial of a motion in limine filed in disregard of a scheduling order is not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Seal v. Woodrows Pharmacy, </em>1999 MT 247, 296 Mont. 197, 988 P.2d 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b667 Applying the same rationale to the District Court\u2019s denial of Weldele\u2019s untimely motion to suppress, we affirm the court\u2019s denial of that motion as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\n<em>Weldele\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AEq\">\u00b668 We turn next to the question of whether Weldele\u2019s counsel was ineffective for failing to file the denied motions in a timely manner. To assess a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, both on direct appeal and in post-conviction proceedings, this Court applies the two-prong test from <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, which requires the defendant to \u201cshow that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense and deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Porter v. State, </em>2002 MT 319, 313 Mont. 149, 60 P.3d 951 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u00b669 Weldele\u2019s attorney challenges her own effectiveness with this issue. She argues that if this Court affirms the District Court\u2019s denial of the untimely-filed motions, then she provided ineffective assistance to Weldele by failing to file these motions in a timely manner. In this connection, we note an observation made several years ago by the California Supreme Court, \u201cSelf-proclaimed inadequacies on the part of trial counsel in aid of a client on appeal are not persuasive.\u201d <em>People v. Beagle </em>(Cal. 1972), 492 P.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\u00b670 First, it is important to recall that there is a strong presumption that counsel \u201crendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690. To overcome this presumption, a defendant bears the burden of showing that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and if so, that defendant was actually prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688 and 692. Arguably inadequate professional performance will not warrant overturning a judgment if the counsel\u2019s error had no effect on the judgment. The inquiry is whether, absent counsel\u2019s deficient representation, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Strickland, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>466 U.S. at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u00b671 An evaluation of counsel's overall representation of Weldele throughout the case at bar reveals that counsel\u2019s assistance did not fall below the reasonable standard. She zealously and conscientiously represented Weldele by filing a multitude of pretrial motions, including a motion to dismiss, seeking to protect her client. She and co-counsel earnestly assisted Weldele during his jury trial and aggressively sought to protect his interests through objections and a motion for mistrial. In light of her active and diligent representation of Weldele as displayed in the record of this case, we conclude that Weldele has not satisfied the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. Quite simply, the late filing of two of many pretrial motions does not rise to the level of a patently deficient performance. Because we find no overall deficiency of performance, we need not determine whether the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland </em>has been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\n<em>The District Court\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\u00b672 Finally, we consider whether the District Court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial after a witness repeatedly referred to alleged prior bad acts by Weldele. We review the grant or denial of a motion for mistrial for an abuse of discretion. The test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Kiely Const., L.L.C. v. City of Red Lodge, </em>2002 MT 241, 312 Mont. 52, 57 P.3d 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">\u00b673 In the case <em>subjudice, </em>the District Court granted a pretrial motion in limine prohibiting any reference to prior bad acts allegedly committed by Weldele. Sheridan had been advised of this testimonial restriction. Nonetheless, on three different occasions during her testimony she alluded to a previous, unreported domestic altercation between her and Weldele. While describing Weldele\u2019s assault on J.B., Sheridan stated, \u201call my memories come back of what he did to me back in October.\u201d Weldele\u2019s attorney objected and Sheridan was cautioned at that time by her attorney to confine her testimony to the events of February 14. Moments later she stated, \u201cI cried and I said this is the last time it is going to happen and I called the cops.\u201d Shortly thereafter, when testifying to the details of the investigating officer\u2019s evidence collection in her kitchen, she testified, \u201cbecause me and my daughter were sitting there going oh God he did it again.\u201d Weldele\u2019s attorney again objected and requested a chamber conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\u00b674 In chambers, Weldele moved for a mistrial. The court denied the request but offered to issue a cautionary jury instruction drafted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Weldele\u2019s attorneys. The instruction was drafted and the court delivered it upon returning to the courtroom. The court told the jury that Weldele was to be tried solely on the allegations relating to February 14,2000, that there had been no prior allegation of domestic abuse between the parties, and that the jury was to disregard any additional accusations made by Sheridan. Weldele claims that this instruction was insufficient and that, as a result of Sheridan\u2019s testimony, he was denied a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b675  A district court\u2019s determination of whether to grant a motion for a mistrial must be based on whether the defendant has been denied a fair and impartial trial. <em>State v. Soraich, </em>1999 MT 87, \u00b6 17, 294 Mont. 175, \u00b6 17, 979 P.2d 206, \u00b6 17 (citation omitted). We declared in <em>State v. Partin </em>(1997), 287 Mont. 12, 18, 951 P.2d 1002, 1005-06, that where there is a reasonable possibility that inadmissible evidence might have contributed to the conviction, a mistrial is appropriate. In determining whether a prohibited statement contributed to a conviction, we consider the strength of the evidence against the defendant, the prejudicial effect of the testimony, and whether a cautionary jury instruction could cure any prejudice. <em>State v. Scarborough, </em>2000 MT 301, \u00b6 81, 302 Mont. 350, \u00b6 81, 14 P.3d 1202, \u00b6 81 <em>(citing Partin, </em>287 Mont. at 18, 951 P.2d at 1005-06).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\u00b676  In the case at bar, while Sheridan\u2019s statements imply that a previous altercation occurred between Weldele and Sheridan, they are not so prejudicial, in light of the verdict, the evidence, and the cautionary instruction, as to warrant a mistrial. Significantly, the jury considered an assault charge by Weldele against Sheridan, but it found him not guilty of that charge. Moreover, there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to find Weldele guilty of assaulting J.B. Lastly, the instruction to the jury to disregard the inappropriate references because \u201cno prior allegations of domestic abuse between these two parties\u201d existed was sufficient in these circumstances. We therefore conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Weldele\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\u00b677 For the reasons stated in this Opinion, we affirm the decision of the District Court in all respects.</p>\n<judges id=\"b497-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-13\"> To protect the identity of the minor in this case, we shall refer to her by initials only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\"> Sections 61-8-402, -404, -409, MCA (1995)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b490-9\"> Rule 23.4.201(7)(b), ARM (1995)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b497-9\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AV8K\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\u00b678 I concur with the holding of the Court on all issues herein, but disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the District Court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>allowing the results of the preliminary alcohol screening test or preliminary breath test (PAST or PBT) as evidence in the trial, and dissent therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b679 First, I disagree with the Court\u2019s interpretation of the <em>Strizich </em>decision. The Court characterizes <em>Strizich </em>as holding that PAST results suffer <em>inherent unreliability </em>as a matter of law and then affirms that decision. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 48 and 58. This characterization of <em>Strizich, </em>in my view, is not entirely accurate. <em>Strizich </em>made no finding of <em>inherent unreliability.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b680 The more accurate view is that <em>Strizich </em>did not hold that the PAST was <em>inherently unreliable </em>as a matter of law, but rather, that it was <em>inadmissible </em>as a matter of law. There is brief language in the opinion which may cause some confusion, but a careful reading demonstrates this point. First, the <em>Strizich </em>Court explained that \u00a761-8-404, MCA, provided that results from post-arrest tests were admissible as evidence in a DUI trial, but that, in direct contrast, \u00a7 61-8-409, MCA, only provided that the PAST may be used in determining whether probable cause exists for an arrest, observing \u201c[t]here is no suggestion in \u00a7 61-8-409, MCA, that the results of a PBT are admissible as substantive evidence to establish a person\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>Strizich, </em>286 Mont. at 11, 952 P.2d at 1371. The Court noted that the legislative history was consistent with this statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u00b681 The <em>Strizich </em>Court then noted that there were reasons for this \u201clegislative decision.\u201d The Court quoted briefly from expert witnesses who had testified that the test is reliable in controlled situations, but that \u201cvariances\u201d could occur, depending upon environmental factors. The Court concluded that the test was an \u201cestimate\u201d and restricted to probable cause determinations by the governing statutes. Thus, the Court reasoned that a \u201clegislative decision\u201d had prohibited the use of the evidence at trial, and that this decision was supported by the trial record. It did not hold that the trial record had conclusively demonstrated that the test was <em>inherently unreliable </em>as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u00b682 The 1997 Legislature changed this \u201clegislative decision\u201d by enacting Senate Bill 106, and thereby revised the very statutes the Court had relied upon in <em>Strizich. </em>Senate Bill 106 included the PAST within the list of tests set forth in \u00a7 61-8-404, MCA, as admissible at trial, and struck the language in \u00a7 61-8-409, MCA, which had referenced its use for probable cause determinations. See Chapter No. 88, Laws of Montana (1997). While reliability of the PAST may have been addressed during legislative hearings, the Legislature itself made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>no attempt to pre-determine that such evidence was rehable in every instance any more than it had done so for other DUI-related tests. It simply removed the statutory impediments to admissibility which the Court had pointed out in <em>Strizich. </em>In short, the 1997 amendments provided that the PAST was \u201cadmissible,\u201d but did not insulate the test from foundational challenges, including reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b683 Prior to trial, Weldele challenged the Legislature\u2019s actions, arguing in his motion in limine that the solons\u2019 attempt to insert this evidence in a trial was invalid because \u201c[t]he legislature cannot make the PBT sufficiently reliable to be admissible simply by saying it is.\u201d The Defendant was absolutely correct in this statement, but the statement is not an accurate reflection of what the Legislature did. It did not legislate reliability, but simply repealed the statutory declaration that the evidence was inadmissible as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"ATY\">\u00b684 Ruling on Weldele\u2019s motion in limine, the District Court called it exactly right: \u201cThe language of these [1997] statutory revisions clearly <em>permits </em>the use of the PBT results in trial. The <em>reliability </em>of the PBT may be established at trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The District Court thus acknowledged that the statutory impediments to admissibility relied on in <em>Strizich </em>had been removed, but that reliability remained an issue to be determined in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b685 At trial, the State provided foundational evidence only in regard to the machine\u2019s certification and the officer\u2019s training, and then offered the test results for introduction. This was Weldele\u2019s opportunity to challenge the science underlying the PAST, but he failed to do so. Instead, he merely renewed his objection that the State had failed to provide full discovery and should be prohibited from using the evidence for that reason, which is the fourth issue resolved by the Court\u2019s opinion herein. Reliability of the PAST was not challenged at trial, and thus, a record was not made on that issue, either by the Defendant or by the State. This is sufficient reason by itself to affirm the decision of the District Court, and this Court should do so on that basis, and stop there.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b686 Instead, the Court embarks on, in my opinion, a quixotic quest to determine reliability of this evidence on its own. Lacking any record on this issue, the Court nonetheless decides the issue by (1) analyzing the record in the <em>Strizich </em>case, and (2) analyzing the legislative history of the 1997 amendments. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52-54. I respectfully submit that by doing so the Court has engaged in an inappropriate mode of review. Neither party here was before us in <em>Strizich, </em>and even if they were, our duty is to decide this case on the record made before the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>here, not a record from a different case. Further, we do not determine the scientific reliability of evidence by a review of legislative history. In <em>Hulse </em>v. <em>State, </em>1998 MT 108, 289 Mont. 1, 961 P.2d 75, the proper method of determining reliability was set forth in the Court\u2019s extensive discussion of the admission of scientific evidence, there addressing the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">We agree that the HGN is not novel scientific evidence. Therefore, to determine the admissibility of HGN test results, a district court need not employ <em>the Daubert </em>standard. However, we continue to recognize that the relationship between alcohol consumption and nystagmus, the underlying scientific principle of the HGN test, is still beyond the range of ordinary training or intelligence. Therefore, <em>a district court must still conduct a conventional Rule 702, M.R.Evid., analysis to determine the admissibility of HGN test results </em>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">... <em>Clark </em>... illustrates that a foundation showing that the arresting officer is qualified to testify as to the HGN test <em>results </em>does not provide a sufficient basis for the officer to testify as to the scientific basis of the HGN test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">... Officer Kennedy was trained to administer the HGN test and, in fact, administered the HGN test on Hulse in accordance with this training, and, therefore, he was qualified to testify as to both his administration of the HGN test and his evaluation of Hulse\u2019s performance. However, nothing in the evidence establishes that Officer Kennedy had special training or education nor adequate knowledge qualifying him as an expert to explain the correlation between alcohol consumption and nystagmus, the underlying scientific basis of the HGN test. Accordingly, we conclude there was insufficient foundation for the admission of evidence concerning the HGN test and the District Court abused its discretion when it summarily denied Hulse\u2019s motion <em>in limine</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-7\"><em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 69-72 (underlining added). This proper determination of the reliability of the evidence did not occur here.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u00b687 The District Court did not summarily deny all challenges to reliability, but simply, and correctly, denied Weldele\u2019s argument that the statutes still preempted admission of PAST evidence, and held that the evidence could be introduced <em>if it </em>was shown to be reliable. At trial, Officer Goetz testified concerning his training and certification to operate a PAST instrument, and the purpose of the test. He did not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>however, testify concerning what <em>Hulse </em>describes as \u201cthe underlying scientific basis\u201d of the PAST, and therefore, presented insufficient foundation for the admission of the test. However, no objection was raised by the Defendant to that insufficiency, no evidence was offered by the State concerning the scientific basis for the test and thus, no record was made. Thus, the District Court was given no opportunity to \u201cconduct a conventional Rule 702, M.R.Evid., analysis\u201d and rule on reliability. <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b688 Given this posture of the matter, we should decline to issue a ruling declaring PAST evidence to be unreliable as a matter of law and consider this issue at a time when we have a proper record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"AIo\">I would affirm on that basis.</p>\n<judges id=\"b501-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY joins the concurring opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b501-6\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"ApO\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u00b689 I concur with the result of the majority Opinion. However, I do not agree with all that is stated in that Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">\u00b690 Specifically, I disagree with that part of the majority Opinion which discusses the effect of 1997 statutory amendments on our decision in <em>State v. Strizich </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 1, 952 P.2d 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">\u00b691 The majority states in \u00b6 48 that at the time of Strizich\u2019s conviction, Montana\u2019s statutes provided that preliminary breath tests were not admissible at trial. However, that is not correct. Section 61-8-409(2), MCA (1995), simply provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">(2) The results of a screening test may be used for determining whether probable cause exists to believe a person has violated 61-8-401, 61-8-406, or 61-8-410.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">\u00b692 Section 61-8-409, MCA (1995), included no express prohibition against the use of PBT evidence for purposes other than establishing probable cause and \u00a7 61-8-404, MCA (1995), made no mention of PBT evidence whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">\u00b693 The most specific reference to the limitations on PBT evidence prior to 1997 was Rule 23.4.201(7)(b), ARM (1995), which provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-13\">Analyses from this type of device, e.g. a preliminary breath tester, are to be considered as probable cause evidence only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">\u00b694 Rule 23.4.201(7)(b), ARM (1995), was still in effect at the time of Weldele\u2019s arrest and conviction. However, by then the legislature had amended \u00a7 61-8-409, MCA (1995), to delete subparagraph (2) and had amended \u00a7 61-8-404, MCA, to include PBTs (therein referred to as \u201cpreliminary alcohol screening test\u201d) among those breath tests which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>are now admissible. However, the statute does not specify the purpose for which the test results are admissible and the statute is not limited in its application to trials at which the substantive issue of guilt is determined. It also refers to \u201cother proceedings.\u201d Other proceedings include pretrial hearings to consider the suppression of evidence or to determine whether probable cause existed for an arrest. Therefore, I find nothing inconsistent with the legislative amendments made in 1997 and this Court\u2019s prior decision in <em>Strizich. </em>In particular, I disagree with the majority\u2019s statement in \u00b6 52 that the 1997 amendments directly conflict with the result we reached in <em>Strizich.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ae64\">\u00b695 Our decision in <em>Strizich </em>had several underpinnings. We noted 1) that \u00a7 61-8-409(1), MCA (1995), specifically provided that a PBT is for the purpose of \u201cestimating\u201d alcohol concentration, 2) that \u00a7 61-8-409(2), MCA (1995), made specific reference to the purpose of a PBT being to establish probable cause, 3) that there was no specific suggestion in \u00a7 61-8-409, MCA (1995), that PBTs are admissible as substantive evidence of guilt, 4) that Rule 23.4.201(7)(b), ARM (1995), specifically limited the purpose for which PBT evidence can be offered, and 5) that the record from the District Court established as a matter of fact that the procedure is unreliable and inaccurate as a measurement of alcohol concentration. <em>Strizich, </em>286 Mont. at 11-12, 952 P.2d at 1371-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b696 Of all the reasons given in the <em>Strizich </em>Opinion for excluding the evidence, the only thing that has changed is that \u00a7 61-8-409, MCA (1997), no longer refers to the use of PBTs to establish probable cause and \u00a7 61-8-404, MCA (1997), now lists PBTs among the types of tests that can be admitted at trials or other proceedings. Therefore, I conclude there is nothing inconsistent about the 1997 legislative amendments and our decision in <em>Strizich. </em>While some of the language relied on for the conclusion arrived at in that case no longer exists in the Montana Code, neither is there any language added to the code which requires that preliminary breath tests be admitted at a trial as evidence of a defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b697 I also disagree with the majority\u2019s suggestion that this issue will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and re-analyzed based on the quality of proof in every criminal case in which the evidence is offered. We all know that the quality of representation for criminal defendants is extremely inconsistent. The majority\u2019s suggestion could result in preliminary breath test admissibility in one case where it is not adequately challenged on a scientific basis and exclusion in another case where, because of the superior quality of representation or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>fact that greater resources are available for scientific or expert opinion evidence, the inadequacies of the test are more clearly established. This type of process provides no guidance to district courts, will lead to inconsistent results, and suggests that the basis for convictions will depend simply on the quality of representation provided to criminal defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b698 I would conclude that absent some evidence that the design or construction and reliability of the instruments by which preliminary breath tests are administered has changed significantly since our decision in <em>Strizich, </em>that decision is binding on district courts in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b699 For these reasons, while I concur in the result arrived at by the majority, I do not agree with all that is said in the majority Opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
