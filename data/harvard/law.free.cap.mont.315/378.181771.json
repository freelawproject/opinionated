The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>District Court for the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, rejected Mathis\u2019s constitutional challenge and the case proceeded to a jury trial. Mathis moved for a directed verdict following the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief. The District Court denied Mathis\u2019s motion and the jury subsequently convicted Mathis of the offense. Mathis appeals from the District Court\u2019s conclusions regarding the constitutional issues and from its denial of his motion for a directed verdict. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u00b62 Mathis raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u00b63 1. Does \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority to an administrative agency or private party?</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it denied Mathis\u2019s motion for a directed verdict based on insufficiency of the evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">\u00b65 Prior to September 2000, the Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) contracted with ECM, Inc., to perform construction on Interstate 90 east of Missoula, Montana. ECM subcontracted to Alpine Construction, Inc., its duty to post construction and reduced speed limit signs in the construction zone. Alpine Construction, Inc., posted temporary signs alerting motorists to the construction which lay ahead approximately 8250 feet prior to where ECM commenced work. The speed limit signs gradually reduced the speed of traffic from seventy-five miles per hour to thirty-five miles per hour nearest the work area. At the end of the construction zone, a sign indicated a return to the normal seventy-five mile per hour speed limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">\u00b66 On September 6, 2000, a Montana Highway Patrol officer encountered Mathis\u2019s vehicle traveling fifty-three miles per hour in the thirty-five mile per hour zone on Interstate 90 near Turah, Montana. Therefore, the officer issued Mathis a speeding ticket pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA. Mathis subsequently pled not guilty in the Missoula County Justice Court and moved to dismiss the charge on the grounds that (1) \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, unconstitutionally delegated legislative authority to the executive branch and/or to private parties and (2) the DOT and/or private contractor did not follow proper procedure to reduce the speed limit in the construction zone. The Justice Court denied Mathis\u2019s motion and a jury convicted Mathis of the offense on February 20,2001. On March 2,2001, Mathis appealed the conviction to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">\u00b67 In District Court, Mathis moved to dismiss the charge on the same grounds. On May 17, 2001, the District Court denied Mathis\u2019s motion and the case proceeded to trial. Mathis moved for a directed verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>following the State\u2019s presentation of its case-in-chief. The District Court denied Mathis\u2019s motion and the jury convicted Mathis of the offense on May 31, 2001. On July 30, 2001, Mathis filed a notice of appeal challenging the District Court\u2019s conclusions with regard to the constitutionality of \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, and its denial of his motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\u00b68 Whether a statute is constitutional is a question of law. We review a district court\u2019s application of the Constitution to determine if it is correct. <em>State v. Stanko, </em>1998 MT 321, \u00b6 14, 292 Mont. 192, \u00b6 14, 974 P.2d 1132, \u00b6 14. It is the duty of courts, if possible, to construe statutes in a manner that avoids unconstitutional interpretation. <em>Stanko, </em>\u00b6 15. We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a criminal defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Billedeaux, </em>2001 MT 9, \u00b6 8, 304 Mont. 89, \u00b6 8, 18 P.3d 990, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A1oz\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\u00b69 Does \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority to an administrative agency or private party?</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">\u00b610 Section 61-8-314, MCA, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">(3) The speed limit in a construction zone or in a work zone must be set by the department of transportation or the local authority based on traffic conditions or the condition of the construction, repair, maintenance) or survey project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">(4) (a) If the department of transportation, the local authority, the utility company, or the private contractor determines, based on traffic conditions or the condition of the construction, repair, maintenance, or survey project, that special speed limits in work zones or construction zones are warranted, then the department, the local authority, the utility company, or the private contractor shall post signs that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-11\">(i) conform to the department of transportation\u2019s manual on uniform traffic control devices;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-12\">(ii) indicate the boundaries of the construction zone and the work zone; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-13\">(iii) display the speed limit in effect within both zones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-14\">(5) (a) A person convicted of a traffic violation in a work zone is guilty of a misdemeanor. Upon arrest and conviction, the person shall be punished by a fine of not less than double the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>penalty provided for the violation in part 7 of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\">(b) A person convicted of a traffic violation in a construction zone is guilty of a misdemeanor. Upon arrest and conviction, the person is subject to the penalty provided for the violation in part 7 of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b6 11 Mathis contends that the Legislature cannot delegate law-making functions, such as the establishment of speed limits, to an administrative agency or private party. Mathis admits that the Legislature can delegate ministerial functions so long as it provides clear standards and guidelines to the implementing entity. Mathis argues that \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, fails to articulate the requisite guidelines, vesting \u201cunbridled discretion\u201d in the DOT. Accordingly, Mathis insists that we must strike \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, down as an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b612 The State argues that \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, articulates \u201cspecific standards for the DOT or other entities performing roadwork to follow when reducing speed limits in a construction zone.\u201d According to the State, the Legislature expressed such standards by requiring the entity to affix speed limits in accordance with the \u201ctraffic conditions or the condition of the construction, repair, maintenance, or survey project.\u201d Therefore, the State concludes that \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, sufficiently satisfies the requirements imposed upon the Legislature for delegating ministerial functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\u00b613 The District Court concluded that \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, is constitutional in that it sets forth, with reasonable clarity, the limitations on the DOT\u2019s discretion in setting speed limits in construction and work zones and does not delegate the establishment of a crime to either the DOT or private contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">\u00b614 Article III, Section 1, of the Montana Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">Separation of powers. The power of the government of this state is divided into three distinct branches-legislative, executive, and judicial. No person or persons charged with the exercise of power properly belonging to one branch shall exercise any power properly belonging to either of the others, except as in this constitution expressly directed or permitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">\u00b615  We have previously held that the authority to establish speed limits is legislative in nature. <em>See Lee v. State </em>(1981), 195 Mont. 1, 8, 635 P.2d 1282, 1286; <em>Stanko, </em>\u00b6 28. The Legislature may constitutionally delegate its legislative functions to an administrative agency, but it must provide, with reasonable clarity, limitations upon the agency\u2019s discretion and provide the agency with policy guidance. <em>In re Petition to Transfer Territory, </em>2000 MT 342, \u00b6 13, 303 Mont. 204, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>\u00b6 13, 15 P.3d 447, \u00b6 13. In <em>Bacus v. Lake County </em>(1960), 138 Mont. 69, 78, 354 P.2d 1056, 1061, we stated the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\">The law-making power may not be granted to an administrative body to be exercised trader the guise of administrative discretion. Accordingly, in delegating powers to an administrative body with respect to the administration of statutes, the legislature must ordinarily prescribe a policy, standard, or rule for their guidance and must not vest them with an arbitrary and uncontrolled discretion with regard thereto, and a statute or ordinance which is deficient in this respect is invalid. In other words, in order to avoid the pure delegation of legislative power by the creation of an administrative agency, the legislature must set limits on such agency\u2019s power and enjoin on it a certain course of procedure and rules of decision in the performance of its function; and, if the legislature <em>fails to prescribe with reasonable clarity the limits of power delegated to an administrative agency, or if those limits are too broad, </em>its attempt to delegate is a nullity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">On the other hand, a statute is complete and validly delegates administrative authority when nothing with respect to a determination of what is the law is left to the administrative agency, and <em>its provisions are sufficiently clear, definite, and certain to enable the agency to know its rights and obligation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiE\">\u00b616 In <em>Duck Inn, Inc. v. Montana State Univ. </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 519, 949 P.2d 1179, Montana State University-Northern (\u201cNorthern\u201d) rented its facilities to private persons and organizations for parties, reunions, conventions, and receptions in order to generate supplemental revenue. The Duck Inn, a local Montana corporation, filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and application for preliminary injunction against Northern. The Duck Inn argued, in part, that the statute permitting Northern to lease its facilities to private parties unconstitutionally delegated legislative authority to an administrative agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u00b617 The relevant portion of the statute in question provided that the regents of the Montana university system may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">rent the facilities to other public or private persons, firms, and corporations for such uses, at such times, for such periods, and at such rates as in the regents\u2019 judgment will be consistent with the full use thereof for academic purposes and will add to the revenues available for capital costs and debt service[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Section 20-25-302(5), MCA (1993). Duck Inn argued that the \u201cconsistent with the full use thereof\u2019 language vested legislative authority in the regents without specific guidelines for implementing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>the powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b618 We rejected Duck Inn\u2019s constitutional challenge. In so doing, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">[I]t is clear that \u00a7 20-25-302, MCA (1993), is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the board of regents. The policy underlying the statute is set forth in the statute;, that policy is to increase revenues available for the capital costs of, and debt service on, campus facilities. The implicit, but clear, rationale behind the statute is to minimize the tax support necessary to fund units of the Montana university system by leasing campus facilities. Likewise, \u00a7 20-25-302, MCA (1993), expressly constrains the leasing of such facilities by mandating that the leasing must be consistent with full use of the facilities for the academic purposes for which they were established. Here, this constraint on the board of regents is the \u201cstandard\u201d or \u201cguide\u201d required ... for a proper legislative delegation of power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">The Duck Inn contends, in this regard, that the \u201cregents\u2019 discretion\u201d language contained in \u00a7 20-25-302, MCA (1993), provides insufficient limits on the legislative delegation of power. It provides no legal authority for its position, however, and we conclude that the regents\u2019 discretion is sufficiently limited by the statutory requirements that the leasing be consistent with the full use of the facilities for academic purposes and produce revenues for capital costs or debt service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-7\"><em>Duck Inn, Inc., </em>285 Mont. at 525-26, 949 P.2d at 1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">\u00b619  Based on the same analysis employed in <em>Duck Inn, Inc., </em>we conclude that \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, does not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority to an administrative body or private party. Here, the implicit, but clear, rationale behind the statute is to protect drivers and workers in construction and work zones. The penalty for committing a traffic offense in a work zone, \u201cnot less than double the penalty\u2019 for similar offenses committed outside the confines of a work zone, lends credence to the implicit policy rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">\u00b620 Contrary to Mathis\u2019s suggestion, \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, does not grant unfettered discretion to establish traffic regulations in construction and work zones. Rather, \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, requires the respective entity to establish speed limits in construction and work zones \u201cbased on traffic conditions or the condition of the construction, repair, maintenance, or survey project.\u201d Construction and work zones on Montana highways presumably encompass a diverse set of driving conditions. Because of this, establishing the speed limit for every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>construction project would be an impractical, if not impossible, task for the Legislature. Enumerating every possible factor which might impact construction zone safety would be similarly unrealistic. Therefore, it makes sense to delegate these duties to the entities most familiar with the nuances of each project.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b621 Mathis cites several cases in which we struck down delegating statutes as unconstitutional. Admittedly, the distinction between an unconstitutional versus a constitutional delegation appears slight in some circumstances. However, \u201c[t]he constitutionality of a legislative enactment is <em>prima facie </em>presumed, and every intendment in its favor will be made unless its unconstitutionality appears beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Ingraham v. Champion Intern. </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 42, 47, 793 P.2d 769, 772. Mathis simply has not overcome his burden on appeal to establish the unconstitutionality of \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, beyond a reasonable doubt. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the above caveat placed upon local entities sufficiently limits the entities\u2019 discretion such that the prescription does not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The District Court did not err in rejecting Mathis\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b622 As an aside, Mathis contends that, regardless of our holding with respect to an administrative agency, <em>Ingraham </em>prohibits legislative delegation to a private party. In <em>Ingraham, </em>we noted that the Legislature delegated \u201cabsolute discretion\u201d to a private party. We observed that, if the Legislature had delegated legislative authority to an administrative agency, it would have had to prescribe standards and guides for the grant of that power. In <em>Ingraham, </em>however, the Legislature provided no guidance when it delegated to a private entity. While we concluded that the Legislature could not do this, we did not preclude the delegation based on the entity\u2019s status as a private party-we did so based on the delegation of \u201cabsolute discretion.\u201d Consequently, <em>Ingraham </em>simply concludes that when delegating legislative authority to a private party, the Legislature cannot ignore the limitations required of it when delegating to an administrative agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u00b623 Did the District Court err when it denied Mathis\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, based on insufficiency of the evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\u00b624  When the evidence in a criminal case is insufficient to support a guilty verdict, the court may, either on its own motion or on motion of the defendant, dismiss the action and discharge the defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Section 46-16-403, MCA. A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict if reasonable persons could not conclude from the evidence, taken in a light most favorable to the prosecution, that guilt was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Billedeaux, </em>\u00b6 8. Therefore, a directed verdict of acquittal is appropriate only when there is no evidence to support a guilty verdict. <em>Billedeaux, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b625 The parties agree that the State had to prove, among other things, that the DOT and private parties complied with the provisions of \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, to obtain a conviction for speeding in a construction zone. Mathis contends that the State failed to prove the requisite compliance beyond a reasonable doubt. First, Mathis states that a private party, not the DOT or local authority, established the relevant speed limits in violation of \u00a7 61-8-314(3), MCA. Second, Mathis notes that \u00a7 61-8-314(4), MCA, requires the posting of signs to indicate the boundaries of a construction zone. Mathis maintains that the parties failed to post signs indicating the commencement of a construction zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b626 As indicated above, \u00a7 61-8-314(3), MCA, provides that \u201c[t]he speed limit in a construction zone or in a work zone must be set by the department of transportation or the local authority based on traffic conditions or the condition of the construction, repair, maintenance, or survey project.\u201d Mathis insists that this provision grants authority to establish speed limits exclusively to the DOT or local authority, not to a private entity as occurred here. However, \u00a7 61-8-314(4)(a), MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">If the department of transportation, the local authority, the utility company, or the private contractor determines, based on traffic conditions or the condition of the construction, repair, maintenance, or survey project, that special speed limits in work zones or construction zones are warranted, then the department, the local authority, the utility company, or the private contractor shall post signs ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\u00b627 A statute must be read and considered in its entirety and the legislative intent may not be determined from the wording of any particular section or sentence, but only from a consideration of the whole. <em>State ex rel. Cashmore v. Anderson </em>(1972), 160 Mont. 175, 184, 500 P.2d 921, 926-27. Stated another way, we will read and construe a statute as a whole to give effect to a statute\u2019s purpose and avoid an absurd result. <em>S.L.H. v. State Compensation Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>2000 MT 362, \u00b6 17, 303 Mont. 364, \u00b6 17, 15 P.3d 948, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">\u00b628 Above, we recognized the Legislature\u2019s implicit concern for safety embodied in \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA. To this end, the Legislature delegated the requisite authority to the most informed parties. While \u00a7 61-8-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>314(3), MCA, contemplates the establishment of speed limits by the DOT or local authority, \u00a7 61-8-314(4), MCA, incorporates private entities\u2019 specialized judgment. To interpret \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, so narrowly as to limit the task solely to the DOT and local authority, would render \u00a7 61-8-314(4), MCA, meaningless and propagate an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b629  Further, there is substantial evidence in the record to establish that the private parties undertook the requisite action pursuant to a contract with the DOT. Shawn Hollenback, operations manager for Alpine Construction, Inc., testified that the DOT provides independent contractors with various traffic regulation plans, plans which the DOT develops, for construction and work zones. Hollenback testified that the DOT instructs the independent contractors to implement the plan which best \u201cfits the situation.\u201d Hollenback testified that the independent contractors selected the DOT signing plan, a plan which provides for speed limit reductions, which applied to the area in question. For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the District Court did not err when it denied Mathis\u2019s motion for a directed verdict with regard to \u00a7 61-8-314(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b630 Next, Mathis contends that the State failed to show that the DOT and/or private parties strictly complied with the requirements of \u00a7 61-8-314(4), MCA. Section 61-8-314(4), MCA, provides that if it is determined that special speed limits in construction or work zones are warranted, the determining entity must post signs that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">(i) conform to the department of transportation\u2019s manual on uniform traffic control devices;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">(ii) indicate the boundaries of the construction zone and the work zone; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">(iii) display the speed limit in effect within both zones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">\u00b631 At trial, Dan Bisom, supervisor of the traffic data collection section of the DOT, testified that the DOT notified ECM that they had to comply with the guidelines in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (\u201cMUTCD\u201d) to insure workers\u2019 safety. In fact, the employment contract entered into evidence as executed by DOT and ECM provides that \u201c[a]ll traffic control must be done in accordance with the MUTCD....\u201d Bisom testified that his maintenance department would notify him if the signs failed to comply with DOT guidelines. Bisom further testified that nobody notified him of any problems with the signs at the area in question. Additionally, Hollenback testified that the signing plan utilized in the area in question conformed to the MUTCD.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">\u00b632 Mathis argues that the parties failed to comply with \u00a7 61-8-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>314(4)(ii), MCA, because they did not post a sign indicating the boundaries of the construction zone. Mathis suggests that a sign stating \u201cconstruction zone begins here,\u201d or something of that nature, must be displayed to comply with \u00a7 61-8-314(4)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b633 Mathis offers no authority in support of his position. It is important to point out that Mathis was charged with speeding in a construction zone, not speeding in a work zone. The Legislature has expressly defined the two zones differently and has provided for separate penalties for violations which occur within each zone. As for notification of the commencement of a construction zone, \u00a7 61-8-314(4)(ii), MCA, simply provides that the entity shall post signs that \u201cindicate the boundaries of the construction zone.\u201d Section 61-8-314(4)(ii), MCA, does not require that this indication come in the form of a \u201cconstruction zone begins here\u201d sign. The District Court acknowledged this fact upon consideration of Mathis\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. It denied Mathis\u2019s motion, in part, based on its conclusion that whether signing \u201cindicates the boundaries of the construction zone\u201d is a determination of fact, subject to the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b634 As for what the jury had to consider on the issue, Hollenback testified about the signs erected in the construction area. Hollenback testified that a lane closure sign indicated the closing of the right lane one mile prior to the lane closure. Two thousand feet beyond that, a sign indicated a right lane closure in one-half mile. Nine hundred feet later, the parties posted a \u201cReduced Speed Ahead\u201d sign. Three hundred and thirty feet beyond that, a \u201cFines Double in Work Zones\u201d sign was displayed. A sixty-five mile per hour speed limit sign was posted three hundred and thirty feet beyond the \u201cFines Double\u201d sign. Three hundred and thirty feet later, the parties posted an arrow board directing traffic to the appropriate lane. From there, signs incrementally reflected a reduction in speed to fifty-five, forty-five, and thirty-five. As drivers exited the construction area, they passed two additional directives, an \u201cEnd of Work Zone\u201d sign and a \u201cResume Speed\u201d sign. Mathis did not call any witnesses on his behalf. Instead, Mathis challenged the State\u2019s witnesses on cross-examination and then moved for a directed verdict at the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"A6e\">\u00b635  Based on the foregoing, we hold that reasonable persons could conclude from the evidence, taken in a light most favorable to the prosecution, that the State proved the elements of the offense, including compliance with \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, Mathis was not entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal and the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b636 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b413-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"A3e\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"A9Ve\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b637 I dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, does not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority to an administrative agency or private party.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u00b638 Mathis argues that this statute unconstitutionally delegates a law-making function to an administrative agency and also to a private party. He argues that, although the legislature may delegate \u201cministerial functions,\u201d it cannot delegate \u201claw-making functions.\u201d Setting speed limits, he asserts, is a law-making function. Additionally, he argues that even when delegating ministerial functions, the legislature must provide standards and guidelines, and in this case, the statute gives the DOT \u201cunbridled discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\u00b639 The State argues that the statute lays out an \u201cimplicit but clear,\u201d policy rationale of protecting highway workers\u2019 safety. It argues that the parameters of the statute are clear; the entity setting the speed limit must base it on \u201ctraffic conditions or the condition of the construction, repair, maintenance, or survey project.\u201d The State asserts that each construction project in Montana provides a unique set of conditions and the legislature desired to \u201callow those closest to the project to limit the risk to highway workers by reducing the speed limit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">\u00b640 The District Court concluded that \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, was constitutional in that it set forth, with reasonable clarity, the limitations on the DOT\u2019s discretion in setting speed limits in construction and work zones and did not delegate the establishment of a crime to either the DOT or private contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">\u00b641 Article III, Section 1, of the Montana Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\">Separation of powers. The power of the government of this state is divided into three distinct branches-legislative, executive, and judicial. No person or persons charged with the exercise of power properly belonging to one branch shall exercise any power properly belonging to either of the others, except as in this constitution expressly directed or permitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">\u00b642 The legislature may constitutionally delegate its legislative functions to an administrative agency, but it must provide, with reasonable clarity, limitations upon the agency\u2019s discretion and provide the agency with policy guidance. <em>In re Petition to Transfer Territory, </em>2000 MT 342, \u00b6 13, 303 Mont. 204, \u00b6 13, 15 P.3d 447, \u00b6 13. A statute is complete and validly delegates administrative authority when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>nothing with respect to a determination of what is the law is left to the administrative agency, and its provisions are sufficiently clear, definite, and certain to enable the agency to know its rights and obligations. <em>White v. State </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 81, 88, 759 P.2d 971, 975 (quoting <em>Huber v. Groff </em>(1976), 171 Mont. 442, 457, 558 P.2d 1124, 1132).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\u00b643 We have previously held that the authority to set speed limits is legislative in nature. <em>Lee v. State </em>(1981), 195 Mont. 1, 8, 635 P.2d 1282, 1286 (\u201c[t]he authority conveyed upon the attorney general [to set speed limits in accordance with federal requirements] is clearly an impermissible delegation of legislative authority\u201d). <em>See also State v. Stanko, </em>1998 MT 321, \u00b6 28, 292 Mont. 192, \u00b6 28, 974 P.2d 1132, \u00b6 28 (Montana\u2019s \u201cbasic rule\u201d statute \u201cimpermissibly delegates the basic public policy of how fast is too fast on Montana\u2019s highways to \u2018policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u00b644 In <em>Lee, </em>the statute at issue <em>required </em>the attorney general to \u201cdeclare by proclamation,\u201d the speed limit \u201cwhenever the establishment of such a speed limit by the state is required by federal law as a condition to the state\u2019s continuing eligibility to receive [federal highway] funds.\u201d Section 61-8-304, MCA (1979). We concluded that the statute was a \u201cblatant handover of the sovereign power of this state to the federal jurisdiction,\u201d based on the mandatory nature of the statute. <em>Lee, </em>195 Mont. at 9, 635 P.2d at 1286. The attorney general had no discretion nor any factors to consider in setting the speed limit. The statute simply required that the attorney general set the speed limit to whatever was mandated by federal law. We noted that in other states where similar legislation was upheld, \u201ceither the legislature pegged the speed limit, or the power granted to a state official or body to adopt speed limits was couched in permissive instead of mandatory terms.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>195 Mont. at 9, 635 P.2d at 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b645 Section 61-8-314(3), MCA, requires the DOT or a local authority to set the speed limit \u201cbased on traffic conditions or the condition of the construction, repair, maintenance, or survey project.\u201d It does not suffer from the same mandatory requirement held unconstitutional in <em>Lee. </em>The statute lays out factors for the DOT or local authority to consider. The question remains whether these factors are \u201csufficiently clear, definite, and certain to enable the agency to know its rights and obligations.\u201d <em>White, </em>233 Mont. at 88, 759 P.2d at 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u00b646 In <em>Douglas v. Judge </em>(1977), 174 Mont. 32, 39, 568 P.2d 530, 534, we held a statute unconstitutional which authorized the Board of Natural Resources and Conservation to make loans to farmers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>ranchers \u201cfor any worthwhile project ...\u201d There, the statute clearly gave uncontrolled discretion to the Board to make loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b647 In <em>White, </em>the legislation at issue, House Bill 700, enacted in 1987, expanded the powers of the Montana Science and Technology Development Board (the Board) by providing the Board with bonding authority to raise money for certain types of \u201ctechnology investments,\u201d and to then invest a percentage of the funds raised in certified Montana capital companies that make technology investments. <em>White, </em>233 Mont. at 83-84,759 P.2d at 972. The plaintiffs argued that HB 700 granted the Board too much discretion because there were no standards or rules from the legislature to guide the Board in making technology investments. <em>White, </em>233 Mont. at 87-88, 759 P.2d at 975.</p>\n<p id=\"A9v\">\u00b648 This Court contrasted HB 700 with the legislation which was held constitutional in <em>Huber. </em>In <em>Huber, </em>the plaintiff asserted that the legislature was too vague in defining \u201cpersons and families of lower income,\u201d when granting the power to assist those persons in obtaining housing. This Court held that the statutory definition provided an objective standard for the Board to follow when exercising its power. \u201cThe size of the family, total income available for housing, availability and cost of housing and ability to enter the housing market at the \u2018going rate\u2019 were all objective criteria requiring only observation and arithmetical calculation.\u201d <em>White, </em>233 Mont. at 89, 759 P.2d at 976. In contrast, HB 700 did not \u201crise to the level of the objective criteria offered in Huber.\u201d <em>White, </em>233 Mont. at 90, 759 P.2d at 976. The statute stated that technology investments be made \u201cupon favorable determination by the board\u201d of such factors as the relevance of the proposed project to the purposes of the statute, the prospects for collaboration between public and private sectors, the prospects for achieving commercial success, the quality of the specific product and methodology proposed and the availability of matching funds. The Court concluded that these factors \u201care more akin to general policy considerations underlying the entire technology investment program.\u201d <em>White, </em>233 Mont. at 90, 759 P.2d at 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u00b649 In 1990, we concluded that a section of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act which required a claimant and insurer to agree to convert benefits into a lump sum before application for lump sum conversion could be made was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. <em>Ingraham v. Champion International </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 42, 793 P.2d 769. We noted that the legislature could \u201cdeny completely any authority to an insurer, a worker, or the department to apply for or to allow lump-sum conversion of workers\u2019 benefits.\u201d Instead, the legislation delegated an \u201cabsolute discretion to the insurer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>(with whom a worker agrees) as to whether a lump-sum conversion of ... benefits will be converted.\u201d We stated that, \u201c[h]ad the legislature conferred the authority solely upon the administrative agency, the legislature would have been required to lay down the policy or reasons behind the statute and to prescribe standards and guides for the grant of the power to the agency.\u201d <em>Ingraham, </em>243 Mont. at 48, 793 P.2d at 772. We concluded that \u201c[t]he power of the legislature to prescribe the amounts, time and manner of payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, which as we said at the outset of this paragraph is not doubted, has been delegated in subdivision (2), \u00a7 39-71-741, MCA, to others. This the legislature may not do.\u201d <em>Ingraham, </em>243 Mont. at 48, 793 P.2d at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b650 Here, the standards and guides set out in the statute are more like the general policy standards in <em>White. </em>The traffic conditions and the condition of the construction, repair, maintenance, or survey project are not objective criteria \u201crequiring only observation and arithmetical calculation.\u201d Individuals assessing these criteria could easily come up with differing opinions on the appropriate speed limit, resulting in an <em>\u201cad hoc </em>and subjective basis\u201d for setting speed limits in construction zones. These standards are too broad and result in an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u00b651 Additionally, the statute unconstitutionally delegates legislative authority to a private party. Although subsection (3) states that the speed limit \u201cmust be set\u201d by the DOT, subsection (4) goes on to state that the DOT, \u201cthe local authority, <em>the utility company, or the private contractor,\u201d </em>may determine that special speed limits are warranted in a work or construction zone. If one of the entities listed determines that special speed limits are warranted, the statute then mandates that the entity post signs that conform to specific requirements. This grants the utility company and/or the private contractor the power to set the speed limit in the work or construction zone and is, consequently, an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</p>\n<p id=\"AnHq\">\u00b652 The State argues that \u201cthe instances are manifold of delegations of legislative authority to private entities for important governmental functions,\u201d and cites \u00a7 53-30-601, MCA, for support. Section 53-30-601, MCA, declares the policy rationale that recognizes the benefits of confining convicted persons in private correctional facilities. Granting authority to private entities to house prisoners who have already been convicted in a court of law of crimes enacted by the legislature is far different than granting authority to a private party to set a speed limit which may result in criminal charges. The first is a ministerial function, while the second is a law-making function. As we said in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>Ingraham, </em>\u201c[t]his the legislature may not do.\u201d <em>Ingraham, </em>243 Mont. at 48, 793 P.2d at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b653 Consequently, because subsections (3) and (4) of \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, contain an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority, I would conclude that \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, as a whole is unconstitutional.</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-5\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the dissent of JUSTICE LEAPHART.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"ACe\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AZO\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\u00b654 I join Justice Leaphart\u2019s dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, does not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority to an administrative agency. I differ only with his conclusion in \u00b6 51 that subsection (4) of that statute grants a private contractor the authority to \u201cset the speed limit in the work or construction zone.\u201d For reasons set forth below, I conclude that the statute delegates that authority only to the Department of Transportation or a local governmental authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u00b655 I also dissent with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the District Court did not error when it denied the Defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict based on insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">\u00b656 The parties agree, and the majority correctly concludes, \u201cthat the state had to prove, among other things, that the DOT and private parties complied with the provisions of \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, to obtain a conviction for speeding in a construction zone.\u201d \u00b6 25. However, the majority then ignores the most basic rule of statutory construction by ignoring the expressed language of the statute and omitting the obligations that have been inserted. See \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">\u00b657 Section 61-8-314(3), MCA, states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">The speed limit in a construction zone or in a work zone <em>must be set by the Department of Transportation or the local authority </em>based on traffic conditions or the condition of the construction, repair, maintenance or survey project.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">\u00b658 Subparagraph (4)(a) allows a contractor to \u201cpost signs\u201d but provides no authority for the contractor to set the speed limit. Nor is that authority provided in any other part of \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA. The statute reserves that authority to the Department of Transportation or \u201cthe local authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">\u00b659 Here, the State failed to offer evidence that the Department of Transportation set the speed limit. In fact, the only evidence offered suggests that it did not do so. The State\u2019s principle witness, its supervisor of traffic data collection, testified that he had no knowledge of the DOT establishing any speed limit at the point in question and documents submitted as exhibits suggest that the private contractor in fact established a speed limit different than that recommended by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>the Department of Transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\u00b660 Section 61-8-314(4)(ii), MCA, requires that the signs which are posted in a construction zone \u201cindicate the boundaries of the construction zone....\u201d The signs posted in this construction zone did not do so. The majority goes to great lengths in \u00b6 34 of its Opinion to indicate all of the signs posted prior to and after the construction zone. However, strikingly absent is any reference to signs which indicated the boundaries of the construction zone. The Department of Transportation and its contractor simply did not comply with that requirement of \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u00b661 Finally, \u00a7 61-8-314(4)(iii), MCA, requires the DOT or its contractor to \u201cdisplay the speed limit in effect within [the construction zone].\u201d Also conspicuous by its absence is any reference in \u00b6 34 of the majority Opinion to speed limit signs located within the construction zone. Based on the record before us, there were none.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\u00b662 The majority criticizes the Defendant, James Mathis, for not offering authority in support of his argument that the State Department of Transportation failed to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA. However, the plain language of the statute speaks for itself. No further authority is necessary. Based on the undisputed facts and the plain language of the statute, the Department of Transportation and its contractor failed to comply with its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\u00b663 For the reasons set forth in Justice Leaphart\u2019s Opinion, with the noted exception, I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority to an administrative agency. For the reasons set forth in this Opinion, I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that the State proved that the DOT and its contractor complied with the provisions of \u00a7 61-8-314, MCA, and that it, therefore, proved the necessary elements of its charge against the Defendant, James Mathis.</p>\n<judges id=\"b418-8\">JUSTICE NELSON joins \u00b6\u00b6 55 through 62 of the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
