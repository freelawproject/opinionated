Saxton filed motions to suppress evidence recovered during a warrantless search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>of her home and statements made by her to a police officer. The District Court denied those motions. Saxton pled guilty to one count of criminal production of dangerous drugs. She appeals the District Court\u2019s orders denying her motions to suppress evidence. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it denied Saxton\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained through a warrantless search of her home?</p>\n<p id=\"Ai8\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it denied Saxton\u2019s motion to suppress evidence based on the State\u2019s failure to preserve or promptly provide audio recordings from her 911 call to the police and a police officer\u2019s \u201cbelt recording\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err when it denied Saxton\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of her conversations with a police officer?</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A51\">\u00b66 On March 14, 2000, Shirley Saxton was at her home in Rexford, Montana, with her boyfriend Ted Wilson, when Saxton\u2019s adult son, Tommy Arms, entered her home. Arms, who was intoxicated and belligerent, yelled at Saxton and at some point hit her in the stomach with a coffee cup, causing her to lose consciousness. Arms then fought with Wilson. While they fought, Saxton regained consciousness, fled her mobile home, and went next door to her daughter\u2019s (Teresa Cantu\u2019s) mobile home and called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">\u00b67 Saxton told the 911 dispatcher, Judy Romeo, that her son was \u201cdrunk and violent, and he was hurting people and throwing things\u201d in her trailer. She told Romeo that she was at her daughter\u2019s house and was not going to return home, but that she feared that Arms would find her at Cantu\u2019s home and try to hurt her so she needed to leave. Romeo asked Saxton for the address, but Saxton could not recall the address. Saxton told Romeo that she had to go and hung up.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">\u00b68 Romeo contacted Matt Neuman, a sheriff for Lincoln County who was off-duty at the time, and requested that he respond to the call. She described the circumstances as an \u201curgent domestic situation.\u201d Neuman agreed to respond and picked up James Handy, a Eureka city police officer, to assist in the response. Meanwhile, Romeo called Cantu\u2019s number to obtain better directions to Cantu\u2019s house, and spoke with Cantu, who gave additional directions that were forwarded to Neuman.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">\u00b69 After calling 911, Saxton left Cantu\u2019s trailer and hid behind her trailer. Cheryl Gillard, Saxton\u2019s neighbor, found Saxton in her backyard and took Saxton back into her house to get Wilson. The three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>then went to the Frontier Bar, which was about 75 feet from Saxton\u2019s trailer. As Saxton went to the Frontier Bar, she heard a crashing noise at her trailer and heard Arms yell \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d Saxton hid in the Frontier Bar\u2019s bathroom until police arrived at her trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b610 Neuman and Handy traveled with their emergency lights activated from Eureka to the Rexford trailer park. Neuman parked in Cantu\u2019s driveway and approached Cantu\u2019s home where he met a young male who directed Neuman to Saxton\u2019s nearby home. Neuman knocked on Saxton\u2019s door, and yelled \u201chello\u201d several times. There was no answer. Neuman knocked on the door again, and a part of the window, which was recently broken, fell to the ground. Neuman then opened Saxton\u2019s door and entered the home. Neuman and Handy performed an armed \u201cquick sweep through the house,\u201d going door-to-door through the trailer to see if anyone was inside. Inside one of the doors, Neuman immediately recognized a \u201cmarijuana grow,\u201d including a low-hanging fluorescent light fixture and several potted plants. Neuman and Handy continued through the remainder of the house and then exited Saxton\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b611 Outside the house, the officers met Gillard, who had left the Frontier Bar to talk to the officers, and asked her to bring Saxton back to her trailer. Gillard left and returned with Saxton a few minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u00b612 Neuman spoke with Saxton regarding the assault. Saxton described the assault and her injuries, after which Neuman asked Saxton if she would like to leave to get medical attention for her injuries. Saxton declined, stating that she could not afford an ambulance. Neuman asked Saxton if she would be willing to have a friend take her to the hospital, but Saxton also declined that offer.</p>\n<p id=\"AmD\">\u00b613 At some point in their conversation, Neuman asked Saxton who owned the marijuana plants inside her trailer. Saxton initially told Neuman that the marijuana was Arms\u2019. However, a short time later Saxton admitted that the marijuana was hers and stated that she was growing it for medicinal and research purposes. Neuman asked Saxton if she had a permit to grow the marijuana and she said she did not. After his discussion with Saxton, Neuman obtained a search warrant for Saxton\u2019s home, and the police seized evidence from the \u201cmarijuana grow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">\u00b614 About 10 days after the seizure of evidence, Saxton called Neuman to discuss the pending case against her, and Saxton made additional incriminating statements regarding her ownership of the seized plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">\u00b615 On March 31, 2000, the State charged Saxton with criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>production of dangerous drugs, criminal possession of dangerous drugs, and criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. On May 30, 2000, Saxton moved to suppress evidence obtained from Neuman\u2019s warrantless search of her home, contending that Neuman should have obtained a search warrant prior to entering her home. The District Court held an evidentiary hearing to consider Saxton\u2019s motion to suppress on October 5, 2000, where Neuman disclosed for the first time that he had a \u201cbelt recording\u201d of his response to Saxton\u2019s house. Neuman testified that he had previously listened to the tape, and discovered that the recording was mostly unintelligible, and had set the tape aside and had forgotten about it until he was summoned to appear at the suppression hearing. The parties also established, at the hearing, that the 911 dispatch center did not record Saxton\u2019s phone call to 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b616 Asa result of the hearing, Saxton filed another motion to suppress on the grounds that the State failed to preserve and provide exculpatory evidence. The District Court later denied both of these motions, and ordered that a copy of Neuman\u2019s \u201cbelt recording\u201d be produced for additional audio enhancement to determine whether there was additional useful evidence for Saxton\u2019s defense. After obtaining the enhanced \u201cbelt recording,\u201d Saxton filed a motion to suppress her statements to Neuman. The District Court eventually denied all of Saxton\u2019s motions to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b617 Saxton entered into a plea agreement with the State and agreed to plead guilty to one count of criminal production of dangerous drugs. The agreement provided that Saxton could appeal the District Court\u2019s rulings on her motions to suppress evidence. Saxton pled guilty to the one count and the District Court sentenced her to a three-year suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u00b618 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Bassett, </em>1999 MT 109, \u00b6 17, 294 Mont. 327, \u00b6 17, 982 P.2d 410, \u00b6 17; <em>State v. Kaufman, </em>2002 MT 294, \u00b6 12, 313 Mont. 1, \u00b6 12, 59 P.3d 1166, \u00b6 12. Findings of fact are clearly erroneous where they are not supported by substantial evidence, where the court misapprehends the effect of the evidence, or where this Court\u2019s consideration of the record results in a firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>State v. Jarman, </em>1998 MT 277, \u00b6 8, 291 Mont. 391, \u00b6 8, 967 P.2d 1099, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u00b619 Whether the factual circumstances determined by the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Court constitute \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d is a conclusion of law that we will review for correctness. <em>Bassett, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>State v. McBride, </em>1999 MT 127, \u00b6 11, 294 Mont. 461, \u00b6 11, 982 P.2d 453, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b620 We review a district court\u2019s orders regarding evidentiary matters and motions to exclude evidence for alleged discovery violations for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Duffy, </em>2000 MT 186, \u00b6 18, 300 Mont. 381, \u00b6 18, 6 P.3d 453, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AcH\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u00b621 Did the District Court err when it denied Saxton\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained through a warrantless search of her home?</p>\n<p id=\"AObb\">\u00b622 In its order denying Saxton\u2019s motion to suppress' evidence obtained as a result of Neuman\u2019s warrantless search of her home, the District Court concluded that exigent circumstances existed to justify Neuman\u2019s entry. It found that Neuman was responding to a \u201cfrantic call from Saxton that her son \u2018was drunk and throwing [things] around and hitting people,\u201d\u2019 and that Neuman was dispatched to investigate the alleged assault and protect potential victims from further assault. The District Court concluded that it was reasonable, when Neuman had not located Arms or Saxton, and heard no answer from inside Saxton\u2019s trailer after knocks and calls from outside Saxton\u2019s door, to enter Saxton\u2019s trailer to protect the lives of possible victims inside. The District Court also relied upon \u00a7 46-6-311(2), MCA, which provides that domestic violence calls constitute an exigent circumstance for making an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u00b623 Saxton contends that the District Court erred when it concluded that there were exigent circumstances because Saxton\u2019s testimony showed that she had told Romeo, the 911 dispatcher, that she was not at her trailer when she called and that she would not be returning to her trailer. Saxton contends that if Neuman was aware of that statement, and heard no evidence of domestic violence after arriving at her home, there were no exigent circumstances which justified his warrantless entry into her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">\u00b624 The State points out that Saxton\u2019s own testimony at the suppression hearing was that she had told Romeo that Arms was hitting other people, i.e., other victims, and that Neuman\u2019s entry into Saxton\u2019s home was necessary for the possible discovery and protection of unconscious or helpless victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">\u00b625  We have recognized that the United States and Montana Constitutions protect persons from unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>State v. Wakeford, </em>1998 MT 16, \u00b6 21, 287 Mont. 220, \u00b6 21, 953 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>P.2d 1065, \u00b6 21 (citing U.S. CONST, amend. IV; Art. II, Sec. 11, Mont. CONST.). We have also recognized the rule that warrantless searches conducted inside a person\u2019s home are <em>per se </em>unreasonable, with few exceptions to that rule. <em>Wakeford, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b626  There is an exception to the warrant requirement where an officer concludes that there are \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d and \u201cprobable cause\u201d to justify a warrantless search. <em>Wakeford, </em>\u00b6 22. We have previously adopted the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 definition of \u201cexigent circumstances,\u201d which is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">[T]hose circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to believe that entry (or other relevant prompt action) was necessary . to prevent physical harm to the officers or other persons, the destruction of relevant evidence, the escape of the suspect, or some other consequence improperly frustrating legitimate law enforcement efforts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\"><em>Wakeford, </em>\u00b6 24 (quoting <em>United States v. McConney </em>(9th Cir. 1984), 728 F.2d 1195, 1199). We have also previously stated that \u201cprobable cause exists \u2018if the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s personal knowledge, or imparted to the officer by a reliable source, are sufficient to warrant a reasonable person to believe that the suspect has committed an offense.\u2019\u201d <em>Wakeford, </em>\u00b6 22 (quoting <em>State v. Schoffner </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 260, 264, 811 P.2d 548, 551).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u00b627  Based on the facts in this case, we agree that there were exigent circumstances and probable cause that justified Neuman\u2019s warrantless entry into Saxton\u2019s trailer. The testimony clearly established that Saxton had reported that Arms had assaulted her and others in Saxton\u2019s trailer. Although Saxton had called 911 from Cantu\u2019s trailer, and had apparently told Romeo that she would not be at her home, when Neuman responded, he could not locate Saxton or Arms, and was directed to Saxton\u2019s trailer, the place where the reported assault(s) occurred. It was reasonable for Neuman to conclude, when knocking on Saxton\u2019s trailer door and hearing no response, that it was necessary to enter her home to discover and protect Saxton or other potentially incapacitated victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\u00b628  We conclude that the District Court did not err when it denied Saxton\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of Neuman\u2019s warrantless entry into her trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">\u00b629 Did the District Court err when it denied Saxton\u2019s motion to suppress evidence based on the State\u2019s failure to preserve or promptly provide audio recordings from her 911 call to the police and a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>officer\u2019s \u201cbelt recording\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b630 The District Court decided that it would not suppress or exclude evidence on account of the State\u2019s failure to record Saxton\u2019s 911 call or Neuman\u2019s failure to disclose that he had a \u201cbelt recording\u201d until the suppression hearing. The District Court found that there was no evidence to suggest that the failure to record Saxton\u2019s 911 phone call was deliberate, or that Neuman\u2019s failure to produce the \u201cbelt recording\u201d was a deliberate attempt to frustrate Saxton\u2019s defense because the tape itself was unintelligible, as Neuman had testified. The District Court permitted Saxton the opportunity to review and enhance Neuman\u2019s \u201cbelt recording,\u201d but the enhanced recording provided little additional evidence helpful to Saxton\u2019s defense. Lastly, the District Court concluded that there would be little evidentiary value provided by the 911 phone call recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b631 Saxton contends that the District Court abused its discretion when it refused to suppress evidence on the grounds that the State failed to preserve evidence helpful to her defense and Neuman\u2019s late disclosure that he had a \u201cbelt recording\u201d of his response to Saxton\u2019s trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u00b632  We have previously held that a defendant has a constitutional right to obtain exculpatory evidence, and that the State must not interfere with that right. <em>State v. Sadowski </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 63, 79, 805 P.2d 537, 546. However, we have also stated that \u201cpolice officers are not required to take initiative or even assist the defendant with procuring [exculpatory] evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Belgarde, </em>1998 MT 152, \u00b6 16, 289 Mont. 287, \u00b6 16, 962 P.2d 571, \u00b6 16. Police officers have no affirmative duty to collect exculpatory evidence, but they \u201cmay not frustrate or hamper an accused\u2019s right to obtain exculpatory evidence.\u201d <em>Belgarde, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>State, City of Bozeman v. Heth </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 268, 272, 750 P.2d 103, 105). We declared in <em>Heth </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">Only a deliberate or intentional suppression of exculpatory evidence is a per se violation of due process. To amount to a denial of due process, negligently suppressed evidence must be vital to the defense. It must be more than a mere suppression, in that the defense must show the evidence was material and of substantial use. Finally, the evidence must be exculpatory meaning it \u201c[w]ould have tended to clear the accused of guilt, to vitiate a conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-8\"><em>State v. Heth </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 268, 272, 750 P.2d 103, 105 (quoting <em>State v. Patterson </em>(1983), 203 Mont. 509, 512-13, 662 P.2d 291, 293). To establish materiality, the evidence \u201cmust both possess an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and be of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\u201d <em>California v. Trombetta </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 479, 489, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 2534, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (quoted in State <em>v. Halter </em>(1989), 238 Mont. 408, 412, 777 P.2d 1313, 1316).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b633 We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that nothing suggests that the State deliberately or intentionally failed to record Saxton\u2019s 911 phone call or that Neuman deliberately withheld his \u201cbelt recording.\u201d In addition, there is no evidence to suggest that a recording of Saxton\u2019s 911 phone call or Neuman\u2019s \u201cbelt recording\u201d were \u201cvital\u201d evidence for Saxton\u2019s defense. We have previously concluded that Neuman\u2019s belief that other potential victims could be in Saxton\u2019s trailer was sufficient to justify his entry into her trailer and Saxton confirmed that she made that report during her 911 call to the police. In addition, Neuman\u2019s \u201cbelt recording,\u201d which Saxton had the opportunity to enhance and examine, has provided no additional evidence to dispel a finding that there were exigent circumstances and probable cause to justify Neuman\u2019s warrantless entry into her home.</p>\n<p id=\"AUL\">\u00b634  Since none of the evidence was material to Saxton\u2019s defense and there was no deliberate suppression of evidence, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Saxton\u2019s second motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\u00b635 Did the District Court err when it denied Saxton\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of her conversations with a police officer?</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u00b636 The District Court concluded that it would not suppress Saxton\u2019s statements to Neuman because it found that Saxton\u2019s statements were given voluntarily and without any coercion by Neuman.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">\u00b637 Saxton\u2019s lone contention on appeal is that her statements to Neuman were not voluntary because Neuman had restricted her freedom by not permitting her to enter her home without him, and that her conversation with Neuman was therefore a \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d such that Neuman should have given her the warnings required by <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. The State contends that Neuman repeatedly told Saxton that she was free to leave with a friend to seek medical treatment, that she was never placed under arrest or any other physical restraint, and that the statements Saxton made were volunteered during the course of his investigation of her 911 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">\u00b638 We have held that the State may not used confessions or admissions obtained through \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d without proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>Miranda </em>warnings being given. <em>State v. Rushton </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 248, 255, 870 P.2d 1355, 1359. The United States Supreme Court has defined \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d as \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612. When we determine whether a defendant was subject to a \u201ccustodial interrogation,\u201d we will decide, considering the totality of the circumstances, whether \u201ca \u2018reasonable person\u2019 would not feel free to leave, after considering such factors as the time and place of interrogation, the length and mood of interrogation, and persons present during the questioning.\u201d <em>Rushton, </em>264 Mont. at 256, 870 P.2d at 1360 (citations omitted); <em>see State v. Scarborough, </em>2000 MT 301, \u00b6 31, 302 Mont. 350, \u00b6 31, 14 P.3d 1202, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b639  We conclude that, after reviewing the totality of the circumstances, Neuman\u2019s conversation with Saxton was not a \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d The evidence demonstrates that Neuman was talking to Saxton as a result of her 911 call and report that Arms had assaulted her. Neuman had told Saxton that she was free to leave to seek medical attention for her injuries. Neuman did not physically restrain Saxton in any way. Finally, Saxton volunteered that she owned the marijuana and grew it for medicinal purposes without any direct questioning from Neuman, following her earlier denial that she owned the marijuana when Neuman specifically asked her who the marijuana belonged to. This evidence supports the conclusion that a reasonable person would have felt free to leave during Neuman\u2019s questioning and that it was not a \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d within the contemplation of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b640 Similarly, Saxton\u2019s telephonic statements to Neuman 10 days after Neuman\u2019s dispatch to her trailer are also admissible. In this instance, Saxton initiated the contact with Neuman by calling him to discuss Neuman\u2019s investigation of the matter, and her statements were clearly not obtained as a result of any physical restraint or \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u00b641  Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it denied Saxton\u2019s motion to suppress statements she made to Neuman.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\u00b642 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b348-8\">JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON, LEAPHART and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
