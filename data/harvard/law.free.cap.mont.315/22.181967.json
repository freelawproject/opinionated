Kern was ultimately sentenced to fifteen years in the Montana State Prison, with eight years suspended. Kern does not challenge his conviction, but he does challenge the charging documents and the legality of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issues Kern presents on appeal follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-11\">1. Whether probable cause was established for the filing of the information absent allegations of touching by the defendant for the purpose of sexual gratification;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-12\">2. Whether the information charged facts sufficient to constitute the crime alleged absent allegations of touching by the defendant for the purpose of sexual gratification;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-13\">3. Whether the State followed statutory requirements in amending the information; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-14\">4. Whether Kern\u2019s sentence of fifteen years in prison with eight years suspended was correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND PRE-TRIAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b47-16\">\u00b63 In August 1997, seven-year-old J.S. and her younger brother, D.S., moved into an apartment in Billings with their mother and Kern. When J.S.\u2019s mother worked late shifts or weekends, Kern sometimes cared for the children. On a number of these occasions, Kern compelled J.S., a minor girl, to touch and rub his penis until he ejaculated. J.S. described scenarios in which Kern removed the blanket that covered the family\u2019s birdcage, draped the blanket over his lap, and placed his penis through a hole in the blanket. While he lay on the couch, with his penis exposed, Kern would order J.S. to \u201ctouch it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-17\">\u00b64 These assaults began in the fall of 1997 and continued until sometime in 1999. During this period, J.S. kept the abuse a secret, as Kern had ordered her to. Kern had warned J.S. that he would kill her mother if she revealed the secret masturbation sessions and he went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>to jail. J.S. first disclosed the abuse during a visit with her father and his family in Wyoming in 1999. At that time, she told her paternal grandmother that \u201cRusty [Kern] made me touch his wienie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b65 J.S.\u2019s grandmother relayed the allegations of sexual abuse to her son, J.S.\u2019s father. He promptly reported the allegations to law enforcement authorities in Wyoming. They began an investigation and contacted the Billings Police Department. On November 30,1999, the State of Montana filed an information against Kern, charging him with six offenses. Those offenses included: one count of felony sexual assault; three counts of felony assault; and two counts of misdemeanor child endangerment (involving J.S.\u2019s younger brother, D.S.).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b66 On March 22, 2000, the State filed its first amended affidavit and motion to amend the information. The State combined the two child endangerment charges involving J.S.\u2019s younger brother, D.S., into a single felony assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b67 The State amended the information again on June 15, 2000. This second amended information reduced the charges to a single count of felony sexual assault involving J.S. and a single count of felony assault involving D.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b68 Finally, the State filed its third and last amended information on September 26, 2000. This third amended information retained the charge of felony sexual assault involving J.S., but reduced the charge involving D.S. from felony assault to misdemeanor child endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">PRE-SENTENCE PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">\u00b69 On December 13, 2000, after a three-day trial, Kern was found guilty of sexually assaulting J.S. (Count One). He was acquitted on the child endangerment charge involving D.S. (Count Two). Subsequent to the guilty verdict, the court ordered the Department of Corrections (DOC) to prepare a Pre-sentence Investigation (PSI), including a psychological evaluation, in preparation for sentencing. Michael D. Sullivan, M.S.W., conducted the evaluation of Kern.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">\u00b610 In the PSI, Sullivan determined that Kern posed a moderate-or level 2-risk. He found that Kern was not motivated by a strong sexual attraction to children (pedophilia interests), but by the desire for power and control. Sullivan advised that the least restrictive option viable for the defendant would be out-patient sex offender treatment in a prerelease setting. He concluded that such a situation would afford the appropriate level of structure and supervision to manage the risk posed by Kern. He felt Kern would likely be successful within those parameters.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>SENTENCING</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b611 Kern\u2019s sentencing hearing was originally set for March 20, 2001. However, DOC had not yet completed Kern\u2019s PSI, so the District Court continued Kern\u2019s sentencing hearing until.March 27, 2001. On that date, Kern requested that his sentencing hearing be continued. The sentencing hearing was finally conducted on April 10, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b612 At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, at which J.S.\u2019s grandmother and Sullivan testified for the State, the District Court announced its sentence orally: Kern was committed to DOC for 15 years for placement in an appropriate institution, with eight years of the term suspended. Kern had supplied a memorandum for sentencing that included copies of affidavits, informations, and sentences of eight other defendants convicted of sexual assault in the same District Court, all of whom received lesser sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b613 At a hearing on May 22, 2001, the State made an oral motion to have the District Court clarify its sentence. The State advised the District Court that Montana law requires that any sentence specifying commitment to DOC suspend all but five years of the commitment. Section 46-18-201(3)(d)(i), MCA(1999). The State urged the District Court to convert the commitment to DOC to a commitment to the state prison, where a sentence of 15 years with eight years suspended would be legal. In contrast, Kern argued that the District Court should correct the error in its initial sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA (1999), by revising the suspended portion to include all but five years.</p>\n<p id=\"AYu\">\u00b614 The District Court held another hearing on May 29, 2001, at which the State and Kern again presented their arguments about how the District Court should correct its original sentence. The District Court concluded that it had imposed an illegal sentence and, following the State\u2019s recommendation, revised the sentence to mandate Kern\u2019s imprisonment in the state prison for a term of fifteen years with eight years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u00b615 On June 7, 2001, the District Court entered its Judgment and Commitment and Order Suspending Sentence, reflecting Kern\u2019s revised sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">\u00b616 Was probable cause established for the filing of the information absent allegations of touching by the defendant for the purpose of sexual gratification?</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">\u00b617 In determinations of probable cause, we review for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Arrington </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 1, 6-7, 858 P.2d 343, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>346 (citing <em>State Bradford </em>(1984), 210 Mont. 130, 139, 683 P.2d 924, 928-29). The evidence necessary to establish probable cause is defined by Montana case law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\">An affidavit in support of a motion to file an information need not make out a prima facie case that a defendant committed an offense. A mere probability that he committed the offense is sufficient. Similarly, evidence to establish probable cause need not be as complete as the evidence necessary to establish guilt... the determination whether a motion to file an information is supported by probable cause is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-5\"><em>Arrington, </em>260 Mont. at 6-7, 858 P.2d at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b618  The State\u2019s affidavit in support of its motion to file an information presents a sufficient case for the establishment of probable cause. As set forth in the contested affidavit, the victim, J.S., reported to law enforcement investigators that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">Defendant forced her to touch his penis on numerous occasions, starting from the time her mother moved in with Defendant and not ending until she moved away from Defendant. J.S. stated Defendant would often have her watch movies with naked men and women in them. J.S. stated that when Defendant forced her to touch him, he would make her touch him until \u2018white stuff came out of his penis. She also stated that he would cover his clothing with the birdcage cover, and place his penis through a hole that was cut in the cover. She described his penis going from soft to hard until \u2018white gooey stuff came out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">These factual allegations clearly establish probable cause that the defendant, Kern, \u201cknowingly subjected] another person to ... sexual contact without consent\u201d in violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA (1999). The District Court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the affidavit alleged facts sufficient to establish \u201ca mere probability\u2019 that Kern committed the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">\u00b619 Moreover, Kern\u2019s argument that the State failed to establish probable cause relies on a misinterpretation of the applicable law. Here, we review the District Court\u2019s conclusions <em>de novo </em>to determine whether it correctly interpreted the law. <em>State v. Steffes </em>(1994), 269 Mont. 214, 231, 887 P.2d 1196, 1206. On this point, while our analysis is different from that relied on by the District Court, our conclusion is the same and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">\u00b620 Kern argues that an affidavit to establish probable cause for sexual assault must include allegations that the <em>defendant </em>touched another and that he did so for the purpose of arousing or gratifying his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>own sexual desire or that of another party.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b621 Section 45-5-502, MCA(1999), defines the crime of sexual assault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak7\">(1) Aperson who knowingly subjects another person to any sexual contact without consent commits the offense of sexual assault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AO\">\u00b622 Section 45-2-101(66), MCA (1999), provides a statutory definition for sexual contact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">\u2018Sexual contact\u2019 means touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of the person of another, directly or through clothing, in order to knowingly or purposely: (a) cause bodily injury to or humiliate, harass, or degrade another, or (b) arouse or gratify the sexual response or desire of either party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">A. Does an affidavit to establish probable cause under \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA, require allegations that the defendant committed the touching?</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\u00b623 Kern incorrectly construes these statutes to require that the <em>defendant touch another. </em>Thus, he argues, there was no probable cause to charge him with sexual assault because he never touched J.S. Rather, he asserts, <em>the minor child touched him. </em>However, contrary to the statutory construction offered by Kern, the language of the relevant statutes does not evince any requirement that the defendant commit the touching himself. The statute clearly states that one commits the crime of sexual assault if he \u201csubjects another person to any sexual contact.\u201d Section 45-5-502, MCA. \u201cSexual contact\u201dis defined as the \u201ctouching of the sexual or other intimate parts of the person of another.\u201d Section 45-2-101(66), MCA. Nothing in the statutory language requires that the defendant commit the actual touching. Clearly, there was sexual contact between Kern and the minor child: she touched his penis and masturbated him to the point of ejaculation. She was far too young to consent to this kind of contact. Thus, Kern subjected her to this sexual contact without consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">\u00b624 While we do not believe this statute is ambiguous, we nonetheless note that this Court has previously interpreted the legislative intent behind the sexual assault provision and concluded it supports a broad statutory reading. In <em>State v. Weese </em>(1980), 189 Mont. 464, 616 P.2d 371, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">It appears to us that the policy behind our sexual assault statute is to criminalize and punish sexual or intimate impositions that do not involve penetration ... but which express a societal concern for such impositions because they provoke outrage, disgust or shame in the victim. The enhanced punishment for this offense when committed on a victim less than 16 years old by an offender 3 or more years older indicates an increased legislative concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>for child victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><em>Weese, </em>189 Mont. at 468, 616 P.2d at 373. A proper reading of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA, together with \u00a7 45-2-101(66), MCA, clearly criminalizes Kern\u2019s impositions on J.S., the minor child. Consideration of the legislative intent behind the statute only strengthens that reading. An adult male forcing a young girl to masturbate him until he ejaculates is undeniably the kind of conduct that is likely to provoke outrage, disgust or shame in the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">B. Does an affidavit to establish probable cause under \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA, require allegations that the defendant engaged in sexual contact to gratify his sexual response?</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u00b625 In addition to his assertion that probable cause for a sexual assault charge requires allegations that the defendant touched the victim, Kern argues that probable cause could not be established absent a specific factual assertion that the defendant engaged in these acts to \u201carouse or gratify the sexual response or desire of either party.\u201d Under a number of different rationales, this argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u00b626 The language concerning intent to gratify quoted above comes from \u00a7 45-2-101(66), MCA, which defines a term-\u201csexual contact\u201d-that is incorporated into \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA, the sexual assault statute under which Kern was charged. To establish probable cause that Kern committed sexual assault, the affidavit need not specifically allege the purpose of the sexual contact; this element is incorporated by reference to the statute Kern was accused of violating. <em>Steffes </em>(1994), 269 Mont. at 225, 887 P.2d at 1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\u00b627  Moreover, the State\u2019s affidavit in support of its motion to file an information presents a more than sufficient case for the establishment of probable cause. The factual allegations in the State\u2019s affidavit clearly suggest that the defendant, Kern, \u201cknowingly subjected] another person to ... sexual contact without consent\u201d in violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA. And, while the State was not required to present factual allegations demonstrating that Kern engaged in this prohibited sexual contact to \u201carouse or gratify the sexual response or desire of either party\u201d to establish probable cause, the factual scenario presented makes a compelling case that the defendant did so for this very purpose. The affidavit repeatedly refers to the minor girl being forced to rub and touch Kern\u2019s penis, and the resultant emission of \u201cwhite stuff\u2019 or \u201cwhite gooey stuff.\u201d This defendant strains credibility when he argues that the State did not demonstrate probable cause that he acted to gratify his sexual response.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b628 Did the information charge facts sufficient to constitute the crime alleged absent allegations of touching by the defendant for the purpose of sexual gratification?</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u00b629 Kern\u2019s second argument on appeal echoes the first: he contends that for an information charging sexual assault to be valid, it also must allege facts that the defendant touched another for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of either party. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b630 First, our rejection of this argument rests on the same analysis of the statute we offered above. Nothing in the language of the statute requires the State to allege that the defendant committed the touching himself. Likewise, the State need not allege that the defendant subjected J.S. to sexual contact for the purpose of gratifying his sexual response in order to satisfy the requirements of an information.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u00b631 The State\u2019s third amended information satisfies the essential elements of an information. Long ago, this Court held that an information must contain \u201ca statement of the facts constituting the offense charged in ordinary and concise language in such manner as to enable a person of common understanding to know what was intended.\u201d <em>State v. Paine </em>(1921), 61 Mont. 270, 273, 202 P. 205, 205. This Court recently reiterated that principle and added that \u201c[a]n information is sufficient if it properly charges an offense in the language of the statute defining the offense charged.\u201d <em>State v. Hardaway, </em>2001 MT 252, \u00b6 67, 307 Mont. 139, \u00b6 67, 36 P.3d 900, \u00b6 67 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u00b632 Here, the State alleged the following facts constituting the offense of sexual assault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">That the Defendant, RUSTY KERN, (d.o.b. 12-10-71), on or [sic] August of 1997 through May of 1999 did knowingly subject another person, J.S. (d.o.b. 5-10-90) to sexual contact without consent, and at a time when Defendant was three or more years older than J.S. who was under the age of fourteen; to wit: the defendant forced J.S. to touch and rub his penis ... which is a violation of Section 45-5-502.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">With the statement of facts provided in this information, a person of common understanding would be properly apprised of what was charged. Kern\u2019s ability to prepare his defense was in no way compromised. Further, the offense is charged in the language of the statute defining the charged offense, sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">\u00b633 Kern endeavors to convince this Court that the information failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>to charge facts sufficient to constitute the crime of sexual assault because it did not allege that the purpose of his contact with the victim was to \u201carouse or gratify the sexual response or desire of either party.\u201d Section 45-2-101(66), MCA. However, as we explained above, this language is part of the definition of \u201csexual contact\u201d and is incorporated by reference to the statute Kern violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b634 As we held in <em>Steffes, </em>where the defendant unsuccessfully made a nearly identical argument, the information does not have to allege that the sexual contact was for the purpose of gratifying the sexual desire of either party because \u201csexual contact\u201d is a legal term of art defined elsewhere in the code. <em>Steffes </em>(1994), 269 Mont. at 225, 887 P.2d at 1203 (relying on <em>Hamling v. United States </em>(1974), 418 U.S. 87, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (upholding the sufficiency of a charging document where the definition of the offense is a legal term of art rather than a question of fact, and the legal term of art is sufficiently definite in legal meaning to give the defendants notice of the charge against them. The Court also noted that the charging document need not contain all the definitions of the legal terms of art used in the statute creating the crime)).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b635 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the information alleged facts sufficient to constitute the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u00b636 Did the State follow statutory requirements in amending the information?</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">\u00b637 The State filed its original information against Kern on November 30,1999, charging the defendant with six offenses, including one count of felony sexual assault, three counts of felony assault, and two counts of misdemeanor child endangerment involving J.S.\u2019s younger brother, D.S. Subsequently, the State amended the information three times. The factual allegations remained virtually the same throughout the amendment process. The specific charges, however, morphed repeatedly. In the third-and final-amended complaint, the State reduced the charges to a single count of felony sexual assault, involving J.S., and one count of misdemeanor child endangerment, relating to D.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">\u00b638 Section 46-11-205, MCA, provides for the amendment of an information as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">(1) The court may allow an information to be amended in matters of substance at any time, but not less than 5 days before trial, provided that a motion is filed in a timely manner, states the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>nature of the proposed amendment, and is accompanied by an affidavit stating facts that show the existence of probable cause to support the charge as amended. A copy of the proposed amended information must be included with the motion to amend the information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">(2) If the court grants leave to amend the information, the defendant must be arraigned on the amended information without unreasonable delay and must be given a reasonable period of time to prepare for trial on the amended information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">(3) The court may permit an information to be amended as to form at any time before a verdict or finding is issued if no additional or different offense is charged and if the substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u00b639 Kern argues that the State failed to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 46-11-205, MCA, each time it amended the information. He claims that, despite repeated objections, the State never filed a motion in writing stating the nature of the proposed amendment. Rather, the State orally requested leave to file each amended information.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u00b640 We agree that the State failed to adhere to all of the procedural requirements set forth in \u00a7 46-11-205, MCA. However, for the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the State\u2019s inattention to detail does not, in this case, amount to reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\u00b641 In our analyses of issues implicating \u00a7 46-11-205, MCA, the dispositive question has been whether the amendment is one of substance or form. When the amendment is one of substance, we have required stricter adherence to the procedural rules. <em>City of Red Lodge v. Kennedy, </em>2002 MT 89, \u00b6 16, 309 Mont. 330, \u00b6 16, 46 P.3d 602, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao\">\u00b642  To differentiate amendments of form versus those of substance \u201cwe examine whether an amendment to an information or complaint alters the nature of the offense, the essential elements of the crime, the proofs or the defenses.\u201d <em>Red Lodge, </em>\u00b6 14. In this case, Kern originally faced four felony charges and two misdemeanor charges but ultimately stood trial only on a single felony charge and a single misdemeanor charge. The nature of the offense did not change despite the repeated amendments, and the essential elements of the crime, the proofs required, and the defenses remained the same (or became less burdensome to the defendant). Accordingly, we conclude that in this case, the amendments were amendments of form rather than of substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">\u00b643 In <em>State v. Cameron </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 95, 830 P.2d 1284, where the amendment to the information was not substantial and the charges remained the same, we held that the district court\u2019s failure to arraign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>the defendant on the amended charges did not constitute reversible error. <em>Cameron, </em>253 Mont. at 106, 830 P.2d at 1291. Here, although the motions to amend the information were presented orally rather than in writing, as required by statute, the defendant was made aware each time the State undertook to change the form of the information. As in <em>Cameron, </em>we do not believe the substantial rights of this defendant were prejudiced by the State\u2019s failure to fully comply with \u00a7 46-11-205, MCA. Accordingly, while we admonish the State to comply with all procedural requirements in the future, we find the State\u2019s shortcuts to be harmless error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u00b644 Was Kern\u2019s last sentence of fifteen years in prison with eight years suspended correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b645 Kern objects to the final sentence imposed on him-fifteen years in the Montana State Prison-on multiple grounds. He challenges the duration of the sentence and the manner in which the District Court imposed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\u00b646 This Court reviews a criminal sentence only for legality (i.e., whether the sentence is within the parameters provided by statute). <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15. We review a trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law, including questions of statutory interpretation, <em>de novo, </em>to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation is correct. <em>Montoya, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">\u00b647 Montana law dictates that a defendant convicted of sexual assault against a minor \u201cshall be punished by life imprisonment or by imprisonment in the state prison for a term of not less than 2 years or more than 100 years.\u201d Section 45-5-502(3), MCA (1999). The sentence imposed on Kern, imprisonment in the Montana State Prison for fifteen years, with all but seven years suspended, falls within the range established by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">\u00b648 Contrary to the District Court\u2019s findings, as articulated in the sentencing order, Kern contends that he is a non-violent offender. As such, he argues he is entitled to special consideration in sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"ADT\">\u00b649 Section 46-18-101(3), MCA (1999), provides an extensive list of principles adopted by the state of Montana to achieve its sentencing policy goals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-10\">(e) Sentencing practices must include punishing violent and serious repeat felony offenders with incarceration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-12\">(f) Sentencing practices must provide alternatives to imprisonment for the punishment of those nonviolent felony offenders who do not have serious criminal records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\u00b650 Section 48-18-104(2)(c), MCA (1999), provides a statutory definition for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\">\u2018Crime of violence\u2019 means: (c) any sexual offense in which the offender causes bodily injury to the victim or uses threat, intimidation, or force against the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b651 The statutory definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is clear. \u201cWhere the language of the statute is plain, unambiguous, direct and certain, the statute speaks for itself.\u201d <em>State v. Renee, </em>1999 MT 135, \u00b6 19, 294 Mont. 527, \u00b6 19, 983 P.2d 893, \u00b6 19. Thus, whether or not Kern\u2019s crime falls under the definition is a question of fact to be answered by the trial court. We review only for clear error. <em>Renee, </em>\u00b6 19. While Kern claims there was no evidence he used threats or intimidation to carry out the sexual assaults against J.S., the record indicates otherwise. The victim testified that she kept the abuse a secret for two years because the defendant threatened to kill her mother if she revealed the sexual abuse. Further, it is difficult to imagine that a seven-year-old girl would comply with requests to masturbate an adult male absent some threat or intimidation. The District Court did not err in finding that Kern is a violent offender for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b652 In addition, given Kern\u2019s prior conviction for negligent homicide, it is difficult for this Court to understand why Kern should be classified as an offender without a serious criminal record (\u00a7 46-18-101(3)(f)). While drinking and driving ten years ago, the defendant had an accident in which his passenger and good friend was killed. While we applaud Kern\u2019s compliance with the terms of his sentence and probation, we cannot treat his criminal record-which involved the death of a human being-as a mark in Kern\u2019s favor, as his counsel implies we should.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\u00b653 Given the defendant\u2019s serious criminal record and his classification as a violent offender, the District Court did not have a responsibility to seek alternatives to imprisonment for Kern.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">\u00b654 The defendant also presented evidence that the sentence he received was not commensurate with the sentences of others convicted of similar charges. We need not reach this issue, however, as a challenge to the \u201cequitability\u201d of a sentence falls under the authority of the Sentence Review Division. <em>Montoya, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">\u00b655 Kern\u2019s final contention relates to the amendment of his original sentence. No one disputes that Kern\u2019s original sentence-a commitment to DOC for fifteen years, with all but seven years suspended violated Montana law. Section 46-18-201(3)(d)(i), MCA (1999), requires that a sentence to DOC include suspension of all but five years of the commitment. The dispute arises over whether the District Court acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>appropriately in the manner in which it corrected the unlawful sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u00b656 The State argues that the District Court was well within the bounds of law when it corrected its mistake by ordering Kern committed to the <em>state prison </em>for fifteen years, with all but seven years suspended. The defendant argues, instead, that the original sentence of fifteen years to DOC was valid, and that it was merely the suspension of eight years, rather than ten, that violated Montana law. Thus, Kern argues, the proper way to correct the sentencing error is simply to retain the original sentence of a fifteen year commitment to DOC, but suspend all but five years of the sentence. The defendant is correct that such a sentence would comply with state law. That does not mean, however, that the course of action pursued by the District Court violated state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b657 Montana law in effect when Kern committed his crime included the following provision for the correction of a sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">The court may correct an erroneous sentence or disposition at any time and may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner within 120 days after the sentence is imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Section 46-18-117, MCA (1999). Based on this provision, we see nothing restricting the District Court from pursuing either the option recommended by the State, or that proffered by the defendant, to correct its original sentence. That Kern would have clearly preferred commitment to DOC for fifteen years, with all but five years suspended, does not entitle him to that more lenient sentence. The District Court did not err in timely correcting the sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">\u00b658 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b58-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, NELSON and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
