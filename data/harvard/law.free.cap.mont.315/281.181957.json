The complaint requested that the District Court determine that he was entitled to coverage from State Farm insurance policies pursuant to which he was an \u201cinsured.\u201d Both parties filed motions for summary judgment and oral argument was held. Following oral argument, the District Court issued an Opinion, Order and Declaratory Judgment in favor of State Farm. Mitchell appeals from that order. We reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">\u00b62 The dispositive issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it applied California law to determine whether Mitchell was entitled to underinsured motorist coverage?</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it concluded that the limitations in the State Farm policies do not violate public policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AUv\">\u00b65 On July 27, 1998, the Appellant, Charles Mitchell, was injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>while a passenger in a vehicle driven by Brook Tebb and insured by Glen and Linda Haas. Mitchell alleged that he suffered approximately $25,000 in medical expenses and alleged damages from loss of wages, for pain and suffering, and for future medical expenses. Mitchell\u2019s claim for damages related to pain and suffering, wage loss and future medical expenses, along with the seriousness of Mitchell\u2019s injuries remain disputed by State Farm. Following the accident, Mitchell settled with Farmer\u2019s Insurance, the insurer of the Haas vehicle, for the vehicle\u2019s policy limit of $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u00b66 Mitchell is insured by his parents\u2019 State Farm insurance policies. Approximately $25,000 of Mitchell\u2019s medical bills were covered by his parents\u2019 medical expenses coverage. Mitchell\u2019s parents reside in California, and insure five vehicles through State Farm, which are registered, owned, operated, and garaged in California. A separate premium was paid for uninsured motorist coverage for each vehicle. The insurance policy declarations pages indicate that uninsured motorist coverage in the amount of $30,000 per person and $60,000 per accident is provided for four vehicles, and coverage in the amount of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident is provided for the fifth vehicle. Separate premiums were charged for each coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u00b67 Each policy provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">Where coverage applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">The coverages you choose apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">1. in the United States of America, its territories and possessions, or Canada; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">2. while the insured vehicle is being shipped between their ports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">Uninsured Motor Vehicle - Coverage U</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">You have this coverage if \u201cU\u201d appears in the \u201cCoverages\u201d space on the declarations page.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-12\">We will pay damages for <em>bodily injury </em>an <em>insured </em>is legally entitled to collect from the owner or driver of an <em>uninsured motor vehicle. </em>The <em>bodily injury </em>must be caused by an accident arising out of the operation, maintenance or use of an <em>uninsured motor vehicle.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-13\">IF THE DAMAGES ARE CAUSED BY AN <em>UNDERINSURED MOTOR VEHICLE </em>THERE IS NO COVERAGE UNTIL:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-14\">1.

It reasoned that the Haas vehicle\u2019s $50,000 liability coverage matched the highest single uninsured motorist coverage and, therefore, it was not \u201cunderinsured\u201d pursuant to the underinsured motorist definition.</p>\n<p id=\"ABV\">\u00b69 Mitchell requested that the District Court determine that State Farm\u2019s denial of coverage violated public policy and determine the amount of coverage he was entitled to receive pursuant to the policies. The parties filed motions for summary judgement and oral argument was held on January 25, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u00b610 The District Court issued its Opinion, Order and Declaratory Judgement on November 14, 2001. The District Court was asked to address the following issues: 1) Is the definition of \u201cunderinsured motorist\u201d coverage in the California State Farm Policy invalid as against Montana public policy; 2) If Mitchell is entitled to underinsured motorist coverage from his parents\u2019 State Farm policy, is he allowed to stack the underinsured motorist coverage provided by all five of his parents\u2019 vehicles; and 3) If Mitchell is not permitted to stack the five coverages, is he entitled to recover $50,000 based on the highest vehicle coverage provided to his parents for one vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">\u00b611 Before addressing the specific issues raised by Mitchell, the District Court determined that California, rather than Montana law controlled. The District Court concluded that, according to California law, the policies were valid and that Mitchell was not entitled to underinsured motorist coverage from his parents\u2019 State Farm insurance policies. It, therefore, awarded summary judgment to State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">\u00b612 This Court reviews an appeal of summary judgment <em>de novo. Motarie v. Mont. Joint Refuse Disposal </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 239, 242, 907 P.2d 154, 156. We apply the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., criteria applied by the district court. <em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903. Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-11\">the judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b613 The party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of establishing the absence of genuine issues of material fact. <em>Bruner, </em>272 Mont. at 264, 900 P.2d at 903. If that burden is met, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to raise a genuine issue of material fact by more than mere denial or speculation. <em>Bruner, </em>272 Mont. at 264, 900 P.2d at 903. Once a court determines that no genuine factual issues exist, it must determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Bruner, </em>272 Mont. at 264-65,900 P.2d at 903. This Court reviews the legal conclusions made by a district court to determine if they are correct. <em>Bruner, </em>272 Mont. at 265, 900 P.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ap2\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u00b614 Did the District Court err when it applied California law to determine whether Mitchell was entitled to underinsured motorist coverage?</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u00b615 Mitchell contends that the District Court erred when it concluded that California law governed whether he was entitled to underinsured motorist coverage. He maintains that Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 6(1) (1971), requires that a court follow \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA, where, as in this case, there is a conflict between California law and Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\u00b616 Generally, conflicts between an insured and an insurer are resolved by contract law rather than tort law. <em>State Farm v. Estate of Braun </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 125, 127, 793 P.2d 253, 254. However, the analysis used to determine which state\u2019s law applies to a particular case is the same for contract and tort law. <em>Phillips v. General Motors Corp., </em>2000 MT 55, \u00b6 23, 298 Mont. 438, \u00b6 23, 995 P.2d 1002, \u00b6 23. Consistent with our decisions in <em>Phillips </em>and <em>Casarotto v. Lombardi </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 369, 886 P.2d 931, the District Court applied the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, when it determined California law applied to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">\u00b617 While the court was correct when it concluded that conflicts of law are resolved pursuant to the Restatement, its application of the Restatement was incorrect. <em>Phillips </em>represents this Court\u2019s attempt to avoid conclusory application of the Restatement, a practice we recognized as an error in other appellate courts. <em>Phillips, </em>\u00b6 26. Consequently, we approached the criteria in a careful, step-by-step <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>fashion, to avoid misapplication of the law. <em>Phillips, </em>\u00b6 26. We incorporate the same careful procedure to the instant case and reach a different result than the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b618 Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">\u00a7 188. Law Governing in Absence of Effective Choice of Law by the Parties</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">(1) The rights and the duties of the parties with respect to an issue in contract are determined by the local law of the state which, with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties under the principles stated in \u00a7 6....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">\u00a7 193. Contracts of Fire, Surety or Casualty Insurance The validity of a contract of fire, surety or casualty insurance and the rights created thereby are determined by the local law of the state which the parties understood was to be the principal location of the insured risk during the term of the policy, unless with respect to the particular issue, some other state has a more significant relationship under the principles stated in \u00a7 6 to the transaction and the parties, in which event the local law of the other state will be applied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">\u00a7 6. Choice-of-Law Principles</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">(1) A court, subject to constitutional restrictions, will follow a statutory directive of its own state on choice of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">(2) Where there is no such directive, the factors relevant to the choice of law include ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">The District Court began its analysis with \u00a7 6(2) and did not ascertain whether Montana law addressed the choice of law concerning Mitchell\u2019s State Farm policy pursuant to \u00a7 6(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">\u00b619 Section 28-3-102, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-13\">What law and usage to govern interpretation. A contract is to be interpreted according to the law in usage where it is to be performed or, if it does not indicate a place of performance, according to the law and usage of the place where it is made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">The policies contemplate that State Farm will be required to perform its contractual duty anywhere in the United States: \u201cThe coverages you choose apply (1) in the United States of America....\u201d Therefore, we conclude that Montana was an anticipated place of performance. Pursuant to \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA, Montana law applies to the instant case if Montana is the actual place of performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">\u00b620  In general, unless the terms of the insurance contract provide otherwise, the law of the place of performance controls a contract\u2019s legal construction and effect <em>Kemp v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1979), 183 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Mont. 526, 533, 601 P.2d 20, 24. We have held that where an insurance contract designates the place of performance to be any state where a claim arises, performance occurs where the insured obtains judgment. <em>Kemp, </em>183 Mont. at 532-33, 601 P.2d at 23. It logically follows, that the place of performance is also the place where an insured is entitled to receive benefits, has incurred accident related expenses, or is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b621 State Farm maintains that <em>Kemp </em>has limited precedential value following this Court\u2019s adoption of the Restatement. However, the Restatement, requires a court to first look to relevant state law when determining applicable law. Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws \u00a7 6(1). Section 28-3-102, MCA, provides that when a contract indicates the place of performance, the law of the state where performance occurs should be applied. In <em>Kemp </em>we determined what constitutes place of performance pursuant to \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA. We hold that the adoption of the Restatement does not change <em>Kemp\u2019s </em>applicability in cases where a court is asked to determine the place of performance pursuant to \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b622  Montana is the place of performance pursuant to Mitchell\u2019s policies because Mitchell was working and living in Montana at the time of the accident; the underinsured tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle was insured in Montana; Mitchell\u2019s medical expenses were incurred in Montana; Mitchell settled with the Haas\u2019 insurers for the policy limit giving rise to the underinsured motorist claim in Montana; and judgment concerning the accident will be rendered and paid in Montana. <em>See Kemp, </em>183 Mont. at 532-33, 601 P.2d at 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u00b623 We conclude that the District Court was incorrect when it held that California law applies to the instant case. Whether or not Mitchell is entitled to recover damages pursuant to the State Farm policy is a matter of Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\u00b624 Did the District Court err when it concluded that the limitations in the State Farm policies do not violate public policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u00b625 Mitchell contends that the definition of underinsured motorist, the Limits of Liability provision, and the Other Insurance provision in his State Farm policies contradict the amount of coverage indicated by the declarations pages. State Farm contends that the terms of the policies are clear and unambiguous and must be enforced as written.</p>\n<p id=\"AR0\">\u00b626 When we look at an insurance contract for purpose and intent \u201cwe [will] examine the contract as a whole, giving no special deference to any specific clause.\u201d <em>Farmers Alliance Mut. Ins. Co. v. Holeman, </em>1998 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>MT 155, \u00b6 25, 289 Mont. 312, \u00b6 25, 961 P.2d 114, \u00b6 25. The terms and words used in an insurance contract are to be given their usual meaning and construed using common sense. <em>Dakota Fire Ins. Co. v. Oie, </em>1998 MT 288, \u00b6 5, 291 Mont. 486, \u00b6 5, 968 P.2d 1126, \u00b6 5. Any ambiguity in an insurance policy must be construed in favor of the insured, and in favor of extending coverage. <em>Holeman, </em>\u00b6 25. An ambiguity exists where the contract, when taken as a whole, is reasonably subject to two different interpretations. <em>Holeman, </em>\u00b6 25. Whether an ambiguity exists is determined through the eyes of \u201ca consumer with average intelligence but not trained in the law or insurance business.\u201d <em>Holeman, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b627 The policies\u2019 declarations pages indicate that Mitchell paid five separate premiums for $30,000 of uninsured motorist coverage on four vehicles, and $50,000 of uninsured motorist coverage on one vehicle. The uninsured motorist coverage pledges that it will pay damages that the insured is legally entitled to recover from a tortfeasor for bodily injury. Uninsured coverage includes coverage for damages by an underinsured motorist. However, according to the underinsured motorist definition, coverage is only available if the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurance limit is less than the single highest coverage purchased by Mitchell. Moreover, underinsured motorist coverage is only available where the tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage does not satisfy the mandatory minimum liability limit for the state where the insured\u2019s vehicle is primarily garaged. Finally, the underinsured coverage is offset by the amount payable to the insured by any person or organization held legally liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b628 In all cases where the tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage is equal to or more than $50,000 Mitchell can recover nothing. If Mitchell is injured by a tortfeasor who satisfies the underinsured motorist definition in Montana, his recovery will automatically be offset by $25,000. Moreover, underinsured portions of the four $30,000 uninsured motorist coverages purchased are rendered valueless by the anti-stacking provision. These provisions contradict the expectation created by the declarations pages that five coverages were paid for and are available. Consequently, we conclude that the State Farm policies are subject to more than one interpretation and, therefore, ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"Axk\">\u00b629 Mitchell contends that the underinsured motorist definition, the offset provision and the anti-stacking provision all violate Montana public policy. State Farm responds that Montana public policy permits limitations and exclusions in optional insurance coverages. State Farm also maintains that the legislature established Montana public policy with regard to stacking pursuant to \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, which allows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>insurers to avoid stacking regardless of the premiums charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Underinsured Motorist Definition</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b630 Mitchell maintains that the limits comparison underinsured motorist definition contravenes the insured\u2019s reasonable expectation that coverage will be available in the event that a tortfeasor does not provide adequate indemnification. State Farm responds that Montana public policy does not prohibit limiting underinsured motorist coverage and, therefore, the limits comparison underinsured motorist definition is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b631 Initially, we note that the combined uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage provision lends itself to confusion. To determine whether the underinsured motorist definition is valid in Montana, we consider the underinsured motorist definition independently. Montana public policy considerations that favor adequate compensation for accident victims apply to underinsured motorist coverage. <em>Bennett v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 386, 389, 862 P.2d 1146, 1149. Moreover, Montana law recognizes that an insurance consumer reasonably expects that underinsured motorist coverage will provide <em>additional </em>coverage when the insured\u2019s damages exceed what is available from the tortfeasor. <em>Hardy v. Progressive Specialty Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 85, 315 Mont. 107, 67 P.3d 892; <em>Bennett, </em>261 Mont. at 389, 862 P.2d at 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\u00b632 In <em>Transamerica Ins. Group v. Osborn </em>(1986 D.Mont.), 627 F. Supp. 1405, 1406-407, an underinsured motor vehicle was defined as: \u201ca land motor vehicle or trailer of any type to which a bodily injury liability bond or policy applies at the time of the accident but its limit for bodily injury liability is less that the limit of liability for this coverage.\u201d The United States District Court concluded that the underinsured motorist definition transgressed the reasonable expectation created by the declarations page representation that $50,000 of <em>additional </em>coverage would be available if Osborn\u2019s damages exceeded the bodily injury liability available from the tortfeasor. <em>Osborn, </em>627 F.Supp. at 1412.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\u00b633 In <em>Hardy v. Progressive Specialty Ins. Co., </em>we held that a limits comparison underinsured motorist definition violated the insurance consumer\u2019s reasonable expectation that underinsured motorist coverage provided additional coverage. The definition provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">\u201cUnderinsured motor vehicle\u201d means a land motor vehicle or trailer of any type to which a bodily injury liability bond or policy applies at the time of the accident, but the sum of all applicable limits of liability for bodily injury is less than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>coverage limit for Underinsured Motorist Coverage shown on the Declarations Page.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><em>Hardy, </em>\u00b6 8. Pursuant to the common law definition of underinsured motorist coverage, the declarations page, and the consumer\u2019s reasonable expectation, we concluded that the underinsured motorist coverage provided indemnification in the event that the tortfeasor\u2019s liability was insufficient to compensate the insured for his damages. We held that the underinsured motorist definition in that policy was void. <em>Hardy, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b634  We acknowledge that the Mitchell policy is identical to neither the policy in the <em>Hardy </em>nor the policy in <em>Osborn. </em>In <em>Hardy </em>and <em>Osborn, </em>a separate premium was paid for underinsured motorist coverage that was provided independently of the uninsured motorist coverage. The underinsured motorist coverage in Mitchell\u2019s policies are a part of the uninsured motorist coverage, no separate premium was paid for underinsured motorist coverage, and the declarations pages do not list underinsured motorist coverage separately. However, those distinctions do not alter the consumer\u2019s reasonable expectation that underinsured motorist coverage provides <em>additional </em>coverage, up to the coverage limit, which is expressed on the declarations page in terms of \u201cuninsured\u201d coverage, when the tortfeasor provides insufficient liability coverage. The underinsured motorist definition in Mitchell\u2019s policies contravenes that expectation. Consequently, we conclude that the underinsured motorist definition violates Montana public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Offset Provision</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u00b635  The offset provision violates public policy on separate grounds. A case in point is <em>Grier v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 457, 812 P.2d 347, where we considered whether a provision that permitted \u201cunderinsured\u201d motorist coverage to be offset by the amount the insured recovered from a tortfeasor violated public policy. In <em>Grier, </em>the policy defined underinsured motorist coverage as part of the uninsured motorist coverage; no independent underinsured motorist provision was included in the policy; no separate premium was charged for underinsured motorist coverage; and the declarations page only indicated that uninsured motorist coverage was provided. <em>Grier, </em>248 Mont. at 459, 812 P.2d at 349. Based on these characteristics, we concluded that the underinsured coverage in the policy was in fact part of the mandatory uninsured motorist coverage. <em>Grier, </em>248 Mont. at 459, 812 P.2d at 349. Montana public policy prohibits offsets of mandatory coverage. Therefore, the underinsured motorist coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>offset clause violated Montana public policy and was void. <em>Grier, </em>248 Mont. at 459, 812 P.2d at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b636 The Mitchell policies are nearly identical to the policy in <em>Grier. </em>The policies define underinsured motorist as part of uninsured motorist coverage; they do not have an independent underinsured motorist provision; no separate premium was charged for underinsured motorist coverage; and the declarations pages only indicate that uninsured coverage is provided by each policy. Consistent with our holding in <em>Grier, </em>we conclude that the offset provisions violate Montana public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Anti-Stacking Provision</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u00b637 Finally, we consider whether the anti-stacking provision in the State Farm policies violates Montana public policy. Mitchell contends that the anti-stacking provision violates public policy because it permits State Farm to charge a premium for coverage that is defeated by the provisions of the policy. State Farm counters that \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, expressly permits the anti-stacking provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b638 We recently held that \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, is unconstitutional to the extent that it allows an insurance company to charge a premium for illusory coverage. <em>Hardy, </em>\u00b6 38. The anti-stacking provision in this case permits State Farm to charge premiums for five separate uninsured motorist coverages in spite of the fact that the anti-stacking provision only permits Mitchell to recover for one coverage. Therefore, \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, violates substantive due process, <em>see Hardy, </em>\u00b6 38, and is not controlling. In the absence of a legislative directive, we must review the anti-stacking provision in light of this Court\u2019s proclamation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\u00b639  An insurance policy cannot include provisions that defeat coverage for which valuable consideration was received. <em>Bennett, </em>261 Mont. at 389, 862 P.2d at 1148. Pursuant to Montana case law, uninsured motorist coverage may be stacked when separate premiums are charged for coverage on more than one vehicle. <em>Chaffee v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>(1979), 181 Mont. 1, 6, 591 P.2d 1102, 1105. In short, an anti-stacking provision that permits an insurer to receive valuable consideration by charging premiums for coverage that is not provided, violates Montana public policy. Any limitations on coverage must be reflected in the premium charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\u00b640 Moreover, uninsured motorist coverage is both personal and portable. <em>Jacobson v. Implement Dealers Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 196 Mont. 542, 547-48, 640 P.2d 908, 912. In <em>Hardy, </em>the declarations page indicated that four coverages had been purchased. However, the anti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>stacking provision only permitted the insured to recover one amount of coverage. We held that the anti-stacking provision defeated the insurance consumer\u2019s reasonable expectation that multiple coverages could be aggregated because it destroyed the personal and portable nature of underinsured motorist coverage. <em>Hardy, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 44-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b641 State Farm charged five premiums for five uninsured motorist coverages. However, Mitchell can only receive one amount of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"ASE\">\u00b642 In <em>Hardy, </em>\u00b6 45, we concluded that limitations of this nature violated the consumer\u2019s reasonable expectation that underinsured motorist coverage was personal and portable. The same holds true for uninsured motorist coverage. The anti-stacking provision in the instant policies contravene Mitchell\u2019s reasonable expectation that uninsured motorist coverage is personal and portable. Consequently, we conclude that the anti-stacking provision in Mitchell\u2019s policies violate the public policy of this state and is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b643  We conclude that Montana law applies to this case. Pursuant to Montana law, we conclude that the District Court was incorrect when it held that the underinsured motorist definition in the State Farm policies was valid in Montana. Furthermore, we conclude that the District Court was incorrect when it held that Montana public policy permitted the anti-stacking provision in the State Farm policies. \u00b644 Based upon the foregoing conclusions, we reverse the judgement on the District Court and remand this case to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b318-6\">JUSTICES REGNIER, LEAPHART, NELSON and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b318-7\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AHL\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\u00b645 I concur with the Court\u2019s holding in Issue 1 and with the Court\u2019s holdings in regard to the underinsured motorist definition and offset provision under Issue 2.
