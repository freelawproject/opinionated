In November of 2001, the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, granted Harold\u2019s motion to modify the parties\u2019 parenting plan to make him the primary parent. Sarah appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">\u00b62 The issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it concluded the daughter\u2019s best interest required the court to change custody?</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion regarding Sarah\u2019s motion <em>in </em>limine?</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">\u00b65 Harold and Sarah were married in 1995 and separated before their daughter was born the following year. When they separated, Sarah moved back to her own mother\u2019s home in Seeley Lake, Montana, and Harold remained in Billings, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">\u00b66 Harold and Sarah initially were granted joint custody of their daughter, with Sarah as the primary parent and Harold to have visitation on alternating weekends and holidays and for several weeks during each summer. In April of 2001, Harold moved for modification of the parenting plan, claiming Sarah had repeatedly frustrated his visitation. He also complained Sarah had raised allegations that he had sexually abused their daughter and, as a result, he had been allowed only supervised visitation for six months pending investigation by the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS). At the end of the investigation, the allegations were dismissed as unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">\u00b67 Both parents testified at the hearing on Harold\u2019s motion for modification. Harold also presented testimony by Sarah Baxter, a clinical psychologist who had treated the parties\u2019 daughter; Mike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Sullivan, the director of a sexual abuse treatment program who had evaluated Harold; Maile Ewalt, who had handled the DPHHS investigation of the sexual abuse allegations; and Jackie Adams, who baby-sat the daughter for Harold. In addition to her own testimony, Sarah called a family friend, Gregory McDonald, as a witness. The court also reviewed five depositions: a physician who had examined the daughter for signs of sexual abuse and found nothing; two psychologists who had evaluated and treated the daughter; and two DPHHS social workers who had been involved with the investigation of the allegations of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b68 After hearing the testimony and reviewing the depositions, the court granted Harold\u2019s motion for modification of the parenting plan. Sarah appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b69 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it concluded the daughter\u2019s best interest required the court to change custody?</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u00b610 Our standard of review of findings of fact on the modification of a parenting plan regarding custody and visitation is that the district court\u2019s findings will be sustained unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage of Oehlke, </em>2002 MT 79, \u00b6 9, 309 Mont. 254, \u00b6 9, 46 P.3d 49, \u00b6 9. We will reverse a district court\u2019s decision regarding modification of custody only where an abuse of discretion is clearly demonstrated. <em>Marriage of Oehlke, </em>\u00b6 9. Here, Sarah\u2019s claims center on the factual determinations made by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">\u00b611 Sarah first claims the District Court failed to make specific findings that she frustrated Harold\u2019s visitation, in violation of Rule 52(a), M.R.Civ.P. The court\u2019s rationale for its decision is set forth in the findings it made in open court. The court stated in its oral findings, \u201cI find specifically that [Sarah] has willfully and consistently refused to allow the child to have contact with dad, and attempted to frustrate or deny contact with dad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">\u00b612 As Sarah points out, the court then directed Harold\u2019s counsel to prepare the written order on its decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-10\">I find that [Harold\u2019s] testimony about the frustrated visitation, and I guess, [Harold\u2019s attorney], I\u2019m going to ask you to put together an order and go through some of those details. I find that they\u2019re legitimate and credible about the frustrated visitation in 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001, whether it\u2019s for the excuse of sickness, or lack of availability, or because of the allegation of sexual abuse, or whatever the reasons that were given, I find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>they\u2019re just not credible and they\u2019re not excusable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Sarah contends this direction from the court required a written order including specific findings concerning frustration of visitation dates, times or places. The written order which the court later entered does not contain such findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b613 Rule 52(a), M.R.Civ.P., provides, \u201cIt will be sufficient if the findings of fact and conclusions of law are stated orally and recorded in open court following the close of the evidence^]\u201d Therefore, to the extent Sarah is complaining about the absence of written findings that she frustrated Harold\u2019s visitation, she has established no violation of that Rule. Sarah has cited nothing, and we are aware of nothing, which would require more specificity than is present in the court\u2019s oral statement of its findings and its subsequent written order.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u00b614 Sarah next asserts that, in making its oral findings, the District Court improperly relied upon its off-the-record notes from the earlier dissolution proceeding. The court stated that it had gone back to its notes from the 1997 dissolution proceedings, in which it had concluded that Harold was a good parent and that Sarah was overly dependent on her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u00b615 Sarah is correct that the notes to which the District Court referred cannot be used to demonstrate a change in circumstances since that time, as is required for modification of custody pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA. However, the court did not cite those notes as demonstrating a change in circumstances, but rather as a historical background to its findings that Sarah\u2019s family exhibited problematic \u201csuccessive enmeshing\u201d and a \u201ccycle of dependence. \u201cWe recently deemed it significant, in <em>In re Marriage of Drake, </em>2002 MT 127, \u00b6 25, 310 Mont. 114, \u00b6 25, 49 P.3d 38, \u00b6 25, that the district court had presided in previous proceedings involving a dissolution and parenting plan and \u201ctherefore had a working familiarity with this family upon which it could critically weigh evidence and decide what was in the best interests of the children.\u201d Given the purpose for which the notes were used in this case, we conclude Sarah has not established that the District Court\u2019s reference to its notes from a prior proceeding was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\u00b616 Sarah states the court erred when it found that her hospitalization and surgeries for a forehead/bone infection were not a factor in loss of visitation. Sarah testified that, beginning in February of 2001, she was hospitalized in Seattle for a life-threatening staph infection that spread to the bone in her forehead, resulting in her temporary inability to accommodate Harold\u2019s visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u00b617 The court\u2019s actual finding was that Sarah \u201chas lied about [the daughter] not being available due to sickness\u201d and \u201cwhether it\u2019s for the excuse of sickness, or lack of availability, or because of the allegation of sexual abuse, or whatever the reasons that were given, I find that they\u2019re just not credible and they\u2019re not excusable.\u201d Substantial evidence in the record supports this finding. Sarah admitted on cross-examination that she could have asked Harold to care for their daughter while she was in Seattle for medical care of her forehead/bone infection. Harold testified Sarah often would not accept his telephone calls or answer his letters when he called or wrote to confirm visitation. He testified that, on a number of occasions, Sarah had failed to meet him on the appointed dates, places and times to allow visitation. Harold testified that on one occasion, he was told Sarah was in the hospital and thus unable to transport the daughter for visitation, but when he drove to Missoula, Montana, to have an abbreviated visit with the daughter, Sarah met him for the exchange of custody. Harold also testified that after a series of weekends during the spring of 2001 on which he was told Sarah was too sick to travel to meet him to exchange custody, she cancelled another of his visitation weekends because she and the daughter had gone to Seattle, Washington, to visit Sarah\u2019s brother. Harold testified he was puzzled about why Sarah was able to travel to visit her brother but not to deliver the daughter to him for visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b618 Credibility is a matter for the finder of fact to determine. <em>Marriage of Drake, </em>\u00b6 20. The court\u2019s finding on Sarah\u2019s excuses for the daughter\u2019s availability for visitation, set forth more fully at \u00b6 12 above, was not limited to the medical excuse in the spring of2001, but related to four years of visitation. We conclude substantial evidence supports the court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b619 Sarah complains the court ignored a psychologist\u2019s deposition testimony that the daughter would \u201clikely\u201d suffer posttraumatic stress disorder if Harold was named her primary parent. Sarah states permanent damage to the daughter is clearly not in her best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"A8h\">\u00b620 The fact that the District Court did not make a finding on the above testimony by the psychologist is inconsequential, in and of itself. A court need not make findings on every piece of evidence offered. <em>Marriage of Drake, </em>\u00b6 23. And, again, credibility is within the province of the finder of fact. <em>Marriage of Drake, </em>\u00b6 20. Psychologist Sarah Baxter testified that when she saw the daughter during an extended two-week visitation with Harold in August of 2001, the daughter was content, relaxed, chatty and spontaneous, exhibiting \u201cgood adjustment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>to a lengthy visit after a long time of not seeing her father.\u201d We hold that the District Court did not clearly err by failing to make a finding on the deposition testimony to which Sarah refers.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b621 The District Court found \u201cas far as the sexual abuse, I find it to be totally unsubstantiated, and I believe that it was suggested by [Sarah] and that\u2019s where this story came from.\u201d Sarah contends no factual basis exists for a conclusion that she \u201csuggested\u201d that Harold sexually abused their daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b622 Again, Sarah\u2019s contention is incorrect. First, the District Court\u2019s statement concerning its belief was a part of a finding, not a conclusion. The finding that the alleged sexual abuse was totally unsubstantiated was supported by the testimony of every professional witness. Second, a social worker who testified by deposition stated she had \u201ca feeling\u201d that Sarah was coaching the daughter to make the sexual abuse allegations. This testimony provided substantial credible evidence to support the District Court\u2019s statement of its belief. Third, even if the finding concerning Sarah\u2019s \u201csuggestion\u201d is not supported by substantial evidence, the outcome of the case would not change, because even though the sexual abuse allegations were very detrimental to Harold, the court\u2019s decision was not made solely on that issue, but also on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b623 Sarah claims the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the daughter\u2019s best interests were served by the modification lacks factual support. In that regard, the court recited its considerations of the best interests factors which must be considered under \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA. It found that Sarah had \u201cwillfully and consistently\u201d refused to allow the daughter to have contact with Harold, and attempted to frustrate or deny contact with him. As to the wishes of the parents, the court stated each parent wanted the daughter to be with him/her, and as to the daughter\u2019s wishes, that she wanted to be with Sarah. The court found, however, that the relationship of Sarah and the daughter was \u201cenmeshed\u201d to an unhealthy degree and obsessive on Sarah\u2019s part. The court found Harold and the daughter interacted very well. The court found the daughter was well-adjusted to her home, school and community and that moving to be with Harold was going to be very difficult on her, but that Sarah was also planning on relocating, so the daughter would face a transition in any case.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b624 As to the mental and physical health of all individuals involved, the court found that Sarah has serious psychological issues which she has not faced. It found there had been no allegations of physical abuse and that the allegation of sexual abuse was completely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>unsubstantiated. The court found no chemical dependency issue for either parent. It found that in the short term and looking at stability of care, the modification would be difficult for the daughter, but in the long run and in relation to her developmental needs, it would be in her best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b625  Thus, the court found factual support under several \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA, best interests factors for its conclusion that the daughter\u2019s best interests were served by modification of the parenting plan. Sarah\u2019s argument to the contrary fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b626 Finally, Sarah claims the District Court made no findings on the seven criteria for amendment of a parenting plan listed in \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA. Section 40-4-219(1), MCA, lists factors which a court <em>may </em>consider in amending a prior parenting plan, in addition to the mandatory best interests and change in circumstances criteria for modification set forth at \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-212 and -219(1), MCA. Because the court <em>may </em>consider the \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA, factors, failure to consider those factors is not error. In fact, the District Court did address one of the \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA, factors: whether one parent-here, Sarah-frustrated or denied contact between the child and the other parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b627  The District Court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. The court did not misapprehend the effect of the evidence, and our review of the record does not convince us that a mistake has been made. We hold that the District Court did not clearly err in making factual findings, and did not abuse its discretion when it concluded the daughter\u2019s best interest required it to change custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u00b628 Did the District Court abuse its discretion regarding Sarah\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">\u00b629  Admission of testimony is a matter of discretion for the trial court, and its decision will not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse of that discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Arrotta </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 508, 511, 797 P.2d 940, 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">\u00b630 Before the hearing, Sarah filed a motion <em>in limine </em>asking the District Court to preclude the testimony of Michael Sullivan, Harold\u2019s psychosexual evaluator. The motion was made on several grounds: Sullivan\u2019s testimony as to whether he believed abuse had occurred would invade the province of the finder of fact; an expert may not testify regarding the credibility of a child\u2019s allegations of sexual abuse if the child does not testify; and testimony regarding polygraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>examinations is inadmissible in Montana. In response to Sarah\u2019s motion, the District Court ruled Sullivan could give his opinion as to whether Harold was a person who would have a tendency to sexually abuse a minor child, but could not testify about the daughter\u2019s credibility or the polygraph examination he administered to Harold.</p>\n<p id=\"ALb\">\u00b631 Sarah claims that in ruling on the motion <em>in limine, </em>the court said it was going to sustain her objection to certain testimony, but then adopted the testimony in its oral statement of findings. This claim is untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b632 In its findings, the District Court noted, \u201cwe have Mr. Sullivan\u2019s testimony that he doesn\u2019t find any of the factors that would indicate that [Harold] would sexually abuse anybody[.]\u201d This finding does not violate the order <em>in </em>limine; in fact, it is a type of testimony the court specifically said it would allow.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b633 The District Court also stated in its findings that \u201cwe have Dr. Miller\u2019s testimony that she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s credible. She says, more likely that she has not been sexually abused by her father, but that [the daughter] thought that she had been.\u201d Dr. Miller was one of the psychologists who testified by deposition. There was no motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude consideration of any of her deposition testimony, nor does Sarah sirgue on appeal that Dr. Miller\u2019s testimony should not have been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b634  We hold the District Court did not err nor abuse its discretion regarding Sarah\u2019s motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u00b635 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b291-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, TRIEWEILER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
