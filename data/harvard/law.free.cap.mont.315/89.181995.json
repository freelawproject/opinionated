Byers (\u201cByers\u201d), was charged with conspiracy to commit criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-4-102 and 45-9-110, MCA; criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-4-102 and 45-9-110, MCA; criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-4-102 and 45-9-130, MCA; and criminal possession of drug paraphernalia, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA. After the State presented its case at trial, Byers moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was insufficient corroborative evidence to support the accomplice testimony, as required by \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA. The District Court denied the motion and the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. Byers appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for a directed verdict. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it found that there was sufficient evidence to corroborate the accomplice evidence as to Count I?</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it found that there was sufficient evidence to corroborate the accomplice evidence as to Count II?</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b65 Byers was charged by Information with several counts related to the possession and manufacture of methamphetamine. He appeals his conviction as to Counts I and II. Because Counts I and II are based on facts almost entirely separate from one another, we describe the facts in detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b66 We review the denial of a motion for directed verdict in the same manner that we review the sufficiency of evidence to support a conviction. <em>See State v. Bower </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 1, 6, 833 P.2d 1106, 1109. We examine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Mergenthaler </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 198, 203, 868 P.2d 560, 562. The decision to direct a verdict at the close of the State's case lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>See State v. Moore </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 20, 64, 885 P.2d 457, 484, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Gollehon </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 116, 121, 906 P.2d 697, 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err when it found that there was sufficient evidence to corroborate the accomplice evidence as to Count I?</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">\u00b68 Narcotics detective Sandra Ann Bjorklund (\"Officer Bjorklund\") discovered a portable methamphetamine lab while searching an apartment occupied by Jonathon Toth (\u201cToth\u201d) and Mary Hein (\u201cHein\u201d). Items seized during the search include a black duffel bag containing the portable methamphetamine lab, a marijuana pipe, a crack pipe, which can be used to smoke methamphetamine, a Chap Stick container which had been hollowed out and contained methamphetamine residue, a snort tube, and two recipes for manufacturing methamphetamine using ephedrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">\u00b69 Toth told Officer Bjorklund that a man named Tony helped him manufacture the methamphetamine, and gave her a description of Tony and Tony\u2019s car. Tony is the defendant, Tony Byers. Hein testified at trial that Byers showed Toth and Hein how to manufacture the methamphetamine and Toth wrote down the recipe. Hein also testified that Byers sometimes stayed at her apartment, that some of the equipment in the apartment was Byers\u2019, that Byers would take some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of the methamphetamine that was made in the apartment, and that the methamphetamine lab belonged to Toth and Byers.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\u00b610 Toth and Hein were both charged as a result of the methamphetamine lab found in their apartment. Toth accepted a plea agreement in which he was sentenced for accountability for criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs and criminal possession of dangerous drugs. Hein\u2019s case was still pending at the time of Byers\u2019 trial, however she admitted she was involved in the manufacture of methamphetamine and she was given use immunity for her testimony in Byers\u2019 trial. Toth did not testify at Byers\u2019 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b611 Count I of the Information charged Byers with conspiracy to commit criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-4-102 and 45-9-110, MCA. It was alleged that on or about October 1 through 22, 2000, Byers, with the purpose that the offense of criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs be committed, agreed with Toth and/or Hein to commit that offense and performed an act in furtherance of that agreement by providing the recipe and some of the materials for producing methamphetamine at their apartment, and also cooked the methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u00b612 In a criminal proceeding, testimony of a person who is legally accountable is governed by \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">A person may not be found guilty of an offense on the testimony of one responsible or legally accountable for the same offense ... unless the testimony is corroborated by other evidence that in itself and without the aid of the testimony of the one responsible or legally accountable for the same offense tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">\u00b613 We have previously addressed the guidelines for testing the sufficiency of corroborating evidence. In <em>State v. Kemp </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 383, 597 P.2d 96, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">To be sufficient, corroborating evidence must show more than that a crime was in fact committed or the circumstances of its commission. It must raise more than a suspicion of the defendant's involvement in, or opportunity to commit, the crime charged. But corroborative evidence need not be sufficient, by itself, to support a defendant's conviction or even to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case against him. Corroborating evidence may be circumstantial and can come from the defendant or his witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWv\"><em>Kemp, </em>182 Mont. at 387, 597 P.2d at 99 (citations omitted). In <em>State v. Kaczmarek </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 456, 460, 795 P.2d 439, 442, we further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>determined that \u201ccorroborating evidence is not insufficient merely because it is circumstantial, disputed, or possibly consistent with innocent conduct; it is the jury's duty to resolve such factual questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\u00b614  Since Toth and Hein were accomplices in the crimes with which Byers was charged in Count I, corroborating evidence must be held to the standards in \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA. Evidence about Byers\u2019 methamphetamine lab in the Toth/Hein apartment was also given by another accomplice, Daricek. Daricek testified that Byers told him Byers was staying at Toth\u2019s house and that Toth had gotten too high, called the police, and turned himself in for having a methamphetamine lab at his house. Byers told Daricek that the police had searched Toth\u2019s house and that Byers was hiding out because it was Byers\u2019 methamphetamine lab at Toth\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b615 Byers\u2019 argues that Daricek\u2019s testimony is insufficient because Daricek himself is an accomplice for Count II of the charges against Byers. We disagree. We addressed a similar issue in <em>State v. Paulson </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 32, 817 P.2d 1137. In <em>Paulson, </em>the defendant was convicted of criminal possession of dangerous drugs with the intent to sell. Two admitted drug dealers testified at Paulson\u2019s trial that they had received shipments of drugs from Paulson in the past. Their testimony was admitted for the purpose of showing a common scheme, plan, or system. However, neither of the admitted drug dealers who testified were involved in the drug shipments for which Paulson was charged. In <em>Paulson </em>we held that \u201cas to crimes, wrongs or acts <em>other than those upon which the defendant is charged, </em>accomplice testimony need not be corroborated before it is admissible.\u201d <em>Paulson, </em>250 Mont. at 38, 817 P.2d at 1140 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b616  Byers urges us to distinguish the facts of <em>Paulson </em>from the facts of the present case because here, Daricek, the accomplice, was facing charges relating to his acts with Byers on a different Count. However, based upon the plain meaning of \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA, we find that Daricek was not an accomplice to Count I, and hold, therefore, that Daricek\u2019s corroborative testimony was proper under the requirements of \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA. The District Court did not err when it denied Byers\u2019 motion for a directed verdict as to Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">\u00b617 Did the District Court err when it found that there was sufficient evidence to corroborate the accomplice evidence as to Count II?</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">\u00b618 After the search of the Toth/Hein apartment, police received an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>anonymous Crimestoppers tip that a man named Tom and his daughter were operating a methamphetamine lab in a tan Winnebago behind Pro-Align in Missoula. Tom was identified as Tom Turner (\u201cTurner\u201d). Law enforcement officers conducted surveillance of the Winnebago and the premises by which it was parked, 2304 <em>Vi </em>Ernest. During their surveillance, the officers observed a silver Mercury Topaz belonging to Byers.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u00b619 The police obtained a search warrant for the Winnebago, the house on Ernest, and the Mercury Topaz. When the officers arrived to execute the search warrant, the Winnebago was not there. One of the detectives testified that he saw the Winnebago turn into the alley, but when the driver spotted the officers,' he stopped the Winnebago abruptly, backed it out of the alley, and proceeded north on Clark Street. As the officers approached the house, Daricek attempted to leave by a back door. He was apprehended and taken into custody. Byers, who was inside the house, was also taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b620 A second Crimestoppers tip informed the police that someone in a Winnebago was dumping something into a Dumpster near Community Hospital. The time frame the caller identified was consistent with the time between when the Winnebago was observed leaving the scene of the search and when the Winnebago was located and seized by the police. Turner testified that he was the driver of the Winnebago and he threw tubs and suitcases, which contained a methamphetamine lab, into a Dumpster behind Community Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"AHx\">\u00b621 The search of the house yielded items that were related to methamphetamine, but the house did not contain a complete methamphetamine lab. Detectives found a crack pipe and a plastic cup with a chemical smell and reddish liquid consistent with the color of iodine or red phosphorus, which are required for certain methods of producing methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\u00b622 In the Mercury Topaz, the detectives found items including a \u201cfix kit\u201d containing syringes, a spoon, and methamphetamine residue; a digital scale, commonly used by drug dealers to accurately measure small amounts; a crack pipe; a small black bag containing a \u201cfix kit\u201d and coffee filters; a blue bag containing a \u201cfix kit;\u201d magazines with squares cut out of the pages, commonly used to package methamphetamine because magazine paper is not porous; and a coffee filter containing residue of methamphetamine. The Mercury Topaz also contained a notebook listing amounts of items, including pseudoephedrine and iodine, and a piece of paper listing ounce to gram conversions.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\u00b623 The Winnebago contained items commonly used in the production of methamphetamine, including a hand blender with white powder residue, matchbooks with the cover and striker plates missing, Sudafed pills, and red phosphorus. Detectives also found a crack pipe and a red cloth in the sink.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b624 Bahne Klietz, a forensic scientist at the Montana State Crime Lab, analyzed the items seized from the Winnebago and the Dumpster. She testified that more than one process is available to make methamphetamine. Based upon her analysis, Klietz was able to conclude that the red phosphorus/iodine method was used to make methamphetamine with the items seized from the Winnebago and Dumpster. Under this method, the red phosphorus and iodine are reagents used to react with pseudoephedrine, usually purchased as cold pills, to convert it to methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u00b625 At the time of Byers\u2019 trial, Turner had not been charged with any criminal offense, and Daricek accepted a plea agreement for two counts of felony possession of methamphetamine and was granted use immunity for his testimony against Byers.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b626 In Count II, Byers was charged with criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-9-102 and 45-9-110, MCA. It was alleged that on or about October 22 through November 1, 2000, Byers purposely or knowingly produced, manufactured, prepared, cultivated, compounded or processed methamphetamine, a dangerous drug as defined in \u00a7 50-32-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AqD\">\u00b627 On appeal, Byers argues that evidence connecting him to the methamphetamine lab found in the Dumpster is insufficient. Because Turner and Daricek are accomplices as to Count II, their testimony must be corroborated by other evidence that in itself tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense, pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA, as we discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\u00b628 We find that other evidence against Byers\u2019, unrelated to the testimony of Turner and Daricek, is sufficient to provide independent corroboration. Byers was present at the house when the search warrant was executed upon the house and his Mercury Topaz. The Mercury Topaz contained items used by drug dealers and methamphetamine manufacturers, namely a digital scale, magazines cut into squares, methamphetamine residue, and clothing stained with iodine. The clothing stained with iodine is particularly significant because, as stated above, the methamphetamine lab found in the Dumpster used the red phosphorus/iodine method of manufacture. Clothes are typically stained with iodine when manufacturing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>methamphetamine using the red phosphorus/iodine method. Additionally, Toth and Hein, accomplices as to Count I, were able to corroborate the testimony of Daricek and Turner that Byers knew the recipe for methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b629  When viewed in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that there was sufficient corroborating evidence for the testimony of Turner and Daricek. A jury could reasonably infer that Byers was involved in the manufacture of methamphetamine using the lab found in the Dumpster. We hold that the District Court did not err in denying Byers\u2019 motion for a directed verdict as to Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b630 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b120-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, TRIEWEILER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
