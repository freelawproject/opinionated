(Budget), Gregory D. Smith, and Harold M. Smith, in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County. The Respondents subsequently removed the case to federal court. However, after Cimmaron stipulated that its damages did not exceed $74,500.00, the case was remanded back to Montana state court. The Respondents then filed a motion to dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction. The District Court granted the Respondents\u2019 motion, and Cimmaron appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad\">\u00b62 We restate the sole issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b26-13\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in concluding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the Respondents?</p>\n<p id=\"b26-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b26-15\">\u00b64 Cimmaron is a Montana corporation with its principal place of business in Great Falls, Montana. Budget is a Pennsylvania corporation with its principal place of business in Washington, Pennsylvania. Budget is owned by Gregory Smith, who is a resident of Pennsylvania. In 1998, Budget entered into a collection agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>with Cimmaron, which provided that Budget would act as a collection agent for Cimmaron. Cimmaron also entered into a sales agreement which provided that Gregory\u2019s father, Harold Smith, would purchase several of Cimmaron\u2019s accounts receivable. Harold is a resident of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b65 On June 29, 1999, Cimmaron filed a complaint in Montana state court against Budget, Gregory, and Harold (the Respondents), which asserted eight claims, including breach of the collection agreement. The Respondents subsequently removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Montana. On February 18, 2000, Judge Donald Molloy transferred the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Cimmaron then voluntarily dismissed the case on March 6, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b66 On June 30,2000, Cimmaron filed a second complaint against the Respondents in Montana state court. Cimmaron\u2019s second complaint was nearly identical to its original complaint. The Respondents again removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Montana. However, on October 31,2000, Cimmaron stipulated that its damages did not exceed $74,500.00. The minimum amount in controversy necessary to confer federal diversity jurisdiction is $75,000.00. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). Accordingly, Judge Richard Cebull remanded the case back to Montana state court that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\u00b67 The Respondents filed a motion to dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction on December 4, 2000. On March 26, 2002, the District Court issued an order, granting the Respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss. Cimmaron appealed the District Court\u2019s order on April 24, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">\u00b68 A district court\u2019s determination that it lacks jurisdiction is a conclusion of law which we review to ascertain whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Seal v. Hart, </em>2002 MT 149, \u00b6 13, 310 Mont. 307, \u00b6 13, 50 P.3d 522, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err in concluding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the Respondents?</p>\n<p id=\"b27-11\">\u00b610  This Court applies a two-part test to determine whether a Montana court can exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant. <em>Threlkeld v. Colorado, </em>2000 MT 369, \u00b6 9, 303 Mont. 432, \u00b6 9, 16 P.3d 359, \u00b6 9. First, we ascertain whether personal jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>exists pursuant to Rule 4B(1), M.R.Civ.P. Second, we determine whether exercising such personal jurisdiction conforms with the traditional notions of fair pl\u00e1y and substantial justice embodied in the due process clause. <em>Threlkeld, </em>\u00b6 9. Therefore, it is axiomatic that if personal jurisdiction does not exist under the first part of the test, further analysis under the second part of the test is unnecessary. <em>Bi-Lo Foods, Inc. v. Alpine Bank, Clifton, </em>1998 MT 40, \u00b6 15, 287 Mont. 367, \u00b6 15, 955 P.2d 154, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b611 Rule 4B(1), M.R.Civ.P., provides in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">All persons found within the state of Montana are subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state. In addition, any person is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state as to any claim for relief arising from the doing personally, through an employee, or through an agent, of any of the following acts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">(a) the transaction of any business within this state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\">(b) the commission of any act which results in accrual within this state of a tort action[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">\u00b612 The first sentence of Rule 4B(1), M.R.Civ.P., states the requirements for general jurisdiction. The remainder of Rule 4B(1), M.R.Civ.P., states the requirements for specific long-arm jurisdiction. See <em>Bi-Lo Foods, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-18. In the instant case, the District Court concluded that it did not have general jurisdiction over the Respondents because the Respondents were not \u201cfound within\u201d Montana for purposes of Rule 4B(1), M.R.Civ.P. Cimmaron does not contest the District Court\u2019s conclusion regarding general jurisdiction. Therefore, we turn our attention to an analysis of whether the District Court lacked specific long-arm jurisdiction over the Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">\u00b613 Subsection (a) of Rule 4B(1), M.R.Civ.P., grants Montana specific long-arm jurisdiction over claims which arise from \u201cthe transaction of any business within this state\u201d (emphasis added). In the instant case, Gregory Smith traveled to Montana to negotiate the terms of the collection and sales agreements with Cimmaron. Accordingly, Cimmaron asserts that Gregory Smith personally, and on behalf of Budget and Harold Smith, transacted business within Montana by negotiating, signing and implementing the collection and sales agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">\u00b614  This Court has previously stated that: \u201c[A] non-resident does not subject himself to the jurisdiction of Montana by merely entering into a contract with a resident of Montana.\u201d <em>Edsall Construction Co., Inc. v. Robinson </em>(1991), 246 Mont. 378, 382, 804 P.2d 1039, 1042. We have further stated that: \u201cinterstate communication is an almost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>inevitable accompaniment to doing business in the modern world, and cannot by itself be considered a \u2018contact\u2019 for justifying the exercise of personal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Edsall, </em>246 Mont. at 382, 804 P.2d at 1042 (citations omitted). Finally, we have concluded that personal jurisdiction is not acquired through interstate communications made pursuant to a contract that is <em>to be performed in another state. Bird v. Hiller </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 467, 473, 892 P.2d 931, 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b615 In this case, the District Court noted that: (1) the Respondents\u2019 sole contacts with Montana are the agreements they entered into with Cimmaron; (2) the services that Budget was required to perform under the collection agreement were to be performed in Pennsylvania; (3). Cimmaron sent its account information to Budget in Pennsylvania in order to allow Budget to perform its services there under the collection agreement; and (4) all of the claims made by Cimmaron in its complaint pertain to actions the Respondents took, or failed to take, in Pennsylvania. Therefore, the District Court concluded that Cimmaron\u2019s claims against the Respondents did not arise from business that was transacted within Montana for purposes of Rule 4B(l)(a), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b616  On appeal, Cimmaron has not cited to any evidence which indicates that the claims it asserted against the Respondents in its complaint arose from business that was transacted within Montana under the meaning of Rule 4B(l)(a), M.R.Civ.P. The District Court did not err in reaching the conclusion it reached, based upon the facts before it. Consequently, we find no basis upon which to reverse the District Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b617 Subsection (b) of Rule 4B(1), M.R.Civ.P., grants Montana specific long-arm jurisdiction over claims which arise from \u201cthe commission of any act which results in accrual within this state of a tort action\u201d (emphasis added). In this case, Cimmaron\u2019s second complaint contained seven claims, including conversion of funds and misappropriation of assets. Cimmaron concedes that the actions of the Respondents which gave rise to its claims occurred outside of Montana. However, Cimmaron alleges that because it was detrimentally affected within this state by the Respondents\u2019 actions, such actions resulted in the accrual of a tort action within Montana for purposes of Rule 4B(l)(b), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b618 This Court addressed a similar situation in <em>Bird, </em>270 Mont. at 467, 892 P.2d at 931. In <em>Bird, </em>the Bird family retained Idaho attorney M. B. Hiller to represent them in a lawsuit which arose out of an automobile collision in Idaho. Hiller negotiated a settlement on behalf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>of the Birds; however, a disagreement arose over the amount of Hiller\u2019s fees. <em>Bird, </em>270 Mont. at 468-69, 892 P.2d at 932. When the settlement checks arrived, the Birds\u2019 new attorney sent them to Hiller, asking Hiller to sign and return them. Hiller refused to return the checks to the Birds. <em>Bird, </em>270 Mont. at 469-70, 892 P.2d at 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">\u00b619 The Birds filed a complaint against Hiller in Montana state court, alleging that Hiller had committed conversion, theft, fraud and deceit with regard to the settlement funds. The District Court dismissed the Birds\u2019 complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction over Hiller. <em>Bird, </em>270 Mont. at 470, 892 P.2d at 932. On appeal, the Birds argued that the tort of conversion accrued in Montana because Hiller had sent a letter to Montana, informing the Birds that he intended to retain the settlement funds. <em>Bird, </em>270 Mont. at 472, 892 P.2d at 933. We rejected the Birds\u2019 argument, however, and held that the alleged conversion accrued in Idaho because Idaho is where Hiller came into possession of, and allegedly asserted unauthorized control over, the settlement funds. <em>Bird, </em>270 Mont. at 472, 892 P.2d at 934, see also <em>Bi-Lo Foods, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28-31 (citing <em>Bird </em>with approval).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b620  In the instant case, as in <em>Bird, </em>the actions which gave rise to the alleged torts occurred outside of Montana, as the Respondents came into possession of, and allegedly misappropriated, Cimmaron\u2019s accounts receivable in Pennsylvania. Therefore, we hold that the Respondents\u2019 actions did not result in the accrual of a tort action within Montana, for purposes of Rule 4B(l)(b), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u00b621  Based upon the foregoing, we hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the Respondents. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b30-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
