Section 87 of the Criminal Code, making it a penitentiary offense to set at liberty or rescue, or attempt to set at liberty or rescue, a person \u25a0charged with a capital offense, etc., does not apply to a case where one procures tools, etc., to be conveyed to one in jail to facilitate his escape.

The act necessary to consummate the offense of setting at liberty a prisoner could only have been committed by the prisoner himself,\u2014all other acts up to this time were simply preparatory. This beginning not having been executed, leaves all other acts of Jackson and the plaintiffs in error as preparatory, and therefore no indictable offense was committed by them. 2 Bishop on Crim.

We admit that the words \u201cand rescue\u201d were surplusage, and the indictment would have been complete without those words. A nolle was entered as to the words \u201cand rescue,\u201d which left the indictment complete in charging the defendants with attempt to set at liberty said Green Patrick.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvF\" pgmap=\"529\">When words occur in an indictment which are not material, such words may be treated as surplusage, and a nolle entered as to such words, which was done in this case. 1 Bishop on Grim.

Suppose a motion to quash the indictment had been made in due time, for the reason that the indictment contained in the same count two distinct charges.. Certainly, the State\u2019s attorney could then elect which charge in the count he would go to trial upon.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-5\" pgmap=\"530\">As we understand, this has always been the practice in criminal pleadings. Inasmuch as the defendants did not desire to avail themselves of the right they had ip requiring the State\u2019s attorney to elect upon which charge he would prosecute them before the commencement of the trial, they certainly could not be permitted, after having gone into the trial, to avail themselves of any such right that they might have had before the commencement of the trial.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-6\" pgmap=\"530\">No amendment was made to the indictment.

The indictment has three counts. In the first it is charged that the parties named \u201cdid then and there, unlawfully and feloniously, attempt to set at liberty and rescue one Green Patrick from the common jail of said White county, the said Green Patrick being then and there confined in the said jail upon the charge of murdering one Charles Blue.\u201d The second count differs from the first only in the form of its phraseology. The third count charges an attempt to rescue Green Patrick, so being in jail, etc. Jackson pleaded guilty.</p> <p id=\"b530-9\" pgmap=\"530(24) 531(76)\">Upon the trial of the plaintiffs in error it was proved that Green Patrick was in the jail of White county on the charge of having murdered Charles Blue; that plaintiffs in error procured certain saws, knives and a file, and delivered them to Thomas Jackson, with the intention that he should deliver them to Green Patrick; that Jackson then took the saws, knives and file to the jail of White county, in the night time, and attempted to deliver them to Green Patrick, but being discovered by-the jailer before he had accomplished his purpose, he was prevented.</p> <p id=\"b531-5\" pgmap=\"531\">After the conclusion of the argument of the case, the State\u2019s attorney was allowed by the court to strike out of the indictment the words \u201cand rescue,\u201d and to enter a nolle prosequi as to the charge of \u201cattempt to rescue.\u201d The State\u2019s attorney then also entered a nolle prosequi as to the second and third counts of the indictment. The State\u2019s attorney has no authority to amend an indictment. The statutes allowing amendments do not apply to criminal cases.' (2 Hawkins\u2019 Pleas of the Crown, 336, b. 2, sec. 97; 1 Bishop on Crim. Proc. sec. 705.) There is nothing in our statute that purports to authorize any one to change or modify the language of an indictment as presented by the grand jury. The plaintiffs in error should therefore have been tried upon the indictment as it was presented by the grand jury, and it was error for the court to allow the State\u2019s attorney to strike out of the indictment the words \u201cand rescue,\u201d and to require the jury to render a verdict under the indictment as thus amended.</p> <p id=\"b531-6\" pgmap=\"531\">Plaintiffs in error requested the court to instruct the jury as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b531-7\" pgmap=\"531\">\u201cThat the statutes of the State of Illinois make a distinction between an attempt to set at liberty a person in the custody of an officer, and an attempt to convey tools to a person confined in jail, and that a person indicted for one of such offenses can not be convicted of the other.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b531-8\" pgmap=\"531(34) 532(19)\">\u201cThe court instructs the jury, for the defendants, that although you may believe, from the evidence, that the defendants on trial did offer to pay Jackson to take tools to the jail for Green Patrick, and loaned him money to buy the file testified to, yet you should find them not guilty.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b532-5\" pgmap=\"532\">But the court refused to do so, and the exception to this ruling presents the only question discussed in the arguments before us.</p> <p id=\"b532-6\" pgmap=\"532\">The jury, by their verdict, found the plaintiffs in error each \u201cguilty of attempting to set at liberty Green Patrick, in manner and form as charged in the first count of the indictment, \u201d and fixed their respective punishments at confinement in the penitentiary for the term of one year, and the payment of a fine of one dollar.</p> <p id=\"b532-7\" pgmap=\"532(250) 533(68)\">The conviction is claimed to be under section 87 of the Criminal Code, (Rev. Stat. 1874, chap. 38, p. 364,) which reads thus: \u201cWhoever sets at liberty or rescues, or attempts to set at liberty or rescue, a person charged with the commission of any capital offense or crime punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary, before the conviction of such person, shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary not exceeding five years,, and fined not exceeding $1000.\u201d The question therefore necessarily arises, what constitutes an \u201cattempt to set at liberty\u201d a prisoner? The statute does not define \u201can attempt,\u201d and we must hence resort to the common law to ascertain what, in a legal sense, is its meaning. Bouvier, in his dictionary, (vol. 1, p. 138,) says: \u201c-An attempt to commit a crime is an endeavor to accomplish it, carried beyond mere preparation but falling short of execution of the ultimate design, in any part of it.\u201d And Wharton says: \u201cTo make the act an. indictable attempt, it must be a cause, as distinguished from a condition.\u201d 2 Crim. Law, (7th ed.) sec. 2693. See, also, People v. Murray, 14 Cal. 159; Griffith v. State, 26 Ga. 493. Since the mere delivery of the saws, knives and file to Green Patrick, manifestly, could not open any way of escape from the jail, it is plain that there is no relation of cause and effect between that which Jackson tried to do, and that which the indictment \u25a0charges and the jury found was attempted. The saws, knives and file were only implements or tools that might be used in \u25a0effecting an opening in the jail, and procuring and attempting to deliver them to Green Patrick was therefore simply attempting to prepare for an attempt to make an escape. They were means, of, adopting the language of Wharton, \u201cconditions,\u201d in making an attempt to escape.</p> <p id=\"b533-5\" pgmap=\"533\">It is provided by section 92 of our Criminal Code, (Rev. Stat.. 1871, chap. 38, p. 365,) that \u201cwhoever conveys * * * into; any jail * * * any instrument, tool, or other thing adapted \u25a0 or useful to aid a prisoner in making his escape, with intent to facilitate the escape of any prisoner, * * * , shall be punished\u201d as therein provided,\u2014but which is only by confinement in the county jail and by fine. And since, by section 273 \u25a0of the same code, all attempts to commit offenses prohibited by law are indictable, and punishable by confinement in the \u00abcounty jail and by fine, it would seem clear that the offense here proved is that contemplated by these sections, and not * that contemplated by section 87 of the Criminal Code, supra, and that the punishment should not have been by confinement in the penitentiary, but by confinement in the county jail and fine, only. The circuit court therefore erfed in refusing to give the instructions asked, and also in overruling the motion for a new trial.</p> <p id=\"b533-7\" pgmap=\"533\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded to the. \u25a0court below for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b533-8\" pgmap=\"533\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
