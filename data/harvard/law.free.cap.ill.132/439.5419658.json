Chancery\u2014jurisdiction\u2014annexing territory to drainage district\u2014 remedy to question its validity. A court of equity has no jurisdiction of \u25a0a bill to question the validity of the annexation of land to a drainage \u2022district, under section 42 of the drainage act of 1885. The proper remedy in such case is a quo warranto against the drainage commissioners, requiring them to show by what warrant or authority they have made \u2022such annexation.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b437-11\" pgmap=\"437\">2.

The commissioners, claiming that appellant had connected drains of lands outside of the original drainage district with the ditches of the district, adopted a resolution,, pursuant to this section, declaring the lands the drains whereof are thus connected with the ditches of the district, annexed. to the drainage district. The hill charges that this is unauthorized and illegal, for several reasons which need not be specifically stated, since the sole question presented is the legality, \u2022of the annexation of these lands to the drainage district. Manifestly, this is purely a question of law, involving no principles of equitable cognizance, and a quo warranto to the drainage commissioners, requiring them to show by what warrant or authority they presume to make the annexation, would bring it before a court of law for its determination. The rule is too familiar to need the citation of authorities in its support, that it is always a sufficient objection to the granting of an injunction, that the party aggrieved has a full and adequate remedy at law.</p> <p id=\"b440-6\" pgmap=\"440\">Nor do we think it is of any pertinence that the bill does not attack the validity of the organization of the drainage district, but the territorial extent of it, only, and that it calls in \u2022question the authority of the commissioners to act, in the first instance, over the particular territory, and not the validity of acts already done by them on the faith of the validity of the annexation, as counsel argue. The question to be determined, in any view, is a purely legal question, and these circumstances invest it with no equitable element which a court,of law is incompetent to adjudicate. The remedy should- have been by quo warranto against the commissioners. Keigwin et al. v. Drainage Comrs. 115 Ill. 347; Evans et al. v. Lewis et al. 121 id. 478; Renwick et al. v.
