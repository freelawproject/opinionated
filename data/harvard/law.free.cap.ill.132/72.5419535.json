Advancements\u2014res judicata\u2014in respect to the fact whether there was an advancement. An administrator\u2019s final report set forth that one of the heirs had received his share of the estate by way of advancement, which was denied, and an exception taken to the report. The exception was sustained, and an order made on the administrator to-pay such heir\u2019s share, from which order the administrator appealed to the circuit court. Pending the appeal, certain other of the heirs filed their bill in chancery against the administrator and such heir, alleging the advancement to him, and praying to enjoin the heir from prosecuting his claim and the administrator from paying it. On a hearing, the bill was dismissed on the merits: Held, that the decree in the ' chancery suit settled all controversy as to such heir having received an advancement in full of his share of the estate, adversely to the contention of the administrator.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b70-9\" pgmap=\"70\">2.

On the 17th of November, 1879, he filed in the county court of said Lee county, and again on the 13th of September, 1880, an amended final report, duly sworn to, in which he*states, among other things, that the intestate had, in his lifetime, paid to certain of his heirs large sums of money, which he intended to be considered as advancements from his estate; that the amounts of such advancements received by said heirs were, to William B.

He also states in the said amended report, \u201cthat the advancements made to all the other heirs of William Long were not in writing, but the whole matter was so well understood between themselves that they \"have been willing to stand to and abide by the well known wish and desire of said William Long, deceased;\u201d that he has \u25a0settled with all of the heirs of the estate of William Long, and received full receipts from them, except the said William P.

Long, and the administrator, William B. Long, and obtained an injunction restraining said administrator from paying said order, and said William P. Long from further prosecuting his \u25a0said exceptions. On a hearing, that bill was dismissed and the injunction dissolved, and the decree was affirmed by the Appellate Court for the Second District, and re-affirmed here. (118 Ill. 638.) Thereupon the ease pending in the circuit court on appeal from the order of the county court was tried, and the judgment of the county court sustained. From this last judgment the administrator prosecuted an appeal to the Appellate Court for the Second District, and now brings the case to this court by further appeal.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-5\" pgmap=\"73\">Messrs.

This contention is based upon the theory, that notwithstand-' ing a part of the heirs of deceased may have in fact received from him the several sums reported by the administrator as advancements, yet, there being no charge in writing by said deceased, or acknowledgment in writing by said heirs, the same \u25a0can not be deemed to have been made in advancement\u2014relying on section 7, chapter 39, of the Bevised Statutes. We think the administrator\u2019s report itself is a full answer to this position, wherein it is shown, that although said advancements were not in writing, each of said heirs had been willing to stand to and abide by the well known wish and desire of said deceased, and that he, the administrator, had settled with each \u25a0of therfwpon the basis of their having received the said sums as advancements. We do not understand that heirs, or descendants of an intestate, who may in fact have received advancements from their ancestor, can not waive their right to have the same evidenced by writing,\u2014and this, on the proof made in this record, the heirs of William Long not excepting to said administrator\u2019s report have clearly done. There is no issue, here, between these heirs and the administrator, and if there was, no such mistake of law or fact has been shown in this case as would authorize a court to relieve these parties against the effect of their voluntary settlement with the ad..ministratpr, as set forth in his report.</p> <p id=\"b76-3\" pgmap=\"76\">Appellant makes the point that the circuit court erred in admitting parol evidence to show that some of the heirs had received their shares, or a part of them, in advancement. The particular evidence subject to this objection is not pointed 1 out. While it is true that where the question in issue is whether a gift or grant shall be deemed an advancement, parol evidence is incompetent to prove the intention with which it was made and received, yet, as between these parties, the-evidence offered was competent, in connection with the final report of the administrator.</p> <p id=\"AG1\" pgmap=\"76\">It is also objected that the court below improperly allowed appellee to testify in his own behalf. He seems to have testified to nothing except as to who were parties to the chancery proceeding referred to. We see no objection to his competency for that purpose.</p> <p id=\"b76-6\" pgmap=\"76\">We find no substantial error in this record, and are convinced that, on the showing made by the administrator in his final report, the county court was fully justified in making the order it did. The judgment of the Appellate Court must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b76-7\" pgmap=\"76\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
