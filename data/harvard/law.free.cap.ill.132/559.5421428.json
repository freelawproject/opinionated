The location of stations for the receipt and discharge of passengers and freight at points most desirable for the convenience of. travel and business being indispensable to the efficient operation of a railroad and the enjoyment of it by the public, the railway company can not be compelled, on the one hand, to locate stations at points where the cost of maintaining them will exceed the profits resulting therefrom to the company, nor allowed, on the other hand, to locate them so far apart as to practically deny to the communities on the line of the road reasonable access to its use.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b557-14\" pgmap=\"557\">2.

Smithers, which was in the year 1877; but there was no contract or agreement of any kind whatever, by or under which said place became a station or stopping place, nor was any property of any kind conveyed to it, or furnished or given to it, as an inducement to the company to make the place a station or stopping place.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-7\" pgmap=\"563(69) 564(86)\">\u201cDefendant further says, that in the year 1877, the said company having incurred a large mortgage and indebtedness, and being largely in arrear, the mortgage bondholders caused its railroad and other property to be placed in the possession and control of the United States Circuit Court in and for this district, which appointed said Henry W. Smithers receiver, and caused the mortgage to be foreclosed, and the entire property to be sold, under the decree of the said United States court, on the 22d day of December, 1881, and Josiah A. Horsey and Charles J. Canda then and there became the purchasers of said property, and that afterward, to-wit, on the 31st day of January, 1882, said purchasers conveyed the property to the St. Louis and Cairo Bailroad Company, which was organized under the general act for the incorporation of railroad companies in this State, on or about the 24th day of May, 1881.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-5\" pgmap=\"564\">\u201cDefendant further says, that the said St. Louis and Cairo Bailroad Company took possession of said railroad, and used and operated the same until the 1st day of February, 1886, when it leased its-railroad and other property to this defendant for the period of forty-five years; and that the said St. Louis and Cairo Bailroad Company, during the time it had possession and control of said railroad, stopped a part of its trains, but only a part of them, at said Hodges Park.</summary><summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-6\" pgmap=\"564\">\u201cDefendant further says, that long prior to the leasing aforesaid, the St. Louis and Cairo Bailroad Company had decided to discontinue the station aforesaid, and to make the station or stepping place at a point or place on its road one-half a mile north of the former station house at Hodges Park, aforesaid, and that said St. Louis and Cairo Bailroad Company, for some two or three years before said leasing, was accustomed fro stop its passenger trains at said place one-half a mile north, as aforesaid, and this defendant has only done what the St. Louis and Cairo Bailroad Company had decided to do, in view of the needs and demands of the public and of its own interests as a carrier of passengers and freight.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-7\" pgmap=\"564(78) 565(299)\">\u201cDefendant further says, that since the leasing aforesaid, and long before this petition was filed, it built a depot building on its road which is just twenty-eight hundred and fifty feet north of the station house building at Hodges Park; that the present station, as located, is much more convenient to and for the public than the former one; that it is nearer to more people who have occasion to use the road, either for the purpose of traveling or the shipment of freights, than the former one; that it is nearer and much more convenient to the farms and shippers in that vicinity, both in Alexander and Pulaski coun- \u25a0 ties; that Hodges Park, which contains less than two hundred people, both white and black, and men, women and children, and which has always done very little business of any kind, is on the very edge, or southward boundary line, of a large agricultural district, lying entirely north of it, and that from Hodges Park southward there is scarcely a farm of any kind for a distance of six miles; that four-fifths of the people who have heretofore gone to the former station to take passage on trains or to ship or receive freights, have had to pass by the present station and go on southward to the former station, and return the same way; that all the public roads in that vicinity lead to the present station; that the only bridge across Cache river, for a distance of ten miles up and down the river, which is the boundary between the two counties, and which has been maintained for fifty years, is only two or three hundred yards northeastward from the present station; that the present station is much nearer to every house and foot of ground in or at Hodges Park than is the court house in Cairo to any of the railroad station houses therein, or than is the station in Murphysboro to the public square therein, and that only to a portion of the people of Hodges Park is the present station less convenient than the former one, and to everybody else who is in anywise interested, the present station is much more convenient than the former one.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-5\" pgmap=\"565(90) 566(82)\">\u201cDefendant further says, that the said railroad, up to the time of the leasing aforesaid, was a narrow gauge road, the gauge thereof being three feet, and that the chief consideration for the leasing of the same was the undertaking by this defendant to rebuild said railroad and make it a standard gauge road, and that this defendant has rebuilt the road and made it a standard gauge road, and has operated the same as such for the period now of two years, and that the business of the line has thereby been largely increased, both in its local and through traffic, and that the wants and needs of this defendant and of the public require the location of its stations at the most convenient places, and that it is neither just nor equitable that the interests of this defendant or of the public should be controlled, limited or restricted, or defendant\u2019s hands tied, by what the other companies, or either of them, may have done or omitted to do.</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-5\" pgmap=\"566\">\u201cDefendant denies that either it or its lessor, the St. Louis and Cairo Eailroad Company, has, at any time, had knowledge of any contract, agreement or understanding, if any ever existed, between the Cairo and St. Louis Eailroad Company and any one else, whereby said Hodges Park was to be or become a station on said Cairo and St. Louis railroad.</summary><summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-6\" pgmap=\"566\">\u201cDefendant respectfully submits, that neither the facts set forth in the petition, nor the facts as they exist outside of it, in regard to.this matter, are sufficient to justify, or can justify, the court in interfering with the control and management of its railroad, or the matter of the location of stations thereon;

And defendant further says, the business of said Hodges Park and of the vicinity and neighborhood would not justify or require the maintenance of the two places or points as stations, and that the business of Hodges Park does not require that-the station should be maintained, as formerly, for its benefit or accommodation, without regard to the wants and requirements of the neighborhood at large.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFu\" pgmap=\"567\">The circuit court awarded the mandamus, as prayed.

Their location 'at points most desirable for the convenience of travel and business is alike indispensable to the efficient operation of the road and the enjoyment of it as a highway by the public. Necessarily, therefore, the company can not be compelled, on the one hand, to locate stations at points where the cost of maintaining them will exceed the profits resulting therefrom to the company, nor allowed, on the other hand, to locate them so far apart as to practically deny to communities on the line of the road reasonable access to its use. The duty to maintain or continue stations must, manifestly, rest upon the same principle, and a company can not therefore be compelled to maintain or continue a station at a point, when the welfare of the company and the community in general requires that it should be changed to some other point; and so we have held that a railway company can not bind itself, by contract with individuals, to locate and maintain stations at particular points, or to not locate and maintain them at other points. Bestor v. Wathen, 60 Ill. 138; Linder v. Carpenter, 62 id. 309; Marsh v. Fairbury, Pontiac and Northwestern Railroad Co. 64 id. 414; Snell &amp; Co. v. Pells, 113 id. 145; St. Louis, Jacksonville and Chicago Railroad Co. v. Mathers, 71 id. 592, and 104 id. 257.</p> <p id=\"b569-5\" pgmap=\"569\">The power of election in the location of the line of the railway, referred to in People v. Louisville and Nashville Railroad Co. 120 Ill. 48, results from the franchise granted by the charter to exercise the right of eminent domain, and is therefore totally different from the power of locating stations, which, from its very nature, is a continuing one. And so we said in Marsh v. Fairbury, Pontiac and Northivestern Railroad Co. supra, where a- bill had been filed for the specific performance of a \u25a0contract to locate and maintain a station at a particular point: \u201cEailroad companies, in order to fulfill one of the ends of their creation\u2014the promotion of the public welfare\u2014should be left to establish and re-establish their depots wherever the accommodation of the wants of the public may require.\u201d And so, again, we said in St. Louis, Jacksonville and Chicago Railroad Co. v. Mathers, supra: \u201cWhenever the public convenience requires that a station on a railroad should be established at a particular point, and it can be done without detriment to the interests of the stockholders, the law authorizes it to be established there, and no contract between the board of directors and individuals can be allowed to prohibit it.\u201d And in the very recent case of People v. Chicago and Alton Railroad Co. 130 Ill. 175, where we awarded a mandamus commanding the location and maintaining of a station at a point where no station had before been located and maintained, we said: \u201cIt is undoubtedly the rule that railway companies, in the absence of statutory provisions limiting and restricting their powers, are vested with a very broad discretion in the matter of locating, constructing and operating their railways, and of locating and maintaining their freight and passenger stations. This discretion, however, is not absolute, hut is subject to the condition that it must he exercised in good faith, and with a due regard to the necessities of the public.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b570-4\" pgmap=\"570(381) 571(104)\">The rule has been so often announced by this court that it is unnecessary to cite the cases, that a mandamus will never be awarded unless the right to have the thing done which is sought is clearly established. If the right is doubtful, the writ will be refused. The burden was on the relator to prove a case authorizing the issuing of the writ, and, in our opinion, that proof has not been made. The evidence does show that there are, of all ages and sexes, one hundred and eighty-two persons residing in Hodges Park, who are, by the change of the station, a little beyond a half a mile farther from the station ; but the evidence not only fails to show that they are a majority of the people resorting to that station for business or travel, or that they furnish the majority of the freight received, or shipped at that station, but it shows directly the reverse. It is not shown that there are either mining or manufacturing interests that would be accommodated by retaining the station at Hodges Park, and, so far as appears from the evidence, the business there is only that incident to the ordinary railway station in an agricultural community. The evidence-shows that, with a few unimportant exceptions, the entire farming interests of the country, accessible either to Unity or to Hodges Park, are best subserved by the change made of the station. Thus, John Hodges, a native of Unity, who was-sheriff of the county for ten years, and who also at one time-filled the office of the county treasurer, and who was thoroughly acquainted with the country in the vicinity of Unity and Hodges Park, testified: \u201cThe new station is more convenient-for the great majority of the people. The distance between the two depot buildings is twenty-eight hundred and fifty feet. I know of none to whom Hodges Park is more convenient than Unity, besides the people of Hodges Park. In going to Hodges-Park to transact business, nine-tenths of the people have to-pass by Unity, and so in returning.\u201d M. Easterday, who resided in Cairo, but who\" was a real estate agent and thoroughly familiar with the country and people in the'vicinity of Unity and Hodges Park, testified, to the effect that the chief part of the farming country was nearer to Unity than to Hodges Park, and that the roads and bridges favored travel to the former place; and he said: \u201cUnity is as much nearer the greater portion of the improved surrounding country as the distance from Unity to Hodges Park. I know of no one, beside the people of Hodges Park, to whom the present station is less convenient than the former one. Unity is more convenient to the farmers of the community.\u201d As we understand 'the record, this evidence is not contradicted.</p> <p id=\"AUt\" pgmap=\"571\">Charles Hamilton, the superintendent of respondent\u2019s road, testified, among other things: \u201cThere were two or three reasons for the removal of the station at Hodges Park to the other location. There was but a little side-track at Hodges Park, and there is one half a mile long at Unity. At Hodges Park the right of way is only fifty feet on each side of the track, .and there was no room to build a side-track, for the reason that the village street is on one side and a slough on the other; and besides, there was not business enough to sustain a station at both points.\u201d This evidence is unimpeached and uneontra\u2022dicted in any respect, and must therefore be accepted as true.</p> <p id=\"b571-5\" pgmap=\"571\">In People ex rel. v. Louisville and Nashville Railroad Co. and People v. Chicago and Alton Railroad Co. supra, the facts were \u25a0settled by the pleadings, and left no question but that the public welfare required stations to be maintained at the points where we held they should be maintained, and there is, therefore, nothing in either of those cases that militates against \u25a0our conclusion here.</p> <p id=\"b571-6\" pgmap=\"571\">The judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court, with direction to enter judgment for dhe respondent.</p> <p id=\"b571-7\" pgmap=\"571\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
