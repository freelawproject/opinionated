Carroll did not disclose this information in response to question 12(a) on the registration application, which asked if he presently was or had ever been \u201ca party to any action or legal proceeding, including civil, criminal, quasi-criminal, administrative, or any proceeding in a juvenile court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The records of the Carroll\u2019s 1981 indictment have been \u201cexpunged,\u201d but this does not excuse his failure to make the required disclosure. In <em>In re Application of Watson </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 220, 31 OBR 415, 509 N.E.2d 1240, we held that an applicant for admission to the bar must provide <em>all </em>information requested for review of his or her character and fitness, including matters that may have been expunged. Indeed, Carroll had been told of the <em>Watson </em>decision before submitting his application. Still, he did not disclose the information requested by question 12(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Carroll eventually revealed his having been a party in criminal and other proceedings just before or during a September 28, 1988 interview with members of the admissions committee. Subsequent interviews, however, unearthed various inconsistencies in respondent\u2019s explanation of the 1981 charges and his reasons for not making the required disclosures initially. These inconsistencies prevent us from concluding that respondent omitted his prior experiences with the criminal justice system by mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">Accordingly, the application for registration and to take the bar examination are disapproved. Carroll may reapply in March 1993 to take the bar examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">\n<em>Order accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b231-12\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
