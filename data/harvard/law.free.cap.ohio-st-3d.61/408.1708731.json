Limbach, supra, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 84, 552 N.E.2d at 643, we held:</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">\u201cThe permissive tax was <em>not </em>properly assessed. The decision of the BTA to the contrary is unreasonable and unlawful and is hereby reversed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The BTA, in finding that the permissive tax was proper, misinterpreted this holding and its decision in that regard is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">In <em>Rotek, supra, </em>at 81, 552 N.E.2d at 640, we identified the \u201cassessed items\u201d to include machine foundations, service and exhaust pits, metal floor plates, craneway columns and column foundations, ingot and storage racks, holding tanks, conduit, cable, and an electrical substation.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">The BTA, attempting to comply with our mandate, identified the items at issue to include only a punch press foundation, ring rolling mill pits and pit covers, craneway column foundations and supports, and holding tanks and furnace exhaust systems. The BTA found that those items were \u201cincorporated into structures\u201d and \u201cerroneously assessed.\u201d The BTA erred in failing to decide whether the additional items, namely, ingot and storage racks, crane-way columns, conduit, cable and the electrical substation, were also incorporated into structures and erroneously assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-14\">With regard to the electrical substation, Rotek contends that items of personal property were incorporated, under the referenced contracts for construction or modification, into a structure; and that such items became real property and were entitled to exception under R.C. 5739.01(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-15\">The Tax Commissioner argues that our mandate did not refer to the electrical substation and that Rotek should have raised its argument in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>motion for rehearing under Rule IX, Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The BTA may have been misled by our references in <em>Rotek, supra, </em>to \u201cassessed items,\u201d as earlier identified, \u201citems purchased under the Austin construction contract,\u201d \u201citems in question\u201d and \u201cthe property in question,\u201d or by our analysis of the issue of exception for \u201cadjunctive use\u201d as urged by Rotek.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Nevertheless, the BTA failed to decide whether items of tangible personal property involved in the Hatfield Electric Company contract, for initial construction, and the Electrical Equipment Company contract, for modification, of the electrical substation, were \u201cincorporated into a structure or improvement on and becoming a part of real property\u201d so as to qualify for the R.C. 5739.01(B) exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">We hold that the assertions of error by the Tax Commissioner are not well taken and are overruled, and, in that regard, the decision of the BTA is neither unreasonable nor unlawful and is affirmed. We hold that the errors asserted by Rotek are well taken, and to that extent the decision of the BTA is unreasonable and unlawful. Accordingly, the decision of the BTA is reversed in part and remanded to the BTA to determine whether the additional \u201cassessed items,\u201d as described above, including those items, if any, which were acquired in connection with the construction or modification of the electric substation, were \u201cincorporated into structures\u201d and erroneously assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">\n<em>Decision affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b580-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
