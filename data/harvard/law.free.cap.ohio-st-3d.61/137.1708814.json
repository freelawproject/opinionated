Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARF\">For the reasons which follow, we find that the trial court\u2019s judgment was based on an error of law, and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The trial court was concerned that expunging Greene\u2019s conviction would prevent this court from obtaining a complete picture of his fitness to practice law. However, this is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">Gov.Bar R. I(2)(B)(5) requires all applicants for admission to the bar to file a completed character questionnaire. Question 12 reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-11\">\u201c(a) State whether you have ever been, or presently are, a party to or otherwise involved (except as a witness) in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-12\"><em>{( </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-13\">\u201c(2) <em>any </em>criminal or quasi-criminal action or legal proceeding (whether involving a misdemeanor, minor misdemeanor, traffic offense, or felony) * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">Gov.Bar R. I(2)(B)(6) further requires the applicant to submit three authorization and release forms granting the Board of Commissioners on Character and Fitness access to sealed criminal records. Together, these provisions insure that this court will know the details of an expunged conviction when determining if an applicant is fit to practice law in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Thus, it was not necessary for the trial court to deny expungement in order to protect our inquiry into Greene\u2019s fitness to become a lawyer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the trial court, in its entry, also said that \u201c * * * criminal convictions of possible bar members should be open to the public for its inspection * * it is clear that the prime reason for denying expungement was rooted in a misconception of the law. Given that the trial court\u2019s decision was based on this erroneous assumption, the court of appeals was correct to reverse it and order the conviction expunged.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b310-7\">Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b310-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Resnick, J., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b310-11\">. It should be noted, however, that we are not passing on Greene\u2019s fitness to practice law at this time. That question is reserved for another proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b310-9\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AI7I\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court erred in denying expungement based on this court\u2019s need to know of the defendant\u2019s conviction for assault. However, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s affirmance of the court of appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">As a second reason for its decision, the trial court relied on its conclusion \u201cthat criminal convictions of possible bar members should be open to the public for its inspection in order that the public may satisfy itself as to the fitness of the Defendant to be employed as an attorney.\u201d This emphasis on the public\u2019s need to know was not misplaced and it should be supported by this court. R.C. 2953.32(C)(1)(e) and (2) mandate a weighing of the \u201cinterests of the applicant\u201d for expungement against \u201cany legitimate governmental needs to maintain such records.\u201d In setting forth a similar balancing test in . <em>Pepper Pike v. Doe </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 374, 377, 20 O.O.3d 334, 336, 421 N.E.2d 1303, 1306, this court stated that \u201cthe public interest in retaining records of criminal proceedings, and making them available for legitimate purposes, [typically] outweighs any privacy interest the defendant may assert.\u201d After having been amended in 1984, R.C. 2953.32 now provides for a \u201cgreater emphasis on the individual\u2019s interest in having the record sealed.\u201d <em>State v. Bissantz </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 112, 114, 532 N.E.2d 126, 128. Nevertheless, the public\u2019s need to know is a relevant, legitimate governmental need under the statute. Cf. <em>State v. Grove </em>(1986), 29 Ohio App.3d 318, 320, 29 OBR 418, 420, 505 N.E.2d 297, 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>The relevance of the public\u2019s need to know is heightened in this case, given the defendant\u2019s plans to become an attorney and the facts underlying his conviction. In an \u201cexpungement report\u201d apparently submitted to the trial court, it is alleged that the defendant threatened to kill his former girlfriend during a physical attack on her and her male companion at a social gathering. The assault charge regarding the girlfriend was dismissed at her request. Defendant was convicted of assault on the male. Even now, the events underlying defendant\u2019s conviction are only six years removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The court of appeals apparently believed that the public\u2019s need to know of such a conviction was not a \u201clegitimate\u201d governmental need because R.C. 2953.33(B) permits prospective employers to inquire into expunged convictions if the inquiry \u201cbears a direct and substantial relationship to the position for which the person is being considered.\u201d However, the interests of the defendant\u2019s future employers, including clients, are not illegitimate merely because R.C. 2953.33(B) affords them some additional protection. Nothing in that statute renders their interests irrelevant for purposes of the weighing process under R.C. 2953.32(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The Supreme Court of Ohio is charged by the Ohio Constitution with the admission to the bar and discipline of members of the bar. It seems paradoxical that we would declare as an abuse of discretion the decision of a trial judge that has the effect of preserving rather than eliminating a very important source of information from the public regarding a person who intends to become a member of the bar of Ohio. A person seeking the services of a lawyer should have available to him or her information that may affect the choice. Can we say that knowledge of an attorney\u2019s conviction for assault would never affect a person\u2019s decision to employ a lawyer? I think not. The issue is not whether every person who would engage the services of \u201cattorney\u201d Greene would search the public records to determine whether he had engaged in criminal conduct. The question is whether this court should eliminate the opportunity for such information to be found if it is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Although the trial court erred in considering this court\u2019s need to know, it did not err in weighing the public\u2019s need to know as a legitimate governmental need under R.C. 2953.32(C)(1)(e) and (2). On this latter basis, considering the facts of the case, the trial court could still deny the defendant\u2019s expungement motion without abusing its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Because the defendant is not entitled to expungement as a matter of law, it was error for the court of appeals to order the expungement of his assault conviction. We should remand the case to the trial court so that it can decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>whether to expunge the conviction without relying on this court\u2019s need to know as a basis for that decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b312-5\">Resnick, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
