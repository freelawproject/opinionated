Before this court the Tax Commissioner conceded that the matter should be remanded to the BTA upon this issue. Accordingly, the matter is hereby reversed and remanded for such determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">The Tax Commissioner contests the exception from taxation of the purchase and lease of certain motor vehicles used by East Ohio in connection with servicing and maintaining its production, transmission, and distribution systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">R.C. 5739.01(E) defines \u201cretail sale\u201d as \u201call sales except those in which the purpose of the consumer is: * * * (2) * * * to use or consume the thing transferred * * * directly in the rendition of a public utility service * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">R.C. 5739.01(Q) (now 5739.01[P]) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-14\">\u201c \u2018Used directly in the rendition of a public utility service\u2019 means: [1] that property which is to be incorporated into and will become a part of a consumer\u2019s production, transmission, transportation, or distribution system and which retains its classification as tangible personal property after such incorporation; [2] fuel or power used in the production, transmission, trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>portation, or distribution; and [3] tangible personal property used in the repair and maintenance of the production, transmission, transportation or distribution system, including only such motor vehicles as are specially designed and equipped for such use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Paragraph one of the syllabus in <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Kosydar </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 71, 67 O.O.2d 81, 310 N.E.2d 245, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">\u201cTangible personal property is \u2018used directly in the rendition of a public utility service\u2019 when its use conforms to one or more of the three standards set forth in R.C. 5739.01(Q).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The three \u201cstandards\u201d of the statute are identified above and, as apparent, the first and second standards have no application to the instant appeal. The third standard, however, is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The Tax Commissioner argues that the tangible personal property in dispute must be used directly in an exempt activity. As seen from the holding in <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec., supra, </em>if one of the three standards identified in the relevant statute applies, the exception is available to the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The initial question is whether it is necessary that motor vehicles be \u201cspecially designed and equipped\u201d for such use. Collateral questions deal with modifications to those vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">The General Assembly has established that only motor vehicles which are specially designed and equipped are entitled to exception. As suggested by the Tax Commissioner, a court in interpreting a statute must give effect to the words utilized, cannot ignore words of the statute, and cannot supply words not included. <em>Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Porterfield </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St.2d 24, 53 O.O.2d 13, 263 N.E.2d 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">The statute requires that the motor vehicles, to be excepted from taxation, be <em>both </em>specially equipped and specially designed. Nothing in the statute requires, however, that the motor vehicles be specially equipped and designed <em>by the vendor. </em>Thus, the purchaser is entitled to make the modifications. We agree with East Ohio\u2019s assertions that the purpose of the purchaser in acquiring the tangible personal property is an appropriate gauge of the use of the property. See <em>Carpenter v. Limbach </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 39, 17 OBR 32, 477 N.E.2d 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">Since we conclude that the vehicles must be both specially designed and specially equipped to qualify for the exception and since, except for its finding relative to hatchback cars, the BTA failed to determine whether the vehicles in question were specially designed, the cause is reversed and remanded to the BTA with instructions to determine whether these vehicles were also specially designed for use in the rendition of a public utility service.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The Tax Commissioner also contests the exception from taxation of the purchases of the storage tanks and pumps. In this regard, the BTA found that \u201c[t]he tanks are underground and are covered with a concrete pad. The pumps are mounted upon and bolted to the pad.\u201d Based upon its analysis of <em>Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Co. v. Lindley </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 15, 1 OBR 39, 437 N.E.2d 302, the BTA decided that tanks such as those here in question fall within the definition of \u201creal property\u201d and are excepted from taxation. We concur. The tanks and pumps which were acquired by East Ohio pursuant to construction contracts were \u201cstructures\u201d and, therefore, became real property, losing their characteristics as personal property, and were accordingly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">For the reasons stated above, the decision of the BTA is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded for further determination by the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\n<em>Decision affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b536-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
