We also agree with the penalty and conditions that the board recommended. However, we observe that respondent has previously undergone various forms of treatment for alcoholism while continuing to drink alcohol. Therefore, we order that respondent be suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for two years, with the last twenty-one months of that period stayed pending respondent\u2019s successful completion of a supervised and monitored two-year probation period, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>accordance with the conditions imposed by the board <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; however, we add as a condition that respondent abstain from the use of alcohol throughout the two-year period.
