(See Appendix, infra.) We have considered appellant\u2019s propositions of law, independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the evidence of mitigation, and reviewed appellant\u2019s death sentence for appropriateness and proportionality. Upon review, and for the reasons which follow, we uphold appellant\u2019s convictions and affirm the sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">Previous cases decided by this court are dispositive of the issues presented by appellant in his third, twelfth, thirteenth, fifteenth, twenty-fourth, twenty-sixth, thirtieth, thirty-first and thirty-second propositions of law and, without further comment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we reject these propositions of law. Likewise, we reject the arguments briefed by appellant under subsection A of his tenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">With respect to appellant\u2019s remaining propositions of law, upon careful review of the record and the applicable case law, we find no errors that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>undermine our confidence in the outcome of appellant\u2019s trial. Indeed, many of appellant\u2019s arguments have been waived. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s remaining propositions of law and address, in opinion form, only the following issues which merit some discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Prior to trial, appellant moved for a change of venue. This motion was denied. In his twenty-ninth proposition of law, appellant contends that the denial of his motion constitutes reversible error. Specifically, appellant alleges that adverse publicity concerning his trial resulted in public antagonism toward appellant such that he could not, and did not, receive a fair trial in Toledo.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">In <em>State v. Swiger </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St.2d 151, 34 O.O.2d 270, 214 N.E.2d 417, paragraph one of the syllabus, this court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">\u201cThe examination of jurors on their <em>voir dire </em>affords the best test as to whether prejudice exists in the community against the defendant, and where it appears that opinions as to the guilt of the defendant of those called for examination for jurors are not fixed but would yield readily to evidence, it is not error to overrule an application for a change of venue, in absence of a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d \u201c * * * connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. * * * \u201d <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 173, 404 N.E.2d 144, 149. We find, as did the court of appeals, that the trial court did not \u201cabuse its discretion\u201d in denying appellant\u2019s motion to change venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">A thorough review of the record before us demonstrates that many prospective jurors who were questioned concerning pretrial publicity had, indeed, obtained some form of information regarding appellant\u2019s crimes as a result of pretrial publicity. However, the record shows that a significant number of the prospective jurors were not influenced by the publicity, and that some knew nothing about the crimes. Furthermore, the record supports the conclusion that the impartiality of the members of the jury ultimately selected in the case at bar was not compromised by the pretrial publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">In his brief, appellant makes several representations regarding the nature and extent of pretrial publicity and the resulting public outrage directed toward appellant. However, these matters are not substantiated by the record and, hence, will not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>The decision whether to grant or deny a motion for change of venue rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. Appellant has presented no persuasive argument indicating that the trial court abused its discretion. Thus, we reject appellant\u2019s twenty-ninth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">On the first day of testimony, the trial judge instructed the jury to avoid media accounts of the trial. In his twenty-third proposition of law, appellant contends that this instruction represents a failure of the trial court to adequately instruct the jury to avoid potentially prejudicial media accounts of the court\u2019s proceedings. Appellant contends that during the voir dire, the potential jurors were not instructed to avoid media accounts of the proceedings and, thus, the jurors were not impartial or indifferent. Appellant asserts, therefore, that his constitutional rights, as protected by the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Sections 10 and 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">In <em>Warner v. State </em>(1922), 104 Ohio St. 38, 44, 135 N.E. 249, 251, we stated that \u201c * * * in criminal cases it is not so much a question of what prejudice might be inferred from irregularities, omissions and technical errors, but rather a question [of] what error has probably intervened as shown by the record.\u201d In the instant case, appellant has failed to put forward evidence suggesting that any juror accessed prejudicial information between the voir dire and the first day of trial, when the jury was instructed as to media coverage. Moreover, despite the fact that several jurors acknowledged exposure to media coverage, these same jurors indicated that they could make an impartial evaluation of the evidence. Therefore, we find that appellant\u2019s constitutionally guaranteed right to a trial by an impartial jury was not jeopardized. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s twenty-third proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">In the guilt phase, the trial court instructed the jury on the element of \u201cpurpose.\u201d In his twentieth proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court\u2019s instruction was in error. With respect to the element of purpose necessary to sustain a conviction of aggravated murder or murder, appellant contends that the instruction \u201ccreated an unconstitutional conclusive presumption * * *.\u201d Judge Abood\u2019s instruction to the jury was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">\u201cThe purpose with which a person does an act is determined from the manner in which it is done, the means used, and all other facts and circumstances in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>\u201cIf a wound is inflicted upon a person with a deadly weapon in a manner calculated to destroy life, the purpose to cause the death may be inferred from the use of the weapon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Appellant asserts that this instruction is unconstitutional because the trial judge used the word \u201cinferred\u201d without adding a qualification that such an inference must be non-conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">In <em>Sandstrom v. Montana </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39, the United States Supreme Court defined a conclusive presumption as an \u201cirrebuttable direction\u201d to the jury to find intent upon proof of the defendant\u2019s voluntary action. <em>Id. </em>at 517, 99 S.Ct. at 2456, 61 L.Ed.2d at 47. Thus, a conclusive presumption unconstitutionally shifts the burden of persuasion to the defendant to disprove an element of the crime charged. <em>Id. </em>In the instant case, appellant argues that the jury\u2019s instruction contained a conclusive presumption which relieved the state of having to establish the material element of criminal intent. We do not agree. The fact that the words \u201cmay be\u201d modify the word \u201cinferred\u201d in the trial judge\u2019s instruction to the jury supports such a conclusion. No reasonable jury could have felt compelled to presume intent on the basis of the trial judge\u2019s instruction. Therefore, the instruction was not a conclusive presumption. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s twentieth proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">R.C. 2903.01(B) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\">\u201cNo person shall purposely cause the death of another while committing or attempting to commit, or while fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit * * * <em>aggravated robbery </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">Whoever violates R.C. 2903.01(B) is guilty of aggravated murder. R.C. 2903.01(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">In his seventh proposition of law, appellant claims that the trial court erred in failing to grant appellant\u2019s motions for acquittal since, according to appellant, the evidence is insufficient to sustain his conviction for aggravated murder. Specifically, appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to show that he possessed the mental state necessary to support a finding that appellant committed or attempted to commit aggravated robbery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>The evidence in this case shows that appellant told Ogle to stop her vehicle and instructed her to exit the vehicle. Appellant then shot Ogle in the head and neck at close range, took her vehicle, and instructed Glover to drive the vehicle to Glover\u2019s home. We believe that, based upon this evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude that appellant <em>knowingly </em>obtained or exerted control over Ogle\u2019s property without her consent, and with the <em>purpose </em>to deprive Ogle of the property. Therefore, the evidence is sufficient to show that appellant committed a \u201ctheft offense\u201d as that term is defined in R.C. 2913.01 (see R.C. 2913.02[A][1]) and, hence, the state adduced sufficient evidence regarding the mental state necessary to prove the aggravated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Appellant also suggests that there is insufficient evidence to show that he purposely caused Ogle\u2019s death <em>while </em>committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery. Again, we disagree. In our judgment, the evidence is sufficient to warrant the inference that appellant purposely killed Ogle to deprive Ogle of her property and to obtain it for himself or another.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Accordingly, we find no error and, thus, appellant\u2019s seventh proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">In his eighth proposition of law, appellant contends that his convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence. After a thorough review of the entire record before us, we are convinced that the evidence establishes appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we reject appellant\u2019s eighth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">In his ninth proposition of law, appellant argues that his aggravated murder conviction was based solely on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, <em>i.e., </em>Glover Heard, in violation of former R.C. 2923.03(D), which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>\u201cNo person shall be convicted of complicity under this section solely upon the testimony of an accomplice, unsupported by other evidence.\u201d Am.Sub. H.B. No. 511 (134 Ohio Laws, Part II, 1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Apparently, Glover was indicted for the aggravated murders of Ogle and Tincher and pled guilty to one count of complicity to murder. Thus, for purposes of this appeal, we will assume that Glover was an \u201caccomplice\u201d to the aggravated murder within the meaning of former R.C. 2923.03(D).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">In <em>State v. Pearson </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 291, 16 0.0.3d 332, 405 N.E.2d 296, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus, this court held, with regard to former R.C. 2923.03(D), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">\u201c1. R.C. 2923.03(D) can prohibit convictions for principal offenses, as well as prohibit convictions for the complicity offenses described in R.C. 2923.-03(A).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">\u201c2. In order for the prosecution to satisfy the corroboration requirement of R.C. 2923.03(D), independent evidence must support an accomplice\u2019s testimony, and must tend to connect the accused with the alleged crime or must tend to identify the accused as a guilty actor. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">In the case at bar, Glover\u2019s testimony implicating appellant in the aggravated murder is supported by independent, corroborating evidence. Appellant shot Tincher in the head at close range. Ogle was killed in a similar manner. The weapon used to kill Tincher was the same weapon used to kill Ogle. The murder weapon was owned by appellant. Appellant admitted that he was in the Hill Avenue apartment on the morning of the murders. Furthermore, appellant led police to Ogle\u2019s body knowing exactly where Ogle\u2019s body would be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">We find that the state produced sufficient evidence to satisfy the corroboration requirement of former R.C. 2923.03(D) as we have heretofore understood that requirement. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s ninth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">In the penalty phase, appellant presented two witnesses in an attempt to establish the existence of R.C. 2929.04(B) mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">One of appellant\u2019s witnesses, Dr. Gerald Briskin, testified on direct examination that appellant, as a juvenile, had committed a manslaughter offense. During closing argument in the penalty phase, the state made several remarks concerning appellant\u2019s juvenile offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>In his fourth proposition of law, appellant claims that the state introduced evidence concerning appellant\u2019s juvenile record and used it as a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The record before us clearly shows that appellant introduced the evidence concerning his juvenile record. While, perhaps, the prosecution should not have commented further regarding the juvenile offense, we fail to find that appellant was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s comments since appellant, through his witness, had already informed the jury of the prior offense. Further, we are not persuaded that appellant\u2019s juvenile record was considered by the jury or the judge as a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance. The jury was never instructed to consider the juvenile offense as an aggravating factor and, therefore, we assume that the juvenile offense was not considered as an aggravating circumstance. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s fourth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The subject of appellant\u2019s second proposition of law concerns a note received by the trial judge during the jury\u2019s penalty phase deliberations. The note was signed by juror Georgia Lukasiewicz and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">\u201cAfter I saw Dr. Briskin on the stand I decided I should ask you if I am allowed to be a juror because I am a psychiatric patient and early in 1964 I had a dream after shock treatments. I saw Dr. Briskin in a dream. He was fat, carried a brief case and a clock. I thought he looked like SATAN. I never recall having seen this man in person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">After receiving this note, the trial judge questioned juror Lukasiewicz concerning her ability to fairly and impartially consider the evidence presented in the penalty phase. Juror Lukasiewicz affirmatively asserted that her dream would not affect her ability to decide the case and, thus, the trial court instructed her to return to the jury room and to continue deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">Appellant suggests that juror Lukasiewicz was unqualified to sit as a juror due to \u201cexhibited bias\u201d and \u201cabnormal reasoning.\u201d We have reviewed juror Lukasiewicz\u2019s responses to the questions asked of her both before trial and during the penalty phase. We find that juror Lukasiewicz adequately responded to these questions and that her statements indicate her ability to distinguish between her dreams on the one hand and reality on the other hand. Nothing in the record affirmatively establishes that juror Lukasiewicz was biased. Under these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion and, hence, appellant\u2019s second proposition of law is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>X</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">In his eighteenth proposition of law, appellant contends that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel during the trial court proceedings. In his nineteenth proposition of law, appellant contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel in his -appeal to the court of appeals. In our judgment, appellant has failed to meet his burden of establishing ineffective assistance under the standards set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, and, accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s eighteenth and nineteenth propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">XI</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Having considered each of appellant\u2019s propositions of law, we must now independently review the death sentence for appropriateness and proportionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">In the case at bar, appellant shot Ogle in the head and neck at close range during the course of an aggravated robbery. Appellant also shot Tincher in the head at close range. Again, we find that the aggravating specifications of which appellant was found guilty, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) and (7), are clearly shown in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">Appellant introduced evidence on the mitigating factor that he lacked a substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law because of a mental disease or defect. We find that appellant did not establish the existence of this R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) factor by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">Appellant presented evidence concerning his family background and violent and unstable family environment. We conclude that these factors are entitled to some, but very little, weight in mitigation. Additionally, we have considered the youth of appellant (he was twenty years old at the time of the offenses) and conclude that this R.C. 2929.04(B)(4) factor is entitled to some weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">Weighing the mitigating factors against the aggravating circumstances, we conclude that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">Finally, we have undertaken a comparison of the sentence in this case to those in which we have previously imposed the death penalty. We have upheld the death penalty in cases involving multiple murders (see, <em>e.g., State v. Moreland </em>[1990], 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 552 N.E.2d 894) and in cases involving robbery-murder (see, <em>e.g., State v. Greer </em>[1988], 39 Ohio St.3d 236, 530 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>382). We find that appellant\u2019s death sentence is neither excessive nor disproportionate.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b590-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, H.
