Michael Shay, </em>for appellee Donna L. Lutz.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b625-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AMI\">Former Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-13(I)(l) (now 4121:1-5-14[F][4][a]) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">\u201c(I) Lifting of personnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">\u201cLift trucks equipped with vertical only, or vertical and horizontal travel controls using a limited carriage or forks for lifting of personnel shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">\u201c(1) Have a platform with standard guardrails, intermediate rail, and toe-boards, and a mast guard seventy-two (72) inches in height, all securely fastened to the lifting carriage or forks[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">It is undisputed that the cage was not securely attached to the forklift. It is also uncontested that on the date of injury, neither decedent nor Harvey checked to see whether the cage was secured, despite appellant\u2019s clear directive to do so. Appellant claims that decedent\u2019s unilateral negligence precludes a finding that appellant violated a specific safety requirement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">In <em>State, ex rel. Frank Brown &amp; Sons, Inc., v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 162, 524 N.E.2d 482, we found no specific safety violation where an employee did not follow his employer\u2019s instructions and was injured as a result. We reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-12\">\u201cAs such awards [VSSRs] are intended to penalize employers for failure to comply with specific safety requirements, only those acts within the employer\u2019s control should serve as the basis for establishing a VSSR violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164, 524 N.E.2d at 485.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">We thus held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-14\">\u201c * * * A VSSR award is precluded by claimant\u2019s unilateral negligence in removing the top cross brace without first installing a corresponding cross brace beneath, contrary to instructions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">The case at bar contains comparable employee negligence. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and a writ of mandamus allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-16\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b625-17\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
