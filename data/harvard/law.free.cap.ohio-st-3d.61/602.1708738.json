Even though appellant did not file a copy of his notice of appeal in this court within thirty days of filing it with the court of appeals as required by Section 1(B), Rule I of the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of Ohio, we exercise our discretion and decline to dismiss the appeal under Section 1, Rule II. This section states that for a violation of Section 1(B), Rule I, \u201cthe Supreme Court <em>may </em>refuse to accept such copy for filing or <em>may </em>dismiss the appeal, on its own motion or on motion of a party, for lack of prosecution.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">Appellant\u2019s complaint stated that he had a hearing, but that he had not received the due process afforded him by <em>Morrissey v. Brewer </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484. However, the complaint failed to state any specific violations of the <em>Morrissey </em>requirements or to plead sufficient facts or offer any proof that would entitle him to a writ of mandamus. We held in <em>Mitchell v. Lawson Milk Co. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 190, 193, 532 N.E.2d 753, 756, that unsupported conclusions are not considered admitted and are not sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">After the final judgment was entered, appellant moved to amend his complaint to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted. The court of appeals denied that motion. Appellant contends that his amendment should be allowed pursuant to Civ.R. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on Civ.R. 15 is misguided. His amendment was not timely made and no apparent reason was given for the delay. The court in <em>Meadors v. Zaring Co. </em>(1987), 38 Ohio App.3d 97, 99, 526 N,E.2d 107, 109, held that \u201c[w]here a motion for leave to amend is not timely tendered and no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>reason is apparent to justify the delay, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow the amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b774-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
