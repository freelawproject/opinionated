Ramirez, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 630, 23 O.O.3d 518, 433 N.E.2d 586. <em>Ramirez </em>authorizes temporary total compensation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\">\u201c \u2018 * * * [UJntil one of the following three things occur: (1) he [claimant] has returned to work, (2) his treating physician has made a written statement that he is capable of returning to his former position of employment, or (3) the temporary disability has become permanent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632, 23 O.O.3d at 519, 433 N.E.2d at 588.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">We must determine whether appellee can receive temporary total disability compensation during the period that he was working at UVC but was unable to return to Rawac \u2014 the job at which he was injured. For the reasons to follow, we find that he cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">Initially, we disagree with appellant\u2019s claim that \u201cformer position of employment\u201d encompasses all jobs held on the date of injury, and that by returning to one, appellee effectively returned to his former position. This argument ignores <em>State, ex rel. McGraw, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 56 Ohio St.3d 137, 564 N.E.2d 695, which held that \u201cformer position of employment\u201d encompasses only one job \u2014 that at which the claimant was injured. See, also, <em>State, ex rel. Horne, v. Great Lakes Constr. Co. </em>(1987), 18 Ohio St.3d 79, 18 OBR 117, 480 N.E.2d 753. Here, appellee\u2019s \u201cformer position of employment\u201d is at Rawac \u2014 the job at which he was injured and to which he cannot return.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">Appellee, on the other hand, incorrectly assumes that termination of temporary total disability compensation is warranted only where the claimant resumes his former position. Such an argument ignores <em>Ramirez\u2019s </em>first prong \u2014 that temporary total compensation may be denied where the claimant has returned to work. In <em>State, ex rel. Nye, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 75, 22 OBR 91, 488 N.E.2d 867, we held that \u201cwork\u201d as used in <em>Ramirez, </em>referred to <em>any </em>\u201csubstantially gainful employment,\u201d not merely the former position of employment. To hold otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-11\">\u201c * * * would permit the payment of temporary total disability benefits to a claimant who has chosen to return to full-time work at a job other than his former employment. In such a case, the claimant is no longer suffering the loss of earnings for which temporary total disability benefits are intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>compensate. * * * This interpretation is particularly compelling in view of the fact that permanent partial disability benefits under R.C. 4123.57 in the nature of damages are available to a claimant who has returned to work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77, 22 OBR at 93, 488 N.E.2d at 870.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Appellee\u2019s reliance on <em>State, ex rel. Diversitech Gen. Plastic Film Div., v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 381, 544 N.E.2d 677, is misplaced. There, a claimant who was medically unable to return to his former job took a light duty job pursuant to a rehabilitation contract entered into by his employer and the commission. The claimant was subsequently laid off from the light duty job, and, remaining unable to return to the job at which he was injured, sought temporary total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">His employer argued that the claimant\u2019s acceptance of the second job represented an abandonment of the former position and precluded further temporary total compensation. We disagreed, finding no abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\"><em>Diversitech </em>is readily distinguishable. First, no rehabilitation contract presently exists. More importantly, the claimant in <em>Diversitech </em>was not seeking temporary total compensation over the same period in which he received wages from his light duty job.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">We thus find that appellee was not entitled to temporary total disability compensation during the period that he received wages from UVC but was unable to return to Rawac. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b771-10\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Wright and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b771-11\">Douglas and Resnick, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b771-12\">Alice Robie Resnick, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQm\">dissenting. I must respectfully dissent from the majority opinion. The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>State, ex rel. Nye, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 75, 22 OBR 91, 488 N.E.2d 867, is misplaced. The scenario set forth in <em>Nye </em>did not occur in this case. In this case appellee here was employed at two jobs: a full-time job at Rawac Plating Company and part-time at Upper Valley Cinema (UVC). When appellee returned to his part-time job he did not indicate that he was abandoning an intention of returning to his former full-time job at Rawac Plating Company, where he was injured. Indeed, at the time appellee returned to light duty work, his attending physician continued to certify that appellee was not able to return to his former position at Rawac.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">The purpose of temporary total disability compensation is to compensate the injured worker for loss of earnings. <em>State, ex rel. Bunch, v. Indus. Comm. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 423, 427, 16 O.O.3d 449, 451, 406 N.E.2d 815, 818. Appellee was unable to return to his duties at Rawac. He should not be penalized for attempting to perform some type of limited gainful employment. In <em>State, ex rel. Ramirez, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 630, 23 O.O.3d 518, 433 N.E.2d 586, this court set forth the criteria for determining when temporary total compensation benefits should cease. I do not believe that when we stated, \u201c * * * [the claimant] has returned to work,\u201d we meant the situation which is presented to us today. Rather, \u201creturn to work\u201d means return to full-time employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Appellee still experienced a loss of earnings from Rawac even after he returned to part-time work at UVC. To deny appellee temporary total disability compensation upon the basis that he has returned to his former part-time employment flies in the face of the purpose of temporary total disability benefits. I would find that the Industrial Commission abused its discretion, as the court of appeals did, and permit appellee to receive temporary total disability benefits from February 25, 1986 through February 26, 1987. Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the appellate court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b772-6\">Douglas, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
