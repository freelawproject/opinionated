(See Appendix, <em>infra.) </em>We have considered appellant\u2019s propositions of law and have reviewed the death sentence for appropriateness and proportionality. Upon review, and for the reasons which follow, we uphold appellant\u2019s convictions and affirm the sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">R.C. 2929.05 requires this court to review capital cases in a certain manner but does not require this court to address and discuss, in opinion form, each and every proposition of law raised by the parties. See <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 520 N.E.2d 568, 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">In the case at bar, appellant\u2019s arguments present a number of issues which have previously been addressed by this court, and which have been resolved in a manner unfavorable to appellant. We adhere to our positions on these issues. Furthermore, many of appellant\u2019s arguments have been waived. Upon reviewing each of appellant\u2019s propositions of law, we fail to find any errors that compromise the integrity and reliability of the trial court\u2019s findings. We discuss, in detail, those issues which have received, in the past, only limited or no consideration by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b351-14\">On January 8, 1988, appellant was arraigned on the aggravated murder charges. Appellant\u2019s appointed attorney was not present at the arraignment. Appellant entered a plea of not guilty and bond was set at $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-15\">In his twentieth proposition of law, appellant claims that it was <em>\u201cper se </em>\u201d constitutional error to arraign him on capital charges in the absence of his appointed counsel. Appellant relies primarily on <em>Hamilton v. Alabama </em>(1961), 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114. We find that appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Hamilton </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>Hamilton </em>stands for the proposition that prejudice can be presumed from the absence of counsel at an arraignment on capital charges. However, the decision in <em>Hamilton </em>was based upon the crucial nature of arraignment under Alabama law. In <em>Dean v. Maxwell </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 193, 22 0.0.2d 144, 187 N.E.2d 884, this court explained the difference between Alabama law and Ohio law and rejected a contention similar to the one set forth by appellant herein. Based upon our holding in <em>Dean, </em>appellant must demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the absence of counsel at the arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In an attempt to show prejudice, appellant claims that the requirements of former Crim.R. 10(A) and (C)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were not properly followed at his arraignment. Upon review of the record, we find that appellant suffered no prejudice in this regard. At his arraignment, appellant pled not guilty, made no incriminating statements, and lost no crucial rights. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s twentieth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In his second proposition of law, appellant contends that there is insufficient evidence to sustain his convictions. Similarly, in his tenth and eleventh propositions of law, appellant claims that his convictions were contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. Appellant\u2019s contentions are not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">In the case at bar, Hatch saw appellant shoot Bunner. Following the shooting, Birmingham observed appellant striking Bunner with his fists as Bunner lay dying from bullet wounds. Appellant was forcibly removed from the apartment. Next, a man was seen driving in the vicinity of the murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>scene in a highly suspicious manner. The driver attempted to elude the police but his attempt was unsuccessful. Police officers identified appellant as the driver of the vehicle. The evidence shows that appellant was the only occupant in the vehicle. Police found the murder weapon along the chase route. The weapon was later identified as belonging to appellant. At trial, the two eyewitnesses to the murder identified appellant as the murderer. Evidence exists which, if believed, indicates that appellant was not invited into the apartment. Moreover, the jury could reasonably have found that once appellant began his violent assault on Bunner, any privilege or consent that appellant may have had to enter the apartment was withdrawn. See <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">We find the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt to be overwhelming. We reject appellant\u2019s second, tenth and eleventh propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The trial court sentenced appellant on both counts of aggravated murder. The court of appeals determined that the trial court erred in this regard and, thus, declared the two offenses merged.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">In his sixth proposition of law, appellant maintains that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s error in sentencing him for both offenses. We disagree. Sentencing appellant for both offenses was merely a procedural error which did not affect appellant\u2019s substantial rights. See <em>State v. Brown </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 305, 317-318, 528 N.E.2d 523, 538-539. In our judgment, the error was sufficiently corrected by the court of appeals. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sixth proposition of law is not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">In his fifteenth proposition of law, appellant contends that his conviction and sentence for aggravated murder must be reversed due to alleged errors by the trial court in instructing the jury during the guilt and penalty stages of appellant\u2019s trial. However, appellant failed to timely object to the instructions and/or failed to raise the alleged error in the court of appeals with the exception of the so-called <em>\u201cAllen </em>\u201d charge given by the trial court during the jury\u2019s deliberations in the penalty phase.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, our discretionary review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>these issues must proceed, if at all, under the plain error analysis of Crim.R. 52(B). See <em>State v. Moreland </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 62-63, 552 N.E.2d 894, 899-900. Therefore, we will not reverse appellant\u2019s conviction unless we determine that the outcome of the trial would clearly have been otherwise had the error not occurred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that appellant must be found to be the principal offender of the aggravated murder offense in order for appellant to be found guilty of the R.C. 2929.-04(A)(7) death penalty specification. Additionally, appellant argues that because the verdict forms do not indicate that the jury found appellant to be the principal offender, the state failed to prove an essential element of its case,</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">We find no reversible error. The evidence in this case does not reasonably suggest that Bunner\u2019s murder was committed by more than one offender. Thus, appellant was either the principal offender, or he committed no offense at all. We conclude that, under these circumstances, any error in failing to instruct the jury on the principal offender issue was not outcome determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Appellant also contends that the trial court committed prejudicial error during the penalty phase by failing to instruct the jury on residual or \u201clingering\u201d doubt. The issue of residual doubt was addressed in the majority opinion, and the concurring and dissenting opinion, in <em>State v. Watson </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 1, 17-18, 18-21, 572 N.E.2d 97, 111, 111-113. In the case at bar, no further comment on this issue is warranted as there is no residual doubt of appellant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">As to the remaining issues presented in appellant\u2019s fifteenth proposition of law, we find no errors arising to the level of \u201cplain error.\u201d Accordingly, appellant\u2019s fifteenth proposition of law is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">Appellant\u2019s third proposition of law concerns a note received by the trial judge during the jury\u2019s penalty phase deliberations. The note was signed by juror Martha Marsh and indicated that Marsh wanted to go home. Approximately fifty minutes after the note was received by the trial judge, and before the trial judge could respond to Marsh\u2019s request, the jury reached a decision recommending that appellant be sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">Appellant claims that the trial court erred in failing to declare a mistrial upon receiving the note from Marsh. Appellant contends that the alleged error was prejudicial since, according to appellant, Marsh violated her oath as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>a juror in order to quickly end the deliberations and, thus, her service as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The record before us does not support appellant\u2019s claim that Marsh or any other juror acted improperly during deliberations. The jury was instructed regarding its duties and responsibilities in the penalty phase and we must assume that the jury performed its obligations as instructed. Every member of the jury was polled and each member stated that the recommendation of death was his or her individual recommendation. We are satisfied that appellant was not prejudiced by the claimed error and, therefore, we reject appellant\u2019s third proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In his fourteenth proposition of law, appellant argues that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel throughout his trial. We find that appellant has failed to meet his burden of establishing ineffective assistance under the standards set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s fourteenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">In his fifth proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion does not comply with R.C. 2929.03(F) in several respects. Specifically, appellant suggests that the trial court committed prejudicial error by failing to specify an aggravating circumstance, by failing to explain why the aggravating circumstance outweighed any mitigation, and by failing to consider residual doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">In its sentencing opinion, the trial court recited the relevant facts of the case and, in doing so, impliedly made a finding that the only aggravating circumstance at issue was proven. Further, we believe that the conclusion reached by the trial court in weighing the aggravating circumstance against any mitigation was virtually inescapable. Additionally, given our finding on the issue of residual doubt, the trial court did not err in failing to consider the issue. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion was sufficient and that appellant\u2019s fifth proposition of law lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">In the court of appeals, a page limitation was imposed on the length of appellant\u2019s merit brief. Appellant was permitted to submit a brief not exceeding eighty-five pages of argument. In his twenty-second proposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>law, appellant claims that the court of appeals erred in imposing this limitation on the length of his brief. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">While we recognize that all alleged errors must be raised in the court of appeals to preserve the alleged errors for review, we find that a brief of eighty-five pages is more than adequate to deal with the issues in the case at bar. Before this court, appellant was permitted to submit a brief of unlimited length. Appellant\u2019s brief is comprised of one hundred ninety-six pages of argument. At oral argument, appellant focused primarily on two issues raised in his brief. One of these two issues is discussed in appellant\u2019s brief on page 101 under subsection (A)(3) of proposition of law fifteen. The page limitation imposed by the court of appeals may have been helpful in forcing appellant to focus on key issues. Succinctness of argument is a beneficial trait in the art of appellate advocacy. We find that appellant was not prejudiced by the page limitation in the court of appeals as the limitation was reasonable and afforded appellant ample opportunity to concisely present all his arguments before the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">X</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In his seventh proposition of law, appellant claims that the court of appeals erred in referring to matters outside the record while reviewing the propriety of appellant\u2019s death sentence. However, given the fact that appellant never presented any credible mitigation on his behalf, the aggravating circumstance in the case at bar clearly outweighs evidence presented in mitigation. Any error by the court of appeals did not prejudice appellant. Appellant\u2019s seventh proposition of law is not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">XI</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">With respect to appellant\u2019s remaining propositions of law, after careful review of the record and case law, we fail to detect any errors that would undermine our confidence in the outcome of appellant\u2019s trial. Indeed, many of the arguments presented by appellant have been addressed and rejected by this court under similar circumstances and our positions on these issues have not changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">XII</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Having considered appellant\u2019s propositions of law, we must independently review the death sentence for appropriateness and proportionality. Again, we find that the aggravating specification of which appellant was found guilty is clearly shown by the record before us. Appellant presents no credible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>mitigating evidence. The trial court considered, as mitigation, that the death penalty in Ohio is not currently being administered. The court of appeals apparently found no mitigating evidence and, upon a review of the record, neither do we. Therefore, we conclude that the aggravating circumstance outweighs evidence presented in mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Finally, we have undertaken a comparison of the sentence in this case to those in which we have previously imposed the death penalty. We find appellant\u2019s death sentence is neither excessive nor disproportionate. See, <em>e.g., State v. Holloway </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 527 N.E.2d 831, and <em>State v. Poindexter, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b357-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b357-9\">Wright, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b357-10\">H.

In appellant\u2019s brief, under subsection (B)(6) of proposition of law fifteen, appellant does claim error regarding the giving of the <em>\u201cAllen </em>\u201d charge. The issue raised in this subsection is also I the subject of appellant\u2019s fourth proposition of law and such issue has been previously addressed by this court on a number of occasions. In accordance with our previous decisions on i the question, we reject appellant\u2019s claimed error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b357-11\">Herbert R. Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Au2\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur in the majority\u2019s affirmance of Bonnell\u2019s conviction. However, numerous errors with respect to the penalty phase, when taken together, lead me to believe that the death penalty should not be affirmed in this case. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">(1) Bonnell was improperly sentenced to death twice for a single homicide in violation of R.C. 2941.25(A). As the statute provides, Bonnell was indicted and tried on two counts of aggravated murder: felony murder and premeditated murder. However, the counts were never merged and the trial court improperly sentenced him to death on both aggravated murder charges when there was in fact only a single murder. R.C. 2941.25(A); <em>State v. Brown </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 305, 317, 528 N.E.2d 523, 538; <em>State v. Huertas </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 22, 28-29, 553 N.E.2d 1058, 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">What disturbs me in this case is the possible effect this violation may have had upon the jury\u2019s determination of the appropriate sentence pursuant to R.C. 2929.03(D)(2): \u201cwhether the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing are sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors present in the case.\u201d Because Bonnell was convicted on two counts of aggravated murder, the jury was confronted with two aggravating circumstances where there should have been one. Particularly where Bonnell presented residual doubt as the only mitigating factor, we cannot say that the jury would not have considered, and been swayed by, the extra and improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>aggravating circumstance when balancing against the single mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">(2) The trial court failed to instruct the jury on an essential element the prosecution was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt in order for Bonnell to be eligible for the death penalty: that Bonnell was the principal offender, or if not the principal offender that he acted with prior calculation and design. R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) requires the jury to make a finding of a capital specification in order for the defendant, convicted of aggravated murder, to be death-eligible. The statute\u2019s purpose is to narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty by imposing it only when the defendant was the principal offender or when the murder was premeditated. <em>State v. Henderson </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 24, 28, 528 N.E.2d 1237, 1242. In this case, Bonnell was not death-eligible because the jury was never instructed, and therefore never made a finding on the elements of the specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">(3) During jury deliberation at the penalty phase, the jury sent a note to the trial court asking, \u201cCan doubt and \u2018not fully disclosed\u2019 evidence (suggested but not proven) be included under mitigating factors?\u201d Despite the fact that the trial court had not given any instruction on residual doubt, the court responded to the jury\u2019s question by stating that \u201c[y]ou have heard all of the law and you have to apply the law to the facts as you, the jury, finds them.\u201d In this case, lingering or residual doubt was the only mitigating evidence that Bonnell presented during the sentencing phase of his trial. The jury\u2019s note indicates that it was concerned about whether or not it could consider the issue of residual doubt. Residual doubt of a capital defendant\u2019s guilt may be properly considered in mitigation, <em>State v. Watson </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 1, 17, 572 N.E.2d 97, 111; <em>State v. Gillard </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 226, 234, 533 N.E.2d 272, 281, and the jury was entitled to consider it in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Furthermore, although the defendant has a right to be present when the trial court communicates with a jury regarding the instructions, <em>State v. Abrams </em>(1974), 39 Ohio St.2d 53, 68 O.O.2d 30, 313 N.E.2d 823, nothing in the record indicates that the court informed Bonnell or his counsel of the jury\u2019s question. The defense, therefore, had no opportunity to suggest an answer or to object to the answer ultimately given by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">(4) After a full day and a half of deliberations, there was another communication from the jury to the court. In this note the jury asked: \u201cWe are at an impasse. Are you able to give us direction?\u201d Over defense objections, the trial court supplementally instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">\u201cYou are the only jury that can decide the issues in this case. This Court cannot give any further guidance except that you shall continue your deliberations with the object of reaching an agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u201cIt is your duty to make every reasonable effort to decide the case if you can conscientiously do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Defense counsel asked the court to strike its statement that \u201c[y]ou are the only jury that can decide the issues in this case.\u201d The court responded that a hung jury \u201cis not a possibility in this case\u201d because the penalty phase \u201ccannot be retried by anyone else.\u201d However, there is no law in Ohio that requires a jury to reach a decision in any case, including the penalty phase of a capital case. Where the jury cannot in good conscience reach a decision, it is entitled to declare itself deadlocked.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">(5) Finally, the court received another note from a single juror on the following day. The note asked that the juror be allowed to go home to her children as she saw no way for the jury to agree on a verdict. Forty-five to fifty minutes after the court received the note but before it had a chance to respond, the jury announced that it had reached a verdict. Defense counsel requested that the trial court take the case from the jury and impose a life sentence, but the court refused and brought in the jury, which sentenced Bonnell to death on both counts of aggravated murder. I do not find error in the above circumstances. However, the short time period between the juror\u2019s note and the jury\u2019s verdict is disturbing because it raises the possibility (particularly when coupled with the \u201cimpasse\u201d question) that a holdout juror may have been pressured into going along with the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Each of the above irregularities, viewed individually, may appear harmless. When taken together, however, their cumulative effect leads me to conclude that the jury\u2019s recommendation of the death penalty is not appropriate in this case. In reaching this conclusion I am also persuaded by the fact that the jury deliberated for about two days before reaching the verdict to recommend capital punishment and the fact that the sentencing jury at one point declared itself to be deadlocked. Accordingly, I would affirm Bonnell\u2019s conviction, but remand to the trial court for imposition of a life sentence pursuant to <em>State v. Penix </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 369, 513 N.E.2d 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\"><em>\u201cProposition of Law No. </em>i[:] R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to appellant Bonnell.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\"><em>\u201cProposition of Law No. </em>ZZ[:] The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution require the state to present sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction.
