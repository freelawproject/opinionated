(hereinafter Donacam) involved a \u201ccontested case\u201d as defined by Code, Art. 41, \u00a7 244(d) and was, therefore, appealable by Donacam to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County under \u00a7 255. The parties have also argued, as they did below, the legality of the special assessments in question. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>We do not reach that issue since we conclude that the proceeding before the WSSC was not a \u201ccontested case.\u201d Therefore, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of the case Donacam attempted to present by way of a purported appeal from the WSSC decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Donacam is the owner of parcels 2, 5, 7, and 8 in Rock Spring Park, Montgomery County. At its own cost, Dona-cam constructed a private water and sewer system on portions of this property. In order to provide water and sewer service to parcel 9, owned by Spaulding and Slye, WSSC determined that it was necessary to hook this private system onto a WSSC public sewer line to be constructed across parcel 8 and connected to parcel 9. In furtherance of this project, Donacam and WSSC in 1980 executed an \u201cAgreement to Grant\u201d and a \u201cDeed of Abandonment and Quitclaim\u201d by the terms of which Donacam transferred to WSSC the private water and sewer system and granted WSSC a sewer easement across parcel 8. In due course, WSSC constructed a sanitary sewer across parcel 8, connecting the former private system to parcel 9. Parcel 9 received public water from a line constructed by WSSC, which line joined the line on site at parcel 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In February, 1982, Donacam was shocked by a notice from WSSC advising that a sewer front-foot benefit charge was being assessed against parcel 8. The assessment was $3,034.84 annually for thirty-three years. Donacam\u2019s distress was the result of its view that parcel 8 had not been benefitted by the construction of the sewer line, and by its reading of the \u201cAgreement to Grant\u201d and the \u201cDeed of Abandonment and Quitclaim\u201d which, it thought, precluded WSSC from charging it for any portion of the costs of that construction. Donacam protested both upon receipt of the assessment and at a subsequent WSSC hearing, but in May, 1982, WSSC determined to retain the assessment against parcel 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>That same month, WSSC imposed water and sewer front-foot benefit charges against parcels 5 and 7 ($2,211.95 annually for thirty-five years and $1,950.73 annually for thirty-three years respectively) and a water front-foot benefit charge against parcel 8 ($733.50 annually for sixteen years). Once again, Donacam\u2019s protests were unavailing. After a hearing, WSSC confirmed these assessments as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Donacam appealed all the assessments to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The appeal was met with WSSC\u2019s Motion Raising Preliminary Objection which asserted the court lacked jurisdiction because there was no statutory provision for appeal. The court, concluding that the matter involved a contested case, held that a right to appeal was granted by Art. 41, \u00a7 255. It denied the motion and then voided all the assessments on the ground that they were arbitrary and capricious because Donacam\u2019s property had received no benefit and because the assessments violated the agreement between Donacam and WSSC, as contained in the \u201cAgreement to Grant\u201d and the \u201cDeed of Abandonment and Quitclaim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">It is from that judgment that WSSC has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\"><em>The Trial Court\u2019s Jurisdiction </em>\u2014 A <em>Contested Case or Not?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The threshold issue in this case, indeed, as we see it, the dispositive one, is whether the circuit court had jurisdiction to decide Donacam\u2019s appeal from the WSSC. Since the right to appeal from the decision of an administrative agency is statutory in nature, <em>Criminal Injuries Compensation Board v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 500, 331 A.2d 55 (1975), we search first for some statutory basis for the appeal to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">The law pertaining to the WSSC is codified in Art. 29 of the Code (1983 Repl.Vol.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Title 5 of that article deals with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>\u201cFront Foot Benefit Charges.\u201d Neither in that title nor elsewhere in Art. 29 is there any provision for an appeal to a court from an assessment of front-foot benefit charges by WSSC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If a statutory right of appeal exists it must be found in Art. 41, \u00a7 255(a) (part of the Administrative Procedure Act) which provides: \u201cAny party aggrieved by a final decision <em>in a contested case </em>... is entitled to judicial review thereof under this subtitle.\u201d [emphasis supplied].</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">WSSC is a state agency subject to the APA. <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Blumberg, </em>288 Md. 275, 418 A.2d 1155 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1083, 101 S.Ct. 869, 66 L.Ed.2d 808 (1981). That Donacam was aggrieved by the WSSC decision as to the assessments is unquestioned, and it seems plain enough that this decision was the final agency decision. The question, then, is whether the proceeding before the WSSC was a \u201ccontested case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">WSSC says it was not because taxation is a legislative matter. There is no doubt that the \u201cpower to tax belongs exclusively to the legislative branch of government,\u201d <em>Spencer v. Merchant, </em>125 U.S. 345, 355, 8 S.Ct. 921, 926, 31 L.Ed. 763 (1888), and that a front-foot special benefit charge is a species of tax. <em>Baltimore v. Cahill, </em>126 Md. 596, 95 A. 473 (1915); 14 McQuillen, <em>Municipal Corporations </em>(Third Ed. 1920 Rev. Vol.) \u00a7 38.01. Nor is there doubt that legislative proceedings are not \u201ccontested cases.\u201d <em>Bernstein v. Board of Education of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>245 Md. 464, 472-73, 226 A.2d 243 (1967); <em>Eliason v. State Roads Commission, </em>231 Md. 257, 189 A.2d 649, <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 914, 84 S.Ct. 211, 11 L.Ed.2d 152 (1963); <em>see </em>R. Oppenheimer, <em>Administrative Law in Maryland, </em>2 Md.L.Rev. 185, 204 (1938) and <em>The Supreme Court and Administrative Law 1936-40, </em>5 Md.L.Rev. 231, 246, 248 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>As we see it, however, it is not the underlying function involved, but rather the particular nature of the hearing required that determines whether a matter is a \u201ccontested case.\u201d <em>See </em>73 C.J.S. \u201cPublic Administrative Bodies and Procedure\u201d \u00a7 130. We shall return to this notion shortly.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Art. 41, \u00a7 244(d) defines a \u201ccontested case\u201d as \u201ca proceeding before an agency in which the legal rights, duties, statutory entitlements, or privileges of specific parties are required by law or constitutional right to be determined after an agency hearing.\u201d The trial court concluded that because Donacam was entitled to a hearing under the WSSC law, this was a contested case. That is the position Dona-cam took below and now asserts on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We think this is a misreading of \u00a7 244(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">We do not doubt that a hearing is provided for by the relevant provisions of Art. 29. Section 5-101(a) informs us that \u201c[t]he construction or acquisition of water mains or sewers'is a benefit to all property that abuts on water mains or sewers.\u201d Subsection (e) provides a formula for determining the benefit charges to be assessed against such properties, each of which is to be placed into one of the seven classes specified in subsection (b) which further provides: \u201c(2) The classification of any property by the WSSC is final, subject only to revision at a <em>hearing\u201d </em>[emphasis supplied]. Subsection (c) goes on to require the WSSC to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>(1) Fix and levy a benefit charge on all property that abuts on the water main or sewer, in accordance with the classification; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\">(2) Notify in writing all owners of property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">(i) Of the class in which their respective properties fall;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">(ii) Of the charge levied on the property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">(iii) Of the time and place of a <em>hearing </em>[emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">But the mere fact that a statute calls for a hearing is not in and of itself sufficient to make the subject of that hearing a \u201ccontested case.\u201d Such a case exists only if (matters of constitutional right aside; see note 3, supra) the law providing for the hearing requires that \u201clegal rights, duties, statutory entitlements, or privileges of specific parties\u201d be determined at that hearing. In other words, it is the subject matter of the hearing required \u201cby law\u201d that is decisive. <em>See The Maryland-National Capital Park Planning Commission v. Friendship Heights and the Hills, </em>57 Md.App. 69, 82, 468 A.2d 1353 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">Statutes or regulations may authorize hearings for many purposes. For example, the State Commission on Human Relations may hold \u201can investigatory hearing ... to resolve [a problem of racial discrimination] promptly by the gathering of all the facts . . . and making such recommendations as may be necessary.\u201d Art. 49B, \u00a7 3(c). But unless the hearing is for the purpose of determining \u201clegal rights, duties, statutory entitlements, or privileges of specific parties\u201d it is not a \u201ccontested case\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 244(d). Thus, in <em>Elprin v. Howard County Board of Education, </em>57 Md.App. 458, 470 A.2d 833 (1984) although a hearing was had, we held there was no contested case because no \u201clegal rights, entitlements or privileges\u201d were involved. <em>Compare State Dept. of Assessments and Taxation v. Clark, </em>281 Md. 385, 380 A.2d 28 (1977) (no hearing required, but in any event no contested case because relief requested was matter of grace, not right or entitlement).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>What is the purpose of the statutory hearing that occurred in this case? Obviously one purpose, as the statute indicates, was to consider the appropriateness of the classification of the Donacam property. That, indeed, may be the only purpose indicated by the statute. Classification was not an issue raised by Donacam. Another issue suggested by the hearing notices Donacam received was \u201cto present views ... on the footage assessed against your property.\u201d This, too, so far as the record discloses, was not an issue in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">These two matters appear to be the only ones intended to be addressed at the statutory hearing. Aside from the fact that neither is involved in this case, neither appears to implicate any legal right or duty of Donacam. The legislature had statutorily declared Donacam\u2019s property to be benefited and had in effect determined the tax by providing the \u00a7 5-101(e) formula for fixing it. Questions of classification and footage could relate only to the amount of the tax to be paid by Donacam, not to its right not to be assessed or to its duty to pay the assessment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court erred in deciding that the mere availability of the statutory hearing made this a \u201ccontested case.\u201d We hold it was not such a case, and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear Donacam\u2019s appeal. While Donacam is not necessarily without a remedy, the route to that remedy is not the one followed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">JUDGMENT VACATED. CASE REMANDED WITH DIRECTIONS TO DISMISS APPEAL FROM WSSC. AP-PELLEES TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-9\">. When this case was decided below, the WSSC law was codified as Art. 67 (1957 Code, 1981 Supp.). It was transferred to Art. 29 by Ch. 57, Acts of 1983. In this opinion, we shall refer to the current codification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b750-6\">. Art. 29, \u00a7 6-110 provides for an appeal to the Public Service Commission when there is an attack on \u201cthe reasonableness of any assessment, tax levy, or service charge of the WSSC.\u201d That section is not applicable here, as both parties agree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b751-6\">. The issue of whether Donacam was entitled to a hearing \u201cby ... constitutional right\u201d was not raised and decided below, nor has Donacam argued it on appeal. Therefore, we do not reach it. <em>Compare Albert v. Public Service Commission, </em>209 Md. 27, 120 A.2d 346 (1956). Front-foot benefit cases addressing the issue of a constitutional right to a hearing at the \u201cagency\u201d level have reached various results. <em>See, e.g., Spencer v. Merchant, supra, </em>125 U.S. 345, 8 S.Ct. 921, 31 L.Ed. 763 (1888) (hearing as to certain matters may be required depending on circumstances); <em>Leser v. Philip Wagner, Inc., </em>120 Md. 671, 87 A. 1040 (1913) (no hearing required when legislature has fixed amount of tax); <em>Ulman v. Baltimore, </em>72 Md. 587, 20 A. 141 (1890) (hearing required); <em>Baltimore v. Scharf, </em>56 Md. 50 (1881) (no hearing required); <em>Baltimore </em>v. <em>The Johns Hopkins Hospital, </em>56 Md. 1 (1881) (no hearing required); <em>Baltimore v. Scharf, </em>54 Md. 499 (1880) (hearing required).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\">. Donacam makes some comment about footage discrepancies as to parcel 8, but there is nothing in the record to show that this was raised at the WSSC hearing or in the lower court; Donacam\u2019s concerns obviously were directed to other matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\">. We observe, in passing, that WSSC\u2019s regulations exclude front-benefit cases from its \u201ccontested case\u201d procedures. \u201cProcedures for Information and Adjudicatory Hearings\u201d Par.
