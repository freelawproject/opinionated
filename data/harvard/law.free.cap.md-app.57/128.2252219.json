We shall return to a discussion of the stipulation in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Michael Anthony Whitehead and Donald Anthony Brown<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were charged with three counts of armed robbery, one count of assault with intent to murder and related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Appellant Whitehead was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court of Anne Arundel County of three counts of armed robbery, one count of assault with intent to rob and one count of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. On December 6,1982, the court imposed sentences of twenty years to run concurrently with a sentence of life imprisonment plus fifteen years imposed in an unrelated case upon a conviction of felony murder. Appellant\u2019s principal allegation of error herein relates to a motion for mistrial, denied by the court, based upon the State\u2019s introduction of evidence establishing appellant\u2019s involvement in an unrelated case. The remaining issue alleges an abuse of discretion by the trial judge in permitting a defense witness to be impeached by the introduction of a prior conviction for possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">On October 3, 1981, at 8:30 P.M., two armed men entered the Severna Park Liquor Mart, accosted two store employees and obtained $600.00 from a cash register. During the holdup a customer, Patricia Ashe, entered the store and one of the robbers seized her pocketbook. Mrs. Ashe pursued her assailant outside the store at which time a shot was fired in her direction. At trial, Mrs. Ashe and one of the store employees, Charles Orr, identified Whitehead as one of the robbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Subsequent to the robbery of the Liquor Mart, but prior to trial therefor, Whitehead and Brown were convicted of an unrelated robbery and felony murder that occurred in Prince George\u2019s County on November 20, 1981, seven weeks after the Liquor Mart holdup.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both Whitehead and Brown were apprehended as a result of the crime in Prince George\u2019s County and Brown had in his possession a handgun that was stolen during the Liquor Mart robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Prior to trial, all counsel conferred with the court concerning the State\u2019s intention to establish that the gun confiscated from Brown was stolen during the Liquor Mart robbery and that Whitehead was with Brown at the time the gun was recovered. The State\u2019s concern was in avoiding a Bruton<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> problem by disclosing an unrelated crime. After discussing the matter, all counsel agreed to the following stipulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">\u201cIt is stipulated between the State and between the defendants, through their counsel in this case, that if called to testify, Cpl. F.M. McQuillen of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department would testify that he took a statement from Donald Anthony Brown, the defendant in this case ... or one of the defendants in this case .. . and in that statement Mr. Brown admitted to being in possession of Exhibit 1 [the gun] on November the 20th, 1981. That at the time he was in possession of this gun, Mr. Whitehead was with him. It would be further stipulated, Your Honor, that this gun was found within close proximity of an automobile, which automobile which (sic) was abandoned in Prince George\u2019s County in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>which the defendants were observed to have occupied on November the 20th, 1981.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The stipulation was offered during the State\u2019s case in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In opening statement, Brown\u2019s counsel made a tactical decision to inform the jury of Brown\u2019s prior record in an effort to bolster his credibility in the present case. The jury was then told that Brown would testify \u201cthat he\u2019s been convicted of murder.\u201d No objection was made by appellant to counsel\u2019s opening statement. We note, however, that the tacit admission of a prior murder conviction carefully avoided any reference to the November 20th felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Brown testified that he had been convicted of first degree murder and armed robbery. He did not, however, state when or where the offenses occurred. He denied being a participant in the Liquor Mart robbery and stated that he purchased the gun from an unknown person on Fourteenth Street in Washington early in November, 1981. On cross-examination the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">\u201cQ. What were you going to do with the gun on that date, Mr. Brown?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">COURT: You\u2019re talking about November 20th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-11\">STATE: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">A. Going to commit a robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-13\">Q. In Prince George\u2019s County, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-14\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-15\">Q. Now that\u2019s the robbery and that\u2019s the murder that you\u2019ve told Mr. Friedman about in the questioning, isn\u2019t it, the one that you pled guilty to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-16\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-17\">Q. Now, Mr. Whitehead was with you when you committed this armed robbery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-19\">Q. And when you committed the murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-20\">APPELLANT: Objection your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>COURT: I\u2019ll sustain the objection and instruct the jury to ignore the question and the answer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">At this juncture, long after the proverbial horse had left the barn, appellant made a motion for mistrial which was denied. The court, presumably, relied upon the curative instruction and the fact that the stipulation placing the appellants together on November 20th and Brown\u2019s admission that the robbery and murder occurred on that date was not objected to by Whitehead.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In <em>Robeson v. State, </em>285 Md. 498, 403 A.2d 1221 (1979), the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">\u201cThe question to which objection was made added nothing to what had already been admitted. Thus, it did not harm the defendant beyond whatever harm may have resulted from the prior questioning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-8\"><em>Robeson </em>is apposite herein. We are at a loss to understand why appellant failed to object when the State inquired if the murder in which Brown was involved took place on November 20,1981. Appellant having stipulated that the two were together on that date, and that Brown had a gun, the jury was most certainly going to surmise, at the very least, if Brown answered the question, that both were involved in a separate robbery and murder. Nevertheless, appellant did not object to the first question nor to the question and answer that involved him in the robbery; he did object when Brown was asked if Whitehead was present at the time of the murder. The court, as we have noted, sustained the objection and admonished the jury to disregard the question and the answer. We point out that Brown did not respond with any answer to the question concerning the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">The State correctly observes that the testimony of Brown\u2019s commission of a felony and murder on November 20, 1981, was admitted without objection, permitting an inference, as the State suggests, that appellant was with Brown when the robbery and murder took place. It is with some ill grace, however, that the State advances this argument, considering that the State\u2019s cross-examination produc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>ed this testimony contrary to the stipulation limiting the disclosure of appellant\u2019s presence with Brown on Novemb\u00e9r 20th to the fact that on that date Brown was in possession of a gun stolen in the Liquor Mart robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">We recognize that <em>Ross v. State, </em>276 Md. 664, 350 A.2d 680 (1976), proscribes evidence tending to show that the accused has committed a crime independent of that for which he is on trial for the reason that such evidence is irrelevant and, therefore, inadmissible. Likewise, in <em>Jones v. State, </em>38 Md.App. 432, 381 A.2d 317 (1978), we said if the potential for prejudice outweighs the probative value, the evidence of other crimes ought to be excluded. Neither <em>Ross </em>nor <em>Jones, </em>however, deals with evidence admitted without objection. We decline to object where the appellant has not seen fit to do so at trial. <em>Peisner </em>v. <em>State, </em>236 Md. 137, 202 A.2d 585 (1964), recognizes that where evidence objected to comes in through another witness at a later time without objection, the earlier objection is deemed waived and the issue is not preserved for appellate review. Here we have the converse of the situation in <em>Peisner; </em>the rule, however, is equally applicable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">Appellant\u2019s second issue is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">Did the trial court abuse its discretion in permitting a defense witness to be impeached with a prior conviction for possession of a firearm?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">In this case the impeachment related to one of several witnesses produced by the appellant. The jury, by its verdict, did not believe the alibi witnesses, only one of whom was impeached. If, therefore, the conviction of unlawful possession of a firearm was not admissible for impeachment purposes, the inquiry was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-9\">.
