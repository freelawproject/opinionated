Because she believed that assault to have occurred within the course of her employment, she filed a claim under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Md.Ann. Code Art. 101. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission agreed with Ms. Miller and awarded her four weeks temporary total disability. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Greenfeld, J.) reversed the Commission\u2019s order and entered summary judgment in favor of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Chagrined at the circuit court\u2019s entry of judgment against her, Ms. Miller has carried her cause to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The \u201cAward of Compensation\u201d as passed by the Commission adequately sets out the relevant facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">\u201cThe incident took place on the Orleans Street Service Drive [a public street] near the place of employment shortly before 7:00 AM on March 12, 1981. This area is one of a number near the hospital which is served by a motorized escort service during peak, or shift change, hours. The escort service is operated by the contract security provider to the hospital and benefits hospital employees, University employees, patients and visitors alike. Hospital employees are not required to utilize the service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">Additionally, there exists between Johns Hopkins University and the Baltimore City Police Department a unique Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding which incorporates, by reference, a letter from the Director of General Services for Johns Hopkins Hospital. Under this Agreement, city police officers are employed and paid by Johns Hopkins University to provide additional street patrols beyond those usually provided by the police. These patrols are conducted in the areas and at the times directed by the hospital security provider. The Agreement specifically states that \u2018Hopkins\u2019 will provide compensation coverage to those members of the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>department employed. The letter attached to the Agreement as an exhibit makes clear the concern of the hospital over its ability to attract, and retain nursing employees and medical students in particular due to the incidence of crimes against persons. Hence, the Agreement. It is clear that although not so stated in the Agreement, that the pay of the officers comes from the Hospital, though possibly furnished through the University.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Ordinarily, employees who are injured while \u201cgoing or coming\u201d from their place of employment are not embraced within the ambit of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. <em>Wiley Manufacturing Co. v. Wilson, </em>280 Md. 200, 206, 373 A.2d 613, 616 (1977); <em>Kendall Lumber Co. v. State, </em>132 Md. 93, 103 A. 141 (1918). This is so because the employee\u2019s injuries do not arise \u201cout of or in the course of\u201d his or her employment. <em>Wiley Manufacturing Co. v. Wilson, </em>280 Md. at 206, 373 A.2d at 616. Going to or from work is not the same as being on the job, and unless there is some agreement, practice, or custom to the contrary, employers are not responsible for portal-to-portal pay or workmen\u2019s compensation coverage. M.J. Pressman, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation in Maryland, </em>(Michie 1977) \u00a7 2-6(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">There are circumstances when, of course, the employee may be covered by workmen\u2019s compensation even though not on the premises, as for example, where transportation to and from work is provided by the employer. <em>Western Electric Co. v. Engleman, </em>13 Md.App. 374, 283 A.2d 437 (1971); Watson <em>v. Grimm, </em>200 Md. 461, 467, 90 A.2d 180, 183 (1952); <em>Tavel v. Bechel Corp., </em>242 Md. 299, 304, 219 A.2d 43, 46 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The courts, however, have carved from the general rule several exceptions. One is styled as the \u201cproximity rule,\u201d the other, the \u201cpremises rule.\u201d The former is but a geographical extension of the area of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The premises rule applies when an employee is injured on the premises of the employer and while going to or from his or her job. <em>Wiley Manufacturing Co. v. Wilson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>supra; Proctor-Silex Corp. v. DeBrick, </em>253 Md. 477, 252 A.2d 800 (1969). An \u201cextension\u201d of the premises rule has been invoked,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">\u201cwhere the employee is injured while traveling along or across a public road between two portions of his employer\u2019s premises, whether going or coming, or pursuing the actual duties of his employment. A typical application of this exception occurs where injury is sustained by an employee while traveling between a company parking lot and his employer\u2019s plant. ...\u201d <em>Wiley Manufacturing Co. v. Wilson, </em>280 Md. at 206, 373 A.2d at 616.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><em>See Proctor-Silex v. DeBrink, supra; </em>1 Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>(1982) \u00a7 15.14 and \u00a7 15.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Inasmuch as the injuries in the matter <em>sub judice </em>were not occasioned in the hospital, on its grounds, or on a public street that separated two portions of the hospital, or while traveling between a hospital parking lot and the hospital, further discussion of the premises rule is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">We now turn our discussion to the proximity or \u201cspecial hazard\u201d extension of the premises rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">It is apparent from the Commission\u2019s recitation of facts that the hospital had experienced some difficulty in obtaining and retaining personnel. The difficulty was caused by the incidents of crime that occurred in the surrounding neighborhood. To make employment at Hopkins more attractive, the hospital engaged the services of a security agency. With consent of the then Baltimore City Police Commissioner, off-duty police officers patrolled the public streets adjacent to the hospital.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Simultaneously, a motorized van was driven over designated routes for the purpose of collecting hospital personnel and visitors and delivering them to the hospital\u2019s various facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Ms. Miller arrived in the vicinity of the hospital too late to make connection with the hospital\u2019s van. After she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>parked her vehicle and alit from it onto the street, she was accosted and forced back into her vehicle where she was attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Ms. Miller contends here, as she did before the Commission and the circuit court, that by providing patrols and transportation in the form of the van, the hospital extended its premises so that the proximity rule is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The proximity rule, according to Judge Levine in <em>Wiley, </em>\u201chad its genesis in two widely cited Supreme Court cases, <em>Cudahy Co. v. Parramore, </em>263 U.S. 418, 44 S.Ct. 153, 68 L.Ed. 366 (1923) and <em>Bountiful Brick Co. v. Giles, </em>276 U.S. 154, 48 S.Ct. 221, 72 L.Ed. 507 (1928).\u201d Both cases involved construction of the Utah Workmen\u2019s Compensation statute. As has been the situation in numerous proximity rule cases, both arose out of railroad crossing accidents. Parramore was struck while driving his automobile across the railroad track. The road on which he was traveling at the time was described as the \u201conly practicable way of ingress and egress for employees\u201d and \u201cwas the way customarily used.\u201d <em>Bountiful </em>concerned a pedestrian who was struck while crossing a railroad track. The route across the track could have been avoided by taking a circuitous and inconvenient course. Bountiful knew that its employees used the shortcut across the tracks, but it did not instruct them not to use it. The Court said that since Bountiful acquiesced in the use of the shortcut across the railroad, the risks incurred by the employee were \u201cincidental to the employment and became annexed as an implied term\u201d of that employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">A host of cases concerning the proximity rule have been decided by the Court of Appeals and this Court. <em>See e.g. Wiley Manufacturing Co. v. Wilson, supra; Saylor v. Black &amp; Decker Manufacturing Co., </em>258 Md. 605, 267 A.2d 81 (1970); <em>Proctor-Silex Corp. v. DeBrick, supra; Salomon v. Springfield Hospital, </em>250 Md. 150, 242 A.2d 126 (1968); <em>Tavel v. Bechtel Corp., </em>242 Md. 299, 219 A.2d 43 (1966); <em>Pariser Bakery v. Koontz, </em>239 Md. 586, 212 A.2d 324 (1965); <em>Maryland Paper Products Co. </em>v. <em>Judson, </em>215 Md. 577, 139 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>A.2d 219 (1958); <em>Sparrow v. Louis Dreyfus Corp., </em>49 Md. App. 564, 433 A.2d 1227 (1981); <em>Carter v. M.V. Construction Corp., </em>47 Md.App. 169, 422 A.2d 44 (1980); <em>Rambo v. International Dry Wall Co. Inc., </em>44 Md.App. 693, 410 A.2d 627 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>287 Md. 751, 753 (1980); <em>Pappas v. Modern Manufacturing Co., </em>14 Md.App. 529, 287 A.2d 798, <em>cert. denied, </em>265 Md. 741 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">A distillation of those cases divulges that each case must be decided on its own facts. <em>Wiley Manufacturing Co. v. Wilson, </em>280 Md. at 211, 373 A.2d at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">What may be safely said, however, is that the \u201cproximity rule is identified with those cases involving accidents which occur at a point where the employee is within range of dangers peculiarly associated with employment.\u201d <em>Wiley Manufacturing Co. v. Wilson, </em>280 Md. at 208, 373 A.2d at 617. The two guidelines pronounced by 1 Larson, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 15.00 are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">1) the existence of a special hazard at the particular off-premises point where the incident took place;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">2) the propinquity between the access route and the premises of the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">This State\u2019s two appellate courts have consistently declined to apply the proximity exception to events that occurred on public property. <em>Salomon v. Springfield Hospital, supra; Pariser Bakery v. Koontz, </em>supra; <em>Maryland Paper Products Co. v. Judson, supra; Stoskin v. Board of Education of Montgomery County, </em>11 Md.App. 355, 274 A.2d 397 (1971). Nevertheless, what we must consider in the instant case is whether the hospital\u2019s attempt through security patrols to assure safe ingress and egress of employees, visitors, and patients extends the proximity rule to public streets. We think it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">While it is unfortunate that Ms. Miller was assaulted on the streets of Baltimore City, such assaults do occur there, as well as in other cities throughout the country. The situation that confronted Ms. Miller could be faced by any woman on any street at any time. There was no \u201cspecial hazard\u201d with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>respect to hospital employees because visitors and patients entering or leaving the hospital are subjected to the same risks. That the hospital\u2019s location, with its attendant pedestrian traffic, might attract hoodlums, criminals, thugs, and persons of similar ilk does not create any more of a special hazard than does Harbor Place, Memorial Stadium, the Civic Center, the Convention Center, or other hospitals which also attract large crowds of people. Simply because the hospital sought to throw a protective cover of sorts over the area adjacent to it does not extend the premises of the hospital. An effort to be of public service, even though motivated by some degree of self-interest, does not convert the hospital into an insurer of the safety of persons on the public streets surrounding the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Were we to hold that the hospital\u2019s act in providing additional security patrols in the area adjacent to the hospital was a unilateral extension of its premises, thus rendering it liable for injuries sustained by employees through acts of third persons, we would in effect discourage any other employer from providing a similar service. In sum, we would, figuratively speaking, strip from such employees the protection they now receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">We observe that the hospital does provide, at a cost, a parking lot. Employees are not required to use that lot, but they may not hold the hospital responsible for injuries sustained because of its non-use.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">As Judge Greenfeld commented in the circuit court, \u201cEven though the ... [hospital] provided extra security patrols, crime prevention in that area was still the primary responsibility of the ... [Baltimore City Police Department].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">It follows from what we have said, that the trial judge did not err in granting summary judgment to the hospital. There was, in the instant case, no genuine dispute of a material fact and, as a matter of law, judgment should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-10\">.
