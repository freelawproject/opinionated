His only complaint in this appeal is that the marijuana seized, pursuant to a search warrant, at the time of his arrest should have been suppressed because the search warrant was not supported by probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Appellant\u2019s attack on the warrant is grounded entirely on the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964), and <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969), as construed and applied in subsequent cases by this and other courts. His complaint is that the warrant was based upon uncorroborated hearsay information obtained from a confidential informant whose veracity and reliability were not demonstrated in the application for the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Recognizing that, by virtue of <em>Illinois v. </em>Gates,-U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983), the criteria of <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>are no longer controlling for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, as applied to the States by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, appellant nonetheless argues that those criteria should continue to control through art. 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. We reject his invitation to drive an unnecessary cleavage between the two parallel constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The Court of Appeals has concluded on a number of occasions, including some recent ones, that art. 26 of the Declaration of Rights is <em>in pari materia </em>with the Fourth Amendment, that both grew out of the same historical background, and that the \u201cdecisions of the Supreme Court on the kindred 4th Amendment are entitled to great respect\u201d when construing art. 26. <em>Givner v. State, </em>210 Md. 484, 498, 124 A.2d 764 (1956); <em>Gahan v. State, </em>290 Md. 310, 430 A.2d 49 (1981), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Although scholars and commentators may debate the matter, as is their wont, privilege, and function to do, it would seem from the majority Opinion in <em>Gates </em>that the Supreme Court abandoned the rather rigid \u201ctwo prong test\u201d of <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>not only because it believed that that test was inappropriate but also because it felt that the test had not served its intended purpose. The various \u201cprongs\u201d and \u201cspurs\u201d attendant to the test produced a \u201clabyrinthine body of judicial refinement\u201d that bore no relationship to \u201cfamiliar definitions of probable cause.\u201d 103 S.Ct. 2333. It has encouraged \u201can excessively technical dissection of informants\u2019 tips, with undue attention being focused on isolated issues that cannot sensibly be divorced from the other facts presented to the magistrate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>103 S.Ct. at 2330. Moreover, \u201cthe direction taken by decisions following Spinelli poorly serves \u2018the most basic function of any government\u2019: \u2018to provide for the security of the individual and of his property.\u2019 . . . The strictures that inevitably accompany the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u2018two-pronged test\u2019 cannot avoid seriously impeding the task of law enforcement. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>103 S.Ct. at 2331.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In place of the discarded test, the Supreme Court resurrected and reaffirmed \u201cthe totality of the circumstances analysis that traditionally has informed probable cause determinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>103 S.Ct. at 2332. Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201cThe task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the \u2018veracity\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\"><em>Id. </em>The task of the reviewing court, then, is \u201csimply to ensure that the magistrate had a \u2018substantial basis for ... concludpng]\u2019 that probable cause existed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Our own experience under <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>confirms the concerns expressed by Justice Rehnquist for the majority in <em>Gates. </em>Until Gates, we were bound by that test, like it or not. To choose it willingly, especially when the effect of doing so would be to make inconsistent the counterpart constitutional provisions long regarded as parallel, would serve no useful purpose. In conformance with <em>Gates, </em>we shall construe art. 26 as invoking the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d standard; and, with this case and henceforth, shall judge search warrants accordingly. <em>Cf. Gipe v. State, 55 </em>Md.App. 604, 466 A.2d 40 (1983) <em>cert. denied, </em>298 Md. 243, 469 A.2d 452 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Reviewing the warrant in this case under that standard, we find that the \u201cissuing magistrate\u201d \u2014 in this instance a circuit court judge \u2014 had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
