In 1969, Maryland imposed a \u201cfranchise tax\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> upon its financial institutions which was measured by their \u201cnet income\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. It defined the latter term as the institution\u2019s federally \u201ctaxable income\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but required that any \u201cincome taxes\u201d imposed by the State be added back to federal \u201ctaxable income\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Perhaps anticipating a refund claim by the institutions which had added the federally deductible State franchise tax (measured on income) to their taxable income when determining the net income upon which the tax was imposed, the General Assembly in 1977 amended the statute \u201c[f]or the purpose of clarifying the amounts which must be added to the federal taxable income of a corporate taxpayer . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>It clarified that the \u201cincome taxes\u201d it had required to be added back to the federally taxable income (upon which the 7% franchise tax was imposed) meant State \u201ctaxes based upon income\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The rationale for saying that \u201cincome taxes\u201d had meant upon enactment just what it (the Legislature) had chosen it to mean, was apparent from the legislative purpose in its enactment,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the plural use of the term in the statute,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the \u201cunvarying construction\u201d given to the statute by the agency charged with its enforcement for its fourteen year life.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When contemplating what type of tax to impose upon financial institutions in 1968, the Legislature had before it the Report of the Joint Legislative-Executive Committee to Study Taxation and Fiscal Problems. In its observations, the Committee pointed out that if the normal corporate income tax were imposed upon financial institutions, the bulk of their income would not be taxable because it was derived from interest and dividends from federal treasury obligations, which income was not subject to a direct state <em>income </em>tax due to a peculiar phraseology in 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 548; but that source of income could be taxed by charging a state franchise tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Realizing that a rose by another name may even smell sweeter, the State \u201cimposed\u201d its 7% tax on the franchise of the financial institution\u2019s \u201cnet earnings\u201d, Art. 81, \u00a7 128A(b), i.e., its income. Thus, it was able to tax the otherwise exempt income from the institution\u2019s treasury obligations. The State then defined the \u201cnet income\u201d measure of the \u201cfranchise tax\u201d as including the \u201ctaxable income of [the] taxpayer as defined in the laws of the United States . . . . \u201d Art. 81, \u00a7 280A(a). The laws of the United States permitted an exemption for the \u201cfranchise tax\u201d imposed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>State which was measured by the institution\u2019s income so the State required that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\">\u201cThere shall be added to the taxable income of such taxpayer: ... (1) income taxes . . . imposed by the State of Maryland . . . .\u201d Art. 81, \u00a7 280A(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">For fourteen years the appellee, State Department of Assessments and Taxation, has considered the franchise tax on financial institutions which is measured by their income as one of the \u201cincome taxes . .. imposed by the State of Maryland.\u201d When the Legislature clarified that purposed intent in 1977, the appellant Maryland National Bank perceived it as a sign of semantic weakness. It filed for refunds from Maryland of the tax it had paid Maryland on the \u201cfranchise tax\u201d which it had added back to its federal taxable income pursuant to \u00a7 280A(b)(l) in order to calculate its taxable income. It reasoned that because the statute had been changed, the bank had been wrong prior to 1977 when it had treated the franchise tax over the years as one of the \u201cincome taxes\u201d to be added back to the federal taxable income for purposes of computing its State liability. The 1977 amendment, it contended, was a forced interpretation necessitated by the formerly clear use of the term \u201cincome taxes\u201d. It argued to the State Tax Court and to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City that the use of the term \u201cincome taxes\u201d was not even sufficiently ambiguous to permit resort to judicial guides for interpreting statutes or to ascertain legislative intent and that the State prior to 1977 had improperly directed that the franchise tax was an income tax to be added back to the federal taxable income (which had exempted it) as the net earnings to be taxed by Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The courts below did not agree and chose to seek the intent of the Legislature from the statute\u2019s purpose and from its application. We, on the other hand, agree that it is and was unambiguous. We agree with the Legislature that the term meant just what it intended it to mean. It is significant, we think, that the plural use of the term \u201cincome taxes\u201d which were to be added to the federally com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>puted taxable income was used in a generic sense to include any taxes based on \u201cincome\u201d imposed by the State. It is beyond our comprehension how appellant can logically contend that the broad plural use of the term meant a narrow singular specific tax. Had the Legislature intended that only \u201cthe\u201d income \u201ctax\u201d was intended, it certainly would have interposed that article, \u201cthe\u201d, or even \u201can\u201d, to so specify. To the contrary, however, it used the plural \u201cincome taxes\u201d which unambiguously comprehends any \u201ctaxes based on income\u201d and as Humpty Dumpty added to Alice, \u201cneither more nor less\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">While we hold that the term unambiguously means what the enforcement agency said it meant without contradiction for fourteen years, <em>Comptroller v. Rockhill, Inc., </em>205 Md. 226, 107 A.2d 93 (1954), and what the Legislature itself verified by repetition that it had always intended, if it was not as clear as we have all perceived it, certainly it was not as unambiguous as the appellant would have us believe. The most the Bank could achieve from its own resort to legislative history is to indicate a possible ambiguity; but even then it clearly loses by its own quotation from the 1968 Joint Committee Report which shows the intent to include as much income as possible on which the tax would be measured.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">We agree that the Legislature recognized the difference between \u201cthe franchise tax and the income tax\u201d. We also think the Legislature knew that a franchise tax when measured on income is one of many \u201cincome taxes\u201d. To adopt the Bank\u2019s interpretation would permit the Bank a deduction for Maryland franchise tax purposes of the franchise tax to be paid. That would permit the absurd result of the Legislature having imposed a tax which it did not intend to collect. <em>Kolb v. Burkhardt, </em>148 Md. 539, 129 A. 670 (1925). It is perhaps for that reason that the General Assembly in 1977 \u201csaid, in rather a scornful tone\u201d, it had intended nothing of the kind in 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
