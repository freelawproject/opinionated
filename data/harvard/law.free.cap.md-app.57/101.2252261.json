Joyce, et ux. are the appellants from a decree entered in the Circuit Court for Harford County purporting to declare the riparian rights of the appellants and those of Thomas N. Templeton, et ux., the appellees, as adjoining property owners on a bulkheaded cove, <em>vis-\u00e1-vis </em>the water adjacent to their respective bulkheads.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">The appellants (Joyce) and the appellees (Templeton) own adjacent land on a cove in Joppatowne, Maryland known respectively as Lots 26 and 28 of Block 21 of Part 33 of Rumsey Island. Lot 26 (Joyce) has 57.5' of bulkhead and Lot 28 (Templeton) has 25' of bulkhead. They are located at right angles to each other on a corner of a man-made cove 120' wide.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>NOT TO SCALE:</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Several times between 1977 and 1981 Templeton approached Joyce about coordinating plans in anticipation that both would be building piers or docks adjacent to their bulkheads. Finally Joyce told Templeton that any dock Templeton constructed would infringe on Joyce\u2019s property rights and he could not agree to allow Templeton to construct any dock there.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Eventually, on June 16, 1981, Templeton applied to the Army Corps of Engineers for permission to construct a pier. Joyce applied to build a pier in July, 1981. Templeton constructed his pier in August, 1981; Joyce, in 1982. The relationship of the two piers is approximately as shown:</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">On August 28, 1981, Joyce filed suit in the Circuit Court for Harford County, seeking to enjoin both the construction of Templeton\u2019s pier and the placement of any boat adjacent thereto, alleging intrusion upon waters to which Joyce claims exclusive riparian rights, and thereby constituting the commission of a nuisance and trespass. In addition, Joyce asked the Court to define and declare the parties\u2019 riparian rights; i.e., their rights to the use of the navigable waters adjacent to their respective bulkheads.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The matter was heard before the trial judge, Brodnax Cameron, Jr., on November 9, 1982. After hearing the testimony of both parties,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the chancellor concluded that the <em>status quo </em>effectively governed the rights of the parties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>thereby ruling in favor of Templeton\u2019s continued use of his dock as constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">An order was submitted to the court by Joyce\u2019s attorney which declared that each party could maintain his dock in its current position. The order also contained a provision that the surrounding water be apportioned by extending the parties\u2019 mutual property line to the center of the cove and prohibiting either party from using the docks in a manner that impinged on the other\u2019s riparian area. In signing the order, the chancellor struck from the proposed decree submitted to him the latter provision which would have been directly contrary to the conclusion he had expressed at the end of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">From that order Joyce appealed to this Court, contending that the decree as signed did not answer the essential question presented for disposition, i.e., each party\u2019s riparian rights as adjoining property owners on a bulkheaded cove.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Templeton declined to participate in the appeal, filed no brief, and did not appear for argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The sole question on appeal is simply whether the chancellor\u2019s order adequately resolved the issue presented for disposition in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">If this corner riparian area in question were to be apportioned according to appellant\u2019s proposal, by extension of the common property line to the center of the cove, it is obvious that appellee\u2019s dock with boat attached would transgress into appellant\u2019s riparian area. In addition, appellant could not take a boat to the inside of his L-shaped dock without violating appellee\u2019s exclusive riparian area. The overall effect would have been to severely limit Templeton\u2019s use of the area and enhance that of Joyce. As the chancellor noted in his opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\">Basically, [Templeton] is \u2014 has no other option that I can see. If he extended his pier perpendicular to the shore line, it would make matters worse, not better. The only thing, really, that could be done by the Defendant would be to remove the pier, which I\u2019ve declined to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Now, [Joyce] could have placed his pier somewhat to the northeast, that is, up towards the neighbor on the other side, but apparently felt that zoning regulations prevented that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">So when it comes down to the bottom line in the present situation, [Joyce] can tie up two boats and can own one pier, [Templeton] can tie up one boat and own one smaller pier. Now, that seems to me a perfectly fair arrangement when it\u2019s contrasted with the alternative, which would be to permit [Joyce] to tie up three boats and keep his pier and [Templeton] to tie up one boat and have no pier. * !j\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">So it\u2019s a \u2014 I can\u2019t conceive of an arrangement which would be more equitable than the <em>present one.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">So if you, Mr. Stahl, will present me with an order, I\u2019ll sign one establishing \u2014 declaring <em>these </em>to be the rights of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">Stated succinctly, the chancellor concluded that the <em>status quo </em>provides the best available solution to the parties\u2019 equitable rights in navigable riparian waters adjacent to their adjoining properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">The courts should declare rights where possible. <em>See Donnelly Advertising Corporation of Maryland v. City of Baltimore, </em>279 Md. 660, 370 A.2d 1127 (1977). Indeed, if the questions are validly before the court, it must pass upon and adjudicate the issues raised. <em>See Dart Drug Corp. v. Hechinger Co., Inc., </em>272 Md. 15, 320 A.2d 266 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">In the instant case, appellants argue that since no absolute boundary was set by the chancellor, the issue raised was not adjudicated. We do not agree. In <em>Mutual Chemical Co. of America v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>33 F.Supp. 881, <em>modified Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co., </em>122 F.2d 385 (D.C.Md.1941), it was held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>[I]t is necessary first to consider what are the established legal principles, or rules, for apportioning property owners\u2019 rights upon a bulkhead line. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\">The following general rules for the apportionment of riparian rights are firmly established: If the shore line is straight, the riparian lines are to be extended from the divisional lines on shore into the water, perpendicular to the shore line. If, on the other hand, the shore line is concave, converging lines shall be run from the divisional shore lines to the line of navigability. <em>City of Baltimore </em>v. <em>Steamboat Co., </em>104 Md. 485, 498, 65 A. 358. If the shore lines are convex, the lines will be divergent to the line of navigability. Surveying and Boundaries, by Frank Emerson Clark, Secs. 268, 269. <em>However, it is self-evident that each of these rules cannot be strictly applied where irregular shore lines are involved, if all affected property owners are to be treated equitably. So, modifications have been enunciated in various State Court decisions.. . . </em>[Emphasis added]. <em>Id., </em>at 887.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The Court in <em>Mutual Chemical Co. of America </em>went on to conclude that the most equitable rule to fit the given situation was the one which must be adopted, to afford <em>each </em>property owner \u201cthe fullest utilization of the respective properties.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In Massachusetts, in the 1849 case of <em>Gray v. Deluce, </em>5 Cush., Mass. 9, 11-12 (1849), a similar issue was discussed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">The principal question in these cases is, in what manner the areas claimed by the parties are to be divided. sfc sfc sfc sfc &amp; sfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">To determine this question, a rule is to be established, whereby <em>all </em>the flats within the cove, where the flats in question are situate, may be divided amongst the coterminous proprietors. S}! * * # * H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">[N]o rule can be laid down which will be applicable to all cases. We have no doubt, however, that in all cases, it was intended, if practicable, to give to every proprietor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the flats in front of his upland of equal width with his lot at high-water mark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">But this in many cases has been found impracticable. So was the fact in the leading case of <em>Bust v. Boston Mill Corporation, </em>6 Pick. 158. In that case the flats to be divided were within a deep cove, the mouth of which was narrow, so that it was impossible to make the division among the several proprietors by parallel lines; and from necessity the division was made by running converging divisional lines from high-water mark to the mouth of the cove, the low-water mark being without the cove. And this rule of necessity has been followed in many other cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">So if a division were to be made of flats surrounding a headland, it would be impracticable to make a just division by parallel lines; and to give to each proprietor his due proportion of the flats, the lines of division must diverge from high-water to low-water mark.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The Massachusetts court went on to assure that a \u201cjust division [was] made of all the flats within the cove.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut, in <em>Lowndes v. Wicks, </em>9 Conn. 15, 36 A. 1072, 1077 (1897), in a case not unlike that at bar, discussed the applicable rules for apportionment and concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">It is the aim of these rules, as applied to the rights of adjoining riparian proprietors on an irregular shore, to give each, as far as may be, fair and reasonable opportunity of access to the channel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">In 1907, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, discussing the application of similar divisionary rules in <em>Hathaway v. City of Milwaukee, </em>132 Wis. 249, 111 N.W. 570, 571 (1907), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfS\">the [trial] court evidently followed the rule of apportioning to each abutting proprietor such proportion of the new shore line as his ownership of the original shore line bore to the whole line on which the accretion abuts, and dividing the area to be apportioned by connecting the points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>where division lines of coterminous owners intersect the original shore line and the corresponding points on the new shore line by straight lines. This process of apportionment is well recognized as a proper one to follow, unless it results in such inequalities as to make it inequitable. \u00a1J: ;{; \u00a1{: s}:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">... An examination of the situation thus presented has led us to the conclusion that the apportionment under the rule followed by the trial court results in as equitable a division of this area as can practically be made in view of the quantity of the [area] to be divided and [its] . .. relation ... to the riparian proprietorships.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-6\"><em>See also, Columbia Land Co. v. Van Dusen Inv. Co., </em>50 Or. 59, 91 P. 469 (1907).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In his opinion, the chancellor below indicated that the case at bar was controlled by the case of <em>Andrejak, et al. v. Shenk </em>(Equity Case # 26948, Docket 33, Folio 153, Harford County, filed 7/19/79), an earlier dispute presenting the same question. That case turned on the pie-shaped wedges created by extending property lines to a point 60' from each bulkhead. The appellees relied upon this concept in their application to the Army Corps of Engineers. Appellants argue that given the awareness of the pie-wedge division in <em>Andrejak </em>and the appellees\u2019 reliance on this method of determining their right to erect their bulkhead, it was error by the trial court to refuse to extend the common property line to the midpoint of the cove. When <em>Andrejak, </em>however, is applied in the light of the equitable principles stated in <em>Mutual Chemical Co. of America, supra, </em>we find no error in the court\u2019s decision to maintain the <em>status quo. </em>We agree with the trial judge\u2019s reasoning as expressed in his declaration of the rights of the parties, when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">. . . Basically, what the Court is being called upon to do is make an equitable division or allocation of the rights of the parties, but it seems to have fallen into the \u2014 fallen to the Court\u2019s lot to be asked to design docking facilities that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>would achieve that end. First of all, the Court is not in business to design docking facilities, and the best that can be done is make an allocation that is a reasonable one but not necessarily the best one. By my consideration of the testimony here, I can think of no alternatives that are more satisfactory than the <em>status quo.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">Now, [Templeton] does have the right, as a pier owner, to construct a pier, in this case a floating five by fifteen pier, along his water frontage as long as it doesn\u2019t unduly impede the exercise of the Plaintiff\u2019s rights to have his pier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">What [Joyce] seems to be asking is that the Court tell [Templeton] that he cannot have a pier at all. Now, I\u2019m not so \u2014 Aside from the deprivation of rights, I\u2019m not so sure that that would be a very satisfactory solution to begin with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">We do not agree with appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court failed to rule on the respective riparian rights of the parties. Their rights are clearly ascertained from the order signed by the court. If appellant desires an engineering delineation of the lines to be drawn which would encompass the court\u2019s decision, he is free to have such a projection of the lines drawn by a competent engineer and submitted to the court for its signature. Obviously, appellant could not expect the court to include in its order the projected riparian rights which the court had found to be inequitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-7\">. In addition, there were diagrams, photographs, blueprints, and Army Corps of Engineers reports entered into evidence for the chancellor\u2019s consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
