All four counts of conviction stemmed from Bou-chard\u2019s role as a closing attorney in several real estate transactions in upstate New York from approximately 2001 until 2007, when mortgage fraud schemes were especially rampant. As part of these transactions, the Government charged, Bouchard and others fraudulently misrepresented closing prices and other important details of the real estate sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">We focus primarily on Bouchard\u2019s challenge to the three substantive counts of conviction involving activity directed at BNC Mortgage (\u201cBNC\u201d). Although BNC was a mortgage lender, not a federally insured financial institution, its parent company, Lehman Brothers, was a federally insured financial institution. In this case, the substantive counts required the Government to prove that Bouchard intended to defraud or obtain the property of a \u201cfinancial institution,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344, or to \u201cinfluencie] in any way the action\u201d of a bank referenced in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014. The principal question on appeal is whether evidence of fraudulent activity directed at BNC is enough to support convictions under \u00a7 1344 and \u00a7 1014 solely by virtue of the fact that BNC was owned by a federally insured financial institution. We hold that it is not, and we accordingly reverse Bouchard\u2019s convictions on the three substantive counts. By contrast, the conspiracy count of conviction involved fraudulent misstatements made directly to a federally insured bank. We therefore affirm Bou-chard\u2019s conviction on that count and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">A. The Fraudulent Schemes</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">Because the jury found Bouchard guilty of all the charges against him, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. See United States v. Facen, 812 F.3d 280, 283 (2d Cir.2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">Bouchard began practicing law in 1988. In 2001 he opened his own law firm devoted largely to real estate transactions. The charges against Bouchard resulted from an investigation into two fraudulent real estate schemes in which he and his law firm participated from approximately 2001 until 2007. The \u201cTeam Title\u201d scheme was run by Francis \u201cTom\u201d Disonell and Matthew Ku-pic and was named after a company the two men owned.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The \u201cPB Enterprises\u201d scheme was named after a company run by Kevin O\u2019Connell and Michael Crowley. As part of that scheme, O\u2019Connell and Crowley either directly resold or brokered the sales of properties at inflated prices and fraudulently obtained mortgages for the higher selling prices. At the real estate closings, O\u2019Connell and Crowley used so-called \u201cdouble HUDs\u201d \u2014 in effect, two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\u201cHUD-l\u201d forms,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> each of which purported to summarize the disbursements made from the funds provided by the lender for the deal. One HUD-1 form reflected the actual, lower selling price, but was submitted only to the seller; the other HUD-1 falsely contained the artificially high purchase price and was submitted on the same day to the lender for the loan payment. The latter HUD-1 made it appear that most of the proceeds of the mortgage would be used to compensate the seller. In reality O\u2019Connell and Crowley diverted the mortgage proceeds to themselves and to the buyer. Disonell, Kupic, O\u2019Connell, and Crowley eventually testified at Bouchard\u2019s trial as cooperating witnesses for the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Bouchard and two paralegals he hired, Laurie Hinds and Malissa Edgerton, were closely involved in both the Team Title and the PB Enterprises real estate schemes. The focus of this appeal, however, is on the PB Enterprises scheme that formed the basis for the counts of conviction. In that scheme, Bouchard\u2019s law firm served as the closing attorney or \u201cclosing agent\u201d purporting to represent the lenders for several transactions. The law firm was therefore responsible for disbursing mortgage funds, ensuring that the closing instructions from the lender were followed before disbursing any funds, and ensuring the accuracy of representations to the lender on the HUD-1 regarding the transaction (such as the sale price and how much money the buyer put down). Typically, Bouchard or his paralegals signed and submitted to the lender a HUD-1 certifying that the form was \u201ca true and accurate statement of all receipts and disbursements made on [their] account or by [them] in this transaction.\u201d But in fact each of these certifications was false: the HUD-ls either contained incorrect sales prices or falsely represented that the buyers had made a down payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Bouchard personally attended the closings and signed fake HUD-1 forms in connection with at least two real estate transactions'for which he was convicted. The first of these transactions took place in March 2005, when PB Enterprises arranged for the sale of a property in Troy, New York to a purported buyer, Brian Haskins. In connection with the sale, Bou-chard signed two obviously different HUD-1 forms, one listing the sale price as $35,000 and the other falsely listing an $85,000 sale price. The false HUD-1 form also represented that Haskins had deposited a down payment of about $17,000 at closing, when in fact he had not. After the closing, Bouchard\u2019s office submitted the false HUD-1 form to BNC, which provided Haskins a mortgage of $76,500 \u2014 over $40,000 more than the actual sale price. Bouchard then disbursed funds from the mortgage proceeds, including a $33,172.03 check made payable to Haskins that Bou-chard gave to Crowley, who deposited it into his personal account.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">The second transaction occurred in April 2005 and, like the first, closed at Bou-chard\u2019s law firm. Bouchard was present at the sale\u2019s closing and signed two HUD-1 forms in connection with a sale of property located at 4 Kaatskill Way in Ballston Spa, New York. One of the HUD-1 forms represented that the sale price was $224,000, while the other HUD-1 form, ultimately submitted to BNC, certified a higher sale price of $240,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">Bouchard\u2019s personal involvement in signing and submitting false HUD-1 forms was only part of the Government\u2019s evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>dence that he knew the schemes were fraudulent. At various times, Bouchard also made direct statements that together demonstrated his knowledge and culpability. For example, Bouchard was unfazed when Disonell initially confided to Bou-chard that Crowley and O\u2019Connell, the masterminds of the PB Enterprises fraud, used \u201cdouble HUDs\u201d at closings and then asked if Bouchard wanted their business. O\u2019Connell later confirmed to Bouchard that he and Crowley \u201cwanted to basically buy the property, have two closings in one day where we were buying it from somebody at a lower price and then reselling it at a higher price.\u201d Bouchard responded that it \u201cwouldn\u2019t be a problem\u201d and agreed to team with O\u2019Connell and Crowley as the closing agent. Bouchard, O\u2019Connell, and Crowley also agreed that Bouchard\u2019s firm would follow up each closing by issuing a check to the buyer reflecting the difference between the actual and the inflated sale price. And Hinds, one of Bouchard\u2019s paralegals, later testified that Bouchard authorized disbursements to parties other than those listed on the HUD-1 forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Finally, in July 2005, after the fraudulent schemes had stretched for more than four years, federal agents interviewed Bouchard as part of a criminal investigation of Disonell and Kupic. During the interview Bouchard admitted that \u201cin about 50 percent of his closings\u201d the fund disbursements were \u201cdifferent than indicated on the HUD-1 form\u201d at the buyer\u2019s and seller\u2019s direction. While acknowledging that the disbursements were \u201cweird,\u201d Bou-chard insisted that they reflected \u201cstandard practice\u201d in the real estate industry and explained that he \u201cwas only concerned that his corporate accounts that show the money that would come in from the lender had zeroed out at the end of the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">B. The Defrauded Lenders</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Two of the principal lenders victimized by the mortgage fraud schemes were Fremont Investment and Loan (\u201cFremont\u201d) and BNC. Fremont and its depository accounts were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d). BNC, while not itself federally insured, was wholly owned by Lehman Brothers, which was federally insured and provided BNC with a \u201cwarehouse line of credit\u201d to fund BNC\u2019s mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">At trial, Bouchard admitted that he knew Lehman Brothers and Fremont were both federally insured but testified that he believed that BNC was not insured (and, as explained above, it is not). There was no evidence that Bouchard knew either that BNC was owned by Lehman Brothers or that Lehman Brothers was involved in any of the loans at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">C. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">1. The Jury Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">The jury convicted Bouchard of the conspiracy count (Count One), two substantive bank fraud counts under \u00a7 1344 that arose from transactions in which Bouchard personally attended the closing and signed the fraudulent HUD-ls (Counts Seven and Nineteen), and the \u00a7 1014 false statements count (Count Twenty-Four), which arose from the same transaction as Count Seven. All three substantive counts of conviction involved mortgages funded by BNC.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">The jury acquitted Bouchard of all the remaining counts, however, including several counts of bank fraud. One of the counts of acquittal (Count Seventeen) involved a false HUD-1 submitted to Fremont.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">2. The Rule 33 Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">Soon after the jury verdict, O\u2019Connell told the Government that his testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>about meeting Bouchard was false and that, in fact, \u201che never met Michael Bou-chard.\u201d O\u2019Connell explained that he had initially so informed the trial prosecutors, one of whom threatened that \u201cif you do not tell us you met with Michael Bouchard we can\u2019t help you.\u201d After learning about O\u2019Connell\u2019s post-trial disclosure to the Government, Bouchard moved for a judgment of acquittal or, in the alternative, for a new trial under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Among other things, Bouchard argued that he would have been acquitted of all the charges against him absent O\u2019Connell\u2019s perjured testimony. He separately argued that there was insufficient evidence that BNC was a federally insured financial institution under \u00a7 1344 or \u00a7 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">After a hearing on the perjury issue, the District Court denied Bouchard\u2019s motion. First, the court assumed without deciding that O\u2019Connell had committed perjury at trial. It concluded, however, that the Government was unaware of the perjury and that Bouchard failed to demonstrate that, but for the perjured testimony, he would most likely not have been convicted. Second, after considering whether the Government needed to prove that BNC itself was a covered institution under \u00a7 1344 or \u00a7 1014, the District Court found that Bou-chard in any event defrauded BNC\u2019s parent company, Lehman Brothers, which indisputably was a federally insured financial institution, and that Bouchard therefore could be liable for bank fraud. In support of that finding, the District Court pointed to (1) Bouchard\u2019s \u201cintent to defraud,\u201d (2) \u201cthe integrated transaction involving funds from Lehman Brother[s],\u201d and (3) \u201cthe financial injury to which Lehman Brothers was exposed as a result of its ownership of BNC and its provision of money to fund the loan[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">In denying Bouchard\u2019s Rule 33 motion with respect to the \u00a7 1014 false statement count, the District Court pointed out that Bouchard \u201cwas an experienced real estate attorney\u201d who \u201cacted as the \u2018bank\u2019s attorney\u2019 for numerous transactions over many years.\u201d Evidence of Bouchard\u2019s background, the court explained, was \u201csufficient to create an inference ... that [Bouchard] knew his statements would influence a bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">3. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Bouchard\u2019s presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended a Guidelines range of 87 to 108 months based on an offense level of 29 and a criminal history category of I. The PSR calculations were premised in part on conduct for which Bouchard had been acquitted. At sentencing, the District Court simply adopted the PSR\u2019s findings and guidelines calculation without separately finding that Bouchard had committed the acquitted conduct. After determining that the loss amount associated with Bou-chard\u2019s crimes far exceeded his personal gain, the District Court downwardly departed from the applicable range and sentenced Bouchard to concurrent terms of 48 months on each count of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">Section 1344 criminalizes schemes to defraud, or schemes to obtain the money of, a \u201cfinancial institution.\u201d The statute provides in full: \u201cWhoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice \u2014 (1) to defraud a financial institution; or (2) to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>representations, or promises; shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. Prior to 2009, the term \u201cfinancial institution\u201d was defined to include insured depository institutions of the FDIC, but not mortgage lenders. See id. \u00a7 20(1). Similarly, Section 1014 makes it a crime to knowingly make \u201cany false statement or report ... for the purpose of influencing in any way the action\u201d of enumerated financial entities, which, at the time the schemes were, undertaken prior to 2009, included \u201cany institution the accounts of which are insured by the [FDIC],\u201d id \u00a7 1014, but again not mortgage lenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">As is now well known, the subprime mortgage crisis some years ago threatened the financial stability of many federally insured financial institutions. The crisis prompted Congress in 2009 to amend both \u00a7 20 (which defines financial institutions for purposes of \u00a7 1344) and \u00a7 1014 to cover mortgage lending institutions specifically. Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act (\u201cFERA\u201d) of 2009, 123 Stat. 1617. Timing is everything: the conduct for which Bou-chard was convicted occurred prior to 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">We therefore consider whether Bou-chard\u2019s conduct violated \u00a7 1344 and \u00a7 1014 before the enactment of FERA, recognizing that BNC, though itself not federally insured, was owned by a federally insured financial institution (Lehman Brothers), while Fremont was federally insured. Because the substantive counts of conviction involved activity directed at BNC only, we conclude that there was insufficient evidence that Bouchard intended to defraud or obtain the property of a \u201cfinancial institution,\u201d as required by \u00a7 1344, or to \u201cinfluenc[e] in any way the action\u201d of an institution covered by \u00a7 1014. We therefore reverse his convictions on those counts. We separately conclude that part of the conspiracy count of conviction involved statements aimed at Fremont, which both parties agree was a federally insured financial institution. We therefore affirm Bouchard\u2019s conviction on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">1. Section 1344(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">As noted, the federal bank fraud statute makes criminal the \u201cknowing[ ] execution]\u201d of a scheme to \u201cdefraud a financial institution.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. Prior to Loughrin v. United States, \u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 2384, 189 L.Ed.2d 411 (2014), we interpreted \u00a7 1344 as a whole to be \u201ca specific intent crime requiring proof of an intent to victimize a bank by fraud,\u201d meaning that \u201c[a] federally insured or chartered bank must be the actual or intended victim of the scheme.\u201d United States v. Nkansah, 699 F.3d 743, 748 (2d Cir.2012) (quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court in Loughrin rejected that interpretation, holding instead that \u00a7 1344(2) does not require an intent to defraud a bank. It confirmed, however, that \u00a7 1344(1) \u201cincludes the requirement that a defendant intend to \u2018defraud a financial institution\u2019; indeed, that is \u00a7 1344(l)\u2019s whole sum and substance.\u201d Loughrin, 134 S.Ct. at 2389-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">The Government concedes there was no evidence that Bouchard specifically intended to defraud Lehman Brothers or was even aware of Lehman Brothers\u2019 role in the transactions involving BNC. Relying on United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409 (1st Cir.1994), the Government nevertheless argues that it satisfied the \u201cintent to defraud\u201d element. Bouchard\u2019s \u201ctargeting of BNC, an uninsured mortgage broker,\u201d it claims, \u201cdirectly affected Lehman Brothers because Lehman Brothers funded BNC\u2019s loans and was liable for its losses.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 15. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Brandon also involved a fraudulent mortgage scheme. The defendants targeted brokers and servicing agents acting on behalf of a federally insured bank that ultimately approved and provided the relevant mortgages in that case. Brandon, 17 F.3d at 418-19. The defendants argued that \u201cthere was no violation of \u00a7 1344 because the scheme to defraud was not knowingly targeted at a federally insured financial institution, but instead at the non-federally insured mortgage brokers.\u201d Id. at 426. The First Circuit rejected their argument, explaining that \u201cthe government does not have to show the alleged scheme was directed solely toward a particular institution; it is sufficient to show that defendant knowingly executed a fraudulent scheme that exposed a federally insured bank to a risk of loss.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original); see also id. at 426-27 (evidence that the defendants \u201cfraudulently evaded a known down payment requirement, whether thought to be imposed\u201d by the brokers, the agents, or the insured bank itself, \u201cis sufficient to support a bank fraud conviction,\u201d so long as \u201cthe government ... establishes] that a federally insured bank ... was victimized or exposed to a risk of loss by the scheme to defraud\u201d); United States v. Walsh, 75 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1996) (explaining that \u201cBrandon ... confirm[s] that a defendant can violate section 1344 by submitting the dishonest loan application to an entity which is not itself a federally insured institution\u201d but that is funded by such an institution).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Brandon conflicts with our precedent insofar as it holds, as the Government 'claims, that a defendant satisfies the intent element of \u00a7 1344(1) merely by submitting the dishonest loan application to an entity which is not itself a federally insured institution without also intending to deceive the entity\u2019s insured owner. Contrary to Brandon, we have held that \u00a7 1344(1) requires the Government to show that a defendant intended to defraud the financial institution itself. See United States v. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686, 694 (2d Cir.1992); United States v. Rodriguez, 140 F.3d 163, 168 (2d Cir.1998);, United States v. Laljie, 184 F.3d 180, 189-90 (2d Cir.1999). To be sure, the Government is not required to prove that a defendant knows that the entity targeted by the fraud is a federally insured bank. See Nkansah, 699 F.3d at 758 (Lynch, J., concurring) (noting that \u201cfor the federal government to exercise its criminal powers over an individual, it is not logically necessary for that person to know or intend that she is transgressing a particularly federal interest\u201d, (emphasis in original)). But it remains true that a defendant cannot be convicted of violating \u00a7 1344(1) merely because he intends to defraud an entity, like BNC, that is not in fact covered by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Brandon also appears to us to conflict with Loughrin, which, though focused on \u00a7 1344(2), suggests that a defendant must intend to defraud a bank in order to be convicted under \u00a7 1344(1). In Loughrin, the Supreme Court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction for bank fraud, even though his \u201cintent to deceive ran only to [a non-federally insured entity], and not to any of the banks on which his altered checks were drawn.\u201d 134 S.Ct. at 2389. The Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that \u00a7 1344(2) required the Government to prove \u201cnot just that a defendant intended to obtain bank property (as the jury ... found), but also that he specifically intended to deceive a bank.\u201d Id. The defendant\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1344(2) was untenable, the Court stated, because it would impose the same requirements on a conviction under \u00a7 1344(2) as apply to a conviction under \u00a7 1344(1) and thus \u201cwould render \u00a7 1344\u2019s second clause superfluous.\u201d Id. at 2389. In other words, the Court reasoned, \u00a7 1344(2) imposes no require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>ment that a defendant \u201cspecifically intend[ ] .to deceive a bank\u201d because \u00a7 1344(1) already requires that specific intent. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">For these reasons, we decline to adopt the holding in Brandon and conclude that the evidence was insufficient to sustain Bouchard\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 1344(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">2. Section 1344(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The Government argues in the alternative that the evidence was sufficient to convict Bouchard under \u00a7 1344(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In rejecting this argument, we are again guided by Loughrin. Under \u00a7 1344(2), the Government must prove \u201cthat the defendant intended] \u2018to obtain any of the moneys ... or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution\u2019 \u201d \u2014 that is, \u201cinten[ded] \u2018to obtain bank property.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 2389. Although the Supreme Court ultimately determined that Loughrin had waived the argument that he did not \u201cintend\u201d to obtain bank property, id. at 2389 n. 3, the Court assumed that \u201cintent \u2018to obtain bank property\u201d\u2019 is an element of a conviction under \u00a7 1344(2) and that a defendant must at least know that the property belongs to or is under the custody or control of a bank.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See id. at 2389, 2393 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">At oral argument the Government urged that BNC itself may loosely be regarded as a bank or financial institution within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 20 because \u201cit is colloquially [a bank or financial institution]... [insofar as] it lends money.\u201d We reject this novel argument. First, a \u201cfinancial institution\u201d is not a loose or eol-loquial term, but a term of precise definition that can lead to grave criminal consequences. Second, we are mindful that \u00a7 1344(2) should not be read to \u201cfederal-iz[e] frauds that are only tangentially related to the banking system,\u201d which is \u00a7 1344\u2019s core concern. Loughrin, 134 S.Ct. at 2393 (quotation marks omitted). For that reason, and particularly when bank subsidiaries may be engaged in activities far afield of the core functions of our federal banking system, it is important (absent legislative direction to the contrary) to distinguish subsidiaries of banks from the banks themselves. See United States v. Bennett, 621 F.3d 1131, 1136 (9th Cir.2010) (banks are distinct legal entities from their subsidiaries for the purposes of \u00a7 1344(2)); see also United States v. White, 882 F.2d 250, 253 (7th Cir.1989) (in the context of \u00a7 1014, \u201cit would be ... perilous to assume that Congress wanted to extend the statute\u2019s protection to [financial institutions\u2019] affiliates, when so far as appears there is no (or only the most attenuated) federal stake in preventing fraud against affiliates of a federally insured bank, as distinct from fraud against the bank itself\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">We also note that Congress has been willing and able to amend the bank fraud statute to cover new conduct by new actors that it determines does directly affect the banking system. For example, as we have already mentioned, in 2009 Congress amended both \u00a7 20 and \u00a7 1014 to cover mortgage lending institutions specifically. FERA, 123 Stat. 1617 (2009). In doing so, Congress appears to have understood that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u00a7 1344 (through \u00a7 20) and \u00a7 1014 \u201conly applie[d] to Federal agencies, banks, and credit associations and d[id] not necessarily extend to private mortgage lending businesses, even if they are handling federally-regulated or federally-insured mortgages.\u201d See S. Rep. 111-10, 2009 U.S.C.C.A.N. 430, 432. As the Senate committee report on FERA explained, \u201cthe bill amend[ed] the definition of \u2018financial institution\u2019 in the criminal code ... in order to extend Federal fraud laws to mortgage lending businesses that are not directly regulated or insured by the Federal Government.\u201d Id. at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">At the time of the charged conduct, all of which occurred before the 2009 congressional amendments, BNC was not a covered institution. Of course, the Government might have been able to prove that Bouchard knew that money from mortgage lenders came from banks by virtue of his knowledge of the industry. But it failed to make this argument or proffer evidence of Bouchard\u2019s extensive knowledge of the real estate and mortgage lending industry as a reason to convict him at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">3. Section 1014 (Count Twenty-Four)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Bouchard also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction on Count Twenty-Four, which charged him with making false statements to a bank in connection with the March 2005 transaction involving the property in Troy, New York. As both the Government and Bouchard agree, \u00a7 1014 does not require the Government to prove that a defendant knew that the bank is insured by the FDIC, but it does require the Government to prove that the defendant \u201ckn[ew] that it was a bank ... to which he has made the false statement in his application for a loan\u201d and that he \u201cintended to influence.\u201d United States v. Sabatino, 485 F.2d 540, 544 (2d Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The HUD-1 that Bouchard signed and submitted in connection with the March 2005 transaction did not reveal that the loan would ultimately be financed by Lehman Brothers. It listed only BNC as the lender. As we have suggested the Government might have been able to argue with respect to the \u00a7 1344 charges, it now contends that Bouchard \u201cmust have known\u201d that the loan would ultimately be financed by Lehman Brothers because of his experience in the real estate industry. See United States v. Grasso, 724 F.3d 1077, 1081, 1088 (9th Cir.2013) (a jury could reasonably conclude that the defendant knew that his false statements would influence an insured bank because, among other things, he \u201cwas an experienced real estate agent who ... was well-versed in the mortgage lending process\u201d and who \u201ctargeted banks\u201d with lenient standards for their lending agents). Under the circumstances of this case, however, we reject the Government\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">First, as we explained above, the Government never presented this theory of Bouchard\u2019s knowledge to the jury. We are disinclined to affirm a conviction based on a theory that was not advanced regarding a critical element. See United States v. Rigas, 490 F.3d 208, 231 n. 29 (2d Cir. 2007). Second, at trial there was no evidence of what a real estate attorney with Bouchard\u2019s experience would have known regarding the connection between non-federally insured brokers or lenders (like BNC) and federally insured institutions (like Lehman Brothers). Nor was there any evidence that Bouchard deliberately \u201ctargeted banks\u201d that imposed lenient standards for their lending agents. See Grasso, 724 F.3d at 1081. Accordingly, even if we entertained the Government\u2019s theory for the first time on appeal, we would conclude that there was insufficient evidence at trial to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>We therefore reverse Bouchard\u2019s conviction on Count Twenty-Four for violating <em>\u00a7 1014.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\">4. Conspiracy (Count One)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">We next turn to Bouchard\u2019s conviction on Count One of the indictment, for conspiracy to violate \u00a7 1014. Count One charged four overt acts involving the submission of false HUD-ls to three different institutions. Only one of the institutions, Fremont, was proven to be a federally insured financial institution. Pointing to his acquittal on the substantive count involving the Fremont transaction (Count Seventeen), Bouchard urges us to assume that the jury wrongly convicted on a different overt act involving one or both of the two other victimized institutions that were not proven to be federally insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">We generally affirm convictions as long as there was sufficient evidence to support one of the theories presented. See Griffin v. United States, 502 U.S. 46, 56-57, 112 S.Ct. 466, 116 L.Ed.2d 371 (1991). \u201c[I]n the absence of anything in the record to show the contrary, the presumption of law is that the court awarded sentence on the good count only.\u201d Id. at 50, 112 S.Ct. 466 (quotation marks omitted); accord United States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, 105 (2d Cir.1994). We conclude that Bouchard\u2019s acquittal on the substantive count is not \u201cto ... the contrary.\u201d Griffin, 502 U.S. at 50, 112 S.Ct. 466. Without a special verdict form demonstrating that the jury convicted on a theory not supported by .sufficient evidence, see United States v. Frampton, 382 F.3d 213, 224-25 (2d Cir. 2004), we can easily reconcile the jury\u2019s verdict to acquit on the substantive count involving Fremont with its finding that an overt act involving Fremont occurred as part of the conspiracy. The differing verdicts might,.for example, simply reflect the fact that the Fremont closing was attended by one of Bouchard\u2019s paralegals rather than Bouchard, and the jury may reasonably have declined to find Bou-chard guilty of the substantive count and simultaneously determined that his co-conspirator (the paralegal) committed the overt act charged in the conspiracy count. See United States v. Palmieri, 456 F.2d 9, 12 (2d Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">For these reasons, we affirm Bouchard\u2019s conviction on the conspiracy count.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">B. O\u2019Connell\u2019s Alleged Perjury</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">We next consider whether Bou-chard was entitled to a new trial under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure because of O\u2019Connell\u2019s alleged perjury. The trial judge is \u201cin the best position to appraise the possible effect\u201d of newly discovered evidence on the jury\u2019s verdict, United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 301 (2d Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted), and so we review the denial of a Rule 33 motion for abuse of discretion, United States v. Sessa, 711 F.3d 316, 321 (2d Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">In denying Bouchard\u2019s Rule 33 motion, the District Court never found that O\u2019Connell in fact committed perjury. But it did find that the Government lacked knowledge of any perjury. Under those circumstances, even assuming perjury, we must be left with \u201ca firm belief that but for the perjured testimony, the defendant would most likely not have been convicted.\u201d' United States v. Ferguson, 676 F.3d 260, 282 n. 19 (2d Cir.2011) (quotation marks omitted). With that standard in mind, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in. denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">First, as Bouchard acknowledges, defense counsel strongly undercut O\u2019Con-nell\u2019s credibility on cross-examination. In particular, on cross-examination O\u2019Connell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>(1) was unable to recall when and where he had a conversation with Bouchard about payouts not reflected on the HUD-ls, (2) confirmed that he had not had any real conversation with Bouchard, (3) admitted that it \u201cwasn\u2019t really [his] role in the company to deal with\u201d Bouchard and that he did not deal directly with Bouchard in connection with any of the closings that were the subject of his testimony on direct examination, and (4) acknowledged that he did not talk to Bouchard about the use of \u201cdouble-HUDs.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In sum, the highly equivocal nature of O\u2019Connell\u2019s testimony about meeting with Bouchard \u201crendered the significance of his perjury minimal.\u201d United States v. Torres, 128 F.3d 38, 49 (2d Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Bouchard counters that O\u2019Connell\u2019s testimony was unduly prejudicial because it was used to undermine his own testimony on cross-examination. He asserts that the \u201cprosecutor effectively used O\u2019Connell\u2019s perjury to suggest that Bouchard was lying about never having met O\u2019Connell or Crowley.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 19. But the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination focused largely on how Bouchard\u2019s knowing participation in the scheme was central to its success, not on O\u2019Connell\u2019s testimony. And in its jury summation the Government conceded that O\u2019Connell had not discussed the scheme with Bouchard. Moreover, we are satisfied based on our review of the record that there was ample independent evidence proving that Bouchard was aware of the fraudulent nature of the schemes. That evidence included Disonell\u2019s testimony that he disclosed to Bouchard that the closings with O\u2019Connell and Crowley would involve \u201cdouble HUDs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Bouchard\u2019s Rule 33 motion based on O\u2019Connell\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE Bouchard\u2019s convictions on Counts Seven, Nineteen, and Twenty-Four, AFFIRM his conviction on Count One, and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\">. This scheme involved purchasing distressed properties from homeowners at low values and then reselling them at artificially inflated values to prospective buyers for no down payment, while falsely representing to lenders at closing that the buyers were providing a down payment. Based on these misrepresentations, Kupic and Disonell were able to obtain higher mortgages than they would have otherwise. They distributed the leftover cash from the higher mortgage proceeds to other entities and to themselves as \"consulting fees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\">. A HUD-1 form, is a Housing and Urban Development settlement form used in closing a property sale that details the costs and fees associated with a mortgage loan. See United States v. Kerley, 784 F.3d 327, 333 n. 2 (6th Cir.2015).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b152-9\">. Bouchard initially argued that we should only consider the sufficiency of the evidence under \u00a7 1344(1), but before oral argument he withdrew the argument based on the Supreme Court\u2019s supervening decision in Musacchio v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 709, 715, 193 L.Ed.2d 639 (2016). See United States v. Bouchard, No. 14-4156-cr (2d Cir.), ECF Docket No. 72.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Ae6\">. As with \u00a7 1344(1), a defendant need not know that the bank is federally insured, nor aim to obtain the property of one bank in particular.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b155-6\">. Moreover, Bouchard was able to testify at trial that \"[w]e have the transcript from Kevin O\u2019Connell and he said that no such meeting occurred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\">. Because we vacate the judgment of conviction in part and remand for resentencing, we need not address Bouchard\u2019s argument that the District Court committed procedural error in calculating his Guidelines range based on acquitted conduct. We nevertheless offer a few words of guidance for resentencing based on acquitted conduct. \"A district court may treat acquitted conduct as relevant conduct at sentencing, provided that it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant committed the conduct.\u201d United States v. Pica, 692 F.3d 79, 88 (2d Cir.2012). With respect to conduct by a co-conspirator, \"a district court must make a particularized finding as to whether the activity was foreseeable to the defendant\u201d and must \"make a particularized finding of the scope of the criminal activity agreed upon by the defendant.\u201d United States v. Studley, 47 F.3d 569, 574 (2d Cir. 1995). This is true even in the case of a conspiracy conviction, because \"the scope of conduct for which a defendant can be held accountable under the sentencing guidelines is significantly narrower than the conduct embraced by the law of conspiracy.\u201d United States v. Getto, 729 F.3d 221, 234 n. 11 (2d Cir.2013) (quotation marks omitted). Insofar as it bases any resentence on acquitted conduct, the District Court must make particularized findings either that Bouchard actually committed the acts or that the acts of his co-conspirators were both foreseeable to him and fell within the scope of criminal activity to which he agreed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
