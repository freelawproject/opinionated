The answer is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-16\">Steven Sherman, a now-deceased land developer, previously sued the Town of Chester (the \u201cTown\u201d) alleging a regulatory taking. That litigation remains pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Ramos, J.). Laroe Estates, Inc. (\u201cLaroe\u201d), a real estate development company, claimed that it, not Sherman, currently owns the property that is the subject of Sherman\u2019s dispute and sought to intervene pursuant to Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rather than determine whether Laroe satisfied the requirements of Rule 24, the District Court denied Laroe\u2019s motion on the ground that Laroe lacked standing to assert a takings claim against the Town. Because we do not require proposed intervenors in this circumstance to show that they independently have standing, we VACATE the order and REMAND to the District Court to determine in the first instance whether Laroe met the requirements of Rule 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b88-18\">This is the second time that this Court has considered a dispute related to the abandoned MareBrook development project in the Town of Chester. When we last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>did so, the District Court had dismissed Sherman\u2019s regulatory takings claim against the Town because it was unripe. Sherman v. Town of Chester, No. 12 Civ. 647 (ER), 2013 WL 1148922, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 20, 2013). We reversed that decision, holding that the claim could proceed even though the Town never \u201crendered a final decision on the matter.\u201d Sherman v. Town of Chester, 752 F.3d 554, 561 (2d Cir. 2014) (quotation marks omitted). That conclusion was based on the extraordinary facts of Sherman\u2019s case\u2014 facts that are fully recounted in our previous decision, with which we assume familiarity. We remanded the case back to the District Court to consider Sherman\u2019s takings claim on the merits. Id. at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Shortly thereafter, Laroe filed a motion to intervene, purporting to be the equitable owner of the property at issue in Sherman\u2019s dispute. Laroe claims that it entered into a purchase agreement with Sherman in June 2003 (the \u201c2003 Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which Sherman agreed to sell Laroe three parcels of land within the proposed MareBrook subdivision. In exchange, Laroe agreed that it would pay $60,000 for each lot approved for development within the three parcels once Sherman\u2019s plans were approved by the Town. The agreement also required Laroe to make $6 million in interim payments while Sherman sought the Town\u2019s approval. The interim payments were secured by a mortgage that Sherman provided to Laroe \u201cencumbering all of the Development Property.\u201d Joint App\u2019x 192. If Sherman failed to obtain the Town\u2019s approval of a sufficient number of lots, Laroe retained the right to terminate the agreement. Over the next year, Laroe advanced Sherman more than $2.5 million for the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Although Sherman\u2019s efforts to secure the Town\u2019s approval stretched on, Laroe did not terminate the agreement. But in April 2013 TD Bank, which held a superior mortgage interest in.the property, commenced a foreclosure proceeding. Hoping to salvage the deal in view of the foreclosure, Laroe and Sherman signed a new contract (the \u201c2013 Agreement\u201d) amending their earlier purchase agreement. The 2013 Agreement provided that the $2.5 million Laroe had already advanced Sherman, plus any amount paid to settle Sherman\u2019s obligation to TD Bank, would constitute the purchase price of the property. Once the Town approved the development, Laroe was required to transfer a certain number of lots back to Sherman depending on how many were approved by the Town. Subject to this requirement, the parties deemed the purchase price for the property \u201cpaid in full.\u201d Joint App\u2019x at 234. To resolve TD Bank\u2019s foreclosure proceeding, the 2013 Agreement also granted Laroe the sole discretion to settle the debt owed to TD Bank and alternatively permitted Laroe to terminate the Agreement if La-roe and TD Bank failed to reach a settlement before the foreclosure sale. Laroe ultimately failed to satisfy Sherman\u2019s obligations to TD Bank. On May 21, 2014, a foreclosure sale occurred, and TD Bank took possession of the property. Laroe nevertheless chose not to terminate the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Throughout this period, Sherman (and subsequently his estate) continued litigating his takings claim. After we remanded the case, Laroe sought to intervene. By order dated March 31, 2015, the District Court denied the motion, concluding that Laroe\u2019s claim against the Town was futile. Sherman v. Town of Chester, No. 12 Civ. 647 (ER), 2015 WL 1473430, at *15-16 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2015). Although the District Court acknowledged that \u201clegal futility is not mentioned in Rule 24,\u201d it reasoned that futility was nonetheless \u201ca proper basis for denying a motion to intervene.\u201d Id. at *15 (citing In re Merrill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Lynch &amp; Co., Inc. Research Reports Sec. Litig., Nos. 02 MDL 1484 (JFK), 02 Civ. 8472 (JFK), 2008 WL 2594819, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. June 26, 2008)). Relying on our decision in U.S. Olympic Committee v. Intelicense Corporation., S.A., 737 F.2d 263 (2d Cir. 1984), the District Court concluded that Laroe lacked standing to assert a takings claim because it was not \u201cthe owner of an interest in property at the time of the alleged taking.\u201d Sherman, 2015 WL 1473430, at *15 (quoting U.S. Olympic Comm., 737 F.2d at 268).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Having concluded that Laroe lacked standing, the District Court did not discuss at length whether Laroe otherwise satisfied the requirements of Rule 24, other than to suggest in a footnote that \u201cit [was] not clear that [Laroe] satisfie[d] Rule 24\u2019s timeliness requirement,\u201d since Laroe waited to file its motion until after this Court reversed the District Court\u2019s decision dismissing Sherman\u2019s takings claim. Id. at *16 n. 20. But because the District Court concluded Laroe lacked standing, it declined to determine whether the motion was timely. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">1. Article III Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">Laroe filed a motion for intervention as a matter of right under Rule 24(a)(2) or, in the alternative, permissive intervention under Rule 24(b). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to intervene for abuse of discretion. Floyd v. City of New York, 770 F.3d 1051, 1057 (2d Cir. 2014). A district court abuses its discretion when \u201cits decision rests on an error of law (such as application of the wrong legal principle) or a clearly erroneous factual finding.\u201d MasterCard Int\u2019l Inc. v. Visa Int\u2019l Serv. Ass\u2019n, 471 F.3d 377, 385 (2d Cir. 2006). Here, the District Court denied the motion as futile because, it held, a party seeking to intervene as of right must independently have standing, and Laroe, it concluded, separately lacked standing to assert a takings claim against the Town. See Sherman, 2015 WL 1473430, at *16. Although, as the District Court acknowledged, \u201clegal futility is not mentioned in Rule 24,\u201d id. at *15, we have affirmed denials of a motion to intervene on that basis, United States v. Glens Falls Newspapers, Inc., 160 F.3d 853, 856 (2d Cir. 1998) (affirming the denial of a newspaper\u2019s motion to intervene to ask the district court to vacate a consent order sealing draft settlement documents). But we have not held that a party seeking to intervene as of right must independently have standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">In fact, we suggested somewhat to the contrary in United States Postal Service v. Brennan, where a union of postal service employees sought to intervene in a dispute between the U.S. Postal Service and the owners of a small mail-delivery business in Rochester. 579 F.2d 188, 190 (2d Cir. 1978). The district court denied the union\u2019s motion partly because the union lacked standing. Although we ultimately affirmed that decision on other grounds, id. at 191, we explained that the motion should not have been denied for lack of standing, because \u201c[t]he question of standing in the federal courts is to be considered in the framework of Article III[,] which restricts judicial power to \u2018cases\u2019 and \u2018controversies,\u2019 \u201d id. at 190 (quotation marks omitted). Therefore, we reasoned, \u201cthere [is] no need to impose the standing requirement upon [a] proposed intervenor\u201d where \u201c[t]he existence of a case or controversy [has] been established\u201d in the underlying litigation. Id. Our approach accords with that of the majority (but not all) of our sister <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>circuits that have addressed this issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See, e.g., King v. Governor of the State of New Jersey, 767 F.3d 216, 245-46 (3d Cir. 2014); Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 630 F.3d 898, 905-06 (9th Cir. 2011); City of Herriman v. Bell, 590 F.3d 1176, 1183-1184 (10th Cir. 2010); Dillard v. Chilton Cty. Comm\u2019n, 495 F.3d 1324, 1336-37 <em>&amp; </em>n. 10 (11th Cir. 2007); United States v. Tennessee, 260 F.3d 587, 595 (6th Cir. 2001); Ruiz v. Estelle, 161 F.3d 814, 829-30 (5th Cir. 1998). But see, e.g., City of Chicago v. Fed. Emergency Mgmt. Agency, 660 F.3d 980, 984-85 (7th Cir. 2011) (treating Article III standing as an additional requirement for intervenors); United States v. Metro. St. Louis Sewer Dist., 569 F.3d 829, 833-34 &amp; n. 2 (8th Cir. 2009) (same); United States v. Philip Morris USA Inc., 566 F.3d 1095, 1146-46 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Although a circuit split on this issue has persisted for some time, the Supreme Court has expressly declined to resolve it. See Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 68-69, 106 S.Ct. 1697, 90 L.Ed.2d 48 (1986). Instead, in Diamond v. Charles, it ruled only that when the original party in the litigation on whose side intervention occurred refuses to appeal and an intervenor wishes to appeal on its own, the intervenor must show that it satisfies Article Ill\u2019s standing requirement in the absence of the original party. Id. at 68, 106 S.Ct. 1697. But since Diamond, the Supreme Court has certainly suggested \u2014 although without deciding \u2014 that an intervenor need not independently have standing where the original party has standing. In McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, for example, the Court determined that it \u201cneed not address the standing of the intervenor-defendants\u201d because it was \u201cclear ... that the [named defendant,] ... whose position ... [was] identical to the [intervenor-de-fendants\u2019,]\u201d had standing. 540 U.S. 93, 233, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003), overruled on other grounds by Citizens United v. Fed. Election Comm\u2019n, 558 U.S. 310, 130 S.Ct. 876, 175 L.Ed.2d 753 (2010). So it is fair to say that while the Supreme Court has not explicitly endorsed our approach, it has sub silentio permitted parties to intervene in cases that satisfy the \u201ccase or controversy\u201d requirement without determining whether those parties independently have standing. The District Court therefore erred by denying Laroe\u2019s motion to intervene based on its failure to show it had Article III standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">2. Failure to State a Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">The Town argues in the alternative that we should affirm the District Court\u2019s order because Laroe\u2019s motion also fails to state a claim against the Town\u2014 whether or not Laroe has standing. Oral Arg. Tr. 27. That argument, however, is foreclosed by Trbovich v. United Mine Workers of America, 404 U.S. 528, 92 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>630, 30 L.Ed.2d 686 (1972). In that case, a union member sought to intervene in a suit by the Secretary of Labor seeking to set aside the results of a union election. Id. at 529-30, 92 S.Ct. 630. Although, under the relevant statute, only the Secretary was authorized to bring such a claim, the union member was permitted to participate on the Secretary\u2019s side of the case, as long as he did not assert any new grounds for relief. Id. at 537, 539, 92 S.Ct. 630. Thus, under Trbovich, a party need not have a stand-alone claim of its own to intervene on the plaintiffs side of a case \u2014 at least as long as it asserts the same legal theories and seeks the same relief as the existing plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">That principle applies here. Although it is unclear from the record whether Laroe believes the Town is directly liable to Sherman or Laroe for the alleged taking, Laroe has acknowledged that its damages are essentially the same as Sherman\u2019s. Oral Arg. Tr. 16. And the Town does not dispute that the land that Laroe now claims it owns is part of the same parcel of land at issue in Sherman\u2019s takings litigation. Even if Laroe has no independent claim that could survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) \u2014 an issue we need not decide \u2014 that does not bar it from continuing to participate in the litigation of Sherman\u2019s takings claim, so long as it seeks relief that does not differ substantially from that sought by Sherman. Because neither a proposed intervenor\u2019s lack of Article III standing nor its failure to state an independent claim necessarily renders a motion to intervene futile, the District Court should have instead focused its analysis on the requirements of Rule 24, to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">3. Rule 24</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Laroe filed a motion for both intervention as a matter of right and permissive intervention. Convincing us to reverse the denial of a motion for permissive intervention is notoriously difficult. See United States v. Pitney Bowes, Inc., 25 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir. 1994). Here, though, we need not address Laroe\u2019s motion for permissive intervention because Laroe relies on the same \u201creasons supporting [its] request to intervene as [of] right.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 34. We therefore focus on only Laroe\u2019s motion to intervene as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The district court must grant an applicant\u2019s motion to intervene under Rule 24(a)(2) if \u201c(1) the motion is timely; (2) the applicant asserts an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action; (3) the applicant is so situated that without intervention, disposition of the action may, as a practical matter, impair or impede the applicant\u2019s ability to protect its interest; and (4) the applicant\u2019s interest is not adequately represented by the other parties.\u201d MasterCard, 471 F.3d at 389; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2). The Town of Chester argues that Laroe fails this test because its application was untimely, it lacks a separate interest in the proceeding, and any interest it has in the litigation is adequately represented by Sherman\u2019s estate. Because the factual record before us is insufficiently developed at this stage to allow us confidently to resolve these arguments, we vacate the order and remand to the District Court to determine in the first instance if Laroe satisfies the requirements of Rule 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">A. Timeliness</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">In determining whether a motion to intervene is timely, courts consider \u201c(1) how long the applicant had notice of the interest before it made the motion to intervene; (2) prejudice to existing parties resulting from any delay; (3) prejudice to the applicant if the motion is denied; and (4) any unusual circumstances militating for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>or against a finding of timeliness.\u201d Pitney Bowes, 25 F.3d at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The Town contends that Laroe waited too long to file its motion to intervene. Laroe responds that it first learned of this litigation after the Town filed its motion to dismiss in May 2012. Although Laroe waited until May 2014 to inform the District Court that it wished to intervene, it explains that it could not have filed its motion earlier because the District Court had by then dismissed Sherman\u2019s suit and it could have intervened only after we decided Sherman\u2019s appeal in 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Laroe\u2019s explanation fails to answer why it did not try to intervene before the District Court first dismissed Sherman's takings claim. But even assuming that Laroe could have moved to intervene sooner, the litigation is still at an early stage. After we remanded the case, the Town filed a motion to dismiss several other claims from Sherman's complaint that we did not address in our previous opinion. A motion for reconsideration is now pending before the District Court. So despite eight years having passed since Sherman first filed suit in federal court (and more than sixteen years since Sherman first applied for subdivision approval), the parties have not even begun discovery. Although we recognize that \u201cthe point to which the suit has progressed\u201d is only \u201cone factor in the determination of timeliness,\u201d NAACP v. New York, 413 U.S. 345, 365-66, 93 S.Ct. 2591, 37 L.Ed.2d 648 (1973), this case does not represent an attempt by an intervenor to join a lawsuit at the eleventh hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Nor are we persuaded that Laroe\u2019s delay in filing the motion prejudiced the Town. The Town points to two ways in which it may have suffered prejudice. First, it asserts, Laroe\u2019s intervention would create \u201c[t]he possibility of ... a much more difficult settlement position.\u201d Oral Arg. Tr. 29. Second, it claims that because Laroe\u2019s contract with Sherman was essentially only a mortgage agreement, other creditors may attempt to join the litigation if Laroe is permitted to intervene.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While both arguments may explain how the Town is prejudiced by Laroe\u2019s participation in the litigation, neither shows how it would be prejudiced by La-roe\u2019s delay in filing its motion to intervene \u2014 our only concern on timeliness under Rule 24. Indeed, at oral argument the Town wisely conceded that timeliness was not \u201cnecessarily where the prejudice would come in[,] in this case.\u201d Oral Arg. Tr. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">Laroe, on the other hand, claims it would be prejudiced by the denial of its motion to intervene. It invested a significant sum of money into the project and lost that investment allegedly due to the Town\u2019s onerous regulatory process. Sherman\u2019s estate does not oppose Laroe\u2019s intervention. But Laroe informed the District Court that Sherman\u2019s widow, the executrix of his estate, was unwilling to pursue the takings claim unless Laroe gave her an \u201cincentive to move the case forward.\u201d Laroe\u2019s Letter to the District Court, May 28, 2014, ECF No. 16. And on appeal Laroe represents that Sherman\u2019s estate is \u201cwithout funds\u201d and therefore unable or unwilling to pursue the claim. Oral Arg. Tr. 10. Sherman\u2019s death, the alleged refusal of his impecunious estate to pursue the takings claim, and the subsequent sale of the foreclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>property might well prejudice Laroe and in any event constitute \u201cunusual circumstances militating for ... a finding of timeliness.\u201d MasterCard, 471 F.3d at 390. The District Court did not address this issue, and on remand it should have the opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\">B. An Interest Relating to the Property</p>\n<p id=\"A5N\">Rule 24 next requires the movant to \u201cassert! ] an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action.\u201d Id. at 389. That interest must be \u201cdirect, substantial, and legally protectable.\u201d Wash. Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 922 F.2d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 1990). And when the underlying dispute involves a takings claim, the movant must show that the interest existed at the time the alleged taking occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The parties dispute whether La-roe is an \u201cequitable owner\u201d of the property referenced in the 2003 Agreement under New York law. Each side marshals what appear to be non-frivolous arguments in its favor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See Appellant\u2019s Br. 11-13, 22-24 (citing, e.g., Matter of City of New York, 306 N.Y. 278, 282, 117 N.E.2d 896 (1954); Bean v. Walker, 95 A.D.2d 70, 464 N.Y.S.2d 895, 897 (4th Dep\u2019t 1983) (\u201c[Notwithstanding the words of the contract and implications which may arise therefrom, the law of property declares that, upon the execution of a contract for sale of land, the vendee acquires equitable title.\u201d)); Appellee\u2019s Br. 23-25 (citing Yale Auto Parts, Inc. v. Johnson, 758 F.2d 54, 58 (2d Cir. 1985) (\u201c[T]o have a \u2018property\u2019 interest entitled to Fourteenth Amendment procedural protection!,] a person ... must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted)). The record certainly suggests that Sherman intended to sell at least a portion of the proposed development to Laroe. But the Town responds that even if Laroe was the equitable owner, it lacked a \u201cvested property interest\u201d at the time of the alleged taking. Appellee\u2019s Br. 24-25. Indeed, one way of thinking about the Town\u2019s misguided argument about standing is that it is essentially a challenge to the \u201cinterest\u201d requirement of Rule 24(a)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But trying to identify the precise nature of Laroe\u2019s interest in the property is difficult at this stage of the litigation, when the factual record has not been fully developed. For example, the 2003 Agreement provided for the sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>certain lots within the proposed Mare-Brook subdivision, but Laroe now claims to be the owner of the entire property. Nor can we conclude, based on the record before us, that Laroe had an interest in the property when the alleged taking occurred because, as Laroe acknowledged at oral argument, the District Court has yet to determine when the Town\u2019s conduct allegedly became so onerous that it rose to the level of a taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">None of these uncertainties mean that the Rule 24 motion should have been denied. \u201cRule 24(a)(2) requires not a property interest but, rather, \u2018an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action.\u2019 \u201d Brennan v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., 260 F.3d 123, 130 (2d Cir. 2001) (emphasis added). \u201cAn interest that is otherwise sufficient under Rule 24(a)(2) does not become insufficient because the court deems the claim to be legally or factually weak.\u201d Id. Here, La-roe\u2019s position appears sufficiently tied to Sherman\u2019s that the District Court should have considered whether it satisfied the requirements of Rule 24. To be clear, we do not mean to definitively state whether, under New York law, Laroe has a vested interest in the property that would permit it to bring a takings claim against the Town in a separate action. That is not what Rule 24 requires. Instead it asks only whether the proposed intervenor has an '\u201cinterest in the proceeding\u201d that is \u201cdirect, substantial, and legally protectable.\u201d Wash. Elec. Coop., 922 F.2d at 97. An interest fails to meet the first two requirements (which are not genuinely disputed by the parties) if it is \u201cremote from the subject matter of the proceeding, or ... contingent upon the occurrence of a sequence of events.\u201d Id. In Washington Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Co., for example, we held that a state regulatory agency\u2019s interest in litigation between two electric companies was not sufficient because it was \u201cbased upon a double contingency.\u201d Id. The regulatory agency hoped to collect on behalf of ratepayers a portion of any judgment the plaintiff electric company obtained from the defendant. Id. at 95. But in order for the agency to succeed, the plaintiff was first required to win a judgment against the defendant, and then the agency would have had to convince the Vermont Public Service Board, a nonparty to the dispute, to decide that the ratepayers were entitled to a percentage of the plaintiffs recovery. Id. at 97. \u201cSuch an interest,\u201d we explained, \u201ccannot be described as direct or substantial.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">As to the third requirement that the interest be legally protectable, Laroe appears to have paid in full for the property, and it could have closed on the sale were it not for the alleged regulatory taking at issue in the underlying dispute. Were the District Court to conclude that the Town did in fact commit a regulatory taking, it seems to us that it could potentially provide relief that benefits Laroe. Thus, whether or not Laroe actually holds a form of title to the property, it has made at least a colorable claim at this stage in the litigation that it has an interest relating to the property that is \u201clegally protectable.\u201d Id. Of course, additional facts may shed light on the precise nature of this interest. We therefore find it prudent to remand for the District Court to determine in the first instance whether Laroe satisfies the interest requirement of Rule 24, separate and apart from the question of whether it would have standing in its own right. In so doing, it would be important, in our view, for the District Court to express its judgment on whether under New York law Laroe has a \u201cdirect, substantial, and legally protectable\u201d interest relating to the property. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>C. Remaining Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Rule 24(a)(2) also requires the movant to show that it \u201cis so situated that without intervention, disposition of the action may, as a practical matter, impair or impede [its] ability to protect its interest,\u201d and that its \u201cinterest is not adequately represented by the other parties.\u201d MasterCard, 471 F.3d at 389. As we have observed, Laroe\u2019s ability to protect its interest appears likely to be impaired by a judgment on Sherman\u2019s takings claim, since-Laroe purports to be the equitable owner of that property. But again, the underdeveloped factual record on appeal makes it difficult for us to determine whether Sherman will adequately represent Laroe\u2019s interest \u2014 a question the District Court did not address at all. \u201c[T]he burden to demonstrate inadequacy of representation is generally speaking \u2018minimal,\u2019 \u201d Butler, Fitzgerald &amp; Potter v. Sequa Corp., 250 F.3d 171, 179 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting Trbovich, 404 U.S. at 538 n. 10, 92 S.Ct. 630), and Laroe has represented that Sherman\u2019s estate is \u201cwithout funds\u201d and thus unwilling or unable to pursue the takings claim, Oral Arg. Tr. 10. Still, this assertion conflicts with the estate\u2019s continued effort to oppose the Town\u2019s second motion to dismiss, which was filed after we remanded Sherman\u2019s takings claim back to the District Court. Laroe also admitted that Sherman\u2019s estate shared a unity of interest with Laroe with respect to the Town\u2019s liability for the alleged taking, though Laroe argued that they may disagree about litigation strategy and on the issue of damages were they to prevail. Oral Arg. Tr. 11. We leave it to the District Court to determine whether, among other things, ending the litigation one way or the other would impair Laroe\u2019s ability to protect its interests, and whether Sherman\u2019s estate adequately represents those interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the District Court\u2019s order of March 31, 2015, insofar as it denied Laroe\u2019s motion to intervene, and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\">. Some commentary mistakenly suggests that the Second Circuit is one of the minority of jurisdictions that require intervenors to demonstrate that they independently have standing, relying on our decision in In re Holocaust Victim Assets Litigation, 225 F.3d 191 (2d Cir. 2000), cited in 6 Moore's Federal Practice \u00a7 24.03. In that case, we dismissed the appeal of an intervening nonprofit organization because it lacked standing. Id. at 196\u2014 97. But we based that decision on the prudential (rather than constitutional) ground that it failed to show that it had \"organizational standing.\u201d Id. at 195-97; see also Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977). Although we acknowledged that six of the nonprofit\u2019s members ostensibly had standing to sue in their own right, we ultimately affirmed the District Court\u2019s denial of their motion to intervene because they did not otherwise satisfy the requirements of Rule 24. Holocaust Victim Assets Litig., 225 F.3d at 197-202. Holocaust Victim Assets Litigation therefore does not abrogate our position in Brennan that a proposed intervenor need not independently have standing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-8\">. The latter argument assumes that Sherman\u2019s other creditors are similarly situated to Laroe- \u2014 in other words, that they agreed to purchase property from Sherman, prepaid a substantial sum of money, and signed a second agreement with Sherman that deemed the purchase price paid in full. There is nothing in the record before us to suggest that any other creditor is in the same situation as Laroe, let alone so many creditors that La-roe\u2019s intervention would open \"the floodgates\u201d as the Town fears. Oral Arg. Tr. 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b94-5\">. Although the Town characterizes the 2003 Agreement as only a \u201cmortgage agreement,\" Appellee's Br. 17, it appears on its face to be an agreement for the purchase of property. For example, it refers to Sherman as the \"Seller\u201d and Laroe as the \"Purchaser,\u201d and it states that \"Seller agrees to sell and convey to Purchaser\u201d certain lots from the proposed subdivision. It is true that Sherman provided a mortgage as security for the $2.5 million Laroe paid him, but structuring the transaction in that way does not necessarily convert the purchase agreement into a loan. At the end of the day, Laroe did not want to be paid back\u2014it wanted the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">In 2013 Sherman and Laroe agreed that the more than $2.5 million Laroe had already paid Sherman would constitute the purchase price for the property, along with any money Laroe paid to settle Sherman\u2019s debts under the TD Bank mortgages. The Town asserts that this additional requirement demonstrates that Laroe did not have a vested interest in the property: it never settled the TD Bank mortgages, so it never held an interest in the land. We disagree. The 2013 Agreement vested Laroe with \"the sole discretion\" to settle the TD Bank mortgages. Joint App\u2019x at 234. So long as Laroe transferred the required number of lots back to Sherman after the Town approved the subdivision, the 2013 amendment deemed the purchase price \"paid in full.\u201d Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b94-9\">. In particular, both parties frame this appeal as raising a question of standing premised on New York law: whether the \"equitable owner\u201d of real property has standing to assert a regulatory takings claim against the town in which the property is located.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
