Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 23, 2014). Collymore was found de-portable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (2) (A) (i) (II) on the basis of a pri- or conviction in 1997 under Title 35 of the Pennsylvania Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) (1997), which was determined to be a conviction that \u201crelat[ed] to a [federal] controlled substance.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). Collymore\u2019s petition challenges that determination. For the reasons set forth below, we DISMISS the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Collymore received lawful permanent-resident status in the United States in April 1989. On December 8, 1997, Colly-more was convicted of a violation of 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) (1997)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County, Pennsylvania. On August 7, 2008, upon his return from a trip to Barbados, Collymore applied for admission as a returning lawful permanent resident. Thereafter, on August 3, 2010, the Department of Homeland Security \u25a0 served Collymore with a Notice to Appear in immigration proceedings, charging him with removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) as an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) as an alien convicted of a controlled substance offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">During the removal proceeding, Colly-more admitted the factual allegations concerning his criminal conviction but deferred to the IJ as to removability. On the basis of Collymore\u2019s admissions, the IJ sustained both charges, and Collymore immediately sought cancellation of removal as a lawful permanent resident. The IJ denied Collymore\u2019s application for relief but afforded him additional time to pursue post-conviction relief in Pennsylvania state court related to his 1997 conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Colly-more subsequently moved to terminate the removal proceedings on the basis that his conviction did not render him removable because his conviction was not categorically a controlled substance offense or a crime involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Thereafter, the IJ denied Collymore\u2019s motion to terminate and ordered him removed to Barbados. Specifically, the IJ determined that \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) \u2014 the statute under which Collymore was convicted \u2014 was not categorically a crime related to a federal controlled substance because, in the IJ\u2019s view, the Pennsylvania statute proscribed conduct that would not necessarily constitute a controlled substance offense under federal law. The IJ then relied on a Third Circuit decision, <em>United States v. Abbott, </em>748 F.3d 154 (3d Cir. 2014), to conclude that the Pennsylvania statute was divisible and employed the modified categorical approach, in which it examined Collymore\u2019s record of conviction to determine whether his conviction was for a controlled substance offense recognized by federal law. The IJ observed, based on a docket transcript certified by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the Pennsylvania state court, that Colly-more\u2019s conviction related to cocaine, which is listed as a controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act\u2019s (\u201cCSA\u201d) schedules of controlled substances. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 (1997).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the IJ concluded that Collymore was inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), and further inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) because an offense involving the possession of a controlled substance necessarily constituted a crime involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\">Collymore appealed to the BIA, which affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissed the appeal. Like the IJ, the BIA determined that Collymore\u2019s conviction under 85 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) was not a categorical match to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), but that the Pennsylvania statute was divisible under <em>Abbott. </em>Like the IJ, the BIA found that the record reflected that Collymore\u2019s conviction involved cocaine, a federal controlled substance, and that he was consequently removable under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), but the BIA did not reach the question <em>of </em>whether Collymore\u2019s conviction also qualified as a crime involving moral turpitude subject to removability under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Collymore filed a timely petition for review in this Court, challenging the determination of the BIA that a conviction under 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) (1997) constitutes a violation of a law relating to a federal controlled substance for purposes of removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). Because we conclude that it does, we dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u201cAny alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of ... any law ... of a State, ... relating to a controlled substance ... is deporta-ble\u201d upon order of the Attorney General of the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). Although we lack jurisdiction to review \u201cany final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a [federal controlled substance] offense,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), \u201c[w]e retain jurisdiction ... to review the legal question ... whether a conviction underlying an order of removal, or the denial of relief from an order of removal, constitutes a[] [controlled substance offense],\u201d <em>Higgins v. Holder, </em>677 F.3d 97, 100 (2d Cir. 2012) (per curiam). \u201cThe inquiry determines our jurisdiction: [i]f [Collymore\u2019s] conviction is a[ ] [controlled substance offense], we must dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction; if not, we may exercise jurisdiction and vacate the order of removal.\u201d <em>Oouch v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>633 F.3d 119, 121 (2d Cir. 2011). Thus, \u201cthe jurisdictional issue merges with the merits, and we are therefore required to consider [Colly-more\u2019s] substantive argument\u201d: that his Pennsylvania conviction is not a controlled substance offense under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). <em>Higgins, </em>677 F.3d at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">I. Legal Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">In assessing whether a conviction under 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) constitutes a controlled substance offense, \u201cwe use a categorical approach that looks to the elements of the penal statute rather than the particulars of the alien\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Oouch, </em>633 F.3d at 122. In doing so, we must determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>\u201cwhether \u2018every set of facts violating [the state] statute\u2019 satisfies the criteria for re-movability\u201d under the INA, mindful that \u201conly the minimum criminal conduct necessary for a conviction is relevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Abimbola v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 173, 176 (2d Cir. 2004)). If, however, the Pennsylvania criminal statute is \u201cdivisible\u201d into qualifying and non-qualifying removable offenses, we proceed \u201cunder a modified categorical approach to ascertain which class of criminal act furnished the basis for the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where the statute is neither categorical nor divisible, though, \u201cour inquiry is complete.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">II. Collymore\u2019s Conviction is Categorically a Conviction for a Controlled Substance Offense <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">On appeal, the parties maintain, as they did before the agency below, that Collymore\u2019s 1997 conviction under \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) does not categorically constitute a controlled substance offense because the Pennsylvania statute under which Colly-more was convicted is not a categorical match to the grounds of removability under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). That is, according to the parties, the IJ and BIA properly declined to apply the categorical approach because, in their view, some of the substances covered by the Pennsylvania law do not necessarily appear in the federal schedules of controlled substances. In their view, this means that the Pennsylvania statute criminalizes controlled substances that do not qualify as bases for removability under the INA, thereby precluding re-movability under the categorical approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">We disagree; the crime for which Collymore was convicted in 1997 under \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) is categorically a federal controlled substance offense for purposes of the INA, resulting in Collymore\u2019s re-movability.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">The 1997 version of the Pennsylvania statute in question prohibits the following acts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">Except as authorized by this act, the manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver, a controlled substance by a person not registered under this act, or a practitioner not registered or licensed by the appropriate State board, or knowingly creating, delivering or possessing with intent to deliver, a counterfeit controlled substance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30). As noted, the INA treats as deportable \u201cany alien convicted of ... a violation of ... any law ... of a State ... relating to a controlled substance\u201d as defined by the CSA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). The CSA makes it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-13\">unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally\u2014(1) to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance; or (2) to create, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to distribute or dispense, a counterfeit substance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">Federal and Pennsylvania law confer similar meaning to the terms \u201ccounterfeit substance\u201d (as used by the CSA) and \u201ccounterfeit controlled substance\u201d (as used in the Pennsylvania statute). The CSA defines the term \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d to mean \u201ca drug or other substance, or immediate precursor, included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V\u201d of the federal schedules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>controlled substances, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 802(6), and describes a \u201ccounterfeit substance\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnA\">a controlled substance which, or the container or labeling of which, without authorization, bears the trademark, trade name, or other identifying mark, imprint, number, or device, or any likeness thereof, of a manufacturer, distributor, or dispenser other than the person or persons who in fact manufactured, distributed, or dispensed such substance and which thereby falsely purports or is represented to be the product of, or to have been distributed by, such other manufacturer, distributor, or dispenser,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au7\"><em>id. </em>\u00a7 802(7). Although Pennsylvania law provides no definition for the term \u201ccounterfeit controlled substance,\u201d it does contain separate definitions for the terms \u201ccounterfeit\u201d and \u201ccontrolled substance.\u201d It defines the term \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d to mean \u201ca drug, substance, or immediate precursor\u201d listed in the Pennsylvania schedules of controlled substances and defines the term \u201ccounterfeit\u201d to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATu\">a controlled substance, other drug, device or cosmetic which, or the container or labeling of which, without authorization, bears the trademark, trade name, or other identifying mark, imprint, number, or device, or any likeness thereof, of a manufacturer, distributor, or dispenser other than the person or persons who in fact manufactured, distributed, or dispensed such substance and which thereby is falsely purported or represented to be the product of, or to have been distributed by, such other manufacturer, distributor, or dispenser.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-3\">35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 780-102. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s conclusion that, because the Pennsylvania law also covered conduct involving \u201cother drug[s]\u201d and \u201ccosmetic[s]\u201d that were not necessarily prohibited federally by the CSA, <em>id. </em>the Pennsylvania statute was broader than its federal counterpart and, as such, a conviction under \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) did not categorically constitute a crime relating to a federal controlled substance. That interpretation of the statute, however, is at odds with our duty to consider the most natural reading of the text and the context of the statute. <em>See Pettus v. Morgenthau, </em>554 F.3d 293, 297 (2d Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u201c[W]hen construing the plain text of a statutory enactment, we do not construe each phrase literally or in isolation. Rather, we attempt to ascertain how a reasonable reader would understand the statutory text, considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the terms \u201ccounterfeit\u201d and \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d are taken in isolation (as advocated by the IJ and BIA), the Pennsylvania statute\u2019s definition of the term \u201ccounterfeit controlled substance\u201d might be read more broadly. Under the most natural reading of these terms taken together, however, in the context of \u00a7 780-113(a)(30), the term \u201ccounterfeit\u201d modifies the term \u201ccontrolled substance,\u201d such that a \u201ccounterfeit controlled substance\u201d encompasses only a <em>controlled substance </em>that, consistent with the definition, is mislabeled, such that it falsely purports or represents to be the product of a manufacturer, distributer, or dispenser other than the person or persons who in fact manufactured, distributed, or dispensed such substance. <em>See </em>35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 780-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The Superior Court of Pennsylvania has reached the same-conclusion regarding the range of conduct proscribed by \u00a7 780-113(a)(30). <em>See Commonwealth v. Mohamud, </em>15 A.3d 80, 89 <em>&amp; </em>n. 23 (Pa.Super.Ct.2010) (\u201cA counterfeit controlled substance is defined in the Act as a controlled substance that is mislabeled such that [it] falsely purports to [be] the product of a manufacturer other than the manufacturer who created it.\u201d (citing 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 780-102)). This reading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>makes sense given that the focus of \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) is on controlled substances, not on substances that the Pennsylvania legislature has declined to criminalize under the Pennsylvania controlled substances schedules. Thus, the text of the Pennsylvania statute does not suggest that it might cast a wider net than that of the CSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Moreover, a comparison of the Pennsylvania and federal controlled substances schedules in effect in 1997, at the time of Collymore\u2019s conviction, <em>cf. Mellouli v. Lynch, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1980, 1987-88, 192 L.Ed.2d 60 (2015) (explaining that we are to compare the drug schedules that were enacted \u201c[a]t the time of [the petitioner\u2019s] conviction\u201d), reveals that the Pennsylvania schedules are not broader than the federal schedules, as they criminalize the same substances.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Compare </em>35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 780-104, <em>with </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812. That is, the 1997 version of the Pennsylvania statute under which Colly-more was convicted is not categorically broader than the federal definition because all of the substances proscribed by the Pennsylvania law are also listed in the federal schedules of controlled substances in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802. Indeed, the Third Circuit has previously observed the same in a similar case under the INA. See <em>Clarke v. Ashcroft, </em>100 Fed.Appx. 884, 886 (3d Cir. 2004) (\u201cThe BIA found that all the illicit substances covered by the Pennsylvania statute are listed in the schedule of controlled substances in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802. It follows that any substance [the petitioner] was convicted of delivering under the Pennsylvania statute necessarily constitutes a violation of the Federal Controlled Substance Act referenced in INA \u00a7 241(a)(2)(B)(i).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">Notably, neither the IJ nor BIA took note of the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Clarke. </em>Rather, they relied instead on a more recent decision from the Third Circuit in <em>United States v. Abbott, </em>748 F.3d 154 (3d Cir. 2014), for the proposition that the categorical approach does not apply to \u00a7 780-113(a)(30). But <em>Abbott </em>is readily distinguishable from the facts presently before us. <em>Abbott </em>involved a criminal sentencing appeal where the Third Circuit was tasked with determining whether \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) was divisible under the modified categorical approach for purposes of determining whether convictions under the Pennsylvania statute qualified as predicate offenses under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>See </em>748 F.3d at 156. Critical to that inquiry was the type of controlled substance at issue because the prescribed range of penalties imposed for violations of \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) varied based on its character. The identity of the drug involved in a defendant\u2019s conviction under the Pennsylvania statute, the <em>Abbott </em>Court determined, was therefore an element of the crime that had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 159. Accordingly, the Third Circuit concluded that the statute included several alternative elements and was therefore divisible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Unlike <em>Abbott, </em>however, the length of sentence in a criminal defendant\u2019s prior conviction has no bearing on the inquiry presently before us in an immigration removal proceeding. Moreover, <em>Abbott </em>concerned an assessment of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction against the ACCA, and therefore lends no support to Collymore\u2019s case because it did not involve a comparison between \u00a7 780-114(a)(30) and the CSA. The relevant question before us is whether the Pennsylvania and federal controlled substance and counterfeit controlled substance definitions categorically proscribe the same controlled substances. We have no difficulty in concluding that they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Because we hold that Collymore\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) was categorically a controlled substance offense under the INA at the time of his conviction in 1997, we need not reach the question of divisibility or apply a modified categorical approach in our analysis. <em>See Costa v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 110, 115 (2d Cir. 2010) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">We have considered the parties\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Because a conviction under 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) (1997) is categorically a conviction under a law relating to a federal controlled substance under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, we lack jurisdiction to review the removability order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\">. This statute was amended on January 24, 2000.

According to Collymore, his motion to vacate his 1997 conviction remains pending in Pennsylvania state court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\">. The federal controlled substances schedules were amended on July 9, 2012. Each reference hereinafter to \u00a7 812 refers to the 1997 version of the federal drug schedules in effect at the time of Collymore's conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\">. Because \"the BIA has no interpretive responsibility over a state criminal statute, we review <em>de novo </em>its interpretation\u201d of 35 Pa. Stat.

In urging us that the Pennsylvania controlled substance schedules are broader than the federal schedules, Collymore argues that the Pennsylvania schedules list substances, such as peyote and salvia divinorum, that were not listed in the federal schedules. A review of the 1997 Pennsylvania and federal controlled substances schedules, however, reveals that neither statute prohibited salvia divinorum, <em>compare </em>35 Pa. Stat.
