While he and a fellow-employee were lifting a can of ice cream mix he felt a \u201csnap\u201d in the left side and said to his companion, \u201cGee, I felt a snap,\u201d but he felt no pain, it did not hurt, and he forgot about it and continued to work the remainder of the day. Early in the evening, while at home, he discovered a lump in his left groin which he reported to his foreman on Monday morning and was sent to the company\u2019s doctor for examination, which disclosed a \u201crecurrent direct inguinal hernia with no tenderness or pain on the edges of the ring through which the protrusion came.\u201d His medical history revealed that in May, 1932, he was operated on for hernia on the left side and that on May 14th, 1936, a pre-employment physical examination showed that the rings on both sides were enlarged. The plaintiff returned to work on Tuesday and worked all day but has not returned since that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>The compensation commissioner found that the \u201csnap\u201d which the plaintiff felt \u201cis equivalent to feeling pain, when related to hernia,\u201d and held that \u201che felt pain immediately following\u201d an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment, and awarded compensation. On the appeal the Superior Court held that this finding was unwarranted, that, instead, it should be found that the plaintiff felt no pain and that, under the applicable statutory provision (in \u00a7 5237 of the General Statutes) he was not entitled to compensation. The correctness of these conclusions is the point decisive of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The history of the special provision regarding hernia here involved, in our Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, has been reviewed in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Wise &amp; Upson Co., Inc. </em>(1928) 108 Conn. 309, 145 Atl. 155, and summarized in <em>Clini </em>v. <em>New Haven Brewing Co., </em>119 Conn. 556, 558, 177 Atl. 745. The provision, first made in 1927 (Public Acts, Chap. 307, \u00a7 4), was that \u201cIn order to be entitled to compensation for a hernia, the employee shall prove that the hernia resulted from an accidental injury, that inability to work immediately followed such accident, that there was not a preexisting hernia at or prior to the accident for which compensation is claimed and that, within two weeks thereafter, the facts of such accident were communicated to the employer.\u201d The purpose of this provision, we held, was \u201cto afford a means of assurance that when incapacity was claimed to be due to hernia, the hernia really resulted from an injury or strain occurring in the course of the employment and not from some strain or effort which occurred outside the scope of the employment. The special requirements made with reference to hernia are in their nature facts tending to evidence the actual connection between the incapacity and the claimed injury.\u201d <em>Clini </em>v. <em>New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number><em>Haven Brewing Co., </em>supra, p. 559. Proof is required that the usual form of hernia\u2014the hernia of effort\u2014 was caused by a strain or other accident arising out of and in the course of the employment. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Wise &amp; Upson Co., Inc., </em>supra, p. 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">In the case last cited we held, by a divided court, that in order to satisfy the requirement of proof \u201cthat inability to work immediately followed [the] accident\u201d such inability must follow an injury \u201cpresently, without any substantial interval of time,\u201d so that when, as in that case, the employee continued his work for a week after the claimed injury, he was not entitled to compensation. Apparently as a result of the decision in that case and the considerations advanced in the dissenting opinion therein the General Assembly at its next session (1929) amended this provision by substituting for the requirement of proof \u201cthat inability to work immediately followed such accident\u201d one for proof that the hernia resulted from an accidental injury \u201caccompanied by evidences of pain [and] that inability to work followed such accident within one week.\u201d Public Acts, 1929, Chap. 242, \u00a7 2. The same provision continues in \u00a7 5237 of the General Statutes. The effect of this change was to liberalize the requirement as to inability to work so that the injury may be compensable although such inability may not \u201cimmediately\u201d follow the accident, if it ensues within one week, but to impose, as an additional assurance that the hernia resulted from accidental injury, a requirement of proof of such injury \u201caccompanied by evidences of pain.\u201d The present case presents the question as to what is essential in order to satisfy the requirement last quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The underlying reason for such special provisions in this and other States is that owing to the nature of hernia arid its onset, a lifting or straining, perhaps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>months before, may be assigned as the producing cause and the basis of a claim for compensation the merits of which, due to lapse of time and lack of notice to the employer, are extremely difficult of just determination, and the purpose is to restrict compensation to those cases where there is relative coincidence of accident and some significant manifestation of a hernia resulting therefrom, and thereby measurably alleviate that difficulty. We said in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Wise &amp; Upson Co., Inc., </em>supra (p. 318): \u201cIf this were a matter of which we could take judicial notice, we would find surgical authority holding that a hernia which was actually caused by a strain is ordinarily accompanied by pain and immediate inability to proceed with the work that was being done.\u201d We there held that the legislation mentioned made proof of inability to work immediately following the accident an essential to compensable hernia. The later amendment (1929), while liberalizing this requirement so that the requisite inability to work might follow, instead of immediately, within one week, adopted the other suggested manifestation\u2014of pain accompanying the accidental injury\u2014as an additional safeguard in fixing the time and the circumstances of the incurrence of hernia. Its appropriateness for this purpose is indicated by uncontradicted medical testimony in the present case that ordinarily a traumatic hernia \u201ccomes through in a hurry, it does some damage coming through; tears the ring, at least stretches it to a point when there is some fibre rupture, with accompanying tenderness and pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Nontechnical definitions of \u201cpain\u201d while varying in form of expression all connote some degree of distress or suffering. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d Ed.); 7 Century Dictionary &amp; Encyclopedia, p. 4232; <em>Merriam </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>64 Ore. 476, 103 Pac. 406; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Words &amp; Phrases (2d Series) Vol. 3, p. 863; (3d Series) Vol. 5, p. 801; (4th Series) Vol. 3, p. 15; 46 C. J. p. 1169. The amended statute also goes farther than to render pain attending injury sufficient of itself to render hernia compensable; it requires that the injury be \u201caccompanied by evidences of pain.\u201d Therefore it would not be sufficient if the employee felt pain subjectively; it must be manifested objectively by some outward sign or indication evidencing it, significant of its occurrence and of the time thereof analogous to the evidence afforded, under the statute of 1927, by immediately ensuing inability to work. Evidence of this kind may be afforded in various ways, as by observed involuntary gesture, facial expression, or exclamation indicative of distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">We are constrained to find the trial court correct in holding that the finding that the \u201csnap\u201d was equivalent to pain for the present purpose lacked support from the record. The plaintiff, who appeared at the hearing without counsel and was examined by the commissioner, naively or frankly disclaimed repeatedly that he felt any pain, stating that he \u201cfelt the snap; it didn\u2019t hurt; I forgot all about it; I didn\u2019t know I was hurt; I kept on working.\u201d It was only when he had finished his day\u2019s work and gone home and was taking a shower that he noticed the lump in his side. The trial court\u2019s statement that \u201call of the evidence on this point is to the effect that the claimant did not feel pain\u201d is borne out by the record. If the snap could be held to constitute pain or to be equivalent thereto, the plaintiff\u2019s statement to his fellow-employee that he felt that snap could be held an \u201cevidence of pain,\u201d but since it must be held, instead, that there was no pain, the declaration may not be regarded as that \u201cevidence of pain\u201d which the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>contemplates and requires in order to entitle one to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We are not unmindful that it can be claimed with reason that evidence of such a muscular manifestation as occurred in the present instance might come within the purposes of the statutory provision as well as that of pain. However, especially as the precise terms of these enactments, it has been disclosed in previous cases, have been agreed upon by representatives of both employers and employees <em>(O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Wise &amp; Upson Co., Inc., </em>supra, p. 323) we are not at liberty to extend, by interpretation, the meaning implicit in the language employed, in order to provide a more liberal rule of compensation than that which the legislature has seen fit to adopt. Idem, p. 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
