If, as is the principal claim of the appellant, a person having financial resources of her own which are available for her support is not \u201cpoor and unable to support herself\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1717 of the General Statutes, disqualification to recover under the statute would result by reason of a bank account of $1200 as well as from one of $1800, and irrespective of competence to earn support for herself by personal services. The crucial question is one of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In 1699 the selectmen of towns were directed to make necessary provision for idiots and lunatics who were incapable of providing for themselves. 4 Col. Rec., p. 285. In 1715 it was provided that relatives, within the degrees named, of \u201csuch poor, impotent persons,\u201d being of sufficient ability, \u201cshall relieve such poor persons\u201d in such manner as the county court shall assess. 5 Col. Rec., p. 503. In the Revision of 1750 (Edition 1754, p. 90) the scope of the act was so broadened as to include, also, any persons who \u201cshall by age, sickness, or otherwise become poor, and impotent, and unable to support or provide for themselves, and having no estate wherewithal they may be supported and maintained.\u201d The statute continued substantially in that form to and in the Revision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>1808 (p. 382). There and previously it was carried under the general title \u201cIdiots\u201d and entitled \u201cAn Act for relieving and ordering of Idiots, impotent, distracted, and idle persons.\u201d In the Revision of 1821 it was transferred to the title \u201cPaupers\u201d (p. 369) and the opening language was changed to \u201cwhen any person shall, by age, sickness, insanity, or any cause, become poor, impotent and unable to support and provide for himself and family. . . .\u201d In the course of subsequent revisions the language of the statute has been condensed and modernized. <em>Condon </em>v. <em>Pomroy-Grace, </em>73 Conn. 607, 613, 48 Atl. 756. By Chapter 70 of the Public Acts of 1867, liability to support such a person was extended to the relation of husband, and to a wife in 1921 (Public Acts, Chap. 114).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In all of the revisions since that of 1821, this statute has been included in the chapter pertaining to support of paupers, and for a long time was followed, in the same act, by other sections providing for support of paupers by the towns. For example, in the Revision of 1821, the next section (two) of Chapter 1 of Title 73 provided that \u201cAll poor and impotent persons who have not estate sufficient for their support, and who have no relations of sufficient ability, who are obliged by law to support them, shall be provided for, and supported, at the expense of the town where they belong.\u201d Also, from the beginning, the selectmen have been among those authorized to bring proceedings under the statute. These considerations point to an intention that the persons to obtain relief for whom it is applicable are those to whom it would be the duty of the town or other public authority to furnish support if it is not furnished by relatives. It was said in <em>Belden </em>v. <em>Belden, </em>82 Conn. 611, 613, 74 Atl. 896, in an action under the same statute, then \u00a7 2499 of the General Statutes of 1902, \u201cThe defendant is correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>in his contention that the statute under which the proceedings were brought is one designed for the protection of the public interests, and not for the enforcement by a wife of her marital rights of support and maintenance. For the latter purpose other methods are provided. ... It seeks rather to secure, to persons unable to support themselves, a proper support, under the circumstances, through the medium of contribution from others, brought by statute under the duty of making that contribution by reason of some relationship, and thus protect the public purse from demands upon it which would otherwise result.\u201d See also <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Fenn, </em>103 Conn. 1, 4, 130 Atl. 126; <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>75 Conn. 64, 52 Atl. 318; <em>Wethersfield </em>v. <em>Montague, </em>3 Conn. 507, 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In a proceeding under this statute it is necessary for the plaintiff to meet its terms in order to lay a basis for recovery, although the same necessity may not exist in an equitable action by a wife against her husband to enforce her marital rights of support. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>114 Conn. 575, 578, 159 Atl. 489; <em>Artman </em>v. <em>Artman, </em>111 Conn. 124, 128, 149 Atl. 246. Among these conditions precedent are, \u201cneglect to provide\u201d on the part of the relative proceeded against <em>(Lathrop </em>v. <em>Lathrop, </em>78 Conn. 650, 652, 63 Atl. 514) and ability to do so <em>(Cunningham </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>supra, p. 68). Equally, the plaintiff must be \u201cpoor and. unable to support herself\u201d within the meaning of the statute; that is, her situation must be shown to be such that if support was not provided by designated relatives she would be entitled to receive it from the town or other responsible public authority. No person would be so entitled so long as he or she possessed or had presently available personal means reasonably sufficient for such support, and that, manifestly, is the present situation of this plaintiff as revealed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>finding, even without the claimed corrections as to amount. Therefore a conclusion requisite to a recovery-in this action lacks necessary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">There is error; the case is remanded to the Superior Court with direction to enter judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
