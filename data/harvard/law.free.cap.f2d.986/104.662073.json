Her daughter, Regina A. Evans, individually and as the representative of the Decedent\u2019s estate, sued the Police Chief and two officers asserting claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and Texas law. The thrust of the complaint alleged that Marlin\u2019s Police Department failed to use due care in Decedent\u2019s confinement. The district court granted the Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. We find that the district court properly dismissed the federal claims because no constitutional violations are present. The summary judgment on the state law claims, however, must be reversed and remanded, as there are issues of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-18\">\n<em>Background and Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b196-19\">Decedent was arrested for public intoxication, taken to the Marlin City Jail, and placed in a cell alone. Approximately two hours and fifteen minutes later, an officer discovered Evans hanging from the cell\u2019s bars, suspended by a garden hose normally used to wash down the jail floors. An autopsy confirmed that the cause of death was asphyxia by hanging, and concluded that she committed suicide.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-20\">Suit was brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1981), Texas Wrongful Death<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Survivorship Statutes,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the Texas Tort Claims Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court held that no violations of Decedent\u2019s constitutionally secured rights occurred. Additionally, the court held that the Defendants-Appellees met their burden of proof in establishing suicide as an affirmative defense to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Texas state law claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Summary judgment was entered against Regina A. Evans, and she now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Alx\">Summary judgment is appropriate if the record discloses \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In reviewing the summary judgment, we apply the same standard of review as did the district court. <em>Waltman v. International Paper Co., </em>875 F.2d 468, 474 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Moore v. Mississippi Valley State Univ., </em>871 F.2d 545, 548 (5th Cir. 1989). The pleadings, depositions, admissions, and answers to interrogatories, together with affidavits, must demonstrate that no genuine issue of material fact remains. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). To that end we must \u201creview the facts drawing all inferences most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Reid v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>784 F.2d 577, 578 (5th Cir.1986). If the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for trial. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); <em>see Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374-75 (5th Cir.1969) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\n<em>\u00a7 1983 Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The elements of a \u00a7 1983 cause of action are: (1) a deprivation of rights secured by the constitution, (2) by a person acting under color of state law. <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 330-31, 106 S.Ct. 662, 664-65, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986); <em>Augustine v. Doe, </em>740 F.2d 322, 324-25 (5th Cir. 1984). A \u00a7 1983 claim may lie when a prisoner\u2019s <em>obviously </em>serious medical needs are met with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d by officials. <em>See Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 105, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); <em>Burns v. City of Galveston, </em>905 F.2d 100, 103 (5th Cir.1990). Likewise, \u201cThe failure to provide pre-trial detainees with adequate protection from their <em>known </em>suicidal impulses is actionable under \u00a7 1983____\u201d <em>Rhyne v. Henderson County, </em>973 F.2d 386, 391 (5th Cir.1992) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">Appellant contends that the city acted with deliberate indifference towards the Decedent\u2019s right to protection from her own suicidal tendencies. This indifference was allegedly illustrated by the failure to provide adequate training to police officers in dealing with suicidal prisoners, and failure to adopt policies to prevent detainees from taking their own lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">Failure to train police personnel can support \u00a7 1983 liability \u201conly where the failure to train amounts to a deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the police come into contact.\u201d <em>City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 388, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 1204, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989). We recently addressed the issue of training to detect suicidal detainees in <em>Burns v. City of Galveston, </em>905 F.2d 100 (5th Cir.1990). A municipality should be required to provide its police officers with minimal training to detect <em>\u201cobvious </em>medical needs of detainees with <em>known, demonstrable, </em>and serious mental disorders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104 (emphasis supplied). Police personnel are not required to \u201cunerringly detect suicidal tendencies;\u201d such an exacting standard \u201crequires the skills of an experienced medical professional with psychiatric training____\u201d <em>Id. </em>Recognizing these practical realities, the <em>Burns </em>court held that detainees have no absolute right to a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>p\u00edete psychological examination. <em>Id. </em>Absent such a right, the failure to train custodial officials in screening procedures to detect <em>latent </em>suicidal tendencies does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. <em>Id.; cf. Partridge v. Two Unknown Police Officers, </em>791 F.2d 1182, 1184 (5th Cir.1986) (\u00a7 1983 liability may exist where suicidal tendencies <em>obvious </em>to arresting officers).</p>\n<p id=\"Asj\">Here there was no indication that Rae Evans would take her own life. officers\u2019 affidavits showed that the Decedent did not exhibit any apparent suibehavior on the night of her death, that she had been in the Marlin City on prior occasions and had never exhibsuch an inclination. R. at 153 (affidavit of Peter Otholt); R. at 175 (affidavit of Randy Trice). The Appellant did not controvert this evidence. In the absence of manifest signs that the Decedent was danger to herself, the city\u2019s failure to police personnel to detect potential suicidal impulses does not give rise to a deprivation of constitutional rights. <em>Rhyne v. Henderson County, </em>973 F.2d 391 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Burns v. City of Galveston, </em>905 F.2d 100, 104 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"AYy\">Plaintiff-Appellant also argues that the failure to adopt and implement adequate policies regarding care for potentially suicidal inmates amounts to deliberate indifference on the city\u2019s part, and that such indifference contributed to the deprivation of Decedent's rights.</p>\n<p id=\"AqK\">liability, the failure to promulgate municipal policy must amount to \u201can intentional choice, not merely an unintentionally negligent oversight.\u201d <em>Rhyne, </em>973 F.2d at 392 (citing <em>City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 389, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 1205, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989)). A failure to adopt a policy rises to the level of deliberate indifference \u201cwhen it is obvious that the likely consequences of not adopting a policy will be a deprivation of civil rights.\u201d <em>Rhyne, </em>973 F.2d at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"AJe\">The Marlin Police Department has policies in place for the safe incarceration of inmates. <em>See </em>R. at 130-46. No controverting evidence was presented that these policies were implemented with deliberate indifference towards the plight of suicidal detainees. At most, these policies were not strictly followed on the night of Verna Rae Evans\u2019 death. Had they been she would not have had access to the hose.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The proximity of the hose to her cell may have been negligence, but the negligent acts of an official will not support liability under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 328, 106 S.Ct. 662, 663, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986); <em>see also Davidson v. Cannon, </em>474 U.S. 344, 347, 106 S.Ct. 668, 670, 88 L.Ed.2d 677 (1986) (\u201c[W]here a government official is merely negligent in causing the injury, no procedure for compensation is constitutionally required.\u201d). Consequently, it cannot be said that the city acted with deliberate indifference in this policy making endeavor: \u201cPut another way, a reasonable juror could not find that [Marlin, Texas] adopted policies creating an obvious risk that pretrial detainees\u2019 constitutional rights would be violated.\u201d <em>Rhyne, </em>973 F.2d at 392.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AptY\">\n<em>Texas Tort Claims Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AcR\">Appellant argues that summary judgment was improvidently entered on her pendant state law claims. A Texas municipality can be liable for personal injury or death caused by a condition or use of tangible persona] or real property under its control. <em>See </em>Tex.Civ.Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 101.021 (West 1986); <em>see also Hale v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>Skeikkoleslam, </em>724 F.2d 1205, 1209 (5th Cir.1984) (\u201cIf nondefective property is alleged to have been used or misused by an officer acting within the scope of employment so as to cause the injury, a cause of action is stated.\u201d) (citing <em>Salcedo v. El Paso Hosp. Dist., </em>659 S.W.2d 30, 32 (Tex. 1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">In a civil action for wrongful death, a defendant can plead and prove suicide as an affirmative defense. This defense succeeds only if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">the plaintiffs conduct was the <em>sole cause </em>of the damages sustained; provided, however, if the suicide was <em>caused in whole or in part </em>by a failure on the part of any defendant to comply with an applicable legal standard, then such suicide or attempted suicide shall not be a defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFq\">Tex.Civ.Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 93.001 (West Supp.1992) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The district court held that there was no evidence to counter the autopsy\u2019s conclusion that Evans\u2019 death was a suicide. The Appellant, however, presented expert testimony that Appellees\u2019 negligence played a part in Verna Rae Evans\u2019 suicide. <em>See </em>R. at 247-49 <em>(e.g., </em>failure to have \u201cprotrusion-free cells,\u201d and the accessibility of the hose). Furthermore, the Chief of Police testified that there is a duty to protect inmates, and it is a breach of this duty to allow inmates access to objects with which they could harm themselves. R. at 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">This evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact, at least with respect to the applicability of \u00a7 93.001\u2019s affirmative defense of suicide. First, the defense is available only if the decedent\u2019s conduct was the <em>sole cause </em>of death. There has been evidence presented which raises the possibility that Appellees\u2019 negligence played a role in the suicide.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Additionally, if the suicide was even partially caused by the Appellees\u2019 breach of \u201can applicable legal standard,\u201d the affirmative defense of suicide is unavailable. Whether or not the conduct of the Appellees\u2019 amounts to a breach of the legal standard of due care is a question of fact. Because we must review the facts drawing all inferences in a light most favorable to the non-movant,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we cannot say that no genuine issue of fact remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">The Appellant does not state any claims of constitutional deprivation that would support liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Summary judgment in favor of the Defendants-Appellees on this issue is AFFIRMED. The Appellant has presented sufficient evidence on her state law claims to create a valid issue of material fact. Summary judgment on the state law claims is REVERSED, and we REMAND these claims to the district court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-13\">. In her brief on appeal, Appellant concedes that no city personnel actively participated in Evans\u2019 death. Furthermore, although a Fourth Amendment excessive force claim and an Eighth Amendment violation were pleaded, these claims have been abandoned on appeal; the issues were not raised or briefed by Appellant. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(4); <em>Price v.

The failure to follow procedural guidelines, standing alone, does not implicate constitutional liability. <em>Gagne v. City of Galveston, </em>805 F.2d 558, 559-60 (5th Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>483 U.S. 1021, 107 S.Ct. 3266, 97 L.Ed.2d 764 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"AH\">. The district court also concluded that the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. R. at 269. We do not reach this issue with respect to \u00a7 1983 liability because no constitutional deprivation is present. Whether or not immunity is proper regarding the Texas state law claims is a question left for the trial court to address on remand. <em>See, e.g., Huddleston v. Maurry, </em>841 S.W.2d 24, 28-29 (Tex.Ct.

This case is not controlling on the causation issue for two reasons. First, this case predates Tex.Civ.Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 93.001 (West Supp.1992). The language of the statute indicates that suicide will not act as an affirmative defense if it was caused <em>in part </em>by a failure of the defendant to comply with an applicable legal standard. <em>Id. </em>This is a departure from the \"general rule\u201d that absolves a tortfeasor of liability when the injured party takes their own life. Second, <em>Exxon Corp. v. Brecheen </em>dealt with a negligent act which resulted in the uncontrollable impulse to commit suicide. Any negligence in the instant case is not alleged to have caused the suicidal tendencies; rather, the acts complained of may have facilitated the suicide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b199-16\">. <em>Reid v.
