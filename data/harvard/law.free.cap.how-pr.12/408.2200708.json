Pr. R. </em>234,) and other cases cited. They were cases where the defendant sought leave to <em>set up </em>the defence of usury, which the court for the reasons stated, refused. In the present case that defence is set up or interposed, and the question is, will the court permit the correction of a clerical error. I have no doubt of the duty of the court to permit it, however unconscionable may be the defence contained in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">But even if this were a motion to permit the defendant to set up or interpose the defence of usury, I should feel it my duty to permit such an answer, under proper circumstances, to be put in.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">I cannot but concur with Justice Parker, in <em>Grant </em>agt. M\u2018Laughlin, (4 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>216,) where he says, <em>\u201c So </em>long as the statute makes the taking of usury a? defence, it was entitled to be treated like any other legal defence, and he would make no discrimination in imposing terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">In <em>Catlin </em>agt. <em>Gunter, </em>(1 <em>Buer, </em>253,) the court refused to amend pleadings to conform to the evidence produced on the trial. The reason-given was, that \u201cin our judgment, it would not be a .proper exercise, but an abuse of our discretion, so to ' amend an answer after a trial as to let in the defence of usury against a holder for value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The judgment of the superior court in this case was reversed in the court of appeals. (1 <em>Kern. </em>368.) The court say, \u201c We are not, I conceive, warranted in applying a different rule to the defence of usury, from that which wTe would hold applicable in other cases. It is a defence allowed and provided by law. The defendant, in seeking to avail himself of the evidence, notwithstanding the variance,.did not claim an indulgence from the court, but simply asked for the application of those rules which the legislature have provided for all cases indiscriminately, whether the partyinvoking their exercise was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>seeking to visit his adversary with a forfeiture or not. The law has not made any distinction between such defences and those where no forfeiture is involved, <em>and the court can make none. </em>If the sense of the legislature is plainly expressed, as it seems to me to be, we have no judgment to pass upon the policy of these provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The motion, therefore, must be granted, on payment of f&gt;10 costs of opposing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
