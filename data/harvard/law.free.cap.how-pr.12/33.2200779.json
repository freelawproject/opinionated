In fact, if this part of the section stood alone, I could discover no authority to administer to him an <em>oath, </em>or to compel him to testify. The order to <em>appear and answer </em>is only to bring him before the judge. If the foregoing words, included within the quotation marks, made it necessary for the plaintiff to examine the defendant on oath; then the provision contained in the same section, that <em>\u201c </em>on an examination under this section, <em>the judgment-debtor may be examined in the same manner as a </em>witness,\u201d would be unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"ACi\">The whole object of this proceeding is to ascertain whether the debtor has property not exempt from execution, in the hands of himself or of any other person, or due to him; all of which facts a plaintiff might be able to establish by witnesses, independent of the judgment-debtor 3 and the debtor, himself might be unworthy of credit as a witness. If I am right, as to the object of the proceeding, why, then, should the plaintiff be required, in a case like the present, to \u00e9xamine the judgment-debtor on oath ? Certainly, there can be no necessity for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The,words, <em>\u201c </em>on an examination under this section,\u201d means <em>on an examination as to the property of the </em>debtor, by calling witnesses, or by calling, swearing and examining the debtor, <em>as a witness, </em>or both, or either, and not simply <em>the examination of the judgment-debtor on oath, </em>concerning his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The motion must, therefore, be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
