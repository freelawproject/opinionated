It is not the trial of an <em>issue.</em></headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b34-9\">\n<em>Monroe General Term,</em>\n</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ARn\"><em>Dec., </em>1855.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-10\">Johnson, Selden and Welles, Justices.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-11\">Appeal from order of special term denying motion for re-adjustment of costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-12\">The complaint wras on a promissory note, made by the defendants, to which the defendants demurred. The demurrer was noticed as frivolous before a justice of this court, under \u00a7 247 of the Code, and was held to be frivolous, and judgment was given under that section for the plaintiff, nothing being said in the order about costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-13\">The plaintiff thereupon perfected judgment, had his costs adjusted by the clerk of Monroe county, in which he charged and was allowed for proceedings, after notice of trial, as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-14\">For all subsequent proceedings before trial, - - - - $ 7.00 For trial of issues of law on demurrer 15.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-15\">Clerk\u2019s fee on trial - -- -- -- -- -- 1.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>These. items were duly objected to before the clerk. The defendants\u2019 moved at special term, for a readjustment, and this appeal is from the order denying such motion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-4\">J. H. Martindale, <em>for appellants.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-5\">T. C. Montgomery, <em>for respondent.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b35-6\">By the court\u2014Welles, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AqT\">\u201cIf a demurrer, answer, or reply be frivolous, the party prejudiced thereby, upon a previous notice of five days, may apply to a judge of the court, either in or out of the court, for judgment thereon, and judgment may be given accordingly.\u201d <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 247.)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">' Subdivision 3 of \u00a7 307, gives to the party entitled to recover costs, \u201c for the trial of issues of law, if separate from the issues of fact, to the plaintiff, $15; to the defendant, $12.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">An issue of law arises upon a demurrer to the complaint, answer, or reply, or to some part thereof. (\u00a7 249.)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">A trial is defined to be the judicial examination of the issues between the parties, whether they be issues of law or of fact. (\u00a7 252.) An issue of law must be tried by the court, unless it be referred, &amp;c., (\u00a7 253,) and must be tried at a circuit court, or special term, &amp;c., (\u00a7 255,) and upon a notice of at least ten days. (\u00a7 256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">We are of the opinion, that an application to a judge for judgment, under \u00a7 247, is not a trial of an issue of law, so as to entitle the party succeeding to charge, in his bill of costs, the fee for the trial of an issue of law, under subdivision three of \u00a7 307, nor any other item, as upon a trial, for the following reasons:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">1. The application does not necessarily involve the decision of the issue; because, if the judge does not see the demurrer, answer, or reply to be frivolous, he makes no decision of the issue. He merely decides that it is not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">We agree with Justice Harris, in <em>Gould </em>agt. <em>Carpenter, </em>(7 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>97-99,) that it is, in effect, a motion to get rid of a frivolous pleading, which is not the subject of a triable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>.issue, so that the party may have the judgment, to which, but for such frivolous pleading, he would have been entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">2. The application may be made upon a notice of five days,</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">whereas a trial can only be brought on upon a notice of ten days. x</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">3. The section allowing the application refers as well to answers and replies as to demurrers. If it is a trial in one case, it is equally so in all of them; yet no one would say it was a trial, in the case of an answer or reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The order of the special term must be reversed, a readjustment of the costs ordered, and the clerk directed to disallow the three items in controversy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
