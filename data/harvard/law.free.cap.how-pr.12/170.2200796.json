JV. <em>\u00a5. Central Mills, </em>11 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>269.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b178-7\">In an action to compel the specific performance of a contract for the sale of real estate, the prevailing party is not entitled to an <em>extra allowance </em>under \u00a7 308 of the Code. The action is for mere equitable relief, and is not within the provisions of \u00a7 308.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b178-8\">A party will be charged with the <em>costs of a motion, </em>where otherwise he would not, <em>if he asks costs against his opponent without any foundation for it.</em></headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-9\"><em>Albany Special </em>Term,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ATO\">July, 1855.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-10\">Motion for reference, <em>See,</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-11\">The action was' brought to compel a specific performance of a contract for the sale of real estate. A preliminary injunction was granted, restraining the defendants from committing waste, &amp;c. A motion was subsequently made to dissolve the injunction. The motion was founded on the pleadings, and was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-12\">In April, 1855, the cause was referred for hearing and decision; and, in July, the- referee made his report, dismissing the complaint, with costs. No judgment has been entered upon the report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-13\">The defendants moved for a reference, to ascertain and report the amount of damages sustained by the defendants, by reason of the issuing of the injunction, and also for an extra allowance of costs, and for the costs of the motion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-14\">W. S. Kenyon, <em>for plaintiff,</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-15\">E.

The undertaking, upon issuing the injunction, is, that the plaintiff will pay to the party enjoined, such damages as he may sustain by reason of the injunction, <em>if the court shall finally decide that he was not entitled thereto. </em>Such final decision cannot be said to have been made in this case. True, the report of the referee is to that effect. But judgment has not been entered upon that report. It may never be entered. Until it is entered, so that the decision of the referee becomes the judgment of the court, the defendant\u2019s right to damages is only contingent. (S<em>ee Code, </em>\u00a7 222; <em>Dunkin </em>agt. <em>Lawrence, </em>1 <em>Barb. </em>447.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Nor is this a case for an extra allowance. The action is not brought to recover money or property, but merely for equitable relief. Such a case is not within the provisions of the 308th section of the Code. <em>(See Sprong </em>agt. <em>Snyder, </em>6 <em>How. </em>11; <em>Osborn </em>agt. <em>Betts, </em>8 <em>id. </em>31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">I should not have thought this a proper case for charging the defendants with the costs of the motion, were it not for the fact that they have themselves claimed such costs, without presenting, in their own papers, a case which, under any circumstances, would have entitled them to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The motion must, therefore, be denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
