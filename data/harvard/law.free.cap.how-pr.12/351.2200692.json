And yet the attorney, as the plaintiffs allege, and he does not deny, long afterwards, informed them that an execution had been issued and returned unsatisfied, and that there was but \u201c little hope of recovering anything, and that he had received nothing.\u201d He pretends, I am aware, that Barber, one of the plaintiffs, \u201c shortly after the claim was settled,\u201d giving no date, \u201c called at his office and was informed of the arrangement, and made no objection.\u201d But how can such an averment be reconciled with the admissions referred to, or with the letter sent by him more than two years subsequently, in which he said he had \u201c delayed writing until he had <em>secured </em>their claim,\u201d and in which he informed them that it was \u201c to be paid ' on the 20th day of September next \u201d\u2014that is, September, 18541</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Under these circumstances, instead of passing on the case definitively, the court sent it to a referee, to ascertain the amount due; and made a further order, that on filing his report, unless payment was made, an attachment issue against the attorney as for a contempt. He now applies to have the order <em>\u201c </em>amended or settled, so as to comply with the facts or merits herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">No alteration, it appears to me, is necessary, unless it be (as was done in the case of <em>Meyer </em>agt. <em>Lent, </em>16 <em>Barb. </em>538,) to direct the attendance of the attorney and his clients to be examined openly, on oath, before the court itself, with such witnesses, especially Gibson, as they may see fit to produce, to throw light on the seeming contradictions in which the written affidavits appear to be involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Let an order to that effect be entered, with $10 costs of opposing the motion, to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
