Defaults for not making such motions can be moved before such justice only. Chambers, during <em>vacation, </em>is regularly held in the <em>general term room.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b208-8\">During <em>term time, </em>motions on notice, and orders to show cause, in the absence of the opposing attorney or counsel, can be moved only, before the justice who holds the <em>special term. </em>Motions to discharge such notices, or orders to show cause, on account of the default of the party serving them to bring them on, can be made before such justice only.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b208-9\">When the attorneys or counsel of both parties attend, they may be heard before any judge of the court who is disengaged.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b208-10\">But there is but one place where defaults can be taken, on the failure of the attorney, serving a notice or order to show cause, to bring on his motion, or on the failure of the attorney, on whom it is served, to appear and oppose.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-11\"><em>At </em>Chambers,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AU1\"><em>September </em>22, 1855.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-12\">This action was commenced by the service of a summons, which stated that a complaint would be filed, and where. The defendants appeared separately, by different attorneys, who gave notice of retainer, but did not, within twenty days after service of the summons, demand, in writing, a copy of the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-13\">After the twenty days, they demanded a copy of the complaint, and none having been served, they severally obtained an order requiring the plaintiff to show cause on the 13th instant, why the action should not be dismissed, on account of the plaintiff\u2019s omission .to serve a copy of the complaint on the defendant\u2019s attorney. The 13th was in vacation, and Mr. Justice Bosworth then sat at chambers, in the general term room.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-14\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel attended to show cause, and after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>waiting until twenty minutes past ten, moved Justice Bosworth to dismiss the orders, which he declined doing then, as defendants\u2019 attorneys might soon appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-5\">About half-past ten, there being a large number in attendance, Justice Bosworth remarked that Justice Hoffman was in the judge\u2019s library, and would hear any motions that counsel chose to argue before him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-6\">Mr. Lossing, a clerk in the office of the defendants\u2019 attorneys, who was present with their papers, understanding that this remark was a permission to move for defaults, as well as to move motions where the counsel of both parties were present, went before Justice Hoffman, and had orders dismissing the complaint granted by default.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-7\">Before granting the orders, Judge Hoffman directed the cause to be called by its title in the room in which Judge Bosworth was sitting, which was done, but was not heard by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, who was there waiting the appearance of defendants\u2019 attorneys, and understanding that that was the only room in which defaults could be taken\u2014and who did not know, or did not recognize Mr. Lossing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-8\">About ten minutes before eleven, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel again applied to Judge Bosworth to dismiss the two orders to show cause, by reason of the default of defendants\u2019 attorneys to appear and bring on the motions. The judge told the counsel to draw the orders, and he would sign a direction to the clerk to enter them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-9\">While the orders were being drawn, Judge Bosworth went to another room to hear a concluding argument on a litigated motion commenced on the previous day, and adjourned to the 13th at 11 A. M. On his leaving, Chief Justice Oakley took his place at chambers ; and when plaintiff\u2019s counsel had drawn his orders, the chief justice signed a direction to the clerk of the court, to enter them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-10\">The plaintiff now moves to set aside the two orders granted by Justice Hoffman, for irregularity. There was some conflict in the affidavits upon the point, whether the orders granted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Judge Hoffman were, in fact, granted on the 13th of September.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-5\">Horatio P. Allen, <em>for plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-6\">Charles W. Sandford, <em>for defendants.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b210-7\">Bosworth, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Aaz\">The plaintiff moves to discharge two orders for <em>irregularity. </em>I have no doubt that the orders granted by Justice Hoffman on defendants\u2019 motion, and the two granted by Chief Justice Oakley, on plaintiff\u2019s motion, were granted on the 13th of September. There is no doubt that it was regular for the plaintiff to apply to the chief justice, and that it was not his duty to have gone into the room where Justice Hoffman \"was sitting, to avoid, the possibility of being defaulted there. It is quite probable, if the case had been called publicly when plaintiff\u2019s counsel applied to Justice Bosworth for the orders subsequently granted by Chief Justice Oakley, that all difficulty would have been obviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">I have no doubt that Mr. Lossing supposed that those applying for orders on default of the opposite party to appear, might as properly go before Justice Hoffman, as attorneys whose adversaries were present and accompanied them. Justice Hoffman, I presume, would not have granted the orders which he did grant, had he not understood that the motions had been publicly called in the general term room, and that the justice sitting there, on account of being fully occupied, desired that he should see that the order to be entered was one justified by the notice of it, and that there was proper evidence of due service of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">In vacation, the only justice before whom orders by default can be properly taken, is the one sitting in chambers for the purpose of hearing motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">In term time, such defaults can only be granted by the justice holding the special term in the room which he occupies for such business.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">When counsel of both parties attend, they, as well as counsel applying for <em>ex parte </em>orders, may go before any justice who may be in attendance at any of the rooms of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>I think the two orders granted by Justice Hoffman should be vacated, but without costs, and on condition that plaintiff stipulate to vacate the orders granted by Chief Justice Oaklet, and attend upon the orders to show cause which were returnable on the 13th instant, to the end that a hearing may be had thereon on such day as the counsel may name, or if they do not agree in relation thereto, as the court may designate.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Note.\u2014This case is reported in order that the profession may be advised of the practice of the superior court, as to granting motions by default. Although the practice is uniform, it does not seem to be well understood, and much confusion results, which might be avoided, if it was borne in mind.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
