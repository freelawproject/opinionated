In December following, an execution was issued, and the entire contents of a thread and needle store of Flandrow\u2019s was levied on. In January the goods were sold; they were bought in by Wyman\u2019s agent, for $395; their original cost was over $1,000. In May following, Flandrow removed to Grand-street; hired a store in his own name, and put up his signs with the word <em>agent </em>on them, in very small letters where the painter usually puts his name.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-14\">In November, 1843, Martha Durando recovered a judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>against Flandrow, and issued execution; and in December following, Mr. Hart, the sheriff, levied on the property in Flandrow\u2019s store, about one-half of which was the same' as that previously sold to Wyman, at the Bowery store. Wyman then brought this suit in replevin; and verdict was rendered for him, the jury assessing the value of the property at $700. The defendant appealed upon exceptions to the ruling of the court,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-5\">Charles A.

The judge then asked what Wyman said when he called on the witness at the time above stated, and the witness answered, that Wyman said he had assumed the business of the store to secure himself for liability incurred in settling Flandrow\u2019s debts. The defendant excepted to this last question. It may be that it was admissible to explain the previous testimony which was not objected to, and as to which there was a cross-examination; but, whether admissible or not, the defendant himself proved nearly the same facts by another witness, W. A. Douglass, who says that \u201c Wyman said that Flandrow was his agent, and that he (Wyman) had purchased the property to help Flandrow along; and that Flandrow was to receive a certain amount for his trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The exception, therefore, should not be sustained. The judge left to the jury the question, whether the sale was in <em>good </em>faith, and not to hinder or delay creditors; and the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>fendant excepts to this, that the judge should have said, not to hinder, delay, or <em>defraud </em>creditors. If the sale was in good faith, it could not have been to <em>defraud </em>creditors; and if it was desired that the question <em>o\u00ed fraud </em>should be brought more distinctly before the jury, a general exception was too indefinite\u2014 the omission of the word \u201c defraud \u201d should have been specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">It was urged by the defendant, that there was fraud in the sale on the execution, because the property was put up in but few parcels. It was shown that it was so put up by the sheriff of his own judgment and will; and that Wyman'did not attend the sale, but had requested Flandrow to procure Sinclair to attend the sale, and buy the goods if they went below their value, and that Sinclair did so attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The judge charged that Sinclair, under this authority, was the plaintiff\u2019s agent only to buy for him, and not for'the purpose of directing the manner of the sale, and that Wyman was not accountable for .any fraudulent act of Flandrow at the sale authorized by Wyman.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">It certainly would be a dangerous doctrine to lay down, that if a defendant in an execution caused the sale to be conducted fraudulently, the plaintiff in the execution should be responsible for it. If there were evidence of connivance between the two, the one would be responsible for the acts of the other\u2014 but otherwise they are adverse parties; and one cannot be affected by the fraud of the other, if he takes no part in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The authority of Sinclair was limited to buying for the plaintiff, and, as the judge correctly charged, gave him no control over the conducting of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">New trial denied, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">Roosevelt, J., on the facts as to a fraudulent sale, <em>dissented.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
