Y. The defendant took a lease from the plaintiff, under seal, for the term of five years. The rent reserved, including the privilege of burning certain firewood, specified in the case, was $50 per year. The premises were occupied for five years under this lease, and for two years after its expiration. Also for goods, wares, and merchandise sold. The summons and complaint were served on the 19th of March, 1855. The answer was duly served on the 7th of April, 1855. The reply was served on the 2d of May, 1855. The cause was, by an order, referred to Cyrus Stevens, Esq., of Albany, sole referee, and was brought to trial on the 14th of August, 1855. The referee, on the 25th of August, 1855, reported in favor of the plaintiff $260.40.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-5\">The defendant excepted to the report on the following grounds:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-6\">1st.

From said judgment the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b533-5\">Lyman Tremain, for appellant, said,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-6\">1st. The action for use and occupation was not allowed at common law. It is only given by statute in eases where there is no sealed lease. (2 <em>R. S. </em>3d <em>ed. </em>32, \u00a7 26; 1 <em>Cow. Tr. </em>3d ed. 174; 1 Wendell, 135; 7 <em>id. </em>109; 1 <em>Denio, </em>37; 13 <em>John. </em>297 <em>; </em>3 <em>Denio, </em>452; 2 <em>Barb. </em>264.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-7\">The Code does not affect the question. The fact constituting the cause of action is the <em>covenant to pay} </em>and not <em>the use and </em>occupation; and that <em>fact </em>is not set out in' the complaint. In covenant, the demand is valid for twenty years, and the plaintiff would recover interest. In an action for use and occupation, the demand would be barred in six years, and the plaintiff could recover no interest? because the claim is for a \u201creasonable satisfaction,which is supposed to be unliquidated. If this pleading is allowed to prevail, all those substantial rules of pleading relating to covenant by lessor, or assignee of lessor, against lessee, or assignee of lessee, are of no avail, and the complaint no longer performs the office of giving notice of the facts constituting the cause of action,</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-8\">2d. The referee erred in allowing, interest upon the rents, in an action for use and occupation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-9\">3d. The referee erred in allowing $10 a year for seven years for the use of <em>fuel, </em>such claim not being covered by a claim for use and occupation of land. [The fifth exception covers this point.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-10\">4th. The referee erred in allowing $30 for hay-press. It was never delivered to, or taken bv defendant. It was part of the realty. It was in possession of one Sherwood, who used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the timber thereof, and the. only evidence against the defendant was a loose declaration that he had bought it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b534-5\">Amasa J. Parker, <em>for respondent, </em>said,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-6\">1st. An action for use and occupation is founded upon a <em>contract, </em>express or implied, between the parties. (1 <em>Tenn. R. 378; 2 Saund. Pl. 889\u2014marginal </em>paging.) It lies only when the relation of landlord and tenant exists, (15 <em>Barb. </em>36\u2014Hand, J., <em>and cases cited; 7 id. </em>203\u2014Allen, J.) Assumpsit for <em>use and occupation </em>of land by permission and assent of the plaintiff, on an <em>express promise </em>to pay a <em>certain sum, </em>lies at common law, independently of the statute of 2 Geo. II, ch. 19. (3 <em>Stark. Ev. </em>1512, <em>note </em>(1). The plaintiff could recover in assumpsit for use and occupation, notwithstanding an agreement by deed, provided it contained no words of present demise. (3 <em>Stark. Ev. </em>1512, <em>note </em>(3); 4 <em>Esp. c. </em>59; <em>Peake\u2019s Ev. </em>254.) In this case, the contract <em>is alleged truly and denied by the answer. </em>It is not stated, however, whether the contract was in <em>writing </em>or <em>under seal, </em>nor was that necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-7\">Even under the old practice it was never necessary to allege a contract to be in writing. In <em>State of Indiana </em>agt. <em>Woram, </em>(6 <em>Hill, </em>36,) Bronson, J., says, <em>\u201c </em>It has long been settled, that the declaration need not allege that the agreement <em>was in writing, it is matter of evidence.\u201d (Van Sandtvoord\u2019s Pleadings, 2d ed., </em>266, 329.) An allegation that the <em>contract was in writing, </em>was not necessary, even on a promise otherwise within the statute of frauds. (15 <em>John. </em>425; 6 <em>Hill, </em>33; 15 <em>Barb. </em>365; 17 <em>id. </em>141.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-8\">All the parts of the contract which were material were <em>alleged </em>and <em>denied, </em>and were proved. If any part of the contract material to the defence was omitted, the defendant should have set it up in his answer. But under a denial of what is truly alleged, he cannot exclude proof of the contract as alleged. The plaintiff sought to gain no advantage, and could gain none, by omitting to say, in' his complaint, that the contract was in writing and under seal. It was done because there were <em>seven </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>years\u2019 occupation of the <em>farm,five </em>under the <em>writing, </em>and <em>two </em>more by <em>parol; </em>and it simplified the matter to complain for the whole together.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-5\">The plaintiff conceals nothing. He introduces the lease, thus showing the whole matter just as it was. Nothing is excluded which the defendant might desire to have received. It is true, under the old practice, a lease <em>under seal </em>could not support a declaration for <em>use and occupation. </em>But the reason was that the action being <em>assumpsit </em>could not be sustained by proof of a <em>covenant, </em>and this was the <em>only </em>reason.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-6\">Now, forms of action are abolished, <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 69,) and previous <em>forms </em>of pleadings are abolished. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 140.) All that is required now, in all cases, is a plain and concise statement of facts. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 142. <em>sub. </em>2.) Even under the old practice, if a <em>special agreement had been performed </em>(as in this case,) the balance due could be recovered on the <em>common counts, if the special contract had not been under seal. </em>(2 <em>Kern. </em>370, <em>and cases there cited.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-7\">And the only reason why it could not be done, if the special contract was under seal, was because <em>covenant </em>would not support an action of <em>assumpsit.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-8\"><em>That reason no longer exists\u2014all forms of action being abolished. </em>There is now but <em>one form of action. (Code, </em>\u00a7 69.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-9\">If the complaint was not sufficiently definite, the only remedy was by motion to ask the court to require the plaintiff to make it so, before answering. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 160.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-10\">I deny that here was any <em>variance </em>between the complaint and the proof. But concede it, for a moment, to be so, would any judge have hesitated for a moment, <em>at the circuit, </em>to allow an amendment on the spot, there being no surprise, and both parties coming as they did, fully prepared to try the cause on its merits'? The court would be clearly bound to do so. <em>(See Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 169, 173.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-11\">By \u00a7 173, it is made the duty of the court, even after judgment, to amend a pleading, \u201c <em>by inserting other allegations material to the case.\u201d </em>And no variance is to be deemed material unless \u201c it have actually misled the adverse party to his preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>dice in maintaining his action or defence upon the merits.\u201d <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 <em>169.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-5\">No one will pretend that the defendant is misled or prejudiced in this case. A variance not material is always to be disregarded. But here was no variance. The substance of the contract was alleged; that is, the use of the farm, and the agreement to pay for it. It was no longer necessary to state whether the contract was or -was not <em>under </em>seal, because <em>that fact would no longer control the form, of </em>action, and that fact was ho part of the terms of the agreement. It could neither increase nor lessen to the extent of a single cent the sum defendant was liable to pay.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-6\">2d. Interest on the rent was properly allowed. BhonsOn, J., says, \u201c We have finally reached the conclusion, that a man who breaks his contract to pay a debt, whether the payment was to be made in money or anything else, shall indemnify the creditor, so far as that can be done, by adding interest to the amount of damage he has sustained by the breach.\u201d <em>(Van </em>Rens<em>selaer </em>agt. Jewett, 2 <em>Com. </em>135.) A computation will show that all defendant paid was credited and only interest allowed on the balance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-7\">3d. The proof is abundant to support every item allowed by the referee. The only error he committed was against us, in allowing defendant\u2019s books as evidence. But we do not complain of that. We ask that judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b536-8\">By the court\u2014Gould, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A_Q\">Had this case been decided on the argument; or on the points made, and authorities cited, to the court, I should certainly have held, that where there <em>is </em>a <em>sealed covenant </em>there is neither the necessity nor the power of <em>implying any </em>contract; inasmuch as to imply one <em>different </em>from the sealed one, would be to <em>contradict </em>the contract made by the <em>parties; </em>and to imply one the <em>same </em>as the sealed one would be needlessly absurd. And, of course, it would have been decided that the <em>sealed covenant </em>to pay rent is <em>itself the cause of </em>action/ as, in <em>covenant </em>for rent, it was not necessary to allege (or prove) even an <em>entry </em>(by lessee) on the premises, or any occupation at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>all; c&lt; for, though he <em>neither enters </em>nor occupies, he must pay the rent; it being due <em>by the lease </em>or contract, and <em>not by the occupation.\u201d </em>(1 <em>Saund. Rep. </em>203, <em>note </em>1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">But it so happens that an action for <em>rent </em>accrued, (and that \u25a0 only where a party elected to bring <em>debt </em>for it, and <em>not </em>covenant,) was, at common law, a case, and the <em>only </em>case, in which, where there was a contract under seal, a plaintiff could declare generally, and produce his deed in support of such declaration. (1 <em>New Rep. </em>109.) In this very case, however, it is decided that, where there was a contract by deed, it was \u201c absurd to contend that the <em>action </em>is <em>not founded </em>on a deed, because if there had been no deed, the action might well have been maintained without it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The <em>reason </em>for this distinction, however, is not to be found in the authorities I have cited. But in <em>Gould\u2019s Pleading, pp. </em>310, 311, <em>(Chap. </em>6, <em>Part </em>1, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 13,) it is distinctly set forth, in showing why \u201c <em>nil debet\u201d </em>is a good plea to an action of <em>debt </em>for rent due on a deed of lease. The deed is said, then, to be pleaded only as <em>inducement </em>to the action; \u201c the <em>subsequent occupation </em>of the defendant, under the demise, is the <em>gist </em>of the action; <em>because </em>rent is considered as a <em>profit, issuing out of land; </em>and when it is sued for, as a <em>debt, </em>the law considers the debt as arising out of the <em>receipt of the issues and profits </em>by the tenant, and not from the <em>deed.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">This opens a way for applying the provisions of the <em>Code </em>to the cas\u00e9 at bar. For, were this case of rent due, <em>not </em>the <em>exception, </em>and the only one, to the rule, that <em>the covenant is the cause of action </em>so absolutely that you must <em>declare on it; </em>it would be in vain to attempt to apply \u00a7 69 as having <em>abolished forms of action; </em>or \u00a7 140 as having <em>abolished forms of pleading: </em>there <em>not </em>being any section that <em>abolishes causes of action; </em>or one that has been entirely able to <em>confound </em>them. But since, (for the reason above quoted,) a plaintiff may elect, in such a case, to sue <em>on </em>the <em>covenant, </em>and by so doing make <em>the covenant </em>his <em>cause </em>of action$ or to sue for the <em>debt, </em>and by so doing make the <em>\u201csubsequent occupation\u201d </em>his <em>cause </em>of action\u2014\u201cthe <em>gist </em>of the action \u201d)\u2014and since, in this case, he <em>has </em>sued for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>the <em>debt, </em>thus <em>making the subsequent occupation his cause of action, </em>it must be decided that he has well pleaded <em>a </em>cause of action ; and that being entitled so to plead <em>this </em>cause of action, the <em>evidence </em>was <em>adapted </em>to the pleading, and the proof of the sealed lease was of <em>no </em>effect, in the way of making a variance from the complaint, or for any purpose except to establish the relation of landlord and tenant, and to show the <em>amount </em>of the <em>debt; </em>and for these purposes it was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">As to the allowance of <em>interest, </em>I am not disposed to set aside the report for that reason. Where money has been really due, the party unjustly withholding it <em>ought </em>always to pay interest. And nothing but a positive and inflexible rule .would compel me to decide to excuse him from it. So far from there being any such rule applicable to this case, the law is well settled in accordance with the referee\u2019s decision. (2 <em>Com. </em>135.)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">I have been unable to find, in the case, anything to warrant the allowance, for the last two years, of the ten dollars (in each year) for <em>fuel </em>used, as there is <em>no </em>proof that, for those years, the defendant used the fuel; and- his agreement to pay for it did not apply to those years, <em>unless </em>he used it.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">As to the hay-press, (were <em>I </em>to find a fact,) I should certainly prefer to have more evidence, and clearer, to satisfy me of its actual sale; especially as. it is entirely clear that the defendant never <em>actually </em>took possession of any part of it; nor was it even on his premises. There is no <em>justice </em>in this allowance ; it is not equitable; and I doubt its strict legality; <em>{see </em>3 <em>Hill, </em>141;) as plaintiff declared for it as \u201c <em>sold and </em>delivered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Av9\">I should order a new trial, unless the plaintiff reduce his judgment, by deducting the two items for fuel, of $10 each, and interest, and the $30 and interest allowed for hay-press.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
