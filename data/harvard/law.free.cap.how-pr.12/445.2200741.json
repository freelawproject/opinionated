Julian Neville.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b453-6\">If a non-resident defendant, within one year from the entry of judgment, is allowed to come in and defend, that fact of itself does not open the judgment, nor stay proceedings upon the execution.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b453-7\">But a third person asking to come in and defend or contest the plaintiff\u2019s claim, must do so <em>before judgment.</em></headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b453-8\">New- <em>York Special </em>Term,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"As_\">Dec, 1854.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b453-9\">Mr. Man, <em>for motion.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b453-10\">H.

If he should be let in to defend, that fact does not of itself open the judgment or stay proceedings upon the execution. I have, therefore, on Neville\u2019s application, granted the order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">Should Dorsey be made defendant, it would open the judgment and stay proceedings upon it. He is too late for such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>favor. The case in 3d <em>Code </em>Reporter, 172, relied upon by Dorsey\u2019s counsel, is where the application was made before judgment. ' In this case, Dorsey attached as early as February, 1853, and the plaintiff in this suit recovered judgment in August, 1854.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">I refuse Dorsey\u2019s application.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
