The complaint alleges a breach, on the part of the defendant, of that contract. The only title the plaintiff shows to the cause of action is by an allegation in the complaint in the following words, viz.:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">\u201c That the said plaintiff is now the sole owner of the said demand against the said defendant.\u201d This I do not think is sufficient. It is merely an allegation of a conclusion of law. The defendant has a right to be informed by the complaint, how the plaintiff became the owner of the demand; whether by purchase, assignment, operation of law, or how otherwise. Some fact or facts should be stated by which it would appear how he became such owner. <em>(Russel </em>agt. <em>Clapp, </em>7 <em>Barb. </em>482; <em>Bentley </em>agt. <em>Jones, </em>4 <em>How. Pr.
