The summons contained a notice, that if the defendant failed to answer the complaint within twenty days, &amp;c., the plaintiffs would take judgment against the defendant for |363.16, with interest thereon from the 30th day of July, 1855, besides costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-9\">The complaint states that the plaintiffs employed the defendant as a pedler, to take goods and merchandise, belonging to the plaintiffs, and sell and dispose of the same for the plaintiffs; the plaintiffs agreeing to pay the defendant a certain sum as a compensation for his services; that the defendant was charged, from time to time, with the goods taken by him, and credited, from time to time, with the goods unsold, which he returned to the plaintiffs, and with the notes and money he received for the goods which he delivered to the plaintiffs. That under this agreement the plaintiffs, at Ithaca, in the summer of 1855, delivered to the defendant goods at some ten or a dozen different times; and that the greater portion thereof the defendant sold and accounted for to the plaintiffs. That, finally, the defendant had, of said goods and merchandise, and in money and notes he received therefor, belonging to the plaintiffs, the sum and value of $363.16, which the defendant, at certain times specified, <em>converted to his own use, </em>and had neglected and refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>account for and pay to the plaintiffs, although by them often requested so to do. Wherefore, the plaintiffs demanded that the defendant might be adjudged to pay the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>damages </em>to the sum of three hundred and sixty-three dollars and sixteen cents, with interest from the 30th' day of July, 1855, besides costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-5\">The defendant now moves to dismiss the <em>proceedings </em>in this_ cause for irregularity: for that the summons concludes as if in an action upon contract, and the complaint is in an action not upon contract; and for such - other or further order as to the court shall seem proper, with costs of the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel insists that the complaint only states a cause of action on contract; but if the court should hold the contrary position he asks leave to amend the summons so it will conform to the complaint.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-7\">Alfred A. Wells, <em>for plaintiffs.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-8\">William Bruyn, <em>for defendant.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b218-9\">Balcom, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ACs\">By striking from the complaint the allegation that the defendant <em>converted to his own use </em>the goods, notes and money of the plaintiffs therein described, which he had neglected and refused to account for and pay to the plaintiffs, when by them requested so to do, the entire cause of action set forth might be regarded as <em>arising on contract, </em>and the complaint would conform to the summons, which contains the appropriate notice prescribed by <em>sub. </em>1 of \u00a7 129 of the Code. The form and language of the complaint would then be substantially like declarations in assumpsit under our former system of practice in actions against an agent employed to sell goods, and for not duly accounting for the goods, or for the moneys received by him. <em>(Chit. Pl. 7th Am. ed. from 6th London ed., vol. </em>2, <em>pp. </em>341 <em>and </em>344; <em>also see id. p. </em>335, <em>id. p. </em>263; <em>Yates PI. </em>236.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">While the charge of a <em>conversion </em>of the goods, notes and money by the defendant remains in the complaint, it is doubtful whether the gravamen of the 'action is not the conversion; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>whether the action is not in substance <em>ex delicto. </em>If it can be considered as <em>ex delicto, </em>and arising from the conversion, then the contract stated in the complaint must be regarded as <em>inducement </em>only, to the real cause or gist of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">This is the construction put upon the complaint by the defendant\u2019s counsel; and there are decisions which countenance such a construction. \u201c If the contract be laid as <em>inducement </em>only, it seems thpt case for an act, in its nature a tort or injury, afterwards committed in breach of the contract, may often be adopted. On this ground, case for not accounting for, <em>and for converting to </em>the. <em>defendants use, </em>bills delivered to him to be discounted, or the proceeds of such bills, is probably sustainable.\u201d (1 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>154, <em>ed. before cited; </em>6 <em>East. </em>333.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u201c And in <em>Mast </em>agt. <em>Goodson, </em>(3 <em>Wils. </em>348,) it was held that a count <em>in case, </em>setting out an agreement by which <em>the </em>plaintiff was to build a yard in defendant\u2019s close, and lay out not less than \u00bf620, and was to enjoy it for life j and averring that defendant built the yard, and enjoyed it for some years as an easement, but defendant afterwards <em>wrongfully obstructed </em>him in the enjoyment of it, was good.\u201d \u201cIn that case,\u201d says <em>Chitty, </em>(1 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>154,) \u201c the action was founded on a contract ; but the obstruction to the plaintiff\u2019s right for which the action was brought, was \u00e9\u00edc <em>delicto, </em>although the right also arose out of the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">As before stated, it is doubtful whether the breach of the contract in this case is set out as the gist of the action, or whether the <em>conversion </em>is not the' real cause for which the action is brought. There can be no doubt but the plaintiffs had their election, \u00e9ither to base their action on the contract, alleging the neglect or refusal of the defendant to account for the goods, money and notes, and pay the same to the plaintiffs when requested so to do; or to allege the defendant\u2019s breach of duty arising out of his employment for hire, and the conversion of the goods, money and notes by him, belonging to the plaintiffs, as the gravamen of their complaint. (1 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>163, <em>ed. before cited.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The breach of duty and conversion in the latter case would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>be the gist of the action, and the manner the goods, money and note's came into the defendant\u2019s hands would be quite immaterial, the same as it formerly was in the old action called <em>tro\u00b0 ver. (Gra. Pr. 2d ed. </em>206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The difficulty in this case arises by the blending, or the connecting together in the complaint, of allegations proper and pertinent to an action solely on the contract, and also to an action for the tort or conversion of the property. This, perhaps, is allowable under the Code, which prescribes that the complaint shall contain \u201ca plain and concise statement of the facts constituting a cause of action, without unnecessary repetition.\u201d (\u00a7 142 <em>of the Code, sub. </em>2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The allegation in the complaint, that the defendant converted to his own use the goods, notes and money therein mentioned, must be deemed a part of the transaction constituting the real cause of the complaint against the defendant. It is perfectly consistent with the other allegations in the complaint; and there are no perceivable reasons why it should not remain there, if the complaint is tested solely by the Code itself. (\u00a7 167 <em>of the Code, sub. </em>1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The charge of a conversion in the complaint is not only proper, but absolutely necessary to make the action <em>ex delicto, </em>instead of <em>ex contractu. </em>It has made the defendant\u2019s counsel believe the complaint charged a tort upon the defendant, and not a simple breach <em>of the </em>contract. The allegation -was wholly unnecessary, if a breach of the contract only was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">For what purpose, then, was the charge of converting the goods, notes and money, inserted in the complaint1?</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">It is fair to presume and hold, it was inserted therein to characterize the action as <em>ex delicto, </em>and to distinguish it from one arising on contract. The plaintiffs should be held to this construction of their complaint by the old and familiar rule, that a pleading should be construed most strongly against the party whose pleading is brought in question. This construction does no violence to \u00a7 140 or \u00a7 159 of the Code; for, by it the ordinary and popular sense of the language used in the complaint is adopted; and it is presumed men of ordinary understandings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>who are not lawyers, would put a similar construction upon the language of this complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Whether the action is founded solely on the contract, or the gist of it is for the conversion; or whether the allegation of a conversion is in the complaint or not, is wholly immaterial in determining the question, whether the defendant can be arrested before judgment is rendered in the action, or afterwards on an execution against his person. An order of arrest may be granted in an action for money received, or property embezzled, or fraudulently misapplied by any agent or other person in a fiduciary capacity. <em>(Sub. </em>2, \u00a7 179 <em>of the Code.) </em>An agent employed to collect moneys for his principal is liable to arrest where he appropriates such moneys to his own use. <em>(Stoll </em>agt. <em>King, </em>8 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>298; <em>Burhans </em>agt. <em>Casey, 4 Sand. </em>707.)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">It is pretty well settled, that it is not necessary the facts which render a defendant liable to arrest should be stated in the complaint. <em>(Cheney </em>agt. <em>Garbutt, </em>5 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>467; <em>Masten </em>agt. <em>Scovill, </em>6 <em>id. </em>515; <em>Corwin </em>agt. <em>Freeland, 2 Selden, </em>560.) The principle involved in this point was determined the same way prior to the Code. <em>(Stage </em>agt. <em>Stevens, </em>1 <em>Benio, </em>267.)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The motion to dismiss the proceedings in the cause cannot be granted, because it is too broad and comprehensive. The summons cannot be set aside. It is in proper form, and it clearly shows the action is one arising on contract, which fact was not only properly but necessarily stated in the summons. (\u00a7 129 <em>of the Code.) </em>The motion should have been to set aside the complaint, on the ground that the complaint varies from the cause of action indicated by the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Prior to the Code, the true cause of action had to be stated in the <em>ac-etiam </em>part of the <em>capias </em>by which the action was commenced. And in declaring, if the plaintiff did not pursue the cause of action as set forth in the <em>ac-etiam, </em>his declaration and subsequent proceedings only, and not the <em>capias, </em>were set aside for irregularity. <em>(Gra. Pr. 2d ed. </em>119; <em>Rogers </em>agt. <em>Rogers, </em>4 <em>J. R. </em>485; <em>Roosevelt </em>agt. <em>Smith and Vansantvoord, </em>16 <em>J. R. 44; Durfee </em>agt. <em>Heimstreet, </em>1 <em>Wend. </em>305.)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">In analogy to the practice prior to the Code, and by the Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>itself, the summons must show whether or not the action arises on contract. The. complaint, whether served with the summons-or subsequently, must conform to the nature of the action appearing in the summons. It will be presumed, in all cases, that the complaint is drawn subsequent to the making or issuing of the summons. The plaintiff should know, before his summons is made out, whether his action arises on contract for the recovery of money only. If he mistakes the nature of his action, he can ask the court for leave to amend his summons. He should not be allowed to make his complaint for a cause of action-not indicated by his summons, and then be permitted to say to the defendant, when brought up by a motion for the irregularity, \u201cmy complaint is right and' my summons is wrong.\u201d To hold that the complaint should control the summons, instead of the latter controlling the former, as to the nature of the action brought, would be somewhat like making a judgment conform to the execution issued on it. It would be <em>currus b\u00f3vem trahit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">As the irregularity complained of is pointed out in the defendant\u2019s notice of the motion, relief may be granted under that part of the notice which states the defendant will ask the court for such other or further order as to the court shall seem proper; and the complaint is set aside, unless the plaintiffs shall, within twmnty days, amend the summons so it will conform to the complaint, or amend the complaint so it will agree with the cause of action indicated by the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Both parties having erred in their proceedings, no costs of motion are given to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
