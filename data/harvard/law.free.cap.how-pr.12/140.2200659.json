The defendant,' at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 proofs, moved to dismiss the complaint, upon several grounds. The court declined to grant the motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>but (the defendant offering no proof) directed a verdict for the plaintiff, subject, however, to the opinion of the general term. After the argument of the cause at the general term, the court dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">At a subsequent day of the same term, upon the suggestion of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, that the further proof which the court deemed necessary could readily be supplied, the court modified the former order, and directed a new trial, on condition that the plaintiff pay the defendant\u2019s costs of the trial, and all subsequent proceedings, including the costs of the argument.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
