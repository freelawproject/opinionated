If he sued in an action <em>ex delicto, </em>he would have a right to state the issuable facts, showing the fraud, or other wrong; and, if he recovered judgment, he would have a right to issue execution against the person of the defendant, without any application to the court. But, as I deem the action commenced equivalent to the old action for money had and received, and therefore <em>ex contractu, </em>all statements relative to the fraud, even if the issuable facts relating to it were succinctly, set forth, are manifestly irrelevant and redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">Motion granted, with liberty to the plaintiff to <em>amend\u2014$10 </em>costs to defendant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
