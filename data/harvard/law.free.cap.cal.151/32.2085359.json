Although the property may not be of the quality or description contracted for, he may, if he so elect, waive the defect, and acceptance of the property offered constitutes such a waiver.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b68-9\">Id.\u2014Duty of Purchaser to Examine\u2014Unreasonable Delay.\u2014When personal property is tendered or delivered to a purchaser in fulfillment of a contract for the purchase thereof, the duty devolves upon him to make an examination of it for the purpose of determining whether it fills the contract, and if from such examination he finds it does not, he must promptly reject it. This duty of inspection for the purpose of determining whether the property complies with the contract must be exercised within a reasonable time, and what is a reasonable time depends upon the circumstances of each particular case. In the present ease, the use by the purchaser for a period of almost two months of an engine which did not have the capacity contracted for, he during all of that period knowing of its want of capacity, and not objecting to it on that ground, operated as an election to accept the engine, and precluded him from claiming that it was not of the character provided for in the contract.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b68-10\">APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County.

This, appeal is taken by the defendant from the judgment and. the order of the court denying its motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">It is insisted by appellant that the evidence is insufficient, to justify the finding that defendant accepted the plant as. furnished by the plaintiff, and that the judgment was not-warranted by the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The point that the findings were not justified by the evidence is, we think, untenable. The evidence on the question! <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>of acceptance, as upon all the other facts in issue, except the terms of the contract and the incapacity of the engine to raise the amount of water required by the agreement, is conflicting; but there was certainly sufficient evidence to be gathered from the conflict supporting all the findings made by the court. It is true that the court was in error as to some dates mentioned in the findings and in some minor particulars, but we do not consider that these substantially affect the sufficiency of the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\">There was evidence in the case showing that under the contract between them the plaintiff set up on the premises of defendant in connection with its irrigating system, a pumping plant claimed by plaintiff to be of the character called for in the agreement. The defendant had fifteen wells to be operated by this plant, and the machinery having been installed, pipes laid, and connections made with all of these wells, a test operation of the plant was commenced by the plaintiff on August 1, 1902. It was provided in the contract that the plant should be installed by plaintiff in complete running order, and that he should leave his expert with it for six days to instruct the engineer of defendant how to operate the plant, and it was in harmony with this provision of the agreement and to test the plant that a six days\u2019 run by the expert of plaintiff was commenced on August 1, 1902. The evidence of plaintiff shows that at the end of that time the engine, pump, suction-pipe, and other connections worked perfectly, and that the only difficulty which arose with the machinery during that period, but which was overcome, was in the circulating pump, the pulley of which had to be changed several times. The run during these six days, however, demonstrated that the engine furnished and operated by plaintiff as part of the plant was not of thirty-five actual horsepower as provided in the contract, but of very much less power; that it was incapable of raising the quantity of water called for and incapable of raising more than a little over one fourth of the amount. This was known to the defendant at that time. After this run of six days, plaintiff saw the superintendent of the defendant company and told him that the plant had been run six days and was all right. The superintendent insisted that it had not been run six days without touching the plant, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>that plaintiff would, have to have his expert run it another six days. This plaintiff did, commencing on August 6th, and ran it to the twelfth day of August; the engine, pump, and connections worked perfectly, but this operation still demonstrated that the engine was incapable of lifting a greater quantity than previously pumped. On\" August 12, 1902, plaintiff again sought the superintendent of defend-\" ant and asked him to accept the plant or take it under his charge. The superintendent said that the plaintiff could turn the plant' over to him, but as to acceptance replied, 11 that he would have his own expert go out to the plant at some future time\u2014at some time in the near future, immediately\u2014and look over the ground and see if all the conditions of the contract were fulfilled.\u201d Plaintiff immediately turned the plant over to defendant, whose engineer thereafter, and while it was in operation, handled it. About August 26, 1902, while the engineer of defendant was operating the plant, some trouble with the pump was reported to plaintiff, who sent a man out to inspect it. He found that for lack of oil the babbitting had melted and stuck onto the shaft of the pump; the shaft was taken out, repaired, and placed back.. Thereafter, and towards the end of August, 1902, defendant engaged an expert and sent him out to the plant to examine it. The expert made the examination and made a written report to defendant, stating that he had examined the pumping plant, \u20181 and found it to be in good working order, with the exception of the gas engine, that is out of adjustment. When this is adjusted I think the plant will work satisfactorily. \u2019 \u2019 This expert, called as a witness, testified that the adjustment of the engine referred to in his report had relation to the governor on the engine, which needed repairing. Plaintiff having been notified that the governor needed adjustment, sent on September 6, 1902, one of his machinists to see what was at fault. He examined the engine, and on the trial testified that he found the distillate they were using in the engine was very poor; that it tended to cause the electrodes\u2014that is, the sparking-points\u2014to become corroded in a very short space of time; that it was so with the engine he was examining; that when he came back from the inspection he sent out another electrode. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>court was warranted from the evidence in finding that these two matters\u2014the corroding of the electrodes and the babbitting of the pumping shaft\u2014were the only faults found in the perfect operation of the machinery; that they were not incident to any defects of the machinery itself, but the result of either a use of poor distillate, or proceeded from carelessness or want of familiarity on the part of defendant\u2019s engineer with the operation of this make of engine installed by plaintiff; that these were the only matters affecting the operation of the engine which were called to plaintiff\u2019s attention; were trivial and promptly remedied; and hence the court was justified in finding that all the conditions of the contract with plaintiff save as to the capacity of the engine to be furnished were performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\">Beferring to the findings in the light of the evidence thus far recited, it is apparent that the court was in error in finding that the examination of the pumping plant by the expert of defendant was made on September 7, 1902,\u2014it is apparent from the date of the expert\u2019s report to defendant that it was as early at least as August 29, 1902; and the finding that a defective governor on the engine was repaired\u2014it apparently was a defective electrode; but these are immaterial errors, and we mention them only because appellant refers to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Proceeding now to a further consideration of the evidence. It shows that aside from these defects referred to no complaint of the operation of the pumping machine was made to plaintiff; that from the time the plant was received by the plaintiff, on August 12th, though not then accepted, and from the time the expert of defendant reported upon it, towards the end of August, 1902, down to October 5, 1902, the plant was operated by the engineer of defendant, was used in the business of defendant in pumping water for its irrigation system, with full knowledge on the part of the defendant that it was not nearly the horsepower capacity which plaintiff had contracted to furnish, and was not and could not be operated so as to lift the amount of water it was agreed it should; that with this knowledge of its incapacity to perform the work the defendant used it to pump such water as its capacity would furnish, and at no time during that period while it was so using it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>made any objection or complaint that it was not as contracted for, nor notified the plaintiff that it would not be accepted until long after October 5, 1902, the date when the engine and pump were received by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\">Defendant, it is true, contends that during all this period it was experimenting with the plant, and endeavored to make the plant work successfully. But as there was evidence that at the first test, with the machinery working perfectly, it was demonstrated that the engine did not have nearly the capacity contracted for, it is apparent that no amount of experimental work could increase such capacity, and it was demonstrated during its entire operation\u2014at the original test, after the defendant had taken it in charge; when its expert reported upon it; and all during the month or more thereafter while defendant continued operating it\u2014 that it was incapable of at all pumping the water it was contracted to do. The trouble with the engine was of such a character that no amount of experimenting, repairing, or adjusting of machinery could <em>remedy </em>it. It did not have the horsepower which was contracted for, and there was nothing that could be done with it to give it. that power. It was impossible to have it operate to the capacity it was agreed it should. The only remedy for this defect was to remove the engine and obtain another that did have the requisite horsepower. Defendant knew this from the very start\u2014the very first test\u2014and when it continued to use and operate the plant with this engine, particularly for over a month after it had sent its expert to examine and report on it with a view of either accepting or rejecting it, and with knowledge that the engine could not possibly develop the horsepower agreed to, and without any notice to plaintiff that the engine was insufficient or unsatisfactory, or that it would not be accepted, the court was justified in finding from the evidence that defendant had, in fact, accepted the engine, notwithstanding it was not in accordance with the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">It is true that the court was in error in finding that the defendant actually used the engine and pump up to November 5, 1902. The insertion of the month of \u201cNovember\u201d was probably a clerical error. The evidence showed they were used up to October 5, 1902, when defendant removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>them. However, we think this is not a material error. Eliminating dates, and leaving the finding stand as a general one of acceptance of the plant, it is still sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\">And the finding that defendant accepted the plant, though not as contracted for, being sustained by the evidence, the judgment rendered for plaintiff was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">The rule is elementary as to the respective rights of the parties under an executory contract for the sale of personal property. As to the purchaser he is bound to accept the property, provided it conforms to the terms of the contract, or, if not according to the contract, he may reject or refuse to accept it. Although the property may not be of the quality or description contracted for, he may nevertheless, if he so elect, waive the defect, and acceptance of the property offered constitutes such a waiver. When personal property is tendered or delivered to a purchaser in fulfillment of a contract for the purchase thereof, the duty devolves upon him to make an examination of the property tendered or delivered for the purpose of determining whether it fills the contract, and if from such examination he finds it does not, he must promptly reject it. This duty of inspection for the purpose of determining whether the property complies with the contract must be exercised within a reasonable time, and what is a reasonable time depends upon the circumstances of each particular ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Applying these general rules to the matter at bar. The engine to operate the pumping plant was to be of a certain description and of certain specified effective power, to be installed and put in running order by plaintiff. He furnished an engine and plant and put it in running order. This did not vest the title in defendant; it was not required to accept the engine unless it conformed to the contract. This could only be determined upon trial. Upon trial as early as August 12, 1902, it was demonstrated that the engine was absolutely incapable of pumping the quantity of water stipulated for, and as early as that date defendant knew it. It was the duty of the defendant after such demonstration to then act promptly and refuse to accept the engine. Instead of doing this, it went on using the engine in the regular conduct of its business, and for its own advantage, for al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>most two months before it notified plaintiff that it would not accept it. This was not only not acting promptly, but it was an unreasonable and unwarranted delay amounting to an election to accept the engine, though it was not of the capacity which had been contracted for. And the defendant having thus accepted the engine, was precluded from claiming that it was not of the character provided for in the contract, and plaintiff was entitled to a judgment for the purchase price as if the engine contracted for had actually been installed.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">As generally sustaining these views, we cite <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>29 N.
