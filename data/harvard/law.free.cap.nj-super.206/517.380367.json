At a jury trial defendant was acquitted on the latter count but convicted of the former. He was sentenced to the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections for 10 years, with four years of parole ineligibility, and assessed a $25 penalty for the benefit of the Violent Crimes Compensation Board. The victim was 4V2 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">On this appeal defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-13\">POINT I THE STATE\u2019S INTRODUCTION OF EVIDENCE REGARDING DEFENDANT\u2019S DISTRIBUTION, POSSESSION AND USE OF A MARIJUANA JOINT PRIOR TO THE ALLEGED SEXUAL OFFENSE CONSTITUTED PREJUDICIAL ERROR, REQUIRING A NEW TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-14\">POINT II THE LAW DIVISION\u2019S DENIAL OF DEFENDANT\u2019S PRE-TRIAL MOTION TO EXCLUDE EVIDENCE OF HIS TWO PRIOR CONVICTIONS CONSTITUTED AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION, REQUIRING A NEW TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>POINT III THE STATE\u2019S INTRODUCTION INTO EVIDENCE OF THE INCULPATORY PORTION, BUT NOT THE EXCULPATORY PORTION, OF DEFENDANT\u2019S POST-ARREST, IN-CUSTODY STATEMENT, CONSTITUTED PLAIN ERROR, REQUIRING A NEW TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">POINT IV THE DEFENDANT MAY HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME NOT ALLEGED IN THE INDICTMENT DUE TO THE TRIAL JUDGE\u2019S IMPROPER CHARGE TO THE JURY. ACCORDINGLY, THE JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION SHOULD BE VACATED, AND THE INDICTMENT DISMISSED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">POINT V THE STATE FAILED TO PROVE DEFENDANT GUILTY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">POINT VI THE STATE\u2019S INTRODUCTION OF EVIDENCE REGARDING DEFENDANT\u2019S REFUSAL TO LEAVE THE POLICE CAR UNLESS HE WAS PROVIDED WITH A MATCH FOR HIS CIGARETTE, AND THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S ARGUMENT TO THE JURY REGARDING THAT EVIDENCE, CONSTITUTED PREJUDICIAL ERROR, REQUIRING A NEW TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">We have carefully reviewed the record in light of these contentions and the arguments advanced in support thereof, and conclude that, with the exception of Point IV, they are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">With respect to the fourth point, defendant was indicted in the first count for second degree sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b, because he committed an act of sexual contact with a victim who was less than 13 years of age while he was at least four years older. The indictment did not specify defendant\u2019s age or age disparity expressly, but defendant was indicted, and there was no challenge to the indictment or, therefore, to his status as an adult. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-11. We do not believe, in these circumstances where the victim\u2019s age was noted in the indictment, that defendant\u2019s age or age disparity (the basis for making \u201csexual contact\u201d a second degree crime) had to be alleged in the indictment. This is particularly true because the first count specifically refers to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b. There was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>no motion to dismiss the indictment and no direct facial attack addressed to the indictment on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u201cSexual contact\u201d is defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-ld and \u201cmeans an intentional touching by the victim or actor, either directly or through clothing, of the victim\u2019s or actor\u2019s intimate parts for the purpose of degrading or humiliating the victim or sexually arousing or sexually gratifying the actor____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-le defines \u201cintimate parts\u201d as \u201cthe following body parts: sexual organs, genital area, anal area, inner thigh, groin, buttock or breast of a person.\u201d The State\u2019s principal witness, Abbregail Pope, testified that she observed the contact and noticed defendant rubbing the victim\u2019s inner thigh. The testimony of the eyewitness included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">Q What did you see initially as you initially watched?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">A As I looked out the window I saw M.C. He was feeling Coletia\u2019s legs and she was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">Q What portion of her legs was he feeling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-11\">A Down by her thighs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-12\">Q Was he using one hand or two hands?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-13\">A Two hands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-14\">Q How was he feeling her thighs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-15\">A He was rubbing them like this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-16\">Q Could you see whether or not he was speaking with her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-17\">THE COURT: I\u2019m sorry. Would you just indicate\u2014He was rubbing them like what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-18\">THE WITNESS: You can\u2019t see me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-19\">Q Would you stand up and demonstrate how he was rubbing them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-20\">A He had his hands on her legs doing like this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-21\">THE COURT: The witness indicates he was rubbing the portion of her leg known as the thigh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-22\">How was Coletia reacting physically as far as you could see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-23\">A She was very fidgety, like she was nervous or scared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-24\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-25\">Q Did you see him do anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-26\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-27\">Q What did you see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-28\">A As I continued to look out the window he kept rubbing her thighs and then I saw him pull her pants to the side and put his finger in her vagina.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Q When he pulled it aside do you recall which finger you indicate he inserted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">A No. I don\u2019t know which finger it was, which hand it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">Q When he pulled her pants aside what could you see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">A I could see her vagina area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">Q Was there anything obstructing your view of seeing her vagina area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">A Nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-11\">Q Did you see him insert his finger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-12\">A Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-13\">Q At the moment he inserted his finger how did Coletia react physically?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-14\">A Afraid. She was like twitching.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-15\">Q When he was rubbing her thighs would you just stand up again and indicate, was it strictly on her thighs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-17\">A No, it was in like this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-18\">Q Would you just indicate\u2014I don\u2019t mean to embarrass you. For the record what portion of her body?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-20\">A Down near her vagina.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-21\">Q Was that when she was wearing her shorts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-22\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-23\">Q When you saw him insert his finger approximately how many feet were you from that car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-25\">A About six.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-26\">Q Is there any question in your mind that you saw him do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-27\">A No. I saw it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-28\">Q When you saw him insert his finger did you see how far it went in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-29\">A No.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-30\">In charging the jury, the trial court advised that defendant could be found guilty if the jury was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had \u201csexual contact\u201d with the victim\u2019s \u201cintimate parts.\u201d The relevant terms were defined. The difficulty, of course, flows from the fact that the defendant was not indicted for having contact with \u201cintimate parts\u201d generally, nor for touching the \u201cinner thigh,\u201d although the jury was instructed that defendant could be convicted for touching an \u201cintimate part,\u201d including the \u201cinner thigh.\u201d Defendant was indicted only for \u201cintentionally touching the vagina and genital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>area____\u201d The \u201cgenital area\u201d is expressly included in the definition of \u201cintimate part,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-le, and, although not expressly specified in the definition, the vagina is clearly an \u201cintimate part\u201d of the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">We are satisfied, under the totality of the circumstances, that defendant\u2019s conviction should not be reversed under the plain error doctrine. We stress that there was no objection to inclusion of reference to the \u201cinner thighs\u201d in the charge. Nor did the defendant assert lack of notice or specific prejudice by consideration of that subject. Moreover, the first count of the indictment referred to the appropriate subsection of the Code of Criminal Justice, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b, which makes it a crime of sexual assault if the actor, at least four years older than the victim, commits an act of sexual contact with a victim less than 13 years of age.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are convinced that, under the circumstances where the indictment referred to specific \u201cintimate parts\u201d (the \u201cvagina and genital area\u201d) and the proofs included another \u201cintimate part\u201d within the same zone of privacy, there is no lack of indictment or notice warranting reversal or a new trial. <em>See </em>and compare <em>e.g., State v. Talley, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>385, 392-394 (1983); <em>State v. Wein, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>491, 497 (1979); <em>State v. Campisi, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>513 (1957); <em>State v. Passafiume, </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>447 (App.Div.1982), certif. den. 91 <em>N.J. </em>280 (1982); <em>State v. Wolden, </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>57 (App.Div.1977); <em>State v. Holder, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>300 (App.Div.1975), certif. den. 69 <em>N.J. </em>443 (1976); <em>R. </em>3:7-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The judgment of conviction and sentence imposed are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-11\">By rejecting defendant\u2019s second contention, we do not indicate agreement or disagreement with <em>State v. Whitehead, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509 (App.Div.1985). While defendant did not testify in this case, the State does not contend in this matter that the <em>Sands </em>issue cannot be asserted on appeal. <em>See State v. Sands, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>127 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b551-31\">The jury acquitted defendant on the second count alleging aggravated sexual assault which required a showing of \"penetration.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(l). We reject the suggestion in the State\u2019s brief that the conviction on the first count can be sustained because of the testimony concerning the vagina without consideration of the issue concerning \"inner thighs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\">We can find no evidence in the record of any motion to dismiss the indictment for evidentiary insufficiency or otherwise. The grand jury minutes are not contained in this record, and we do not know if the evidence before the grand jury included direct testimony from Ms. Pope or reference to \u201cinner thighs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
