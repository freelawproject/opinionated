Karnell challenge the entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants Rita Campbell, John Penna, Carollee Rosenblatt and Eileen Wolfskehl in connection with the complaint for defamation plaintiffs instituted against them. The complaint alleged that defendants had maliciously written letters containing false and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>defamatory statements about plaintiffs which injured plaintiffs\u2019 business reputations. It sought compensatory and punitive damages and other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">All defendants filed a joint answer denying the allegations of the complaint. Thereafter, Campbell, Penna and Rosenblatt filed an amended answer in which they also denied that the letters were written maliciously and raised several separate defenses, including that plaintiffs were public figures and that defendants\u2019 statements constituted fair comment, made in good faith, without knowledge of any falsity or disregard for truth. Eventually all defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that the publications at issue were expressions of \u201cpure opinion.\u201d Plaintiffs cross-moved for summary judgment. The trial judge determined that the letters were indeed expressions of \u201cpure opinion\u201d and not actionable and granted defendants\u2019 motion, concomitantly denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion. This appeal ensued in which plaintiffs claim that the trial judge erred in determining, as a matter of law, that the letters were not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The letters which form the basis of plaintiffs\u2019 claim were published in the <em>P.D. Review, </em>a newspaper serving Piscataway and Dunellen and involve the former New Market school property and a lot adjoining the school property in Piscataway which plaintiffs were developing through their real estate development firm, the Central Leasing Company. The vacant lot was purchased by plaintiffs for $35,000. Plaintiffs\u2019 proposal for development of these properties, the price which they paid for the New Market property, and an alleged underappraisal of the vacant lot leading to its being undervalued for sale to the plaintiffs ultimately became the source of heated debate in the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">In connection with the New Market property, Rosenblatt wrote a letter which was published on December 16,1982. In it she said that on December 8, 1982 Piscataway had been \u201craped.\u201d She explained that because the town had been \u201cstu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>pid enough\u201d to trust plaintiffs and rezone the New Market site commercial, eliminating the necessity for a variance, it was getting \u201canother strip mall\u201d instead of the quiet business offices residents had been promised. The town had also been \u201crobbed,\u201d according to Rosenblatt, because while undeveloped commercial land could sell for $200,000, the price paid for the New Market property, with improvements and structure included, \u201camounts to theft.\u201d She expressed the hope that the town would fight the planned alterations and void the zoning change \u201cobtained by the developer under false pretenses.\u201d According to her, if it did not fight, the town would be not a rape victim, but a \u201ccheap prostitute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In a lengthy letter published the same day, Penna criticized the planning board for approving plaintiffs' plans to pave over grassland and develop the New Market property into another retail shopping area which, according to Penna, would cause traffic jams, air pollution and storm sewer overloads and thus \u201conly serve to congest and not benefit us.\u201d He said that the township and the New Market area had been \u201cduped by the clever maneuvering of very shrewd businessmen\u201d who bought the New Market School and adjacent land at a very low price. According to Penna, \u201c[a]llowing the Karnell group [plaintiffs] the right to build retail stores on our grassland only serves to fatten the Karnell bank account (I can see the smiles on their faces) while, once again, the New Market area gets dumped on.\u201d Penna said that the mayor and the planning board could not be trusted in matters concerning the New Market site.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Wolfskehl\u2019s letter, which appeared the same day as those of Penna and Rosenblatt, criticized the plaintiffs\u2019 development plan and the planning board for approving it in spite of public opposition. She said that \u201cMr. Karnell seems to have no difficulty in getting what he wants,\u201d <em>e.g., </em>a variance to build more parking spaces. She also remarked that citizens who oppose the retail store development plan should be informed that \u201cthey have not exhausted every means to stop Karnell from carrying out his plan to satisfy his greed.\u201d Wolfskehl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>complained that a planning board clerk had misinformed her that stores were not part of the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed project, and questioned whether the board chose to continue the meeting and make their decision late at night, after many of the citizens had left, because they feared there would be a greater turnout if another meeting were held.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Campbell\u2019s letter was published in the <em>P.D. Review </em>on February 24, 1983. This letter said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">At the Piseataway Township Council meeting of February 1, Robert Karnell, purchaser of a 0.9-acre lot adjacent to the New Market School, portrayed himself as a much put-upon man. He said that he had been slandered and libeled and he attempted to win sympathy by stating that his wife had been hospitalized for a year and that he himself had had a heart attack and had also been hospitalized. He said that he had been unaware of the restrictive clause in the sale ordinance limiting use of the land to parking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\"><em>No one an [sic] believe that a developer who has purchased as much land in Middlesex County as Mr. Karnell has could fail to be aware of that restrictive clause. </em>Moreover, he has a lawyer. Indeed, a lawyer was sitting beside him at the meeting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">The injured party is not Mr. Karnell but the citizens of the township for it is now known that the parcel was appraised as being zoned R-7.5 for residential use whereas the council had changed it from education-research to commercial four months prior to the appraisal date. <em>Does Mr. Karnell expect us to believe that he was not aware of this grave error in the appraisal of which he got a copy and for which he paid $300? Do you pay $300 for something and not look at it carefully?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">The whole matter raises many questions and <em>1 have complained to the Middlesex County Prosecutor. </em>At the council meeting of February 15, <em>Mr. Paley, township counsel, said that he did not know how this error had occurred. Perhaps the prosecutor can find out and whether it was, in fact, an error, </em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> [emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1X\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>On February 24, 1984 an article in the <em>P.D. Review </em>reported that the county prosecutor was investigating Campbell\u2019s charge that after the former New Market school property was rezoned from educational-research to commercial, plaintiffs purchased it at a \u201c \u2018dishonestly\u2019 low cost\u201d because its appraisal value had been \u201cdeliberately underestimated\u201d at $35,000 for plaintiffs\u2019 gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">We have analysed this record with care and have concluded that the trial judge properly granted summary judgment to defendants. Thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Those who write or publish material which tends to injure an individual\u2019s reputation, may be subject to liability in a libel action if the material is false. <em>Maressa v. New Jersey Monthly, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>176, 190 (1982), <em>cert. den. </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>907, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>211, 74 L.Ed.2d 169 (1982). The threshold issue in such actions is \u201cwhether the language used is reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning.\u201d <em>Kotlikoff v. The Community News, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>62, 67 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Whether language is defamatory on its face is a question of law for a court to resolve, <em>Lawrence v. Bauer Pub. &amp; Print Ltd., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>451, 459 (1982), <em>cert. den. </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>999, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>358, 74 L.Ed.2d 395 (1982). In so doing the judge must evaluate the statement in context, construing it according to the meaning that a reasonable recipient would give it. <em>Molnar v. Star Ledger, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>12, 18 (App.Div.1984); <em>Cibenko v. Worth Publ., Inc., </em>510 <em>F.Supp. </em>761, 764 (D.N.J. 1981). When the language at issue is capable of both a defamatory and a nondefamatory meaning, there exists a question of fact for a jury to decide. <em>Lawrence, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\"> In general it can be said that words that subject a person to ridicule, hatred, or contempt or which \u201cclearly \u2018sound to the disreputation\u2019 of an individual are defamatory on their face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459 (citation omitted); <em>Garven v. Finch, </em>97 <em>N.J.L. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>329, 331 (E. &amp; A. 1922). A false criminal accusation falls into this category. <em>See, e.g., Hoagburg v. Harrah\u2019s Marina Hotel Casino, </em>585 <em>F.Supp. </em>1167 (D.N.J.1984); <em>Dijkstra v. Westerink, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>128 (App.Div.1979), <em>certif. den. </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>329 (1979). So does a statement which unavoidably implies that a plaintiff stole property, without explicitly accusing him of theft. <em>Murphy v. Johns-Manville Prods. Corp., </em>45 <em>N.J.Super. </em>478, 488 (App.Div.1957), <em>certif. den. </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>55 (1957); <em>Jorgensen v. Pennsylvania R. Co., </em>38 <em>N.J.Super. </em>317, 343 (App.Div.1955), <em>certif. den. </em>20 <em>N.J. </em>308 (1956). Where criminal allegations are concerned, a court needs to examine a statement in context to determine whether it conveys the impression that a plaintiff is being accused of a crime, <em>Kotlikoff, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\"> The question of whether the statement has a defamatory meaning does not even arise, however, unless the statement is an assertion or implication of \u201cfact.\u201d Unlike false statements of fact, expressions of opinion, no matter how insulting, are actionable only if they imply the existence of undisclosed defamatory facts on which the opinion was based. While the opinion cannot be false, those undisclosed defamatory facts may be, thus subjecting the publisher of the opinion to liability. The rationale is that while \u201cthere is no constitutional value in false statements of fact,\u201d opinions, no matter how \u201cpernicious,\u201d cannot be false and are therefore constitutionally protected as \u201cideas.\u201d <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch Inc., </em>418 <em>U.S. </em>323, 339-340, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>2997, 3007, 41 L.Ed.2d 789, 805 (1974). Therefore the court held in <em>Kotlikoff, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 68-69, that \u201cpure\u201d expressions of opinion on matter of public concern are not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In <em>Kotlikoff </em>the court defined a \u201cpure\u201d expression of opinion as one which:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">... is found when the maker of the comment states the facts on which he bases his opinion of the plaintiff and then states a view as to the plaintiff\u2019s conduct, qualifications or character. \u2018Pure\u2019 expression of opinion occurs also when the maker of the comment does not spell out the alleged facts on which the opinion is based but both parties to the communication know the facts or assume their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>existence and the statement of opinion is obviously based on those assumed facts as justification for the opinion. <em>[Ibid.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The court went on to describe the \u201cmixed\u201d statement as \u201cone that, while an opinion in form or context, is apparently based on facts about plaintiff or his conduct that have neither been stated by the defendant nor assumed to exist by the parties to the communication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The court dismissed as \u201cmerely pejorative rhetoric\u201d language that plaintiff had characterized as false factual assertions of criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>at 72. Kotlikoff, the mayor of Pennsauken, had brought a defamation action against the writer of a letter to the editor and the local newspaper that published it. The letter suggested that Kotlikoff was engaged in a \u201chuge coverup\u201d or \u201cconspiracy\u201d because he was refusing to disclose the names of delinquent local property taxpayers. <em>Id. </em>at 65. After reading this language in context the court found that, \u201ctaken as a whole the letter could not reasonably be interpreted as charging the plaintiff with committing a criminal offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72 (citations omitted). Instead, the statements were \u201cprotected expressions of opinion.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>According to the court, the letter writer had fully disclosed the facts upon which he had based his opinion and no other defamatory facts could reasonably be implied. <em>Ibid. </em>Therefore the opinion was not actionable. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">... Where an opinion is accompanied by its underlying nondefamatory factual basis, ... a defamation action premised upon that opinion will fail, no matter how unjustified, unreasonable or derogatory the opinion might be. This is so because readers can interpret the factual statements and decide for themselves whether the writer\u2019s opinion was justified. <em>[Id. </em>at 72-73; citation omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">A similar result was reached in <em>Greenbelt Cooperative Publ. Ass\u2019n., v. Bresler, </em>398 <em>U.S. </em>6, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1537, 26 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>6 (1970) where a real estate developer instituted a defamation action against a newspaper which published a report of city council meetings at which he had been criticized. The newspaper fully and accurately reported on the meetings, in which plaintiff\u2019s opponents accused him of \u201cblackmailing\u201d the city in negotiations regarding zoning variances. 398 <em>U.S. </em>at 13, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>1541. According to plaintiff, use of the word \u201cblackmail\u201d constituted a false criminal accusation. <em>Ibid. </em>The Supreme Court disagreed. It ruled that any reader would understand that the word was \u201cno more than rhetorical hyperbole, a vigorous epithet used by those who considered Bresler\u2019s negotiating positions extremely unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1542.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The decision in <em>Rinaldi v. Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, Inc., </em>42 <em>N.Y.</em>2d 369, 366 N.E.2d 1299, 397 N.Y.S.2d 943 (1977), <em>cert. den. </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>969, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>514, 54 L.Ed.2d 456 (1977), illustrates the difference between nonactionable \u201cpure\u201d opinion and defamatory mixed opinions. In <em>Rinaldi </em>a judge had sued publishers of a book that was highly critical of him. After setting forth examples of the judge\u2019s decisions, the book concluded that he was \u201cincompetent,\u201d \u201cprobably corrupt\u201d and \u201csuspiciously lenient.\u201d The court ruled that statements that he was \u201cincompetent,\u201d and that he should be removed from office, both of which were based on specific disclosed facts, were constitutionally protected statements of opinion. 366 N.E.2d at 1306, 397 N.Y.S.2d at 950. However, comments that he was \u201cprobably corrupt\u201d and \u201csuspiciously lenient\u201d implied the existence of undisclosed \u201cfacts\u201d that might be false. These opinions, therefore, were not protected from attack in a defamation suit. <em>Id. </em>at 1307, 397 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>at 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">In <em>Lawrence, supra, </em>defendants who invoked the \u201cpure\u201d opinion rule did not prevail. Plaintiffs in that case were leaders of a local taxpayers\u2019 association who opposed municipal appropriations for construction of a new firehouse. <em>Id., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 455. The taxpayers\u2019 association circulated petitions in order to put the appropriation issue before the public as a referendum question. A city official informed an editor and a reporter of a local newspaper that there were \u201cirregularities\u201d in some of the signatures on the petitions and that the city prosecutor was investigating the matter. <em>Id. </em>at 455-456. The newspaper published articles reporting that plaintiffs might be charged with criminal forgery and false swearing of their oaths and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>affidavits as witnesses to the petition signatures. <em>Id. </em>at 456. The court determined that the \u201cunambiguous import of the two articles is to cast doubt on the reputations of plaintiffs\u201d and that the statement that they \u201cmay be\u201d charged with crimes \u201cdiminishes their standing in the community and is little different from an assertion that plaintiffs have actually been charged with certain crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459. The articles therefore were \u201clibelous <em>per se, i.e. </em>not susceptible of a nondefamatory interpretation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">This is the backdrop on which the statements in this case must be evaluated. We begin with plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial judge was required to allow a jury to resolve the issue of the questioned statements. This is only true if the statements could be read in either a defamatory or nondefamatory way. <em>Lawrence, supra, </em>at 459. Where as here, she found them capable of being read only as nondefamatory she properly resolved the issue summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Next we turn to the substance of plaintiffs\u2019 claims and Wolfskehl\u2019s letter which, in our view is clearly not actionable. The gist of the letter is that plaintiff Robert Karnell was having no trouble getting what he wanted from the town: approval of his development plan. Wolfskehl did not hint that he was getting his way through dishonest or criminal tactics although she was critical of municipal officials for capitulating to him despite public opposition to the development plan. Indeed, Wolfskehl\u2019s criticism of plaintiff was not even particularly vehement. Her reference to his \u201cgreed\u201d was merely \u201cpejorative rhetoric,\u201d in fact, much milder than the language held not to be actionable in <em>Kotlikoff </em>and <em>Greenbelt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Neither was Penna\u2019s letter actionable although it refers to the township having been \u201cduped\u201d by plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cclever maneuvering.\u201d The facts underlying these words (plaintiffs\u2019 purchase of the New Market property at a low price and their subsequent application to develop it into a retail mall) were laid out in detail in Penna\u2019s letter. In essence Penna portrays <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>plaintiffs as clever businessmen who are profiting at the expense of the citizens and smiling as their bank accounts increase. We view this as pure opinion couched in terms of pejorative rhetoric and, like that in <em>Kotlikoff </em>and <em>Greenbelt, </em>not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Rosenblatt is a slightly more difficult case. While Rosenblatt\u2019s letter uses the words \u201ctheft\u201d and \u201crape,\u201d any reader would understand that she was not accusing plaintiffs of the crimes of rape or theft any more than the opponents of the developer in <em>Greenbelt </em>were accusing him of \u201cblackmail.\u201d The letter also claims that plaintiffs obtained a zoning change under \u201cfalse pretenses.\u201d Plaintiffs say that this cannot be dismissed as an expression of opinion but that it is either a statement charging plaintiff with dishonest conduct or, at least, an opinion based on undisclosed facts. The statement is not so clearly a criminal accusation or an attack on plaintiffs\u2019 reputation as to be defamatory per se. The only question is whether Rosenblatt\u2019s opinion as to false pretenses belies undisclosed facts on which she accuses plaintiffs of dishonesty. We think that a contextual reading of Rosenblatt\u2019s words leads only to the conclusion that her idea of an appropriate commercial use for the New Market school property is different from plaintiffs. Her reference to \u201canother strip mall\u201d as opposed to quiet business offices supports this view. Rosenblatt does not question the viability of the \u201ccommercial\u201d zone per se but only the plaintiff\u2019s projected use within that zone. We are satisfied that her letter is nothing more than pure opinion and therefore not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Campbell presents the closest case. Campbell\u2019s letter outlined the facts of plaintiffs\u2019 purchase of the questioned property. She indicated that Karnell obtained it at a very low price because it had been incorrectly appraised as \u201cresidential\u201d although in fact it had been recently rezoned from education-research to commercial. She said that plaintiff himself had paid for the appraisal and received a copy of it. In her letter she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>avoided explicitly accusing plaintiff of wrongdoing. However, she wrote: \u201cDoes Mr. Karnell expect us to believe that he was not aware of this grave error in the appraisal of which he got a copy and for which he paid $300. Do you pay $300 for something and not look at it carefully?\u201d She also expressed dissatisfaction with the township. \u25a0 She reported that she had complained to the county prosecutor in hopes that he might find out whether the appraisal was, in fact, in error. We view this as protected speech. Campbell set forth in detail the facts underpinning her opinion that Karnell was not unaware of the underappraisal of the property and her belief that Karnell\u2019s testimony before the Piscataway Township Council was incredible. She also expressed dissatisfaction with the municipal authorities and it is this overall dissatisfaction which led to this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">\u201cThe whole matter raises many questions. I have complained to the Middlesex County Prosecutor. At the council meeting of February 15, Mr. Paley, township counsel, said that he did not know how this error had occurred. Perhaps the Prosecutor can find out whether it was, in fact, an error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">As we see it Campbell disclosed all of the facts which formed the basis of her opinion thereby obviating plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the nondisclosure principle. In addition Campbell made a statement of true fact when she indicated that she had exercised her right as a citizen to complain to the Prosecutor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Like those of Wolfskehl, Penna and Rosenberg, these statements are not actionable. Thus the trial judge properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">No opinion of this sort would be complete without an expression of the deep concern with which we view plaintiffs\u2019 action here. The citizens of our state must be free, within reason, to speak out on matters of public concern. So long as they state the facts implicated fairly and express their opinions, even in the most colorful and hyperbolic terms, their speech should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>protected by us. Of course, developers such as plaintiffs here are entitled to invoke their legal rights in a court of law to protect their good names. We nevertheless fear that no one will be left to carry the torch of criticism even when defendants like those in this case are vindicated, after they have withstood the financial and emotional rigors of litigation such as this. Indeed it may become too costly for ordinary citizens to exercise the right to free speech which undergirds a democratic society. We are profoundly concerned with the chilling effect that plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit in these rather unremarkable circumstances may have on other citizens who would ordinarily speak out on behalf of what they perceive to be the public good. We thus consider stringent scrutiny of claims such as plaintiffs\u2019 to be required. Like the court in <em>Kotlikoff </em>we are extremely \u201cloathe to discourage that robust and uninhibited commentary on public issues that is part of our national heritage.\u201d <em>Kotlikoff, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-11\"> A subsequent letter by Campbell which appeared in the P.D. Review of March 1, 1983 was referred to in plaintiffs\u2019 argument on appeal and a copy of this letter was included in the appendix to plaintiffs\u2019 brief. Because it was not before the trial judge and the argument made here was not there advanced, it is not properly before us. Similarly, reference to answers to interrogatories relied on here for the first time are inappropriate. We therefore grant defendants\u2019 motion to strike those portions of plaintiff\u2019s brief and appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-11\">In fact the County Prosecutor did investigate this case and recommended that the Township secure a new appraisal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
