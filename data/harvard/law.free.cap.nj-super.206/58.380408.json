The determination under review is based upon a finding of conduct by the juvenile which would cause him to be classified as a disorderly person under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-2(b) if he were an adult. As the trial court\u2019s opinion states, the punishable conduct consisted of addressing the police officer with profane language, the only purpose of which \u201cwas to offend the officer, in effect, to exact verbal vengeance for his arrest.\u201d <em>State in the Interest of H.D., </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>499, 503 (J. &amp; D.R.Ct.1982). Although the court found that the juvenile\u2019s language did not amount to \u201c \u2018fighting words\u2019 likely to cause an immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>breach of the peace or move the hearers to present violence,\u201d it nevertheless concluded that it transgressed the statutory proscription against verbal assaults upon the sensibilities of a listener and that the statute did not infringe upon protected freedom of expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">As the trial court correctly noted, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-2(b) was enacted some time after the decisions of the United States and New Jersey Supreme Court invalidating convictions for the public use of offensive language. In those cases, the prosecutions were conducted pursuant to statutory language found to be overly broad. <em>Gooding v. Wilson, </em>405 <em>U.S. </em>518, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1103, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972); <em>Coken v. California, </em>403 <em>U.S. </em>15, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971); <em>State v. Rosenfeld, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>594 (1973). <em>Rosenfeld </em>was a prosecution under our predecessor statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:170-29(1), which prohibited the public use of \u201cloud and offensive or profane or indecent language.\u201d In <em>State v. Profaci, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>346 (1970) the Supreme Court concluded that this enactment served two purposes, (1) to preserve the peace by prohibiting the use of language which was likely to incite its hearer to violence and (2) \u201cto protect the sensibilities of those persons within hearing of the person uttering the language.\u201d So understood, the statute was held constitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 353. <em>Rosenfeld, </em>however, recognized that under the intervening decisions of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Gooding v. Wilson, supra, </em>and <em>Cohen v. California, supra, </em>\u201cthe second alternative in <em>Profaci </em>(56 <em>N.J. </em>at 353) is no longer viable.\u201d 62 <em>N.J. </em>at 601. The court added the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">Thus the Attorney General\u2019s brief acknowledges that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:170-29(1) \u201cmay not be utilized to punish speech which solely is offensive to the sensibilities of the hearer\u201d; and similarly the Prosecutor\u2019s brief acknowledges that the views expressed by the majority in <em>Gooding </em>dictate the conclusion that so much in <em>Profaci </em>as denies First Amendment protection to language which \u201caffects one\u2019s sensibilities\u201d is no longer valid. [/6fd.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">In the view of the trial court the present statute satisfies constitutional requirements by proscribing offensive language \u201cmuch more narrowly than did the doctrine enumerated in <em>Profaci.\u201d State in the Interest of H.D., supra, </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>at 502. We cannot agree that the present enactment reflects any significant modification of the constitutional reading given the earlier statute in <em>Profaci </em>found to be \u201cno longer viable\u201d in <em>Rosenfeld. Profaci </em>held that under a constitutional application of the statute it was sufficient that the words be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKC\">spoken loudly, in a public place and must ... be likely, in the light of the gender and age of the listener and the setting of the utterance, to affect the sensibilities of a hearer. The words must be spoken with the intent to have the above effect or with a reckless disregard of the probability of the above consequences. [56 <em>N.J. </em>at 353].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The present statute declares that one is guilty of disorderly conduct</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">if, in a public place, and with purpose to offend the sensibilities of a hearer or in reckless disregard of the probability of so doing, he addresses unreasonably loud and offensively coarse or abusive language, given the circumstances of the person present and the setting of the utterance, to any person present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">In our view, the two standards are practically identical and we conclude that the defect of overbreadth found fatal to the validity of the predecessor statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:170-29(1), inheres in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-2(b). It follows, therefore, that there is no valid statutory authority for prosecutions based upon the public use of coarse or abusive language which does not go beyond offending the sensibilities of a listener.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
