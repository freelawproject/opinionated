But this contention, we submit, is not supported by any authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-14\">No such exception is made in the statute. See. 4364-9. And such exception, if it be as claimed by counsel, would amount to a practical defeat of the law, especially in those cities and villages where pub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>lie sentiment is not strong enough to enforce a prohibitory ordinance. All that would be necessary in such case would be to adopt the ordinance and then elect a mayor who would ignore it. In .this way both the Dow tax and the ordinance would be defeated. The legislature certainly did not intend such an anomaly. <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>5 Dec. 27; 2 N. P. 300; <em>Youngblood </em>v. <em>Sexton, </em>32 Mich., 406; License Tax Cases, 5 Wal., 462.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-4\">The Dow law is not a license law. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Brewster, </em>44 Ohio St., 576. It does not make legal the sale of intoxicating liquors in any form not already authorized by law. The laws of the state forbid the sale to certain classes, such as minors, person's intoxicated or in the habit of getting intoxicated, and also on Sundays, election days, etc. Section 6942, Rev. Stat., makes it illegal, under penalty of fine and imprisonment, to keep a place where intoxicating liquors are so sold in violation of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-5\">Now it will hardly be contended by counsel that a dealer, confining himself strictly to such illegal traffic, would be exempt from the Dow tax if he conducted his business as specified in Sec. 4364-16, Rev. Stat., defining the meaning of traffic in intoxicating liquors. Lax officers might not impose the penalties provided for such illegal sales, or he might pay his fines and yet do an extensive business. It would be a premium upon wrongdoing. We assume therefore that no one will contend that a dealer under such circumstances is exempt from the Dow tax, and yet the reason for such exemption is much stronger than in case of a local option ordinance. In one case the state itself prohibits the traffic absolutely, but in the other permission only is given to the municipal corporation to pass the ordinance.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b73-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Shauck, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al\">The findings of fact made by the court below are not to be reviewed here. The cases are thought to be entitled to report only upon the question arising out of the fact, established in both cases, that the traffic was carried on in violation of ordinances -passed by the municipal authorities forbidding the traffic. The provision of the statute for the assessment in question is found in section 4364-9 of the Revised Statutes. Without exception or limitation it provides for the assessment \u201cupon the business of trafficking.\u201d The only limitations upon the terms of the statute are found in the eleventh subdivision of the same section which provides for the remission of a portion of the assessment when the person against whom it is made voluntarily discontinues the business, and in the twentieth sub-division which provides for such' remission when there is a compulsory discontinuance of the business resulting from the exercise by municipal corporations of the power of prohibiting the traffic, which power is therein conferred. The reliance of counsel for the plaintiff in error is iipon this provision which is: \u201cIf any municipal corporation shall prohibit * * * places where intoxicating liquors are sold within the limits of such corporation, a ratable portion of the tax paid by the proprietors thereof for the unexpired portion of the year shall be returned to such proprietors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The question presented has not been determined by the lexicographers. Although these municipalities have by ordinance forbidden the traffic, they have not prevented it. But the historical development of our legislative policy upon the subject and the terms employed in the present statute indicate the sense in which the word \u201cprohibit\u201d is used in this section. For nearly half a century prior to the enactment of the present statute, a statute had forbidden throughout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>the state the sale of intoxicating liquors to be drank upon the premises where sold. During this time the forbidden, traffic grew much beyond the general growth of the state. It was, therefore, most obvious when the present statute was enacted that to make the traffic unlawful does not necessarily prevent it. A leading object of the present statute was to secure to the state the benefit of its experience. Accordingly by the first section the traffic is assessed in terms which admit of no exception. Full effect will be given to all the provisions of the statute if the word \u201cprohibit\u201d in the provision relied upon by counsel for plaintiffs in error is regarded as having its appropriate meaning of preventing. The object of the particular provision was to provide for an equitable remission of a portion of the assessment if the municipal authorities should exercise the power of passing an ordinance forbidding the places and also the power of enforcing the ordinance. The natural force of the language employed in this section is not inconsistent with that of the section which requires the traffic to be assessed wherever it may be carried on. We should not assume that the legislature intended to offer,a reward for the violation of local inhibitions in those numerous portions of the state where sentiment against the traffic is strong enough to secure their adoption, but conviction is not strong enough to secure their enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b74-6\">Minshall, C.
