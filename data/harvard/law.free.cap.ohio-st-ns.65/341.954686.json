Said plaintiff further says that the aforesaid liabilities of said manufacturing company, and the several members thereof, for money borrowed as aforesaid, were contracted with the knowledge and assent of each of said directors, or if either of the said directors failed to have actual knowledge thereof, that said directors were grossly negligent of their duty in the management of the affairs of said bank, in failing to examine the books of account and evidence of indebtedness held by said bank during all the period in which said liabilities were being contracted, and in failing to exercise the slightest diligence or in making the slightest investigation of the conduct of said bank; and that any investigation or supervision of the affairs of said bank, or any examination of its books, and the evidence of indebtedness held by this bank during that period, would have disclosed to either of said officers or directors that said liabilities were incurred, and the amount and extent thereof, and what security, if any, had been required by said directors and said officers for the loans so made by said bank to said company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">\u201cEighteenth.

Hughes, Jr., cashier, taking advantage of his position as such officer, negligently and willfully concealed the protested notes and drafts of said manufacturing company, upon which the said bank had loaned its money to the amount of over eighty thousand dollars, which were protested and returned to said bank, thus impairing the assets of said bank to that extent; that the same was known to said directors in and for the years 1893 and 1894, or, if not known, might and could have been known to the directors of said bank if said directors had made the slightest investigation and inquiry from him or made any investigation of the books of said bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-7\">\u201cTwentieth.

Hughes, Jr., cashier, to execute his bond with security in the sum of fifteen thousand dollars, for the faithful and honest discharge of his duties as such cashier, as required by section 8 of the by-laws of said bank and in violation thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-8\">\u201cTwenty-first.

Hughes, Jr., for the causes set forth in this petition, and no attention whatsoever was paid thereto by said directors; and that on the 24th day of July, 1897, he again served a notice in writing embracing in substance the contents of this petition upon C. B. Crites, cashier, in person, in the bank in Lima, Ohio, requesting the present directors of said bank to pay him said sum of money, or on a failure to do so, to bring an action against the defendant directors named herein, to which request the present directors of said bank made no response whatsoever; and that on the 18th day of August, 1897, he again served the present directors of said bank with a notice in writing, by handing the same in person to T.

Said plaintiff further says that he now brings and prosecutes this action on behalf ol himself and all other stockholders who wish to become parties to this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>\u201cTwenty-sixth.

That the plaintiff has not legal capacity to sue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-10\">\u201cSecond.

The allegations which set forth the complaining stockholders\u2019 cause of action will, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>course, depend largely on the particular facts of each case. It is necessary, however, to determine, <em>first, </em>whether the allegations are to make out a case of fraud or an <em>ultra vires </em>act, or of a <em>negligent </em>act. The complainant need not allege who the other stockholders are, how numerous or whether a majority. The stockholder need not allege that he was a stockholder at the time of the act. 2 Cook on Stockholders, section 742; <em>Zinn </em>v. Baxter, 9 Circ. Dec., 731; 17 C. C. R., 283.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-6\">If the defendants are liable to the bank, they are certainly liable to the stockholder at the <em>time </em>of the <em>injury. </em>This is a suit in equity to remedy a wrong committed by the defendants. The bank might and should have brought this action, but the defendant directors who are and were the guilty parties at the time of the injury complained of, refused to bring this action. The petition alleges specifically that all the losses to the bank \u2014 the impairment of its capital stock \u2014 are and were directly occasioned by the wrongful, reckless and negligent mismanagement, the utter absence of supervision and examination and the gross neglect of duty and inattention in the conduct of the business of the bank in 1893-4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-7\">The plaintiff in error asks that an <em>account </em>be taken of the loss and damage to said bank, its shareholders. \u201cIt is well settled that the prayer for relief may be in the alternative.\u201d 2 Cook on Stock, section 743.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-8\">The capital stock of the bank was $100,000. The .plaintiff in error alleges that the president, vice-president, cashier and his assistant, knowingly permitted the liabilities to said bank of a certain corporation known as the Munroe Manufacturing Company, for money borrowed exceeding one-tenth of the capital stock of the bank actually paid in. Here we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>find that said officers, in violation of the law, loaned out $45,150 over and above its capital stock to one worthless concern. This clearly states a case against the directors and officers of the bank. <em>Cockrill </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>86 Fed. Rep., 7.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-5\">This construction is unanswerable. This opinion also decides that a stockholder need not aw\u00e1it a forfeiture of charter before suing, and that the provisions of the national banking law, making the directors liable, do not create a new cause of action, but exists without and independent of them. 1 Morawetz on Corp., section 554.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-6\">The directors are bound to manage the affairs of the company with the same degree of care and prudence which is generally exercised by business men in the management of their own affairs. <em>Hun </em>v. <em>Cary, supra; </em>1 Morawetz, section 554.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-7\">The comptroller of the currency prior to the 1st day of October, 1894, found the bank <em>insolvent, </em>and ordered an assessment of 100 per cent, on the capital stock.

There would then be no bank, no corporation to claim the assets or the fruits of this litigation. Then would the stockholder who sustained the loss lose his right to recover from the wrong-doing directors? The liability of a wrong-doing director is certainly not dependent upon the continuance or dissolution of the corporation, nor are the rights of the stockholder to recover for losses sustained dependent upon such conditions of the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-9\">The liability of the director is created by his own act, and in derogation of chartered privileges, while acting as trustee for the stockholder. Then if a corporation expires, as aforesaid, how would a stockholder recover the losses he sustained from a wrongdoing director? We answer, a court of equity would permit, the stockholder to bring all parties before the court and would lay hold of the fruits of the litiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>tion and administer and distribute them for the benefit of all interested. <em>Hightower </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>8 Ga., 492; <em>Hargroves </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>30 Ga., 606.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-5\">The right of a shareholder to recover from a wrongdoing director must necessarily then rest not upon the contention that the corporation receives the fruits of the litigation as an asset, but upon the fact that the shareholder sustained a loss.

Graves, 41 Fed. Rep., 459; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>44 Fed. Rep., 13; <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Barney, </em>7 O. F. D., 8 (45 Fed. Rep., 668); <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Mosher, </em>63 Fed.

The rights of the bank and of its stockholders, as well as the liabilities of its officers and directors, were fixed and imposed by that act alone, and therefore the statutes of Ohio, the common law, and rules of equity, as to such rights and liabilities, have no application; but the rights and liabilities being ascertained under the provisions of said act, the same may be enforced in the state courts unless otherwise provided by act of congress. It is not otherwise provided by act of congress as to the grievances of which complaint is made in the petition, and therefore the action was properly brought in the courts of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The section of the national banking act which gives the right, and imposes the liability, is No. 5289, which reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u201cIf the directors of any national banking association shall knowingly violate or knowingly permit any of the officers, agents or servants of the association to violate any of the provisions of this title, all the rights, privileges and franchises of the association shall be thereby forfeited. Such violation shall, however, be determined and adjudged by a proper circuit, district or territorial court of the United States in a suit brought for that purpose by the comptroller of the currency, in his own name, before the association shall be declared dissolved. And in cases of such violation, every director who participated in or assented to the same shall be held liable in his personal and individual capacity for all damages which the association, its shareholders or any other person shall have sustained in consequence of such violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">There is no averment in the petition to the effect that the association has been adjudged dissolved by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>a federal court as provided in that section, and therefore it must be regarded for the purposes of this case, that the assessment made by the comptroller of the currency in October, 1894, was paid, and that the bank is and ever has been since its organization a going concern. What would be the rights of stockholders, or the liabilities of directors, after such dissolution, is therefore not involved in this case, and is not here decided. The question here' is as to the rights of stockholders, and the liabilities of directors, in cases where the bank, has not been dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">It seems clear that the acts of omission and commission charged in the petition-were in violation of the provisions of the national banking act, and sufficient to impose a liability upon such directors as participated therein, or assented thereto, and that the plaintiff suffered loss by reason of such acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Whatever may be the case after a national bank has been adjudged dissolved by a federal court, and gone into the hands of a receiver, or after such receiver has been discharged, it seems too clear for controversy, that before such dissolution, and while the bank is open and carrying on its usual business, the loss caused by the wrongful acts of its directors, is an asset of the bank, and that the bank may recover from such directors all damages which it may have sustained in consequence of such wrongful acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Said section 5239 provides that where the provisions of the act are knowingly violated by the directors, every director who participated in, or assented to the same, shall be held liable in his personal and individual capacity for all damages which the association, its shareholders, or any other person shall have sustained in consequence of such viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>tion. As the directors are to be held liable for the damages which the association, the bank, has sustained, it follows that they are liable <em>to </em>the bank for such damages, .and that the damages are therefore an asset of the bank, and may be recovered by it in an action for that purpose. And if the bank brings its action and recovers the damages, such damages inure to the benefit of all the stockholders, by an increase in the value of their respective shares, or the payment of increased dividends; and in such case the shareholders would have no right of action against the directors, for the reason that while they may have been damnified in the first instance, such damages have been paid to their benefit, and they have no right to be compensated twice for the same injury; and the directors can not be compelled to pay twice for the same wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In case the bank fails to bring an action against the directors for the damages by it sustained, then by the law of civil procedure, one or more of the shareholders may bring an action against the delinquent directors in behalf of himself and all the other shareholders, making the bank a party defendant. The action must be in behalf of all the shareholders, and not as in this petition, in behalf of such shareholders as wish to become parties to the action. In such action the shareholder who sues can not recover a separate judgment for himself for the damages he has individually sustained, but the judgment must be in favor of the bank for the full amount of damages sustained by all the shareholders combined, and the judgment when collected must go to the bank, and inure to the equal benefit of all the shareholders, the same as if the action had been brought by the bank. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hurd, </em>53 Mass., 371; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Cur</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>tis, 26 Conn., 456; <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Lincoln Savings Bank, </em>89 Tenn., 630, 24 Am.

And on principle the same rule must prevail when the action is brought as this one was under said section 5239. Whether a shareholder can maintain such action for his individual benefit after the dissolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>of the association, need not now be decided as the question is not involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">As the action by a shareholder against the directors for damages, before dissolution of the bank, must be for the common benefit of all the shareholders, and as the judgment must be in favor of the bank for their common benefit, it follows that such action can be maintained only by a shareholder while he still owns his shares, because after he has parted with his shares he has no longer any interest in the proceeds to be derived from the litigation, as such proceeds must go to the bank for the common benefit of the then shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Counsel for plaintiff concede that if the wrongful acts of the directors occurred before a particular shareholder obtained his shares, that such shareholder can not maintain an action against the directors for damages resulting from such acts, but they claim that a shareholder who has parted with his stock may maintain an action against the directors for damages arising from their wrongful acts while he was the owner and holder of his stock, and they cite a New York case to sustain their contention. The statute of New York under consideration in that case is different from said section 5239 in this, that it gives no right of action to the bank, but only \u201cto the creditors and stockholders, respectively, of the corporation of which he shall be a director to the full extent of any loss they may respectively sustain from such violation.\u201d This New York statute clearly gives a right of action against such directors, to each creditor, and to each stockholder for any loss that each one may sustain individually, and the judgment under that statute would not be in favor of the corporation, but in favor of the individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>stockholder, and the proceeds would go, not to the bank for the benefit of all the stockholders, but to the individual stockholder bringing the action for his own benefit. The New York case, <em>Mabey </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>3 Bosworth, New York Superior Court, 346, is therefore not in point. The same is true, and for the same reason, of <em>Buell </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>33 Vt., 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">But is is urged that at common law, and under the rules of equity, a shareholder may maintain an action against the directors for such damages as he has individually sustained by reason of the wrongful acts of the directors, even though the same acts damnified all the sockholders in the same degree as they did him, and even though the corporation is a going concern, and has not been dissolved. The error of this contention lies in supposing that the statute, the common law, and rules of equity, may all be invoked in the same case, and that where one may be found too narrow, the other may be called in to help out, and that the right of action is given partly by statute, partly by the common law, and partly by the rules of equity. The correct rule is, that as congress has legislated upon the subject, and given and defined the right of action, the right thus given by congress is the only right, and that the action must be maintained under the act of congress or fail; and that the liability of the directors of a national bank is measured by that act alone, and can not be enlarged or changed by the common law or rules of equity. In the case of <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>141 U. S., 132, which was a bill by a receiver of a national bank against the directors for damages as in the present case, the bill charged that independently of the acts of congress the directors were liable as trustees for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>bank, its stockholders and creditors; and upon the hearing this view was ably urged by counsel; but the Supreme Court of the United States ignored the claim and disposed of the case in favor of the directors upon the provisions of the national banking ad alone. The duty of directors being declared by that act, as well as their liability for the violation of that duty, it is competent to resort to the common law and rules of equity to ascertain whether such duty has been properly performed, and that was done in the above cited case, but the court went no further. It is therefore clear that the common law and rules of equity can not be invoked in opposition to the acts of congress to enable a shareholder in an action like the one at bar to maintain such action against the directors after he has parted with his stock, and before a dissolution of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">But it is further urged by counsel for plaintiff, that under the national banking act, the plaintiff having parted with his stock, is no longer a shareholder, and that he may now maintain his action against- the directors in his capacity of \u201cany other person,\u201d because the act provides that the directors shall be liable \u201cfor all damages which the association, its shareholders or' <em>any other person </em>shall have sustained,\u201d and that in an action by a person other than a shareholder, the judgment must be in favor of such person, and not in favor of the bank, and the money when collected must be awarded to such person, and not to the bank. It is true that in an action by such person the judgment would be in his favor, and the money when collected would be awarded to him, and if that wrere all, he might maintain the action. But the words \u201cany other person\u201d in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>section, do not reach back and include shareholders, nor causes of action which have accrued to shareholders, but has reference to creditors and persons other than shareholders. And where a cause of action under that section has accrued to a shareholder in his capacity as such, and he has not availed himself of beginning an action against the directors before parting with his stock, he can not thereafter change his cause of action from what it was when it accrued \u2014 a cause in favor of a shareholder \u2014 to a cause of action in favor of a creditor, or person other than a shareholder. The only cause of action against the directors which ever accrued to the plaintiff was a cause as shareholder, and having allowed that to go by without bringing his action, he now shows no cause of action in his favor in the capacity of <em>\u201cany other person \u201d </em>He slept on his rights until they were gone, by reason of parting with his stock, and now his petition shows no cause of action in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">It may well be doubted whether the demurrer as to the first ground thereof should have been sustained, because it is not a want of capacity in the plaintiff to sue, but the lack of a cause of action in him. We regard the principle stated in <em>Buckingham </em>v. <em>Buckingham, </em>36 Ohio St., 68, as applicable. The principle is there stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u201cThe objection, that a cause of action for which the plaintiff sues was assigned before the commencement of the action, does not relate to the capacity of the plaintiff to sue, but to the fact that the right of action sought to be enforced is not in the plaintiff. To warrant a recovery the petition must show a cause of action in the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>It is clear, however, that the common pleas was right in sustaining the third ground of demurrer, as was also the circuit court in affirming the&gt; judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b390-5\">Minshall, O.
