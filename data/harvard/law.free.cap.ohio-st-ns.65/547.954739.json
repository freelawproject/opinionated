There is no time expressly fixed by statute wherein a bill of exceptions shall be filed, and therefore-the extension of time- allowed for <em>filing </em>the bill, would not include the <em>signing </em>upon the principle that the greater includes the less, for the reason that an extension of- time for filing is not provided for, and therefore such unauthorized extension could not include an extension for <em>signing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">As there was no extension of time for signing the bill endorsed on the bill by the trial judge, the bill was signed after the time allowed by law, and the circuit court was right in striking the same from the files.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b569-8\">Minsi-iall, C.
