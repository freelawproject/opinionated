Section second of the said ordinance provided that the said company, its successors or assigns, shall for a period of ten years from the first day of September, 1895, be entitled to charge for such natural gas furnished not to exceed the sum of twentyjfive cents per thousand cubic feet. There was no provision in said ordinance for a \u201cflat\u201d rate which is a fixed price per month for each fire. Very little gas was sold by meter measurement, most of the consumers taking gas at flat rates by contracts between said company and individual consumers. In September, 1900, the gas company announced an advance in the price of gas as furnished by the flat rates, and thereupon on September 18, 1900, the city council passed an ordinance seeking to compel the gas company to continue to furnish gas at the flat rates which it established when it began business in the city of Chillicothe and had continued up to the time of the beginning of the controversy. The gas company refused to obey the ordinance of September 18,1900, and this action was begun by the city of Chillicothe\u00bb by its city solicitor against the Logan Natural Gas &amp; Fuel Company seeking a mandatory-injunction requiring the gas company to furnish natural gas to all persons who are ready, able and willing to pay for the same in accordance with the prices fixed by the ordinance of September 18, 1900, so long as it may continue in the business of furnishing natural gas to the citizens and public buildings of said city, and that it be restrained from collecting from those who have signed written contracts, more than the price fixed in said ordinance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-6\">The court of common pleas granted a perpetual injunction, and on appeal the circuit court entered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>decree in favor'of the city.

Ency. Law (1 ed.), 233; Sutherland Stat. Constr., Secs. 71, 107; <em>Blanding </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>13 Cal., 357; <em>People </em>v. Salomon, 51 Illinois, 37; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Charlestown, </em>114 Mass., 214; 23 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law (1 ed.), 223.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-8\">The same principle applies to ordinances passes 1 by municipal corporations. The test-writers and the courts in the reported cases make no distinction in its application between statutes and ordinances, and apply it indiscriminately to the whole, or any part or section of a statute or ordinance. 1 Dillon on Municipal Corporations (4 ed.), Sec. 309; <em>Mayor </em>v. <em>Clunet, </em>23 Maryland, 450; <em>Rushville </em>v. <em>Gas Company, </em>132 Indiana, 575; <em>Hensly </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>2 Circ.

If it be construed, as we insist it must be, it will be conceded that it cannot have the effect to invalidate the second section of the ordinance of February 11, 1895; and if- it be construed contrary to the interpretation that we give to it, the conclusive answer to the contention of the city is, that its provisions can have no application to contracts of the character of the one in controversy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>because the power of council to make such contracts is derived from section 2479 of the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-4\">It is perfectly apparent that the provisions of section 1691 and the provisions of section 2479, which latter relate peculiarly and exclusively to the subject matter of the second section of the ordinance of February 11, 1895, cannot both apply to the case, if section 1691 is to be considered as expressing a legislative intention incompatible with that assigned to it by us; and it follows, as a necessary sequence from this, that the provisions of section 2479 must be read as an exception to the provisions of section 1691.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-5\">The universal rule for the construction of statutes is that when general and specific provisions, either in the same statute or in different statutes, are in conflict, the general provisions do not control or override the specific provisions, but the specific provisions are to be read as exceptions to the general provisions and held to supersede them. 23 Am. &amp; Eng. Encv. Law (1 ed.), 426.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-6\">The principle has been approved and applied by this court in many cases. <em>State </em>v. <em>McGregor, </em>44 Ohio St., 628; <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Carthage, </em>49 Ohio St., 334; <em>Cincinnati </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>56 Ohio St., 104; <em>Hoey </em>v. <em>Gilroy, </em>129 New York, 132.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-7\">The doctrine of <em>ultra vires </em>is regarded by the courts as \u201can ungracious and odious one\u201d at best; and, where, as in this instance, the exercise of the alleged excess of power by the city is merely incidental to the principal matter of agreement between it and the company, which is strictly within the limit of the legitimate power of each of them, is not immoral, does not violate any statute expressly forbidding it, and is not illegal, the settled rule is that the entire transaction,- except as to the part which is <em>ultra vires, </em>will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>be sustained. No good reason can be advanced why, upon principle, this rule is not a just and wise one. The courts in this way enforce that part of the contract, which is <em>intra vires, </em>and reject that part of it,, which is <em>ultra vires.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-5\">When it is remembered that the words <em>\u201cultra </em>vires'v and \u201cillegality\u201d represent totally different and distinct ideas, that a contract or transaction that is <em>ultra vires </em>is, as a general thing, far from being either illegal or wrong, or in any manner contrary to public policy, and that the question in each case is only as to the competency and power of a corporation to make the contract, and not as to the legality of the contract, it will readily be seen that this rule is based upon sound and just principles.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-6\">The enforcement of a contract, which is in part <em>ultra vires, </em>in so far as it is within the power of a corporation to make it, leaving the parties without a remedy as to the part of it which, is in excess of such power, and no more, must certainly fulfill every requirement of the law, as there is a well-defined distinction between this and the recognition by the courts of a contract that is void, because it is wholly <em>ultra vires.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-7\">The following cases, among others, are illustrative of the principle and its application: <em>Somers </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>6 Dec. (Re.) 887; 8 Am. L. Rec. 612; <em>Toledo </em>v. <em>Gas Co., </em>3 Circ. Dec., 273; 5 C. C. R., 557.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-8\">This court has, on different occasions, sustained the identical principle, which, we contend, is applicable to this case. The principle was recognized and applied in <em>Knox County </em>(Comrs.) <em>Nichols, </em>14 Ohio St., 260, where the commissioners, in addition to doing what they were authorized by statute to do, in the matter of issuing bonds for railroad purposes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>did something that they were <em>not </em>authorized to do. <em>Smartle </em>v. <em>Penhallow, </em>2 Lord Raymond, 1000; <em>State </em>v. <em>Board of Ed., </em>35 Ohio St., 519; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gas Co., </em>37 Ohio St., 45; <em>Lougee </em>v. <em>State, </em>11 Ohio, 68.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-6\">This ease was affirmed and followed, at the same term of the court, in <em>Bonsal </em>v. <em>State, </em>11 Ohio, 72, and in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State, </em>11 Ohio, 276, and afterwards in <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>State, </em>7 Ohio St., 107; <em>Eldora </em>v. <em>Burlingame, </em>62 Iowa, 32; <em>Harbaugh v.

It is a fundamental principle of equity that \u201che who comes into equity must come with clean hands.\u201d Then, too, another principle of equity is that \u201che who seeks equity must do equity.\u201d And here the city, in violation of both these principles, not only seeks equitable relief, but asks relief of a kind that courts of equity will never grant, \u2014 the enforcement of a forfeiture. We say enforcement of a forfeiture, because this is the practical effect of a decree enjoining the company from charging more for gas than is authorized to be charged by the ordinance of September 18,1900, and from charging for gas what it is authorized to charge by the second section of the ordinance of February 11, 1895. <em>Pugh </em>v. <em>Electric Light </em>Co., 10 Circ. Dec., 573; 19 C. C. R., 594.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-6\">The principle established by this decision is sustained and applied in the case of <em>Mayor of Macon </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>62 Georgia, 221.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-7\">Again, while these provisions of the ordinance of September 18, 1900, are so unreasonable as to render it void, it is subject to another objection that is to our mind equally fatal to its validity. The city by the second section of this ordinance delegates to each individual consumer of gas the. power to determine for himself, \u2014 that is within certain prescribed limits-the price to be paid for it; and this, the city cannot legally do. A municipal corporation is not authorized to delegate to individuals the power given to it by the statute to regulate the prices to be charged for gas. The power thus vested in council is a discretionary one, and it is an unlawful exercise of such power to delegate it to any party or person, even though he may be an officer of the city itself, much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>less to an individual whose interests are directly opposed to the interests of the company from which Ms supply of gas is to be purchased.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-5\">The rule, that power conferred upon a municipal corporation by the statute or its charter, as the case may be, which requires the exercise of judgment and discretion, cannot be delegated by it, is fully settled by authority. 1 Dillon on Municipal Corp. (4 ed.), Sec. 96; <em>Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>Minneapolis, </em>36 Minnesota, 159; <em>East St. Louis </em>v. <em>Wehrung, </em>50 Ill., 28; <em>Franke </em>v. <em>Water Supply Co., 88 </em>Ky., 467.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b214-6\"><em>John O.

And under and by virtue of it said gas company acquired vested rights which could not be taken away or impaired by any subsequent action of said city, without the consent of said gas company.

Such obligations rest upon all persons, whether natural or artificial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-5\">Corporations, as much as individuals, are bound to good faith and fair dealing, and the rule is well settled that they cannot by their acts, representatives, or silence, involve others in onerous engagements, and then turn around and disavow their acts, and defeat the just expectations which their own conduct has superinduced. <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>74 U.

It is now very well settled that a corporation cannot avail itself of the defense of <em>ultra vires </em>when the contract has been in good faith fully performed by the other party, and the corporation has had the full benefit of the performance of its contract. <em>Whitney Arms Co. </em>v. <em>Barlow, </em>63 N.

the language referred to is as follows: \u201cAnd when the said gas is furnished by meters the rent or price of said meter shall not exceed,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-7\">This language implies that gas may be furnished in other ways, and it is an admitted fact that gas may be furnished in other ways, and it is an admitted fact that gas was furnished almost exclusively by the \u201cflat rate\u201d from the start, for which there was never any regulation of price until council passed the ordinance of September 18, 1900.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-8\">If the city council had no power the effect would be that the gas company, after having a rate established for it by one method, could then arbitrarily inflict another and entirely different one on the people.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-9\">The ordinance of February 11, 1895, in so far as it attempts to regulate the price of natural gas for the time fixed therein is in contravention of section 2479 of the Revised Statutes, and therefore absolutely void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-10\">Our claim in regard to this question is, that municipal corporations have no powers, except those which are delegated in express words, or which are necessarily implied, and that the power to regulate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>price of gas for a period of years granted by Sec. 2479, Rev.

It would plainly be a violation of this section for council to pass an ordinance regulating the price for a period to begin five or ten years in the future. How then can a court draw a line defining just how far in the future a city council may go in fixing the beginning of the ten year term?</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-5\">If council has the power to make such a regulation, the term thereof to begin <em>six months </em>in the future, it is not delegated to it in <em>express words </em>by section 2479 of the Revised Statutes, neither is it <em>necessarily implied, </em>in accordance with the rule laid down in <em>Ravenna </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-6\">It would certainly border on the ridiculous to claim that the right to make the ten year term in a gas contract begin six months in the future is \u201cessential to the very life of the corporation,\u201d yet that would be, in effect, the construction placed on the law should the plaintiff in error prevail in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-7\">If there is a <em>doubt </em>that council possessed the power to cause the ten year period to begin six months in the future, then that doubt must be resolved against the corporation and in favor of the public. <em>Goblet Co. </em>v. <em>Findlay, </em>3 Circ.

A forfeiture presupposes a right. If there was no valid contract under section 2479 of the Revised Statutes, or if estoppel does not in effect confer a right, there can be no question of forfeiture in the case. We have argued the question as to the validity of the contract under section 2479, Revised Statutes, contending that it was illegal and <em>ultra vires.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-10\">The remaining question is, does the doctrine of estoppel assist the company?</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-11\">1.

If this were so -it would not follow that this latter ordinance is valid. The power conferred on the council of any city or village by sections 2478 and 2479 is the power to fix the maximum price at which the company may sell gas. This is the obvious meaning and intent of these sections when read together. It is true that section 2479 contains these words; \u201cIn case the council fixes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>the <em>minimum </em>price,\u201d etc.; but it is clear from the preceding section that the purpose of the legislature was not to prevent a gas company from selling gas as low as it might, but to protect the public from the hardships of excessive charge, and therefore the council is authorized to fix the limit above which the gas company cannot go. We may apply here the rule of statutory construction that \u201cwhen the real design of the legislature in ordaining a statute, although it be not precisely expressed, is yet plainly perceivable, or ascertained with reasonable certainty, the language of the statute must be given such a construction as will carry that design into effect, even though in so doing the exact letter of the law be sacrificed, or although the construction be, indeed, contrary to the latter.\u201d Endlich on Statutes, section 295; Sutherland on Statutes, section 323. It is also provided that if the gas company assents to such limitation in writing it then becomes a binding obligation on both the city and the company for ten years and no more. This is the extent of the authority granted to the council, and no other or different power is either expressed or implied. When, therefore, the council undertakes, even in the absence of a prior ordinance, to compel the gas company without its consent to furnish gas in a manner and at a rate entirely at the option of the consumer, it not only transcends the power conferred by the legislature, but it also undertakes to seize private property without due process of law. The decree of the circuit court was, therefore, erroneous in granting a mandatory injunction against the plaintiff in error, in accordance with the prayer of the defendant in error, enforcing the ordinance of September 18, 1900, although the company had not only refused to assent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>thereto, but had utterly repudiated it and challenged the right of council to enact it.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">But is it a just contention that the original ordinance, that of February 11, 1895, which was assented to by the company, is invalid? We think that it is not. It is argued that this ordinance is within the inhibition of section 1691 of the Revised Statutes, which provides that \u201cthe council shall not enter into any contract which is not to go into full operation during the term for which all the members of such council are elected.\u201d The context, Revised Statutes, section 1690, shows that the contracts referred to in section 1691 are contracts for <em>\u201cservices </em>performed, <em>and supplies </em>furnished <em>for the corporation.\u201d </em>It is also apparent that in regard to contracts with gas companies, or rather ordinances regulating the price of gas, it is \u201cotherwise provided in other divisions of this title,\u201d namely, in Revised Statutes, section 2479. This objection to the ordinance may, therefore, be dismissed without further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">It is also urged with great earnestness that section 2 of the ordinance of February 11, 1895, violates Revised Statutes, section 2479, because it provides \u201cThat said company, its successors and assigns, shall for a period of ten years from the first day of September, 1895, be entitled to charge,\u201d etc. It is argued that inasmuch as the ordinance was passed February 11, 1895, and by its own terms was in force and took effect from and after its passage and legal promulgation, the provision of section 2 of the ordinance was in effect a fixing of the price of gas for a period exceeding, ten years, and therefore <em>ultra vires. </em>This argument proceeds upon the assumption that the period of ten years must begin to run on the date at which the ordinance was passed and went into effect. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Upon this premise it is contended that the price of gas is fixed by that ordinance for a period beginning on February 11, 1895, and extending to ten years from September 1, 1895, and hence is invalid. But this assumption is not only opposed to the express language of the ordinance which provides for a period of ten years beginning on September 1,1895, and ending September 1, 1905; but it ignores settled rules of statutory construction, first, the legislative intent, as already shown, when it can be ascertained with reasonable certainty, must prevail, and, second, there is no legal objection to different provisions of the same statute taking effect at different times at the will of the legislature. <em>Plummer </em>v. <em>J ones, </em>84 Me., 58; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Charlestown, </em>114 Mass., 214; <em>Workman </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>118 Mass., 168; <em>Rushville </em>v. <em>Rushville Natural Gas Co., </em>132 Ind., 575; Sutherland on Statutes, section 107. It is the manifest intention of the council which passed this ordinance to fix the price of gas for the period of ten years only, beginning on September 1, 1895, and since the council might legally prescribe that section 2 should take effect at a later date than the passage of the ordinance, we find no just reason for holding that such section is in any manner in conflict with Revised Statutes, section 2479.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">It is also urged that the ordinance of February 1J, 1895, is invalid because it does not reserve the right to purchase the gas plant and its appurtenances during the existence of the contract, as required by Revised Statutes, section 2485. When we take into consideration the history of this, section and its language, it seems to us very clear that it applies only to the purchase of gas works, for the manufacture and supply of artificial gas. It was enacted long before natural gas became an article of commerce and included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>only gas <em>works </em>for the manufacture and supply of such gas as was then used for illuminating purposes. It has not been amended and it therefore cannot.be presumed that the legislative intention has been enlarged. Counsel for the defendant in error seem to think it difficult to explain why the section of the Revised Statutes now under consideration does not apply to natural gas contracts while it is insisted Revised Statutes, section 2479, does so apply. The explanation is that section 2479 is plainly a limitation on the general power conferred in section 2478, which has been amended so as to expressly include natural gas companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">It has been suggested by counsel for the defendant in error that if section 2 of the ordinance of February 11, 1895, is valid at all, it is only valid in respect to meter rates and that it did not exhaust the power of the council, under section 2478, to fix \u201cflat rates\u201d or non-meter rates. This theory ignores the fact that the power of the council is to regulate the price only of gas furnished and that when that has been done according to one standard, and accepted, it cannot be altered without the consent of the company within ten years by fixing another standard which may affect the limit of price previously fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The conclusion, therefore, is that the ordinance of February 11, 1895, is valid and that the ordinance of September 18, 1900, is invalid, unless accepted in writing by the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The judgment of the circuit court will, therefore, be reversed, and speaking for myself only I think that, logically, we should stop there; but an order will be made that the plaintiff in error shall have the option to accept or reject the ordinance passed September 18, 1900, and if it elects to furnish gas at \u201cflat rates\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>it must do so according to tbe provisions, of tbe ordinance of September 18, 1.900, and that the company be enjoined from hereafter exacting contracts for \u201cflat-rates\u201d from consumers of gas, or enforcing such contracts hereafter made, except in accordance with the ordinance of September 18, 1900.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b230-6\">Burket, Spear and Shauck, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b230-7\">Minshall, C.
