Miller from his job after fifteen years of employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Miller alleges that he was discriminated against on the basis of his age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-23\">At trial, the district judge instructed the jury that it could return a verdict for Miller only if he proved that age was \u201cthe sole cause\u201d of INA\u2019s decision. After the jury returned a verdict in INA\u2019s favor, Miller appealed, asserting that the district court improperly charged the jury regarding his burden of proof. We hold that in ADEA cases that do not qualify for a burden shifting charge under <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989), district courts should instruct the jury that the plaintiffs burden is to prove that age played a role in the employer\u2019s decisionmaking process and that it had a determinative effect on the outcome of that process. Because Miller should not have been required to prove that age was the sole cause of INA\u2019s decision, we conclude that he is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Miller was hired in 1975 as an assistant to INA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. In that position, he directed INA\u2019s reinsurance operations at the Newark Reinsurance Company, created a financial processing service center, and directed the production of summary financial documents. After serving as Vice President and Director of INA\u2019s Special Risk Facility, Miller was promoted to Senior Vice President, Field Operations. He created a new organization, managed a $200 million budget, and supervised over 8,000 employees. At this point in his career, Miller was compensated at pay grade sixty-one and his superior consistently evaluated his performance as exceeding expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">After his promotion to Senior Vice President, Miller was asked to join a special team of executives called IMPACT. IMPACT\u2019S mission was to identify major strategic issues and market strategies for INA\u2019s Property and Casualty Division. Caleb Fowler, Chief Financial Officer of the Property and Casualty Division, and Richard Hoag, then Chief of Human Resources, indicated that they would find Miller a permanent position at the conclusion of the project. When IMPACT concluded in late 1984, Miller was assigned to a special project on reinsurance collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Upon completing the special project on reinsurance collection, Miller was appointed to the position of Senior Vice President, Finance and Administration in the Underwriting Division. In this position, Miller managed four departments, handled complaints from agents and regulatory agencies, prepared state filings and annual budgets, and managed a $70 million annual budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">In late 1988, Miller\u2019s supervisor, Jack Morrison, advised Miller that he should search for another job because his position might be eliminated. In March of 1989, Miller\u2019s new superior, Nord Bjorke, informed Miller that his position was eliminated and sent him to Richard Hoag to receive a special assignment reducing real estate costs in the Property and Casualty Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">One year later, Hoag informed Miller that, despite his success in reducing real estate costs, his position as \u201creal estate czar\u201d was being terminated. Hoag advised Miller that he could assist Robert O\u2019Neil, head of the Corporate Real Estate Department, with special projects. In November of 1990, Miller was informed that this position was being eliminated and that he would be terminated at the end of December. At the time he was terminated, Miller was fifty-eight years old and had been downgraded to pay grade fifty-nine. At no time during 1990 did company officials apprise Miller of five vacancies at the company for which he might have applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">The first vacancy was for the position of Vice President, Filing and Regulation. The company announced that Darrell DeMoss, age forty-two, had been selected. Miller had not known of the position and contends that he was qualified for it because, as Senior Vice President, Finance and Administration, he supervised the Filing and Regulation function. INA asserts that Miller was not considered because the position required legal analysis and Richard Franklin, the hiring manager for this position, decided to hire an attorney. Miller notes, however, that his name was not included on the list of nonlaw-yer candidates who were considered but disqualified, and that the previous Vice President, Filing and Regulation, was not a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">The second vacancy was in the position of General Manager of CIGNA Reinsurance Company, United Kingdom. Among the desired qualifications were \u201c[wjork experience with either United Kingdom accounting practices or reinsurance accounting practices and principles.\u201d App. at 712. Miller asserts that this position involved the same responsibilities he had when he supervised the Newark Reinsurance Company. James Godorecci, who was in charge of hiring for the position, acknowledged that he wrote the job qualifications with Michael Durkin, age thirty-five, in mind and that he never considered Miller for the position. INA contends that Miller lacked the desired academic credentials, work experience, and knowledge of United Kingdom accounting practices, although Miller testified that when he expressed interest in the position, Godorecci\u2019s superior told Miller he was \u201cover qualified.\u201d App. at 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The third vacancy was for the position of Senior Vice President, Finance Systems and Administration, in the Claims Department. Qualifications desired for the position included: broad knowledge and experience in the property and casualty business; knowledge of financial measures and objectives; demonstrated credibility and the ability to work with other managers; skill in influencing managers and implementing strategy; and effective verbal and written skills. Miller contends he satisfied these requirements because of his management experience. James Engle, the hiring manager for this position, testified Miller was not qualified because he did not have a strong math and statistical background, was not familiar with loss control and statistical monitors, and lacked credibility among the actuaries. The company asserts that Victor DiFeliee, age thirty-eight, was better qualified for the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The fourth vacancy, for the position of Head of Strategy Implementation, was filled by Ronald Peters, age forty-nine. The company conceded that Miller was qualified for the job, but maintained that Peters was better qualified. Although it was a temporary assignment, when his work in this position was completed Peters was retained by the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The fifth vacancy was for the position of Vice President, Property and Casualty Marketing. Hiring manager Thomas Cobb appointed Cynthia Cole-Dougherty, age thirty-eight. Job qualifications included an ability to conduct market studies, market research, competitive analyses, and segmentation studies. INA asserts that, although Cynthia Cole-Dougherty did not have insurance experience, one of the primary considerations in the hiring decision was a desire to hire from outside both the company and the industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The evidence at trial also focused on the nature of INA\u2019s hiring and promotion deci-sionmaking process. Human resource personnel testified about the company\u2019s formal placement process available for positions above pay grade fifty-four (\u201cthe 54 + placement process\u201d). A department manager using the 54 + placement process would receive assistance from an assigned human resource contact who would act as the manager\u2019s agent within the- company, helping to locate, sort through, and evaluate potential candidates for the position. Open positions above grade fifty-four were not publicly posted and a candidate could only access information about these openings through direct management contact. The 54 + placement process was not mandatory, however, and many of the managers who testified at trial explained that they had in fact filled their management vacancy through an informal process by assessing their own needs, reflecting on the qualifications of their staff members, and initiating contact with potential candidates directly. Richard Morrissey, director of human resources for CIGNA\u2019s property and casualty companies, also testified about the company\u2019s annual organizational review process through which department managers assess the qualifications, potential, and development needs of their staff with an eye toward identifying and developing future high level managers.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">During trial, the district judge asked counsel if Miller\u2019s was a \u201cpretext\u201d or \u201cmixed motives\u201d case. This inquiry made reference to the distinction between employment discrimination cases in which the plaintiff seeks to carry his or her burden by showing that the employer\u2019s tendered reason for the challenged action is a pretext for discrimination<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and cases that qualify for a mixed motives, burden shifting instruction under <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989). Miller\u2019s counsel advised the district court that this was a \u201cpretext\u201d ease. The district judge then \u201cdistribute[d] to counsel the questions [to be used] to submit the case to the jury.\u201d App. at 610. After reviewing those questions, Miller\u2019s counsel stated that she had an objection. Counsel asserted that plaintiffs burden of proof was to establish that age was \u201ca determining factor,\u201d i.e., that it \u201cmade a differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ence\u201d in the employer s decision. App. at 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Notwithstanding this objection, the district judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">To recover under the pretext theory which the plaintiff asserts in this case, the plaintiff must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that his <em>age was the sole cause </em>of defendants\u2019 failure to hire him into vacancies that became available and to terminate his position as a real estate czar in the last of those listings that I\u2019ve put on the page that you have; that he was qualified and rejected for the positions in question <em>solely because of his age.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">If the defendants articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for his rejection, the plaintiff at all times retains the ultimate burden of persuading you that the defendant intentionally discriminated against him because of his age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">* \u2756 Hs * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">The plaintiff under the law must prove that the discriminatory motive was the <em>sole cause </em>of the employment action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">In order to prove pretext, the plaintiff must show that the defendant\u2019s reasons were false and that discrimination was the real reason, however, if you disbelieve the reasons put forth by the defendants to justify their decision, you may but are not required to find intentional discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-11\"># H\u00ed \u2756 %</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-12\">The plaintiff doesn\u2019t have to prove that the employer hated him.... He has to prove that plaintiffs <em>age was the sole determinative factor </em>in the particular employment decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">App. at 673-77 (emphasis added). At the conclusion of the charge, Miller\u2019s counsel renewed her \u201cobjection to ... the verdict sheet ... [and stated that] the question before [the jury was] whether age was <em>a determinative factor </em>according to <em>[Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993) ].\u201d App. at 683 (emphasis added). The district court declined to alter the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-18\">During its deliberations, the jury sent the following message to the district judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-19\">The jury requests clarification on the meaning of defendants\u2019 employment decisions in question #2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-20\">Is the question which we are addressing (regarding discrimination based solely on the plaintiffs age) focused on: a. Mr. Miller not being actively considered \u2014 on the candidate slate, or b. Mr. Miller not being selected as the person to get the job, for each of the jobs \u201ca\u201d through \u201ce\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-21\">App. at 691. In responding to this inquiry, the district judge twice described the issues before the jury in terms of whether the relevant decision of INA had been <em>\u201cbased solely on Mr. Miller\u2019s age.\u2019\u2019 </em>App. at 691-92 (emphasis added). After two days of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict in favor of INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-22\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-23\">We conduct a plenary review when an appellant contends that the instructions to the jury, read as a whole, do not state the correct legal standard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Griffiths v. CIGNA Corp., </em>988 F.2d 457, 462 (3d Cir.) (citing <em>Savarese v. Agriss, </em>883 F.2d 1194, 1202 (3d Cir.1989)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 186, 126 L.Ed.2d 145 (1993). \u201c[W]e will reverse if the instructions were capable of confusing and thereby misleading the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Limbach Co. v. Sheet Metal Workers Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n, </em>949 F.2d 1241, 1259 n. 15 (3d Cir.1991) (in banc)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Like Title VII which prohibits an employer from taking adverse employment actions against an employee \u201cbecause of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l), the ADEA prohibits an employer from taking adverse employment actions against an employee \u201cbecause of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1). Not surprisingly, the ADEA jurisprudence concerning this prohibition has followed the Title VII jurisprudence interpreting the analogous prohibition. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, </em>469 U.S. 111, 121, 105 S.Ct. 613, 621, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985); <em>Seman v. Coplay Cement Co., </em>26 F.3d 428, 432 n. 7 (3d Cir.1994). A district judge in a case under either statute must, of course, instruct the jury in a manner consistent with Congress\u2019 mandate that the adverse employment action must have been taken \u201cbecause of\u2019 the prohibited consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The nature of the causal connection mandated by the use of the phrase \u201cbecause of\u2019 in Title VII was a focus of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in Price <em>Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989). The members of the Court differed as to whether \u201cbecause of\u2019 meant that the forbidden consideration must be a \u201cbut-for\u201d cause (i.e., one without which the adverse employment action would not have been taken) or only that the impermissible consideration must have \u201cplayed a motivating part\u201d in the decision to take that action. <em>See id. </em>at 244, 109 S.Ct. at 1787 (plurality opinion); <em>id. </em>at 262-63, 109 S.Ct. at 1797 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in the judgment). All members of the Court agreed, however, that \u201cbecause of\u2019 did not mean \u201csolely because of.\u201d <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 241, 109 S.Ct. at 1785 (plurality opinion); <em>id. </em>at 284, 109 S.Ct. at 1808 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Justice Brennan, writing for himself and Justices Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens, took the position that \u201cbecause of\u2019 required only a finding that gender or some other prohibited consideration played a part in the decision to take the challenged action. He explained their position in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKv\">We take these words to mean that gender must be irrelevant to employment decisions. To construe the words \u201cbecause of\u2019 as colloquial shorthand for \u201cbut-for causation,\u201d as does Price Waterhouse, is to misunderstand them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">* * * \u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-9\">... The critical inquiry ... is whether gender was a factor in the employment decision at the moment it was made. Moreover, <em>since we know that the words \u201cbecause of\u2019 do not mean \u201csolely because of,\u2019</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> we also know that Title VII meant to condemn even those decisions based on a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate considerations. </em>When, therefore, an employer considers both gender and legitimate factors at the time of making a decision, that decision was \u201cbecause of\u2019 sex and the other, legitimate considerations \u2014 even if we may say later, in the context of litigation, that the decision would have been the same if gender had not been taken into account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">Price <em>Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 240-41, 109 S.Ct. at 1785 (emphasis added and altered from original) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">Justice Kennedy, writing in dissent for himself, the Chief Justice, and Justice Scalia, concluded that \u201cbecause of\u2019 required \u201cbut-for\u201d cause. In doing so, he likewise rejected the suggestion that it was intended to mean \u201csolely because of\u2019:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-13\">By any normal understanding, the phrase \u201cbecause of\u2019 conveys the idea that the motive in question made a difference to the outcome. We use the words this way in everyday speech. And assuming, as the plurality does, that we ought to consider the interpretive memorandum prepared by the statute\u2019s drafters, we find that this is what the words meant to them as well. \u201cTo discriminate is to make a distinction, to make a difference in treatment or favor.\u201d 110 Cong.Rec. 7213 (1964). Congress could not have chosen a clearer way to indicate that proof of liability under Title VII requires a showing that race, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>color, religion, sex, or national origin caused the decision at issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-4\">Our decisions confirm that Title VII is not concerned with the mere presence of impermissible motives; it is directed to employment decisions that result from those motives. The verbal formulae we have used in our precedents are synonymous with but-for causation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">\u2021 \u2021 \u2021 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">We are told ... that but-for cause is not required, since the words \u201cbecause of\u2019 do not mean <em>\u201csolely </em>because of.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 241 [109 S.Ct. at 1785]. <em>No one contends, however, that sex must be the sole cause of a decision before there is a Title VII violation. </em>This is a separate question from whether consideration of sex must be <em>a </em>cause of the decision. Under the accepted approach to causation that I have discussed, sex is a cause for the employment decision whenever, either by itself or in combination with other factors, it made a difference to the decision. <em>Discrimination need not be the sole cause in order for liability to arise, but merely a necessary element of the set of factors that caused the decision, ie., a but-for cause.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\"><em>Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 281-82, 284, 109 S.Ct. at 1807, 1808 (additional emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Justice O\u2019Connor, while concurring in the result reached in Justice Brennan\u2019s plurality opinion, disagreed with the plurality\u2019s reading of \u201cbecause of\u2019 and agreed with that of the dissent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-9\">The legislative history of Title VII bears out what its plain language suggests: a substantive violation of the statute only occurs when consideration of an illegitimate criterion is the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of an adverse employment action. The legislative history makes it clear that Congress was attempting to eradicate discriminatory actions in the employment setting, not mere discriminatory thoughts.... Senator Case, whose views the plurality finds so persuasive elsewhere, responded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-10\">\u201cThe man must do or fail to do something in regard to employment. There must be some specific external act, more than a mental act. Only if he does the act because of the grounds stated in the bill would there be any legal consequences.\u201d [100 Cong.Rec. 7254 (1964).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-12\">Thus, I disagree with the plurality\u2019s dictum that the words \u201cbecause of\u2019 do not mean \u201cbut-for\u201d causation; manifestly they do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHDQ\"><em>Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 262-63, 109 S.Ct. at 1797. In the course of her opinion, Justice O\u2019Connor likened the relevant principles to those involved in <em>Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., </em>429 U.S. 252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977), where the Court held that \u201cthe plaintiff was not required \u2018to prove that the challenged action rested <em>solely </em>on racially discriminatory purposes.\u2019 \u201d 490 U.S. at 268, 109 S.Ct. at 1800 (emphasis supplied) (quoting <em>Village of Arlington Heights, </em>429 U.S. at 265, 97 S.Ct. at 563).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">Finally, Justice White, who also concurred in the judgment of the Court, looked to <em>Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), for guidance in interpreting \u201cbecause of.\u201d In the context of a public employer\u2019s decision not to rehire an employee in part because of his exercise of First Amendment rights, the Court had there \u201crejected a rule of causation that focused \u2018solely on whether protected conduct played a part, \u201csubstantial\u201d or otherwise, in a decision not to rehire.\u2019 \u201d <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 259, 109 S.Ct. at 1795 (quoting <em>Mt. Healthy, </em>429 U.S. at 285, 97 S.Ct. at 575). Under the <em>Mt. Healthy </em>approach, the plaintiff was required to prove only that \u201cthe unlawful motive was a <em>substantial </em>factor in the adverse employment action,\u201d but there could be no liability if the defendant showed that it \u201c \u201cwould have reached the same decision ... even in the absence of the protected conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Mt. Healthy, </em>429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. at 576). A necessary corollary to this approach, according to Justice White, was that a plaintiff does not have \u201cto prove that the illegitimate factor was the only, principal, or true reason for [the employer\u2019s] action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">We find it clear from the opinions in <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>and from the legislative history they cite, that Congress, by using the phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>\u201cbecause of,\u201d did not mean \u201csolely because of.\u201d Even if we did not have this guidance, however, we would be reluctant to attribute to Congress an intention that an employer should be liable if a hiring or discharge decision is based solely on an employee\u2019s age and not liable if the decision is based primarily on the employee\u2019s age but also on the fact that the employee\u2019s supervisor did not like the employee\u2019s personality, hair color, or some other personal trait or conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Having concluded that \u201cbecause of\u2019 does not mean \u201csolely because of,\u201d we now look to the governing precedents to determine the proper jury instruction in an employment discrimination ease that does not qualify for a mixed motives, burden shifting charge under <em>Price Waterhouse.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The Justices concurring in the judgment in <em>Price Waterhouse </em>declined to apply to the situation before them the familiar rules for allocating the burdens of production and persuasion found in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and <em>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>460 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They viewed those cases as \u201cpretext\u201d cases and the case before them as a \u201cmixed motives\u201d case. The Court held that, in cases where the plaintiff offers \u201cdirect evidenee\u201d of unlawful discrimination and the evidence as a whole permits a conclusion that both permissible and impermissible considerations played a role in the employer\u2019s decision, the plaintiff need only show that the unlawful motive was a substantial motivating factor in that decision. If the finder of fact concludes that the plaintiff has carried this burden, the burden of persuasion shifts to the defendant to prove that the unlawful motive was not a but-for cause, i.e., that the same action would have been taken, because of legitimate considerations, in the absence of the unlawful motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">The members of the Court concurring in the judgment in <em>Price Waterhouse </em>reached this result by different routes. Justices Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens read the statute as imposing liability in any situation where the unlawful motive was a \u201cmotivating\u201d factor, but recognized an \u201caffirmative defense\u201d where the employer shows that the same actions would have been taken in the absence of the unlawful motive. <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 244-45, 250, 109 S.Ct. at 1787-88, 1790. Justice O\u2019Connor agreed with the three dissenters that the statute required but-for cause as a predicate to liability, but favored a burden shifting rule for cases in which the plaintiff \u201cshow[s] by direct evidence that an illegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in the decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276, 109 S.Ct. at 1804. In such cases, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>burden shifts \u201cto the employer to justify its decision,\u201d \u2014 \u201cto show that the decision would have been the same absent discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). \u201c[Wjhere a plaintiff has made this type of strong showing of illicit motivation, the factfinder is entitled to presume that the employer\u2019s discriminatory animus made a difference in the outcome, absent proof to the contrary from the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Justice White found it unnecessary \u201cto get into semantic discussions on whether <em>Mt Healthy ... </em>creates an affirmative defense.\u201d <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 259, 109 S.Ct. at 1795. He agreed with Justice O\u2019Connor, however, that the plaintiff in <em>Price Waterhouse </em>had made the requisite showing that sex was a substantial factor in the employer\u2019s decision and that the \u201cburden of persuasion then should have shifted to Price Waterhouse to prove\u201d the same decision would have been made absent the unlawful motive. <em>Id. </em>at 259-60, 109 S.Ct. at 1795.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">For present purposes, there are two important things to note about the several opinions in <em>Price Waterhouse. </em>First, a majority of the members of the Court did not endorse the plurality\u2019s view that Title VII imposed liability whenever a prohibited factor played a motivating role in the challenged decision. Justices O\u2019Connor and White and the three dissenters rejected, in the words of Justice White, \u201ca rule of causation that focused solely on whether [an impermissible motive] played a part, \u2018substantial\u2019 or otherwise, in a decision.\u201d 490 U.S. at 259, 109 S.Ct. at 1795 (internal quotation omitted). Second, while the holding of the Court fashioned a special rule reducing the plaintiffs burden of persuasion in a defined category of Title VII individual discrimination cases, a majority of the Court endorsed views of Title VII that would leave plaintiffs in other individual discrimination eases with the burden of showing but-for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">All members of the Court now seem to agree that a showing of but-for causation by the plaintiff is required in ADEA cases that do not call for special treatment under <em>Price Waterhouse. </em>In <em>Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993), the plaintiff, like the plaintiff here, claimed that he had been discharged because of his age in violation of the ADEA. The Supreme Court was called upon to address the relationship between the standard of ordinary liability under the ADEA and the standard of liability for liquidated damages under the provision of that Act authorizing such damages for \u201cwillful\u201d violations. With respect to the former, Justice O\u2019Connor, writing for a unanimous Court, reviewed the case law applicable to disparate treatment (i.e., individual discrimination) cases and concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-8\">Whatever the employer\u2019s decisionmaking process, a disparate treatment claim cannot succeed unless the employee\u2019s protected trait actually played a role in that process and had a determinative influence on the outcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-9\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 113 S.Ct. at 1706.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">With respect to the standard of liability for liquidated damages, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-11\">We therefore reaffirm that the <em>Thurston </em>definition of \u201cwillful\u201d \u2014 that the employer either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute \u2014 applies to all disparate treatment cases under the ADEA. Once a \u201cwillful\u201d violation has been shown, the employee need not additionally ... prove that age was the predominant rather than a determinative factor in the employment decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-12\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 113 S.Ct. at 1710.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-13\">We find support in <em>Hazen Paper </em>for our earlier conclusion that \u201cbecause of\u2019 does not mean \u201csolely because of.\u201d If an ADEA plaintiff need not show that age was \u201cthe predominant factor\u201d in order to establish liability for liquidated damages, surely such a plaintiff does not have to show that age was the sole cause of the challenged decision in order to establish a right to normal forms of relief. We also believe <em>Hazen Paper </em>provides an authoritative answer to our second inquiry. A plaintiff in an ADEA ease who does not qualify for a burden shifting instruction under <em>Price Waterhouse </em>has the burden of persuading the trier of fact by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a \u201cbut-for\u201d causal connection between the plaintiffs age and the employer\u2019s adverse action \u2014 i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>that age \u201cactually played a role in [the employer\u2019s decisionmaking] process and had a determinative influence on the outcome\u201d of that process. <em>Hazen Paper, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 113 S.Ct. at 1706.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">We find further support for our holding in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). That decision makes clear that the trier of fact in a pretext case is not limited to a choice between finding that the alleged discriminatory motive or the employer\u2019s nondiscriminatory explanation was the sole cause of the employment action. At the time we decided <em>Griffiths v. CIGNA Corp., </em>988 F.2d 457 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 114 S.Ct. 186, 126 L.Ed.2d 145 (1993),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it was possible to view all pretext cases as presenting only two possibilities: the fact finder could conclude either that the plaintiff had succeeded in proving that the employer\u2019s explanation was a pretext for discrimination, or that the plaintiff had failed to so prove. Under this view, if the plaintiff proved the employer\u2019s proffered reason was pretextual, the trier of fact presumed, as a matter of law, that the impermissible cause alleged by plaintiff was the sole cause of the employer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\"><em>St. Mary\u2019s </em>instructs that this bipolar view of pretext cases is inaccurate. A finding that the employer\u2019s nondiscriminatory explanation is a pretext permits, but does not require, the trier of fact to conclude that the employer discriminated against the plaintiff based on the ground alleged. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014 , \u2014 , 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2749, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">In <em>St. Mary\u2019s, </em>the plaintiff, an African-American, had been demoted and ultimately discharged by his employer. He brought suit under Title VII, asserting that the employer\u2019s actions were the result of racial animus. The employer insisted it took these actions because the plaintiff on a number of occasions had permitted his subordinates to break institutional rules, and on one occasion had threatened his superior. <em>See Hicks v. St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr., </em>756 F.Supp. 1244, 1246-48 (E.D.Mo.1991). The district court, as the trier of fact, found that the threatening conduct and rules violations had occurred, but concluded that neither these events nor the plaintiffs race was the real reason for plaintiffs demotion and discharge. Rather, the district court concluded that \u201calthough [the] plaintiff ha[d] proven the existence of a crusade to terminate him, he [had] not proven that the crusade was racially rather than personally motivated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-16\">The court of appeals, viewing pretext cases as bipolar, ruled that, once the plaintiff proved the employer\u2019s proffered reasons were pretextual, he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Hicks v. St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr., </em>970 F.2d 487, 492 (8th Cir.1992). The Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the trier of fact\u2019s rejection of the employer\u2019s proffered reason for its action did not compel the conclusion that race was the sole cause of the employment decision. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr., </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2749-51. Rather, the record evidence supported three possible causes: race, threats and violations of the employer\u2019s rules, and personal animosity. The Supreme Court ruled that the trier of fact was entitled to draw from the record evidence whatever inferences that evidence would support. Since the district court concluded that the explanation advanced by the employer was a pretext, it could have further inferred that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>there was an impermissible motive to hide. It was not required to do so, however. If the district court inferred that personal animosity was the cause of the demotion and discharge, that, too, was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">We think it clear from the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>St. Mary\u2019s </em>that the trier of fact in a pretext case, where the record will support it, may choose not to accept either party\u2019s litigating position as reflecting the whole truth. This may, as in <em>St. Mary\u2019s, </em>take the form of a conclusion that the adverse action was taken for a reason other than the reasons urged by the parties. It may also take the form of a conclusion that the alleged discrimination and the employer\u2019s nondiscriminatory explanation both played a role in the employer\u2019s decision. If the plaintiff, for example, argues that he or she was discharged because of age and the employer insists that it was because of the plaintiffs record of absenteeism, the trier of fact may conclude that the plaintiffs absenteeism record played a part, but that the plaintiff would not have been fired if he or she were twenty years younger.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In some eases, the evidence may be such that the use of \u201csole factor\u201d or \u201csole cause\u201d to describe the plaintiffs burden would be harmless error. We perceive no reason, however, why a trial court would choose to use those phrases in any ease. Even in those rare cases where the evidence appears to present the jury with only a bipolar choice, such phrases misstate the law and hold a potential for creating a misunderstanding in the minds of the jury that may outlive their service in that particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">In most age discrimination cases that get to the jury, the record will support an inference that both a legitimate and an illegitimate reason played a role in the employer\u2019s decision and the charge must provide for the possibility that the jury will find the employer\u2019s decision to be the product of more than one consideration. In those cases, the court must charge, in accordance with <em>Hazen Paper, </em>that the plaintiffs burden is to show that the prohibited consideration played a role in the decisionmaking process and that it had a determinative influence on the outcome of that process.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">In this case, the district court\u2019s repeated reference to \u201csole cause\u201d and \u201csole factor\u201d was not harmless error. Miller alleged that because of his age, he was not selected for various open high level management positions for which he was qualified and that thereafter he was terminated. For each of the open positions his employer offered evidence to show that Miller was not qualified or that he was less qualified than the candidate ultimately selected. Based on the evidence presented at trial, a jury could well have concluded that both Miller\u2019s and the employer\u2019s explanations were accurate \u2014 that Miller was qualified for one or more of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>open positions, that the employer\u2019s promotion and hiring decisionmaking process contained a bias in favor of younger employees, and that Miller\u2019s credentials did not sufficiently distinguish him from the competing candidates to overcome this bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">For example, with.respect to the vacancy for general manager with CIGNA Reinsurance Company, United Kingdom (the \u201cCIG-NA UK position\u201d), the manager responsible for filling that position testified that he wrote the job description with Michael Durkin, the successful candidate, in mind; that Durkin had most of the qualities needed for that position; and that Durkin had more experience than Miller in reinsurance and accounting work. A jury who credited the employer\u2019s evidence could therefore conclude that Durkin\u2019s promotion was a legitimate hiring decision. However, Miller testified that he had extensive reinsurance experience as well as substantially more management experience and skills than Durkin. \u2014 one of the qualifications for the position. Durkin had managed a staff of only twenty employees, while Miller had managed much larger groups. Miller also testified that when he expressed interest in the CIGNA UK position the president of that division told him he was \u201coverqualified.\u201d Miller also offered evidence that Durkin had obtained his reinsurance experience in part through his manager\u2019s desire to cross-train and develop him for this type of managerial promotion. Miller additionally points out that many of the INA managers responsible for the hiring decisions at issue, including the manager who filled the CIGNA UK position, testified that they eschewed the company\u2019s formal inter-departmental placement process available for positions above grade fifty-four for an informal and personal decisionmaking process. This testimony lends credence to Miller\u2019s theory that the promotion and hiring decisions for upper level management positions were susceptible to age-animus. Accordingly, a jury crediting Miller\u2019s evidence could infer that the decision not to consider or select him for the CIGNA UK position was based on age.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Because INA\u2019s and Miller\u2019s explanations were not inherently contradictory, however, it would have been possible for the jury to find that the company considered both Miller\u2019s qualifications and his age, and that both factored into the relevant hiring decisions. Thus, the jury could have reasonably concluded that Miller was less than ideally qualified for a particular position and that this was a factor in INA\u2019s decisionmaking process. At the same time, it could reasonably have concluded that INA\u2019s decisionmakers were biased in favor of younger workers and a younger person with Miller\u2019s credentials would have been assigned to the post.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The ADEA\u2019s protection against age discrimination is not limited to perfectly qualified employees. As the court observed in <em>Shager v. Upjohn Co., </em>913 F.2d 398, 403 (7th Cir.1990): \u201cThe statute does not protect merely the older worker who is perfect from the standpoint of his employer; such a worker needs no protection except from irrational employers, and they are rare. It protects, as a practical matter, the imperfect older worker from being treated worse than the imperfect younger one.\u201d <em>Cf. Mardell v. Harleysville Life Ins. Co., </em>31 F.3d 1221, 1233 (3d Cir.1994) (\u201c[NJeither Title VII nor ADEA strips a wrongdoing employee of his or her entitlement to protection against unlawful discrimination.\u201d). Despite his imperfect credentials, Miller should have prevailed if he would not have been passed over but for his age. The district court\u2019s \u201csole cause\u201d charge did not permit the jury to find in Miller\u2019s favor on this basis. It follows that Miller is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">We hold that in an ADEA case which does not qualify for a burden shifting instruction under <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>a district court should instruct the jury that the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that age played a role in the employer\u2019s decisionmaking process and that it had a determinative effect on the outcome of that process.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Since the district court instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>that age must be shown to be the sole cause of the employer\u2019s decision and since the record would support a conclusion that, while other factors played a role, age was a determinative factor, we will reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-14\">.

We are here, of course, describing cases in which the challenged action of the employer may be the product of two or more motives. It is important to understand, however, that these cases do not fall within the legal categoty of \"mixed motives\u201d cases reserved for special treatment under <em>Price Waterhouse. As </em>we explained more fully in <em>Griffiths, </em>988 F.2d at 470, and <em>Hook v. Ernst &amp; Young, </em>28 F.3d 366, 373-76 (3d Cir.1994), \"mixed motives\u201d cases are cases not only where the record would support a conclusion that both legitimate and illegitimate factors played a role in the employer's decision, but where the plaintiff's evidence of discrimination is sufficiently \"direct\u201d to shift the burden of proof to the employer on the issue of whether the same decision would have been made in the absence of the discriminatory animus. The term of art \"mixed motives\" is thus misleading because it describes only a small subset of all employment discrimination cases in which the employer may have had more than one motive. Under <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>the correct wording of a causation instruction to a jury differs depending on whether the case before the court is a \u201cmixed motives\u201d or a \u201cpretext\u201d case <em>as those categories are defined in that case. </em>Only in a \"mixed motives\u201d ADEA case is the plaintiff entitled to an instruction that he or she need show only that the forbidden motive played a role, i.e., was <em>\"a </em>motivating factor.\u201d Even then, the instruction must be followed by an explanation that the defendant may escape liability by showing that the challenged action would have been taken in the absence of the forbidden motive. <em>See Griffiths v. CIGNA Corp., </em>988 F.2d at 472. In all other ADEA disparate treatment cases, the jury should be instructed that the plaintiff may meet his or her burden only by showing that age played a role in the employer's decisionmaking process and that it had a determinative effect on the outcome of that process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b692-5\">. In the course of this opinion, we have relied on Title VII cases because the development of the relevant case law under the two statutes prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1991 followed parallel courses. Section 107 of the 1991 Civil Rights Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(m), provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>that \"an unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that [a prohibited consideration] was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice.\u201d The substantive provisions of the 1991 Act that amended Title VII did not amend the ADEA, and Miller does not contend that section 107 is applicable to ADEA cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b693-4\">GREENBERG, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Az49\">concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">To put it succinctly, the question before us is the effect of <em>Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993), and <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v.

The majority correctly concludes that \u201cin ADEA eases that do not qualify for a burden shifting charge under <em>Price Waterhouse ... </em>district courts should instruct the jury that the plaintiffs burden is to prove that age played a role in the employer\u2019s decisionmaking process and that it had a determinative effect on the outcome of that process.\u201d Opinion at 589. I thus join in the Introduction and Parts I, II, VI and VII of the majority Opinion. I write separately for three reasons: First, I cannot accept portions of the majority\u2019s analysis in Parts III, IV and V. Second, the area of employment discrimination law is cursed with elusive terms like \u201cmixed motives\u201d and \u201cpretext,\u201d and with numerous presumptions, inferences and burden-shifting rules. Those terms and rules historically often have taken on lives of their own, independent of their connection to the underlying theories of liability that gave them birth. Thus, a \u201cmixed motives\u201d case is not about mixed motives, and a \u201cpretext\u201d case has little to do with pretext. I believe the time has come to clarify the current status of theories of ADEA liability, and to dispense with unhelpful monikers whenever possible. Thus, unlike the in banc majority, I would dispense altogether with the terms \u201cpretext\u201d and \u201cmixed motives\u201d and hold explicitly that the same standard applies to all disparate treatment eases. Finally, I believe that the entire debate over \u201cbut-for\u201d causation makes something out of nothing, and that district courts should feel free to instruct juries in all ADEA eases that a plaintiff does not succeed unless but-for causation is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-18\">In <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), the Supreme Court first set forth the order of proof in disparate treatment cases, and the Court elaborated upon and explained the framework in <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). In the later case, the Court described the process as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-19\">First, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence a prima facie ease of discrimination. Second, if the plaintiff succeeds in proving the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant \u2018to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee\u2019s rejection.\u2019 <em>[McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S.], at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824. Third, should the defendant carry this burden, the plaintiff must then have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 804, 93 S.Ct., at 1825.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-20\"><em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 252-53, 101 S.Ct. at 1093. <em>Burdine </em>repeatedly speaks about the employer\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d reason for the discharge, <em>see id. </em>at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095, and therefore, the opinion was cast in either-or terms. <em>Post-Burdine </em>cases reaffirmed this proposition. <em>See, e.g., N.L.R.B. v. Transportation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number><em>Management Corp., </em>462 U.S. 393, 400 n. 6, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 2473 n. 5, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983) (in <em>Burdine, </em>\u201c[t]he Court discussed only the situation in which the issue is whether either illegal or legal motives, but not both, were the \u2018true\u2019 motives behind the decision\u201d); <em>United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, </em>460 U.S. 711, 717, 718, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 1483, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983) (\u201ca plaintiff prevail[s] when at the third stage of a Title VII trial he demonstrates that the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason given by the employer is in fact not the true reason for the employment decision\u201d) (Blackmun, J., concurring). Thus, the pre-Price <em>Water-house </em>jurisprudence \u201cassumed ... that a single impulse moves the employer who discriminates,\u201d <em>see </em>Theodore Y. Blumoff &amp; Harold S. Lewis, Jr., <em>The Reagan Court and Title VII: A Common-Law Outlook on a Statutory Task, </em>69 N.C.L.Rev. 1, 47 (1990), and that all disparate treatment claims could be analyzed under Burdine\u2019s either-or pretext framework. This did not mean that the Court foreclosed liability when more than one cause motivated the adverse employment decision, but only that the employment discrimination cases coming before the Court were argued under the <em>Burdine </em>pretext framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Price <em>Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989), changed the employment discrimination liability landscape, but not in the way the in bane majority suggests. In my view, the majority confuses Price Waterhouse\u2019s general holding that plaintiffs may obtain relief despite their inability to fit their proofs into Burdine\u2019s pretext framework, with the standard for causation in cases that do proceed under <em>Burdine. </em>The majority correctly points out that \u201c[a]ll members of the [Price <em>Waterhouse </em>] Court agreed ... that \u2018because of did not mean \u2018solely because of.\u2019 \u201d Opinion at 592. But the quotations from the Price <em>Waterhouse </em>opinions demonstrate only that in that case, all members of the Court agreed that plaintiffs were not without a remedy if their proofs did not fit into the classic <em>Burdine </em>mold. Rather, all members of the Court agreed that when there is no one true reason behind the discharge, the employer in certain circumstances still could be liable. The Price <em>Waterhouse </em>dissent suggested interpreting <em>Burdine </em>so that it could cover all claims of disparate treatment. But a majority of the Court chose to retain Burdine\u2019s framework for pretext cases, and to provide a separate theory of liability, together with a separate order of proof, to apply in cases involving both legitimate and illegitimate reasons for the adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Thus, <em>Price Waterhouse </em>does not support the conclusion that in a pretext case, a plaintiff need not prove that age was <em>the </em>determinative factor in the employment decision. Quite the contrary, a majority of the justices explicitly reaffirmed Burdine\u2019s assumption that in a pretext case, as opposed to a mixed motives case, the illicit reason must be <em>the </em>determinative cause. Crucial passages in the various opinions, that the in banc majority does not cite, demonstrate that a majority of the <em>Price Waterhouse </em>court viewed <em>Bur-dine </em>\u2019s \u201cone or the other\u201d description of pretext liability as still viable in eases proceeding under a pretext theory. Writing for himself as well as Justices Marshall, Black-mun and Stevens, Justice Brennan distinguished <em>Burdine </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">Where a decision was the product of a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate motives ... it simply makes no sense to ask whether the legitimate reason was \u2018the \u201ctrue reason\u201d \u2019 (Brief for Petitioner 20 (emphasis added)) for the decision \u2014 which is the question asked by <em>Burdine. See Transportation Management, </em>supra [462 U.S.], at 400, n. 5, 103 S.Ct., at 2473, n. 5. Oblivious to this last point, the dissent would insist that Burdine\u2019s framework perform work that it was never intended to perform. It would require a plaintiff who challenges an adverse employment decision in which both legitimate and illegitimate considerations played a part to pretend that the decision, in fact, stemmed from a single source \u2014 for the premise of <em>Burdine </em>is that either a legitimate or an illegitimate set of considerations led to the challenged decision. To say that Burdine\u2019s evidentia-ry scheme will not help us decide a ease admittedly involving both kinds of considerations is not to cast aspersions on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>utility of that scheme in the circumstances for which it was designed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Price <em>Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 247, 109 S.Ct. at 1788-89 (plurality opinion). Moreover, in discussing the standards for proving liability in a mixed motives ease, the plurality pointed out that \u201c[i]f the plaintiff fails to satisfy the factfinder that it is more likely than not that a forbidden characteristic played a part in the employment decision, then she may prevail only if she proves, following <em>Burdine, </em>that the employer\u2019s stated reason for its decision is pretextual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247 n. 12, 109 S.Ct. at 1789 n. 12 (plurality opinion). Justice White similarly drew this distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoZ\">The Court has made clear that \u2018mixed-motives\u2019 cases, such as the present one, are different from pretext cases such as <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>and <em>Burdine. </em>In pretext eases, \u2018the issue is whether either illegal or legal motives, but not both, were the \u201ctrue\u201d motives behind the decision.\u2019 <em>NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., </em>462 U.S. 393, 400 n. 5, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 2473 n. 5 [76 L.Ed.2d 667] (1983). In mixed-motives cases, however, there is no one \u2018true\u2019 motive behind the decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 260, 109 S.Ct. at 1796 (White, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">In fact, the <em>Price Waterhouse </em>plurality\u2019s theory of employment discrimination liability necessarily assumed that a plaintiff proceeding under a mixed motives theory could not succeed under a pretext theory. This is because of the following: In a pretext case, the defendant responds to the plaintiffs pri-ma facie case by offering legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for the discharge. The plaintiff then must prove that those reasons are pretextual. If a plaintiff cannot prove that the proffered reasons for the discharge were not in fact real reasons, then by definition the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate pretext, and has failed the third prong of the <em>Burdine </em>test. Assume, however, that the district court is convinced that even though the defendant\u2019s proof has gone unrebutted, the plaintiff nonetheless has proven that age played a role in the adverse employment decision. That is a scenario in which both legitimate and illegitimate factors played a role in the decision. Here, the <em>Price Water-house </em>scenario comes into play, and even though the claim fails under <em>Burdine, </em>the defendant would have the burden of disproving but-for causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Thus, <em>Price Waterhouse </em>is important not because it said anything about the standard for showing pretext liability but because it constituted the first time the Supreme Court explicitly decided that <em>Burdine </em>liability, while alive and well, did not provide the only framework for imposing liability. I believe, then, that the in bane majority is wrong to suggest that the <em>Price Waterhouse </em>majority used \u201cmixed motives\u201d as a \u201cterm of art\u201d that describes \u201conly a small subset of all employment discrimination cases in which the employer may have had more than one motive.\u201d Opinion at 597 n. 9. To be sure, there is language in the various <em>Price Waterhouse </em>opinions addressing the evidence the plaintiff must adduce to prove that the illicit criterion played a role in the decision. But, at least in <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>the nature of the evidence that can be used \u201cto satisfy the factfinder that it is more likely than not that a forbidden characteristic played a part in the employment decision,\u201d <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 247 n. 12, 109 S.Ct. at 1789 n. 12, is a question separate and apart from how a plaintiff can proceed when he or she is unable to prove pretext. In fact, in the wake of <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>a number of courts have addressed the nature of the proofs required to shift the burden in an employment discrimination case, and have arrived at differing results. That is hardly surprising, since <em>Price Waterhouse </em>does not address that question. <em>Compare White v. Federal Express Corp., </em>939 F.2d 157, 160 (4th Cir.1991) (\u201cTo show discrimination in a mixed motive case ... a plaintiff ... may carry its burden under ordinary principles of proof by any sufficiently probative direct or indirect evidence\u201d) <em>with Brown v. East Mississippi Elec. Power Ass\u2019n, </em>989 F.2d 858, 861 (5th Cir.1993) (\u201c[w]hen a plaintiff presents credible <em>direct </em>evidence that discriminatory animus in part motivated or was a substantial factor in the contested employment action, the burden of proof shifts to the employ-er_\u201d) (emphasis added). For our part, we have held that \u201c[a]t a bare minimum, a plaintiff seeking to advance a mixed motive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>case will have to adduce circumstantial evidence \u2018of conduct or statements by persons involved in the decision-making process that may be viewed as directly reflecting the alleged discriminatory attitude\u2019.\u201d <em>Griffiths, </em>988 F.2d at 470 (quoting <em>Ostrowski v. Atlantic Mut. Ins. Cos., </em>968 F.2d 171, 182 (2d Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">In short, then, a majority of the justices in <em>Price Waterhouse </em>held that Title VII provides two theories of liability: (1) pretext, or <em>Burdine </em>analysis, under which an employee only wins by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered reason for the adverse employment decision was pretextual and that, in fact, the decision was based solely on illegitimate factors; (2) mixed motives cases, in which the trier of fact concludes that both licit and illicit motives played a role in the employment decision, and where the burden shifts to the employer to prove that it would have made the same decision absent the illegitimate motive. This means that the in banc majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cwe would be reluctant to attribute to Congress an intention that an employer should be hable if a hiring or discharge decision is based solely on an employee\u2019s age and not hable if the decision is based primarily on the employee\u2019s age but also on the fact that the employee\u2019s supervisor did not like the employee\u2019s personahty, hair color, or some other personal trait or conduct,\u201d- Opinion at 593, really states the obvious. Other than perhaps the appellant in <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>few contended or contend that a plaintiff would always lose under the ADEA if age was not the determinative factor. The question is how to analyze claims alleging both legitimate and illegitimate motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The in bane majority\u2019s description of <em>Price Waterhouse </em>derives not from the opinions in the <em>Price Waterhouse </em>majority, but from the <em>Price Waterhouse </em>dissent\u2019s characterization of the Court\u2019s holding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Justice Kennedy\u2019s dissent in <em>Price Waterhouse </em>sought to recast the Court\u2019s analytical grounding away from the theory underlying the plaintiffs case and in terms of the type of evidence the plaintiff had adduced to prove disparate treatment. Writing for himself, the Chief Justice and Justice Sealia, Justice Kennedy began by describing his view of the court\u2019s holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-10\">I read the opinions as establishing that in a limited number of cases Title VII plaintiffs, by presenting direct and substantial evidence of discriminatory animus, may shift the burden of persuasion to the defendant to show that an adverse employment decision would have been supported by legitimate reasons. The shift in the burden of persuasion occurs only where a plaintiff proves by direct evidence that an unlawful motive was a substantial factor actually relied upon in making the decision. ... In sum, the court alters the evidentiary framework of <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>and <em>Burdine </em>for a closely defined set of cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-11\"><em>Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 280, 109 S.Ct. at 1806 (Kennedy, J.,'dissenting). Thus, in the dissent\u2019s view, the court did not draw a distinction between pretext cases and mixed motives cases but rather between direct evidence cases and circumstantial evidence cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> More than that, the dissent appeared to criticize the plurality opinion for the latter\u2019s assumption that pretext analysis requires proof of sole cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-12\">The plurality tries to reconcile its approach with <em>Burdine </em>by announcing that it applies only to a \u2018pretext\u2019 case, which it defines as a case in which the plaintiff attempts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>prove that the employer\u2019s proffered emanation is itself false.... This ignores the language of <em>Burdine, </em>which states that a plaintiff may succeed in meeting her ultimate burden of persuasion \u2018either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u2019 450 U.S., at 256, 101 S.Ct., at 1095 (emphasis added). Under the first of these two alternative methods, a plaintiff meets her burden if she can \u2018persuade the court that the employment decision more likely than not was motivated by a discriminatory reason.\u2019 <em>United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, </em>460 U.S. 711, 717-18 [103 S.Ct. 1478, 1483, 75 L.Ed.2d 403] (1983) (Blackmun, J., concurring).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><em>Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 287-88, 109 S.Ct. at 1810. The dissent\u2019s view is totally compatible with the in banc majority\u2019s (and my) conclusion that in all but a limited number of cases, the holding of <em>Price Waterhouse </em>is irrelevant. <em>See id. </em>at 280, 109 S.Ct. at 1806 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\u201cIn sum, the Court alters the evidentiary framework of <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>and <em>Burdine </em>for a closely defined set of cases.\u201d). Indeed, I believe it is impossible to square the <em>Price Waterhouse </em>majority\u2019s framework with the language of subsequent Supreme Court cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The <em>Price Waterhouse </em>dissent explicitly criticized the Court for unnecessarily complicating disparate treatment analysis by dividing it into various theories. <em>See Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 279, 109 S.Ct. at 1806 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\u201cContinued adherence to the evidentiary scheme established in <em>[McDonnell Douglas </em>and <em>Burdine </em>] is a wiser course than creation of more disarray in an area of the law already difficult for the bench and bar.\u201d). Just four years later, that view became the majority. In <em>Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993), the Court clarified the standards for proving disparate treatment under the ADEA. In no uncertain terms, the Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">Whatever the employer\u2019s decisionmaking process, a disparate treatment claim cannot succeed unless the employee\u2019s protected trait actually played a role in that process and had a determinative influence on the outcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-10\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 113 S.Ct. at 1706. One thing is clear from this language: In no disparate treatment case must a plaintiff prove that the illicit motive was <em>the </em>determinative factor. It necessarily follows that the Court\u2019s distinction in <em>Price Waterhouse </em>between pretext cases and mixed motives cases no longer proves a viable rationale for the <em>Price Water-house\u2019s </em>burden-shifting approach. This is because in light of <em>Hazen, </em>a plaintiff need not prove that age was the determinative factor to prove liability in a pretext case \u2014 rather, under the language of <em>Hazen, </em>a plaintiff could succeed under <em>Burdine </em>without proving that the employer\u2019s reasons are <em>wholly </em>pretextual. And, if the reasons are not wholly pretextual, some of them must be true. Further still, if some of the employer\u2019s reasons are true, pretext cases sometimes involve mixed motives. Thus, after <em>Hazen, </em>the burden-shifting approach of <em>Price Water-house </em>\u2014 if it survives at all \u2014 must rest not on the distinction between cases involving mixed motives and eases involving pretexts for discrimination, but rather on the distinction between circumstantial evidence cases and direct evidence cases \u2014 the distinction drawn by Justice Kennedy in his <em>Price Waterhouse </em>dissent. Thus, in my view, this court should not continue to refer to the term \u201cmixed motives\u201d and then define it as meaning something other than mixed motives. <em>See </em>Opinion at 597 n. 9. Instead, we simply should abandon the term altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">Along with abandoning the notion of an independent category of \u201cmixed motives\u201d eases, <em>Hazen </em>is important for another reason as well \u2014 it signalled discomfort with the <em>Bur-dine </em>scheme of apportioning burdens and presumptions, and consequently, with the entire notion of \u201cpretext\u201d liability. In this regard, the Court foreshadowed its decision in <em>St. Mary\u2019s </em>by pointing out that \u201cinferring age-motivation from the implausibility of the employer\u2019s explanation may be problematic in cases where other unsavory motives, such as pension interference, were present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 113 S.Ct. at 1708. Hence, the Court expressed wariness about the \u201cone or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>other\u201d approach of the pretext cases. The Court supported this critique by pointing to language in pretext eases tending to show that liability could be imposed under the ADEA even when age was not a motivating factor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\">Although some language in our prior decisions might be read to mean that an employer violates the ADEA whenever its reason for firing an employee is improper <em>in any respect, </em>see <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824 [36 L.Ed.2d 668] (1973) (creating proof framework applicable to ADEA) (employer must have \u2018legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u2019 for action against employee), this reading is obviously incorrect. For example, it cannot be true that an employer who fires an older black worker because the worker is black thereby violates the ADEA. The employee\u2019s race is an improper reason, but it is improper under Title VII, not the ADEA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\"><em>Hazen, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 113 S.Ct. at 1707. Thus, with the criticism of <em>Burdine </em>generally, and with the Court\u2019s holding that in all disparate treatment cases the plaintiff need only prove that the illicit factor had a determinative effect on the outcome, the Court strongly signalled the end of pretext liability as a distinct theory of disparate treatment liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\"><em>St Mary\u2019s </em>made the point even more explicit, and abandoned the notion of pretext liability altogether. In that case, the Supreme Court rejected the view that when a plaintiff proves an employer\u2019s proffered reasons for the adverse employment action is pretextual, the plaintiff automatically wins. Rather, in a disparate treatment case, the plaintiff must prove intentional discrimination, and the concept of affirmative proof is analytically distinct from proving other explanations wrong. <em>St Mary\u2019s </em>qualified this by saying that \u201c[t]he factfinder\u2019s disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the prima facie case, suffice to show intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2749. And, as the in banc majority recognizes, \u201c[a] finding that the employer\u2019s nondiscriminatory explanation is a pretext permits, but does not require, the trier of fact to conclude that the employer discriminated against the plaintiff based on the ground alleged.\u201d Opinion at 596. But by focusing on what <em>St Mary\u2019s </em>says about \u201csole cause,\u201d the majority misses the real significance of <em>St Mary\u2019s, </em>and may perpetuate misreadings of the case both in our own case law and in the commentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">If we interpret <em>St Mary\u2019s </em>purely within the pretext paradigm, as the in banc majority appears to do,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the case can be read to say that in all disparate treatment cases proceeding within the <em>Burdine </em>framework, the plaintiff must, at a minimum, prove pretext. After all, that is how <em>Burdine </em>described the three-pronged test. And, we recently held in <em>Armbruster v. Unisys Corp., </em>32 F.3d 768, 782 (3d Cir.1994), that in a <em>post-St Mary\u2019s </em>pretext case \u201ca plaintiff who claims invidious discrimination but lacks overt evidence of discriminatory animus <em>must </em>point to evidence tending to show the defendant\u2019s explanation is pretextual.\u201d (Emphasis added). If that is true, however, we very nearly are back at sole cause again. This is because the plaintiff is being forced not only to make an affirmative showing but also affirmatively to disprove facts. <em>See Armbruster, </em>32 F.3d at 783 (\u201cAfter <em>St Mary\u2019s, </em>it seems clear ... that the trier of fact cannot find for the plaintiff merely because it disbelieves the defendant\u2019s proffered explanation; it must <em>also </em>be persuaded that the employment decision was the result of the bias that can be inferred from the falsity of the defendant\u2019s explanation.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>id. </em>(\u201can ultimate finding of illegal discrimination in a pretext case requires evidence showing a <em>pri-ma facie </em>case <em>and </em>evidence showing pretext\u201d) (second alteration added); <em>see also </em>Michael A. Zubrensky, <em>Despite the Smoke, There Is No Gun: Direct Evidence Requirements in Mixed-Motives Employment Law After Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>46 Stan. L.Rev. 959, 964 (1994) (\u201cplaintiffs [must] dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>prove unstated reasons for the employment decision\u201d). But, as <em>Hazen </em>makes clear, in no disparate treatment case must a plaintiff prove that the illicit factor was the sole or determinative cause of the adverse employment action. Therefore, to read <em>St. Mary\u2019s </em>as requiring a plaintiff to prove pretext is to misread the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The point of <em>St. Mary\u2019s </em>was not to place a dual burden on plaintiffs, but rather to treat disparate treatment discrimination eases\u2014 after the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and after the defendant has met its burden of production \u2014 -just like any other case where the plaintiff bears the burden of proof. See also <em>Gehring v. Case Corp., </em>43 F.3d 340, 343 (7th Cir.1994) (\u201cOnce the judge finds that the plaintiff has made the minimum necessary demonstration (the \u2018prima facie case\u2019) and that the defendant has produced an age neutral explanation ... the only remaining question ... the jury need answer is whether the plaintiff is a victim of intentional discrimination.\u201d) After the plaintiff and the defendant have met their initial burdens, the entire <em>Burdine </em>procedure no longer is of any relevance (apart from the fact that the procedure provided a mechanism to get evidence before the court). <em>Id. </em>To be sure, the plaintiff may attempt to prove intentional discrimination solely by focusing on the falsity of the defendant\u2019s explanations, <em>see St. Mary\u2019s, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-n. 4, 113 S.Ct. at 2749 n. 4, but that only means that if a jury disbelieves the defendant\u2019s argument, it may believe the opposite. Nothing in that proposition is peculiar to age discrimination claims. In other words, the plaintiff certainly is not required to rebut the defendant\u2019s proffered reasons completely, if he or she nonetheless is able to establish that the illicit motive was a but-for cause of the adverse employment decision. <em>See St. Mary\u2019s, </em>-U.S. at-n. 4, 113 S.Ct. at 2749 n. 4 (\u201cthere must be a finding of discrimination\u201d); <em>id. </em>at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2751 (employee must prove \u201cthat the employer has unlawfully discriminated\u201d); <em>id. </em>at --\u2022, 113 S.Ct. at 2752 (\u201cproving the employer\u2019s reason false becomes part of (and often considerably assists) the greater enterprise of proving that the real reason was intentional discrimination\u201d); <em>id. </em>at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2753-54 (\u201c[Ojnce the defendant has responded to the plaintiffs prima facie case, \u2018the district court has before it all the evidence it needs to decide\u2019 not (as the dissent would have it) whether the defendant\u2019s response is credible, but \u2018whether the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">The problem probably arose with <em>St. Mary\u2019s </em>assumption that proving pretext is easier than affirmatively proving intentional discrimination. <em>St. Mary\u2019s </em>assumed that when the factfinder is focussed purely on whether the defendant\u2019s proffered reasons are true, the plaintiff is somehow getting off the hook. In some cases that may be true. But that assumption certainly is incorrect as a general proposition. Rather, it may be much more difficult to disprove an employer\u2019s explanation than to point to evidence tending to show that even if the employer\u2019s explanation is partly correct, the illicit motive also caused the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">But putting that incorrect assumption aside, the real point of <em>St. Mary\u2019s </em>was to focus the factfinder in all disparate treatment cases away from the question of pretext and instead on the question of whether intentional discrimination took place. <em>St. Mary\u2019s </em>is important because it tells district courts to dispense with abstract pretext analysis altogether except insofar as it sheds light on whether intentional discrimination took place. As in all eases, there must be evidence in the record to support a finding in favor of the plaintiff on the ultimate question. As <em>Hazen </em>makes clear, when the plaintiff is not required to prove sole cause, it should not matter at all that a legitimate reason played a role in the process. Thus, once the defendant has met its proffer, the jury should be instructed that it should consider evidence of the prima facie case, evidence of legitimate explanations, evidence bearing on the credibility of those explanations, and all other relevant evidence in the case to determine whether the employer discriminated against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-14\">By abandoning sole cause as the basis for pretext liability, <em>Hazen </em>makes clear that there is no separate category of mixed mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>tives cases. By turning the focus in \u201cpretext\u201d cases away from evidence of pretext, <em>St Mary\u2019s </em>makes clear that there is no separate category of pretext cases. What we are left with is one broad category of disparate treatment eases that, except for the limited category of <em>Price Waterhouse </em>eases, should be treated alike.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">This brings me to the question of causation. The majority goes to great lengths to show that plaintiffs must prove but-for causation in order to prevail, but the ultimate test it announces neglects all mention of but-for causation. <em>See </em>Opinion at 596-97, Opinion at 598. Contrary to the majority\u2019s intimations, all the justices in <em>Price Waterhouse </em>itself agreed on this point. I believe that the majority is incorrect when it states that in <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>\u201cJustices Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens read the statute as imposing liability in any situation where the unlawful motive was a \u2018motivating\u2019 factor.\u201d Opinion at 594-95. While the <em>Price Waterhouse </em>plurality pointed out that \u201cHopkins argues that once she made this showing [that the unlawful motive was a motivating factor] she was entitled to a finding that Price Waterhouse had discriminated against her on the basis of sex,\u201d it quickly rejected that argument. <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 244 n. 10, 109 S.Ct. at 1787 n. 10. Justice Brennan really was concerned with burdens and presumptions; his point was that if the defendant could not prove its affirmative defense, the trier of fact could presume that but-for causation had been proven. <em>See id. </em>at 246 n. 11, 109 S.Ct. at 1788 n. 11 (\u201c [W]here an employer is unable to prove its claim that it would have made the same decision in the absence of discrimination, we are entitled to conclude that gender did make a difference to the outcome.\u201d) (plurality opinion); <em>see also id. </em>at 249, 109 S.Ct. at 1790 (\u201cA court that finds for a plaintiff under this standard has effectively concluded that an illegitimate motive was a \u2018but-for\u2019 cause of the employment decision.\u201d) (plurality opinion); <em>id. </em>at 281, 109 S.Ct. at 1807 (\u201cThe theory of Title VH liability the plurality adopts ... essentially incorporates the but-for standard.\u201d) (Kennedy, J., dissenting). In other words, all the justices always have agreed that a plaintiff cannot win in an age discrimination suit if but-for causation is not proved; the disagreement in <em>Price Water-house </em>involves the much different question of who bears the burden of proof and what can be inferred when those burdens are not met. <em>Id. </em>at 281, 109 S.Ct. at 1807 (\u201cThe importance of today\u2019s decision is not the standard of causation it employs, but its shift to the defendant of the burden of proof.\u201d) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">The in banc majority\u2019s belief that \u201cbut-for\u201d causation is surrounded in controversy has induced it to shy away from the concept in articulating a jury charge \u2014 even though the majority opinion at one point explicitly recognizes that the <em>Hazen </em>test translates into but-for causation, <em>see </em>Opinion at 595-96 (\u201cA plaintiff in an ADEA case ... has the burden of persuading the trier of fact ... that there is a \u2018but-for\u2019 causal connection between the plaintiff\u2019s age and the employer\u2019s adverse action....\u201d I believe this unnecessarily complicates matters. <em>Cf. Gehring, </em>43 F.3d at 344 (\u201c\u2018determining factor\u2019 is not a term in common usage, and it therefore does not illuminate the essential concepts. Putting unusual terms in jury instructions does little beyond confusing the jurors\u201d). Thus, while it is true that in all non-Price <em>Waterhouse </em>cases, the test is whether the \u201cplaintiff [has proven] by a preponderance of the evidence that age played a role in the employer\u2019s decisionmaking process and that it had a determinative effect on the outcome of that process,\u201d Opinion at 598-99, the jury also may be instructed that this technically worded test translates into but-for causation. <em>Gehring, </em>43 F.3d at 344 (\u201cone attractive formulation\u201d is that the jury should be instruct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>ed to decide \u201cwhether the employer would have fired [demoted, laid off] the employee if the employee had been younger than 40 and everything else had remained the same\u201d) (alteration in original). In <em>Price Waterhouse </em>cases, as defined in note 9 of the in banc majority\u2019s opinion, the jury should be instructed that if the defendant fails to meet its burden of showing that it would have made the same decision in the absence of the illicit motive, it must conclude that the plaintiff <em>has 'proven </em>but-for causation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-7\">. It is evident that we decided <em>Griffiths </em>correctly, as <em>Griffiths </em>was after <em>Price Waterhouse </em>but before <em>Hazen. </em>Of course, <em>Price Waterhouse </em>constituted the first stage in a process that ultimately saw the Supreme Court abandoning the notion that there are different theories of disparate treatment liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b696-8\">. The dissent disagreed with this distinction as well: \"Our opinions make plain that <em>Burdine </em>applies to all individual disparate-treatment cases, whether the plaintiff offers direct proof that discrimination motivated the employer\u2019s actions or chooses the indirect method of showing that the employer's proffered justification is false, that is to say, a pretext. <em>See Aikens, </em>supra, 460 U.S. at 714 n. 3, 103 S.Ct. at 1481 n. 3 ('As in any lawsuit, the plaintiff may prove his case by direct or circumstantial evidence.')\u201d. <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 288, 109 S.Ct. at 1810 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\">. <em>See </em>Opinion at 597 (\"We think it clear from the Supreme Court's opinion in <em>St. Mary\u2019s </em>that the trier of fact in a <em>pretext </em>case, where the record will support it, may choose not to accept either party's litigating position as reflecting the whole truth.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b700-6\">.
