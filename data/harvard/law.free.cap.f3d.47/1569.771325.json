This is a case of first impression in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">The District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, sitting in bankruptcy, determined that it possessed subject matter jurisdiction to entertain a complaint seeking declaratory and monetary relief based upon a contract in a dispute otherwise governed by the exclusive provisions of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-563, 92 Stat. 2383 (1978) (CDA). The District Court then denied the Government\u2019s motion to transfer the cause to the Court of Federal Claims. The United States has taken this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(d)(4)(A),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which permits appeals to this court from interlocutory orders of a district court denying, in whole or in part, a motion to transfer an action to the Court of Federal Claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (dealing with transfers to cure want of jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">We conclude that in a case such as this, Congress gave concurrent jurisdiction to both the District Court, under the Bankruptcy Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-598, 92 Stat. 2549, codified as amended as Title 11 of the United States Code (Bankruptcy Act), and the Court of Federal Claims, under the Contract Disputes Act. The initial decision as to which is the proper forum to resolve a particular contract dispute is for the District Court, applying the proper standards. The cause is remanded to the District Court with instructions to reconsider its denial of the transfer motion in light of these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-7\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-8\">The United States Army (Army) contracted with Quality Tooling, Inc. (Quality) for the manufacture of certain parts required by the Army for a missile system. The parties to the contract had a falling out over Quality\u2019s performance (or lack of it), and were unable to settle the dispute amicably. The Army terminated the contract for default on October 11, 1990, and informed Quality that it owed the Government for losses that, the Army alleged, had been caused by Quality\u2019s default.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-13\">Quality then brought suit against the Government in the Court of Federal Claims<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pursuant to the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, and the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 609 (CDA), one of the established routes for resolution of a government contract dispute. In its suit Quality alleged that the Army had in fact terminated the contract for the convenience of the government, that the Army was therefore not entitled to recover damages as a result of a default, and that Quality was due money both under the termination for convenience clause and for incidental expenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the contract dispute was pending before the Court of Federal Claims, Quality petitioned the District Court of the District of Columbia for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act. At Quality\u2019s request, Quality\u2019s bankruptcy case was subsequently transferred to the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, where Quality is located. After a series of moves and countermoves by the parties, Quality\u2019s contract claim against the United States, pending in the Court of Federal Claims, ended up in the hands of the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, sitting in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-14\">The Government then moved, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, to transfer the contract dispute back to the Court of Federal Claims, arguing that the District Court, sitting in bankruptcy, was without jurisdiction to try <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1572\">*1572</page-number>the issue, and that the proper forum for resolution of the contractual claims was the Court of Federal Claims. The District Court denied the Government\u2019s motion. The Government duly appealed the denial to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(d)(4), which establishes this court\u2019s jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals from the grant or denial of a motion to transfer a case from a district court to the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">\n<em>I. The transfer from the Court of Federal Claims to the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">As a preliminary matter, the Government argues that this case was improperly transferred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452 from the Court of Federal Claims to the District Court in Alabama sitting in bankruptcy. In the Government\u2019s view, that provision permits transfer only from <em>state </em>courts to a bankruptcy court, and a transfer from a federal court of nationwide jurisdiction to a district court is not authorized. In support of the Government\u2019s argument, it is noted that \u00a7 1452 is the last of a number of sections codified in chapter 89 under the title: \u201cDistrict Courts: Removal of Cases from State Courts,\u201d and each of the other sections \u2014 1441 through 1451 \u2014 deals expressly with actions commenced in state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-7\">But \u00a7 1452 does not refer to actions commenced in state courts. It states simply that \u201c[a] party may remove any claim or cause of action in a civil action\u201d to a district court sitting in bankruptcy. There are two stated exceptions: (i) the proceeding may not be before the United States Tax Court; and (ii) the claim may not be a civil action by a governmental unit to enforce the unit\u2019s police or regulatory power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-8\">The specific exclusion of transfers from the United States Tax Court hardly would be necessary if \u00a7 1452 dealt only with transfers from state courts. Had Congress wanted to exclude other federal courts, including the Court of Federal Claims, it could have said so. The Tax Court and the Court of Federal Claims are both Article I courts of nationwide jurisdiction. The Government\u2019s argument \u2014 that the terms of the statute suffice to exclude courts of national jurisdiction \u2014 would make the express exclusion of the Tax Court superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-14\">Enacted as part of the 1984 amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, Bankruptcy Amendments of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-353, title I, \u00a7 103(a), 98 Stat. 333, 335 (1984), section 1452 is designed to address removal of claims related to bankruptcy cases, and to provide for transfer of such claims to the district courts sitting in bankruptcy. Nothing in the language of the section suggests a limit on the courts from which transfer is authorized, other than the two specific exceptions noted, neither of which applies to the case of Quality.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Government notes that the legislative history of \u00a7 1452 lacks any debate or deliberation concerning the removability of Court of Federal Claims actions to a bankruptcy court, and that apparently there has been no recorded occasion in which an action was removed from the Court of Federal Claims to a federal district court. The absence of legislative history on the subject hardly proves the negative, and there is a first time for everything. We conclude that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452 is not limited by its terms to removing a claim from a state court, and that the transfer here was properly authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-15\">\n<em>II. The jurisdiction of the District Court and of the Court of Federal Claims over the dispute arising out of the supply contract between Quality and the Army.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-16\">The Government points out that Quality founded its contract dispute suit upon \u00a7 1491 of Title 28, United States Code, the Tucker Act, and \u00a7 609(a) of Title 41, which is \u00a7 10(a)(1) of the Contract Disputes Act (CDA). The Government is correct that the Tucker Act, in conjunction with the CDA, purports to make the Court of Federal Claims the exclusive trial court for hearing disputes over government contracts that fall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1573\">*1573</page-number>under the CDA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(a)(2), 1491(a)(2). Exclusive appellate jurisdiction over such suits (as well as those which follow the alternate route through an agency board of contract appeals) is in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3), (a)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-4\">But Quality is also correct in contending that when Congress passed the Bankruptcy Act, it anticipated that there would be claims involving a bankrupt\u2019s estate that, by statute, were assigned exclusively to some court other than a district court. Congress, wishing to give the district court sitting in bankruptcy plenary authority over the bankrupt\u2019s estate and all claims by or against it, expressly provided that the district court would have concurrent jurisdiction over all claims, even those which by statute were within the exclusive jurisdiction of other federal courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-5\">Notwithstanding any Act of Congress that confers exclusive jurisdiction on a court or courts other than the district courts, the district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b). That Congress intended what the statute states is reinforced by the legislative history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-7\">There are several objectionable results to the division of jurisdiction of the judicial business generated by bankruptcy cases. The first is delay\u2014 Delay is critical in cases under the Bankruptcy Act, particularly in the business cases where litigation is most likely to occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-8\">A comprehensive grant of jurisdiction to the bankruptcy courts over all controversies arising out of any bankruptcy or rehabilitation case would greatly diminish the basis for litigation of jurisdictional issues which consumes so much time, money, and energy of the bankruptcy system and of those involved in the administration of debtors\u2019 affairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">H.R. No. 595, 95th Cong., 2nd Sess. 44-46 (1978) <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 6006-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-11\">District courts sitting in bankruptcy have traditionally had broad powers, including authority for \u201cthe collection and distribution of the estates of bankrupts and the determination of controversies in relation thereto;____ In such respects the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts is exclusive of all other courts.\u201d <em>Pepper v. Litton, </em>308 U.S. 295, 304, 60 S.Ct. 238, 244, 84 L.Ed. 281 (1939) (citation omitted). In exercising their authority over bankrupt estates, bankruptcy courts have often treated organs of the Federal Government affected by the bankruptcy as if they were private parties. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Whiting Pools, </em>462 U.S. 198, 209, 103 S.Ct. 2309, 2315-16, 76 L.Ed.2d 515 (1983) (\u201cWe see no reason why a different result should obtain when the IRS is the creditor____ Nothing in the Bankruptcy Code or its legislative history indicates that Congress intended a special exception for the tax collector____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-15\">The Bankruptcy Act is thus a codification of the comprehensive authority possessed by bankruptcy courts over bankrupt estates, and on its face includes the disputed contract rights at issue here. In an earlier litigation in the Tenth Circuit the Government conceded that the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction over contract claims such as the one here. <em>United States v. Bagley (In re Mur-dock Mach. &amp; Eng\u2019g Co. of Utah), </em>990 F.2d 567, 569 (10th Cir.1993). There can be little doubt that, by statute, both the District Court, sitting in bankruptcy, and the Court of Federal Claims are empowered with subject matter jurisdiction over this contract dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-16\">\n<em>III. The effect of sovereign immunity on the ability of the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, sittiny in bankruptcy, to hear this case.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-17\">But, argues the Government, the matter is not so easily resolved. In order for the district court, sitting in bankruptcy, to exercise jurisdiction over the United States Government under a contract dispute claim, it is not enough that there is an express statutory grant of jurisdiction. Since the CDA claim is against the Federal Government, there must also be an express waiver of the Govem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1574\">*1574</page-number>ment\u2019s sovereign immunity. And that, says the Government, is a whole different story.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">The distinction between a grant to a court of subject matter jurisdiction to entertain a particular claim against a government, and a waiver of that government\u2019s sovereign immunity from suit on the claim, first arose in the context of whether a citizen of one state could sue another state in the federal courts. In the early case of <em>Chisholm v. Georgia, </em>2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419, 1 L.Ed. 440 (1793), the Supreme Court was called upon to interpret Article III of the Constitution, which in pertinent part provides that \u201cThe Judicial Power shall extend to all Cases ... between a State and citizens of another State.\u201d U.S. CONST, art. III, \u00a7 2. The Supreme Court held that a citizen of South Carolina could sue the State of Georgia in the Supreme Court. Disagreeing with his brethren,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Justice Iredell relied on the distinction between the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction, which Iredell conceded the Constitution <em>might </em>be read to grant, and a purported waiver of Georgia\u2019s sovereign immunity, which Iredell was sure did not exist. \u201c[Ejven if the Constitution would admit of the exercise of such a power [jurisdiction], a new law is necessary for the purpose, since no part of the existing law applies [to waive sovereign immunity], this alone is sufficient to justify my determination in the present case.\u201d <em>Chisholm, 2 </em>U.S. (2 Dall) at 449. Justice Iredell\u2019s view that the suit should not be entertained was vindicated by the passage of the Eleventh Amendment, which \u201cnullified the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chisholm.\u201d Welch v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Highways &amp; Public Trans., </em>483 U.S. 468, 484, 107 S.Ct. 2941, 2951, 97 L.Ed.2d 389 (1987) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">More recently, the Supreme Court in <em>Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, </em>501 U.S. 775, 111 S.Ct. 2578, 115 L.Ed.2d 686 (1991), held that the State of Alaska\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit was not abrogated by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362, which grants jurisdiction to district courts to hear claims brought by Indian tribes. Regarding the relationship between waivers of sovereign immunity and grants of jurisdiction, the Court observed that \u201c[t]he fact that Congress grants <em>jurisdiction </em>to hear a claim does not suffice to show Congress has abrogated all <em>defenses </em>to that claim. The issues are wholly distinct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 786-87 n. 4, 111 S.Ct. at 2585 n. 4 (emphasis in original) (Scalia, J., noting with approval Justice Iredell\u2019s view in Chisholm).</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-10\">Building on this distinction, the Government here argues that the statute granting jurisdiction to the district courts must contain the applicable waiver of sovereign immunity. The Government acknowledges that, through the Tucker Act, Congress has waived sovereign immunity against claims founded on contracts with the Government. But, a familiar mantra says, waivers of sovereign immunity are to be \u201cstrictly construed.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 94, 111 S.Ct. 453, 456-57, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990); <em>Library of Congress v. Shaw, </em>478 U.S. 310, 318, 106 S.Ct. 2957, 2963, 92 L.Ed.2d 250 (1986). The Government argues that the Tucker Act waiver of sovereign immunity is limited to its jurisdictional terms: the Government has consented to be sued on a contractual matter <em>only </em>in the Court of Federal Claims. That the Government has waived its immunity in the Court of Federal Claims does not imply that the Government has waived its immunity in other courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-11\">Quality answers that the Tucker Act waives sovereign immunity over claims founded upon government contracts in all courts with jurisdiction to hear such claims. As the Supreme Court has said, the waiver is implicit in the grant of a remedy for claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1575\">*1575</page-number>founded upon any express or implied contract with the United States, <em>United, States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 215, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 2967, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and \u201c[i]f a claim falls within the terms of the Tucker Act, the United States has presumptively consented to suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216, 103 S.Ct. at 2967. \u201c[T]he Tucker Act effects a waiver of sovereign immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215, 103 S.Ct. at 2967 (citing <em>Army &amp; Air Force Exchange Serv. v. Sheehan, </em>456 U.S. 728, 734, 102 S.Ct. 2118, 2122, 72 L.Ed.2d 520 (1982)); <em>Hatzlachh Supply Co. v. United States, </em>444 U.S. 460, 466, 100 S.Ct. 647, 651, 62 L.Ed.2d 614 (1980) <em>(per </em>curiam). Quality argues that this waiver of sovereign immunity extends to any court with jurisdiction over a suit on a government contract, in this case the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">Quality is correct. The distinction between sovereign immunity and jurisdiction, so strongly urged by the Government, cuts both ways. The Government\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity is not only distinct from, it is logically prior to, the Government\u2019s grant of jurisdiction. \u201cIt is axiomatic that the United States may not be sued without its consent and that the existence of consent is a <em>prerequisite </em>for jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. at 212, 103 S.Ct. at 2965 (emphasis added, footnote omitted). In order for a claim against the United States to be heard, first there must be, because sovereign immunity requires it, consent to be sued; and because, with the exception of the Supreme Court, the subject matter jurisdiction of federal courts is defined by statute, there must be, second, Congressional provision of a court with the authority to hear the claim and grant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">The inquiry, then, is not whether there is the one, jurisdiction, or the other, a waiver of immunity, but whether there is both, and that requires examining all that Congress has had to say on the subject. \u201c[Wjaiver of sovereign immunity is accomplished not by \u2018a ritualistic formula\u2019; rather intent to waive immunity and the scope of such a waiver can only be ascertained by reference to underlying congressional policy.\u201d <em>Franchise Tax Bd. of California v. United States Postal Serv., </em>467 U.S. 512, 521, 104 S.Ct. 2549, 2554, 81 L.Ed.2d 446 (1984) (quoting <em>Keifer &amp; Keifer v. Reconstruction Finance Corp., </em>306 U.S. 381, 389, 59 S.Ct. 516, 517-18, 83 L.Ed. 784 (1939)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-9\">The Supreme Court has long \u201cinterpreted the Tucker Act as having provided the consent \u00f3f the United States to be sued <em>eo nomine </em>for the classes of claims described in the Act.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. at 215, 103 S.Ct. at 2967. The Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"agk-dedup-0\">a court need not find a separate waiver of sovereign immunity in the substantive provision [of law granting a right to monetary relief], just as a court need not find consent to suit in \u2018any express or implied contract with the United States.\u2019... The Tucker Act itself provides the necessary consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-10\"><em>Id </em>at 218, 103 S.Ct. at 2968 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491).</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-11\">Just as a statute or contract that creates a right to monetary relief need not contain a redundant waiver of sovereign immunity, a Congressional enactment granting a federal court jurisdiction over a class of cases need not redundantly waive the government\u2019s sovereign immunity if it is otherwise waived. \u201c[Tjhere is simply no question that the Tucker Act provides the United States\u2019 consent to suit for claims founded upon statutes or regulations that create substantive rights to money damages.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. at 218, 103 S.Ct. at 2969. The Tucker Act waives the government\u2019s immunity from suit on its contracts in any court to which Congress grants jurisdiction to hear the claim. No further waiver, no \u201critualistic formula,\u201d <em>Keifer &amp; Keifer, </em>306 U.S. at 389, 59 S.Ct. at 518, is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-12\">The Government argues further, however, that even if the Tucker Act waiver of sovereign immunity extends to courts other than the Court of Federal Claims, when a district court sitting in bankruptcy is the other court, Congress, and the Supreme Court, have limited the Government\u2019s exposure to the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1576\">*1576</page-number>press waivers of immunity specifically provided in the Bankruptcy Act. In contrast to the broad waivers of sovereign immunity in the Tucker Act and the CDA the Bankruptcy Act contains three specific waivers of sovereign immunity. These authorize monetary claims against the United States with regard to specified provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(a); compulsory counterclaims to government claims, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(b); and permissive counterclaims to government claims capped by a setoff limitation, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(c).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">The Government reads <em>United States v. Nordic Village, </em>503 U.S. 30, 34-36, 112 S.Ct. 1011, 1015, 117 L.Ed.2d 181 (1992) <em>(Nordic </em>Village) for the proposition that in bankruptcy, a claimant against the Government must rely on the waivers of sovereign immunity contained in the Bankruptcy Act. It is uncontested that none of the Bankruptcy Act\u2019s three waivers of sovereign immunity apply to Quality\u2019s case, and thus, argues the Government, Quality has failed to state a claim on which the Government has consented to be sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">The Government stretches <em>Nordic Village </em>well beyond its facts, and argues for a position that is not supported by either statute or precedent. In <em>Nordic Village, </em>an officer of a corporation which had filed for bankruptcy used corporate funds to pay personal income taxes. The bankruptcy trustee sought, and received, a judgment against the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Ultimately, the Supreme Court reversed. <em>Nordic Village, </em>503 U.S. at 38-40, 112 S.Ct. at 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">The bankruptcy trustee contended that 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(c), as it then stood, provided the requisite waiver of sovereign immunity permitting the trustee to sue the United States for the money stolen from the corporation. The Supreme Court held that the proffered language. did not unambiguously subject the government to the judgment of the bankruptcy court in this class of case. Absent a clear expression of Congressional intention to waive the government\u2019s immunity from suit, the Court was unwilling to read into the language of the Act the needed waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-9\">In the case before us, Quality relies on the Tucker Act and the CDA for the waiver of sovereign immunity, and not on the explicit waivers or the general language of the Bankruptcy Act. The bankruptcy trustee in <em>Nordic Village </em>had no Tucker Act claim. In consequence, the precise question at issue here \u2014 whether the waiver of sovereign immunity found in the Tucker Act and in the CDA is valid in another federal court with jurisdiction \u2014 was not at issue in <em>Nordic Village.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-10\">The bankruptcy trustee in <em>Nordic Village </em>had no substantive right to payment. Instead, the bankruptcy trustee essentially prayed that the bankruptcy court grant equitable relief \u2014 the federal fisc should not profit from theft, and hence the IRS should return the money to the bankrupt\u2019s estate, and ultimately, the creditors of the corporation. Quality, on the other hand, has a colorable claim to a substantive right enforceable against the United States, a claim founded on its supply contract with the Army, and for which the CDA expressly provides a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-11\">Here, Congress\u2019 intention to waive the government\u2019s immunity from suit for a breach of contract is clear and undisputed. The Government does not maintain that it has a right not to pay a damage claim founded on a supply contract governed by the CDA The issue here is not whether the Government has waived its sovereign immunity, but whether that waiver extends to federal trial fora other than the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-12\">The dissent, along with the Government, argues that waivers of sovereign immunity should be understood to be court specific. In support of this proposition the dissent cites <em>Minnesota v. United States, </em>305 U.S. 382, 59 S.Ct. 292, 83 L.Ed. 235 (1939), and <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>309 U.S. 495, 60 S.Ct. 659, 84 L.Ed. 888 (1940). But in each of those cases, the question was whether the United States, without express Congressional assent, should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1577\">*1577</page-number>have claims decided against it in the courts <em>of another sovereign. </em>In the <em>Minnesota </em>case, the probate court in Minnesota purported to adjudicate a claim regarding Indian lands in which the Federal Government had an interest. In <em>Shaw, </em>the issue was whether jurisdiction resided in the probate court of Michigan to adjudicate an affirmative claim for money against the United States. In both cases, the Supreme Court concluded that no Congressional act could be found that expressly authorized these state courts to adjudicate the federal interests involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">In the case before us, the question is not whether Congress has clearly authorized the courts of another sovereign to adjudicate claims against the United States; both courts involved here are creatures of the federal sovereign, created and empowered by Congress with subject matter jurisdiction over the cause.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The question is the narrow one of whether Congress, having granted Quality the right to sue the United States on this claim, and having in other legislation granted to two federal courts jurisdiction over such claims, intended the right to sue to be applicable in both federal courts which have jurisdiction. In other words, our inquiry comes down to the simple question of whether there is anything in the governing legislation to suggest that we are to read Congress\u2019 intention as preferring the one court to the exclusion of the other in adjudicating this claim. We have found no such indication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">The dissent argues further, however, that in determining what Congress desires, recent decisions of the Supreme Court indicate that grants of sovereign immunity are to be very narrowly construed, and express legislative words must be found if waiver is to be found. We must of course honor the Supreme Court\u2019s current view of the doctrine, but at the same time we may not ignore Congressional intent and purpose.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-10\">The Supreme Court has never agreed on the precise basis for the judicially created doctrine of sovereign immunity, and its historical antecedents are obscure.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The doctrine receives the brunt of much criticism, for example,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-11\">[L]earned members of the legal profession have been continuously attacking the roots and branches of that judicially planted growth, calling into question not only its utility but even the legitimacy of its alleged origins. Oddly enough this criticism has had a palpable effect upon federal legislators, ... [and] upon state supreme courts. But if the United States Supreme Court is to be judged by what it has done concerning the doctrine, as opposed to what it has from time to time said, criticism seems to have confirmed the Court in the error of its ways.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-12\">Scalia, <em>supra </em>n. 9, at 867-68 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-13\">Be that as it may, it is undisputed that Congress has the final say over whether the immunity of the United States from suit has been waived. With regard to the application of sovereign immunity generally, Congress has chosen through general legislation to waive the government\u2019s immunity for most monetary claims resulting from torts of government agents committed against the citi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1578\">*1578</page-number>zenry,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as well as for money claims arising out of contracts entered into between the government and private citizens.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In addition, Congress has made specific provision for monetary recoveries against the government in a wide variety of legislation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">The problem here is not one of extending the government\u2019s exposure to liability for a contractual breach \u2014 the government\u2019s grant of exposure is conceded if plaintiff can prove his case. The problem is one of construing Congress\u2019s intent and purpose regarding the proper forum for resolving this contract dispute. The answer lies not just in the exception provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, as the dissent would have it. The answer requires that we put in <em>para materia </em>the relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, expressly granting jurisdiction to district courts over matters otherwise exclusively in other courts, with the language of the Tucker Act and the CDA, waiving in unmistakable terms any claim to sovereign immunity for these contract claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">Recent Congressional enactments reinforce our view of Congress\u2019 purpose regarding concurrent jurisdiction in both the district court and the Court of Federal Claims to entertain CDA matters. Section 10 of the CDA, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 609, was amended in 1994 to add a new subsection (f):</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">(1) Whenever an action involving an issue described in paragraph (2) is pending in a district court of the United States, the district court may request a board of contract appeals to provide the court with an advisory opinion on the matters of contract interpretation at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-355, \u00a7 2354, 108 Stat. 3243, 3323 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">The \u201cissue described in paragraph (2)\u201d is a CDA claim: \u201cAn issue referred to in paragraph (1) is any issue that could be the proper subject of a final decision of a contracting officer appealable under this Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This added provision in the CDA leaves little doubt that Congress understood that district courts might be entertaining CDA claims, pursuant to other provisions of law, and that the district court might need advice regarding aspects of such claims from a board with expertise in government contracting matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-14\">Finally, the dissent argues that if we open the door to this contract dispute, we will have opened the door to wholesale transfers of suits from the Court of Federal Claims to the district courts in a host of cases \u2014 takings cases, military pay claims, and other types of entitlement.claims. [Op.' at 1575.] We do not think so. In the first place, the decision was Congress\u2019s, not ours. And we are here talking only about \u201ccivil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b). In the second place, this opinion goes no further than to hold that the District Court sitting in bankruptcy has subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the cause raised by Quality against the United States, and that Congress has waived any claim the United States might have had regarding sovereign immunity for that claim. And thirdly, as we shall next explain, the District Court, before it may undertake to adjudicate the cause, must consider whether as a matter of judicial economy and prudence the cause should be heard by it or by the' Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-15\">\n<em>TV. Determining whether the Court of Federal Claims or the District Court, sitting in bankruptcg, should hear Qualitg\u2019s government contract claims.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-16\">We have explained why neither jurisdictional nor sovereign immunity concerns bar the district court, sitting in bankruptcy, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1579\">*1579</page-number>hearing Quality\u2019s government contract suit. The bankruptcy court and the Court of Federal Claims have concurrent jurisdiction to entertain Quality\u2019s suit against the Government. This raises a prudential problem hardly \u2022 considered by the parties: which court <em>should </em>hear the case, and why?</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\"><em>Gary Aircraft Corp. v. United States (In the matter of Gary Aircraft Corp.), </em>698 F.2d 775 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 820, 104 S.Ct. 82, 78 L.Ed.2d 92 (1983), presented a case similar to the one before this court. Gary Aircraft was a defense contractor who went bankrupt sometime after it had filed, with the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA), certain contract claims against the Government. In order to determine various questions of priority, the bankruptcy court undertook to determine the value of these claims. The Government appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s action to the district court, lost, and then appealed to the Fifth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">The Fifth Circuit recognized that the heart of the problem was two facially inconsistent mandates.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-7\">We have been presented with two inclusive, exclusive, sweeping schemes, both of which the Supreme Court has endorsed. The disputes clause [under which contract disputes went to the ASBCA] is something that <em>no court </em>can disregard. Bankruptcy courts have jurisdiction exclusive of <em>all other courts. </em>Given such conflicting mandates, what is a poor circuit judge to do?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2x\"><em>Id. </em>at 780 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">The Fifth Circuit sought the answer in three cases, <em>Order of Railway Conductors of America v. Pitney, </em>326 U.S. 561, 66 S.Ct. 322, 90 L.Ed. 318 (1946), <em>Smith v. Hoboken R.R., Warehouse &amp; S.S. Connecting Co., </em>328 U.S. 123, 66 S.Ct 947, 90 L.Ed. 1123 (1946), and <em>Nathanson v. NLRB, </em>344 U.S. 25, 73 S.Ct 80, 97 L.Ed. 23 (1952). In each of these cases, the Supreme Court had held that the bankruptcy court should defer to an administrative tribunal. From these cases the Fifth Circuit derived \u201cthe general proposition that a bankruptcy court should defer a complicated, technical dispute to a specialized forum.\u201d <em>Gary Aircraft, </em>698 F.2d at 783. And from this proposition, the Fifth Circuit reasoned that the bankruptcy court was required to transfer the contract claims to the ASBCA for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-11\">In <em>United States v. Bagley (In re Murdock Mach. &amp; Eng\u2019g Co. of Utah), </em>990 F.2d 567 (10th Cir.1993), the Tenth Circuit confronted the same issue of deferral, although on a somewhat more convoluted set of facts. The bankruptcy court had refused the Government\u2019s request to abstain from ruling on the merits of a dispute relating to a contract between the bankrupt and the government. The bankruptcy court had considered five criteria which it abstracted from <em>Gary Aircraft, </em>and decided that it had discretion in applying these criteria to the facts before it.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Exercising this discretion, the bankruptcy court declined to defer, even though the same contract issues were then pending before the ASBCA.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-12\">The Tenth Circuit read <em>Gary Aircraft </em>as holding that, \u201cbecause these criteria were generally present in all government contracts cases, a rule of mandatory deferral was appropriate.\u201d <em>Bagley, </em>990 F.2d at 572. The Tenth Circuit rejected that rule in favor of a more flexible one: \u201cBecause of the bankruptcy court\u2019s duty to timely determine and quantify creditors\u2019 claims, we believe the bankruptcy court correctly held that it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1580\">*1580</page-number>discretion to defer or to determine itself whether the government had a viable claim against the bankruptcy estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Tenth Circuit held its job was to determine whether the bankruptcy court had abused its discretion, and concluded that it had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">We believe the <em>Bagley </em>rule, granting some discretion to the bankruptcy court, is better designed than the rule of <em>Gary Aircraft </em>to carry out the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act, without necessarily impairing the ability of either the Government or the contractor to obtain a proper resolution of a contract dispute. We hold, as did the Tenth Circuit, that the matter of deferral is committed to the discretion of the district court, which is reviewable for abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">Although we decline to adopt the rule of decision announced by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Gary Aircraft, </em>we find that the prudential argument of <em>Gary Aircraft </em>retains much force. We agree that \u201ca bankruptcy court should defer a complicated, technical dispute to a specialized forum.\u201d <em>Gary Aircraft, </em>698 F.2d at 783. \u201cThe bankruptcy court normally supervises the liquidation of claims. But the rule is not inexorable. A sound discretion may indicate that a particular controversy should be remitted to another tribunal for litigation.\u201d <em>Nathanson, </em>344 U.S. at 30, 73 S.Ct. at 83 (citations omitted). Government contract law is a specialized, even arcane, field. In many cases, bankruptcy courts should stay their proceedings while the contractual issues are resolved by the Court of Federal Claims, which is accustomed to the intricacies of government contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">On the other hand, not all government contracts are complicated or technical, nor are all government contract disputes arcane. Bankruptcy judges are quite competent to decide contract disputes, including disputes that happen to arise from government contracts. In the absence of an absolute rule of decision, bankrupt estates whose assets include contractual claims involving the Federal Government present district court judges with another issue over which they must exercise their discretion: should they decide the contractual claims, or should they stay the bankruptcy proceedings and transfer the contractual issues to the Court of Federal Claims for resolution?</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">It is likely that, by and large, the latter course is preferable. There may be times, however, when transfer of a relatively straightforward contract claim would cause substantial losses to the creditors of the bankrupt estate, while resolution of the claim would do no harm to the fabric of government contracting law. The newly-enacted provision of the CDA, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 609(f), discussed above, for obtaining an advisory opinion from a board of contract appeals may assist the district courts in resolving these government contract disputes, and thus enlarge the number of cases in which transfer to the Court of Federal Claims will not be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-9\">With regard to the integrity of that fabric, we note that the bankruptcy court is a court of equity rather than law. \u201c[T]his Court has held that for many purposes \u2018courts of bankruptcy are essentially courts of equity, and their proceedings inherently proceedings in equity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pepper v. Litton, </em>308 U.S. at 304, 60 S.Ct. at 244 (holding, in circumstances of case, that <em>res judicata </em>did not bar equitable powers of bankruptcy court) (citations omitted). The precedential effect of the bankruptcy court\u2019s actions on government contract law is circumscribed by its character as a court of equity. If the interest expressed by the Bankruptcy Act in providing fair and expeditious relief to creditors is greater than the interest expressed by the CDA in resolving government contract claims in familiar, and expert, fora, then the district court may, in its discretion, retain jurisdiction over the contract claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">Thus, although jurisdictional and sovereign immunity concerns fall short of requiring the transfer of government contract disputes from a district court sitting in bankruptcy to the Court of Federal Claims, prudence will often counsel such a transfer. In a memorandum opinion, the District Court invited our review of its decision not to transfer Quality\u2019s contract claims back to the Court of Federal Claims. The memorandum opinion was concerned with whether or not the court <em>could </em>refuse the Government\u2019s motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1581\">*1581</page-number>transfer the case, and gave scant attention to <em>why </em>the court has chosen to refuse the motion. Consequently, we vacate the trial court\u2019s denial of the Government\u2019s motion to transfer, and remand the case to the District Court for a ruling on whether that court, in light of this opinion, sees fit to retain jurisdiction over Quality\u2019s government contract claims. Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1055-9\">.

It is true that the Tucker Act contains both a grant of jurisdiction and a waiver of sovereign immunity. <em>United States v.

Thus, a waiver must be \u201cunequivocally expressed\u201d in the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 33, 112 S.Ct. at 1014 (quoting <em>Irwin v.

This is a rule of statutory construction, 503 U.S. at 34-36, 112 S.Ct. at 1015, which guides not only the courts, but also Congress. I agree with the majority that <em>Nordic Village </em>is not controlling on the narrow issue before this court; nevertheless, it sets forth the guiding principles upon which this case should be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-18\">The concept of a waiver of sovereign immunity being forum specific is not new. In <em>Minnesota v. United States, </em>305 U.S. 382, 59 5. Ct. 292, 83 L.Ed. 235 (1939), the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether the courts of the State of Minnesota had jurisdiction over a condemnation proceeding involving Indian lands, when the United States was an indispensable party defendant. Minnesota\u2019s substantive right to obtain a judgment against the United States arose from a statute which provided: \u201c[L]ands allotted in sev-eralty to Indians [in which the United States had an interest] may be condemned for any public purpose under the laws of the State or Territory where located in the same manner as land owned in fee may be condemned, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1582\">*1582</page-number>the money awarded as damages shall be paid to the allottee.\u201d Act of March 3, 1901, ch. 832, \u00a7 3, 31 Stat. 1058, 1083-84. Although the Court was of the opinion that this \u201cauthorization to condemn conferred] by implication permission to sue the United States,\u201d 305 U.S. at 388, 59 S.Ct. at 295, it rejected the State\u2019s argument that the permission extended to suits in Minnesota state courts, <em>id. </em>at 389-90, 59 S.Ct. at 295-96. Instead, it held that the waiver of sovereign immunity was limited to suit in federal district court. <em>Id. </em>at 389, 59 S.Ct. at 295-96. The Court stated that \u201cit rests with Congress to determine not only whether the United States may be sued, but in what courts the suit may be brought,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 388, 59 S.Ct. at 295, and it pointed out that the statute at issue related to Indian lands under trust allotments and that the judicial determination of controversies concerning such lands \u201cha[d] been commonly committed exclusively to federal courts,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 389, 59 S.Ct. at 295-96 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">The Supreme Court had occasion to consider the waiver of sovereign immunity issue again in <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>309 U.S. 495, 60 S.Ct. 659, 84 L.Ed. 888 (1940). In that case, the United States filed in Michigan probate court a judgment it had obtained in federal court against the administrator of a decedent\u2019s estate for damages arising from an act of conversion by the decedent. The probate court allowed the claim and denied an attempt by the administrator to set-off against the judgment in favor of the United States a judgment against the decedent for which the United States had assumed liability. On appeal, the county circuit court held that the set-off was proper to the extent of extinguishing the claim of the United States. That decision was affirmed on appeal by the Michigan Supreme Court and the case was remanded to the probate court for further proceedings. <em>In re McLouth\u2019c Estate, </em>281 Mich. 191, 274 N.W. 759, 766 (1937). On remand, the administrator of the estate petitioned the probate court to allow, as a claim in favor of the estate, the amount by which the judgment for which the United States had assumed liability exceeded the judgment in favor of the United States. The probate court granted the petition and allowed the claim, and the decision was affirmed by the county circuit court. On appeal, the Michigan Supreme Court also affirmed. <em>In re McLouth\u2019s Estate, </em>290 Mich. 311, 287 N.W. 477, 484 (1939). In so doing, the court rejected the argument of the United States that the probate court lacked jurisdiction to enter an affirmative money judgment against it. The basis for this argument was the contention that the United States could not be sued without the express consent of Congress and that such consents were jurisdictional and were to be strictly construed. <em>Id. </em>287 N.W. at 481-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">The Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari </em>The Court framed the issue before it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-7\">Whether that jurisdiction [jurisdiction in the probate court with respect to an affirmative claim against the United States] exists depends upon the effect of the voluntary submission to the Michigan court by the United States of its claim against the estate. As a foundation for the examination of that question we may lay the postulate that without specific statutory consent, no suit may be brought against the United States. No officer by his action can confer jurisdiction. Even when suits are authorized they must be brought only .in designated courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">309 U.S. at 500-01, 60 S.Ct. at 661 (footnotes omitted). The Court pointed out that, by statute, cross-claims against the United States, up to the amount of the government\u2019s claim, were allowed in cases where the government voluntarily sued. <em>Id. </em>at 501, 60 S.Ct. at 661. It also pointed out that \u201c[s]pe-cially designated claims against the United States may be sued upon in the Court of Claims or the district courts under the Tucker Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). The Court stated, however, that it was not its \u201cright to extend the waiver of sovereign immunity more broadly than has been directed by the Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502, 60 S.Ct. at 662. It concluded: \u201cAgainst the background of complete immunity we find no Congressional action modifying the immunity rule in favor of cross-actions beyond the amount necessary as a set-off.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court reversed the decision of the Michigan Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1583\">*1583</page-number>preme Court. <em>See also Hahn v. United States, </em>757 F.2d 581, 586 (3d Cir.1985) (\u201cIt is uniformly held that, for claims exceeding $10,000, the Tucker Act vests <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction in the Claims Court ... even if such claims could be brought within the terms of some other jurisdictional grant, such as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331____ This is because it is only under the terms of the Tucker Act that the United States waives its sovereign immunity to such claims, and this consent to suit is a jurisdictional prerequisite.\u201d (emphasis in original)); <em>In re Prudential Lines, Inc. (Prudential Lines, Inc. v. United States Maritime Admin.), </em>79 B.R. 167, 182 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.1987) (\u201cThe Tucker Act\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity is inextricably tied to its jurisdictional terms.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">While it is true that the doctrine of sovereign immunity has its critics, <em>see, e.g., Nordic Village, </em>503 U.S. at 42-46, 112 S.Ct. at 1019-21 (Stevens, J., dissenting), the doctrine still stands.

For the following reasons, I am unable to reach that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-10\">Congress has specifically limited the government\u2019s exposure to suit in bankruptcy court to the express waivers of immunity contained in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106. Section 106 effects waivers in three situations. First, as was clarified in the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, \u00a7 106(a) waives sovereign immunity where the substantive authority for the cause of action arises from the Bankruptcy Code itself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, \u00a7 106(b) waives sovereign immunity for compulsory counterclaims against government claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Third, \u00a7 106(c) waives sovereign immunity for permissive counterclaims capped by a set-off limitation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-11\">Nowhere in the Bankruptcy Code does one find the language which I believe is necessary in order for one to conclude that Congress has conferred upon the district courts jurisdiction over a contractor\u2019s CDA claim when the government has not asserted a claim in the bankruptcy proceeding. In this regard, the enactment of the 1994 Act is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1584\">*1584</page-number>significant. When Congress enacts legislation, it is presumed to know the pertinent law. <em>See Cannon v. University of Chicago, </em>441 U.S. 677, 699, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1958, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (\u201c[I]t is not only appropriate but also realistic to presume that Congress was thoroughly familiar with these unusually important precedents [regarding implied private rights of action] and that it expected its enactment to be interpreted in conformity with them.\u201d). That means that, when it enacted the amendments to \u00a7 106 cited above, Congress is presumed to have known the law relating to sovereign immunity, including the principle that waivers of sovereign immunity are to be strictly construed in favor of the government and not enlarged beyond statutory terms. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 835, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 42 (1994) U.S.C.C.A.N. pp. 3350, 3351 (\u201cThis amendment [to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106] <em>expressly </em>provides for a waiver of sovereign immunity \u2014 \u201d (emphasis added)). Under these circumstances, I am constrained to conclude that, by not going beyond the point it did in amending \u00a7 106, Congress evinced an intent not to confer upon the district courts jurisdiction to adjudicate claims like Quality\u2019s. <em>See United States v. International Business Machs. Corp., </em>892 F.2d 1006, 1009 (Fed.Cir. 1989) (\u201cHad Congress intended to make the exemptions permanent, it knew how; it could and we believe would have used words of futurity----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">The majority states that \u201c[t]he Tucker Act waives the government\u2019s immunity from suit on its contracts in any court to which congress grants jurisdiction to hear the claim.\u201d Majority op. at 1575-76. Most respectfully, I disagree for two reasons. First, it seems to me that it is in the language of the Bankruptcy Code that we must find the required waiver of sovereign immunity. As just discussed, I am unable to find such a waiver. In addition, I do not believe that the cases upon which the majority relies support its position. In <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. at 212, 103 S.Ct. at 2965, the suit against the government was brought in the forum specified in the statute that effected the waiver of sovereign immunity (Tucker Act case, brought in the Court of Claims), while <em>Franchise Tax Board of California v. United States Postal Service, </em>467 U.S. 512, 515, 104 S.Ct. 2549, 2551, 81 L.Ed.2d 446 (1984), and <em>Keifer &amp; Keifer v. Reconstruction Finance Corp., </em>306 U.S. 381, 392, 59 S.Ct. 516, 519, 83 L.Ed. 784 (1939), both involved \u201csue and be sued\u201d clauses that did not limit where the federal government entity could be sued. I do not believe that, in the face of the law of sovereign immunity and the absence of necessary language in the Bankruptcy Code, these cases are adequate to the task of carrying one from Point A (the forum-specific waiver of sovereign immunity in the Tucker Act) to Point B (the conclusion that the district court has concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of Federal Claims over Quality\u2019s CDA claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-9\">Finally, I believe that one additional point should be noted. In my view, the implications inherent in the majority opinion are also pertinent in seeking to determine whether Congress intended the waiver of sovereign immunity which the majority has found. It seems to me that the conclusion which flows logically from the majority opinion is that, in bankruptcy cases with facts similar to those here, the district courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of Federal Claims over the kinds of claims that are traditionally brought in that court; for example, claims involving an alleged taking of property by the government in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Causby, </em>328 U.S. 256, 267, 66 S.Ct. 1062, 1068-69, 90 L.Ed. 1206 (1946); military pay claims, <em>see, e.g., Matias v. United States, </em>923 F.2d 821, 823 (Fed.Cir.1990); and claims asserting an entitlement to money under a federal statute or regulation, <em>see, e.g., Rogers v. Ink, </em>766 F.2d 430, 436 (10th Cir.1985) (directing the transfer of a claim of statutory entitlement to federal funds to the United States Claims Court), <em>cert, denied following post-transfer adjudication, </em>490 U.S. 1034, 109 S.Ct. 1930, 104 L.Ed.2d 403 (1989). When the amount in controversy has exceeded $10,000, pursuant to the Tucker Act, such cases have come under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims or its predecessors. Congress certainly could change all this, but the change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1585\">*1585</page-number>would be radical. For this reason, I believe that before we effectively hold that there has been such a change, we must find clear and unambiguous language. I am unable to find such language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I would hold that the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama lacks jurisdiction in this matter. Accordingly, I would reverse the decision below and transfer the case to the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">.

In this regard, the 1994 Act changed the statute so as to compel a result different from the one reached in <em>Nordic Village. </em>In that case, the bankruptcy trustee commenced an action against the United <em>States, </em>contending that an unauthorized, post-petition transfer of funds from the estate to the government could be avoided under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 549(a) and the funds recovered from the government under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550(a)'. 503 U.S. at 30-32, 112 S.Ct. at 1013.
