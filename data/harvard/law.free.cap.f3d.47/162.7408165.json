JONES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">This appeal arises from the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity to police chief Van Horn of Granite Shoals, Texas. The court\u2019s interlocutory order on that point of law does not, however, reflect the real significance of this case. The facts before us illustrate a common misperception that the United States Constitution offers a remedy for every conceivable controversy between a citizen and government officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">Dottie Cathey loved cats and dogs, a number of which she nurtured at her house. Her neighbor, Dennis Guenther, loved birds, which he watched at his feeders, and he liked to keep his house and yard neat and orderly. As citizens of Granite Shoals, they shared a common problem: stray animals. Granite Shoals is too small to maintain an animal pound, so stray dogs and cats roam about, defecating in Guenther\u2019s yard, boldly attacking his trash cans, although they were stored in a screen-enclosed porch, and fighting at all hours of the day and night. Both cats and dogs committed these trespasses, to Guen-ther\u2019s dismay.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">Guenther asked the town police chief for advice on several occasions. The testimony conflicts over exactly what he was told. As Cathey describes it, Chief Van Horn informed Guenther that he could shoot stray animals on his property if they were damaging it. If this is accurate, Van Horn\u2019s advice may have contradicted two municipal ordinances, one preventing the discharge of firearms inside the town and the other prohibiting cruelty to animals. Van Horn denies any such intemperate language and insists that he qualified his advice carefully. He asserts he told Guenther to determine first whether the animals were really homeless and second, to trap them or spray them with water, not to shoot them.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-16\">Whatever the truth of the matter, Cathey claims that Guenther shot and killed her little black cat when it strayed onto Guen-ther\u2019s property one afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-17\">To Cathey, Guenther\u2019s foul deed demanded retribution to the fullest extent of the law. She preferred criminal complaints against him and then filed suit against Guenther, Van Horn, police officer Arther and the Town of Granite Shoals in state court, seeking damages under state common law and federal constitutional provisions. The public defendants removed the case to federal court, some discovery took place, and Van Horn moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. The district court, expressing serious misgivings that a case of this sort ought to be tried in federal court, nevertheless felt compelled to deny qualified immunity. The court\u2019s decision focused on the ambiguity in the evidence regarding what Chief Van Horn told Guenther he could do to get rid of stray animals.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-18\">In our view, proper analysis of this case begins at an earlier point. Cathey alleges a deprivation of her property, <em>i.e. </em>her cat,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> without due process of law. She asserts that Chief Van Horn effected \u201ca taking\u201d of the property without due process by advising Guenther, contrary to local ordinances, that Guenther could shoot stray animals on his property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has instructed us to consider, before the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>qualified immunity, whether the plaintiffs complaint states a cognizable constitutional cause of action. <em>Siegert v. Gilley, </em>500 U.S. 226, 282, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 1793, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991). Contrary to the district court\u2019s assumption, Supreme Court opinions have foreclosed a procedural due process claim in this sort of case.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Ordinarily, the state may not take property from an individual without providing pre-deprivation notice and a hearing. <em>Zinermon v. Burch, </em>494 U.S. 113, 127, 110 S.Ct. 975, 984, 108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990) (\u201cusually\u201d Constitution \u201crequires some kind of hearing <em>before </em>the state deprives a person of liberty or property\u201d). Some types of takings, however, cannot fairly be attributed to the state because they represent the random and unauthorized actions of state actors. Thus, in <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984), the Supreme Court held that no \u00a7 1983 claim exists if a person\u2019s property has been taken by such random and unauthorized conduct and if the state provides an adequate post-deprivation remedy, for instance, in state tort law. <em>Id. </em>at 533, 104 S.Ct. at 3203-04. (\u201c[W]e hold that an unauthorized intentional deprivation of property by a state employee does not constitute a [constitutional] violation ... if a meaningful post-deprivation remedy for the loss is available.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">As Cathey\u2019s pleadings demonstrate, Texas common law supplies several causes of action to remedy Chief Van Horn\u2019s unlawful \u201ctaking\u201d of her cat. The adequacy of state post-deprivation remedies founded on these remedies is not at issue. Absent such an argument, however, no state action sufficient to support a constitutional claim has occurred. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cFor intentional, as for negligent deprivations of property by state employees, the state\u2019s action is not complete until and unless it provides or refuses to provide a suitable post deprivation remedy.\u201d) Cathey insists, without benefit of supporting authority, that <em>Hudson </em>does not apply because Van Horn\u2019s action could not have been random or unauthorized because he was the police chief. We disagree. The scope of his authority is gauged by state law, <em>Jett v. Dallas Independent School Dist., </em>491 U.S. 701, 737, 109 S.Ct. 2702, 2723-24, 105 L.Ed.2d 598 (1989), and we fail to discern any authorization for the police chief to give private citizens legal advice directly contrary to the laws he must enforce. Without a link to state practice or procedure, in the narrow context of deprivations of property, <em>Hudson </em>forecloses any federal constitutional claim and compels the grant of summary judgment on behalf of Chief Van Horn.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The order of the district court denying qualified immunity to Chief Van Horn is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss the federal constitutional law claims against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">REVERSED and REMANDED with INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-13\">.

Cathey also alleges denial of equal protection of the laws under the 14th amendment. Since she concedes that the issue was not raised in the district court, we find it waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\">. Cathey also maintains that by instructing Guenther to shoot at stray animals. Van Horn placed her in danger. No state, however, has an affirmative duty to protect its citizens unless the state imposes some restraint on personal liberty increasing the danger to the individual. <em>DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept., </em>489 U.S. 189, 199-200, 109 S.Ct. 998, 1005-06, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989). Cathey has failed to allege a state-created condition distinct from other members of the general public.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
