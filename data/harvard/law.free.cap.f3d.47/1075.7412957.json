Brown (\u201cBrown\u201d) with one count of possession of a firearm while being a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e), and one count of possession of crack cocaine with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-12\">Prior to trial, Brown filed a motion to suppress statements and evidence that law enforcement officers had obtained from Brown after they had conducted an investigatory stop of Brown\u2019s car. A United States magistrate judge conducted a hearing on Brown\u2019s motion and, following the hearing, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation recommending that Brown\u2019s motion be denied. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and denied the motion. Brown then filed a motion for severance of charges under Rule 14, Fed.R.Crim.P., arguing that he was \u201csubstantially and specifically prejudiced by the joinder of [the] offenses for trial.\u201d Rl-28. The district court also denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-14\">After a trial by jury, Brown was found guilty of both of the counts charged in the indictment. During his sentencing hearing Brown argued that he should not be subject to the enhanced penalty provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 because he had not been indicted for or waived indictment for the prior state offenses that triggered the application of those provisions. The district court rejected that argument and sentenced Brown to mandatory concurrent terms of life imprisonment. Brown then perfected this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-16\">The issues Brown presents in this appeal are (1) whether the district court erred in denying Brown\u2019s motion to suppress evidence; (2) whether the district court erred in denying Brown\u2019s motion to sever; and (3) whether 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(2) requires that a predicate offense underlying a sentence enhancement must be the result of a prosecution by indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-17\">Because we are persuaded by the record that there is no merit to any of the arguments Brown makes in support of the first two issues, we summarily affirm the district court\u2019s orders concerning them. Because the third issue presents a question of first impression in this circuit, it warrants discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-18\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-19\">Brown was sentenced under the mandatory statutory minimum set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The statute directs that a defendant who has more than two prior convictions for a felony drug offense and subsequently is convicted of possession with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine is subject to life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). In order to establish the legitimacy of those prior convictions, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 provides that the government must file with the court an information stating the previous convictions to be relied upon. In addition, the statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1170-20\">An information may not be filed under this section if the increased punishment which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>may be imposed is imprisonment for a term in excess of three years unless the person either waived or was afforded prosecution by indictment for the offense for which such increased punishment may be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1171-4\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">Brown contends in this appeal that because his prior state convictions were based upon the filing of informations, rather than the return of indictments or waiver of indictments, the sentence enhancement provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 851 do not apply. This argument is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), a defendant who is guilty of possessing with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine is subject to a mandatory term of life imprisonment if the offense was committed after two or more prior convictions for felony drug offenses have <em>become </em>final. The term \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d includes \u201ca felony under any law of a State or a foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marijuana or depressant or stimulant substances.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-7\">If the government intends to ask the sentencing court to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to section 841(b)(1)(A) based on the defendant\u2019s prior convictions, the government must file an information setting forth the prior convictions on which the government intends to rely. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1). Brown\u2019s argument that these prior convictions must have been brought by indictment or pursuant to waiver of indictment is premised on 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-8\">Four circuit courts of appeals have addressed the argument that Brown asserts in this case, and all four courts have agreed that section 851(a)(2) permits the government to seek the enhanced penalty so long as the current offense of conviction (rather than the \u201ctriggering offenses\u201d) resulted from an indictment or the waiver of an indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-9\">In <em>United States v. Espinosa, </em>827 F.2d 604 (9th Cir.1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 968, 108 S.Ct. 1243, 99 L.Ed.2d 441 (1988), the Ninth Circuit held that the reference in section 851(a)(2) to \u201cprosecution by indictment\u201d refers to the charge of conviction. The court reached this conclusion for three reasons. First, \u201ca common-sense reading of the phrase \u2018offense for which such increased punishment may be imposed\u2019 is the current, or latest, offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617. Second, the court recognized that, when Congress used the term \u201coffense\u201d in section 851, it was referring to the current offense. Whenever Congress referred to the \u201cprior conviction\u201d or the so-called \u201ctriggering conviction,\u201d it used the words \u201cprior conviction\u201d or \u201cprevious conviction.\u201d The <em>court reasoned, </em>\u201cHad Congress intended [the defendant\u2019s] interpretation, it seems that the phrase simply would have read \u2018prosecution by indictment in the prior conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>' Third, the court recognized that it was Congress\u2019s intention in 1984 to broaden the scope of enhancements in \u00a7 841(b) for prior convictions rather than to limit the scope. <em>Id. </em>If the court had adopted Brown\u2019s argument, the scope of the enhancement would have been severely limited because many states do not charge by indictment but rather use informa-tions or complaints to charge felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-11\">In <em>United States v. Adams, </em>914 F.2d 1404 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1015, 111 S.Ct. 588, 112 L.Ed.2d 593 (1990), the Tenth Circuit expressly adopted the reasoning employed by .the Ninth Circuit in <em>Espinosa. </em>The <em>Adams </em>court recognized that the words \u201coffense for which\u201d in section 851 may be vague when read alone but, in context, \u201cthe correct meaning is plainly discernible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1407. The court held that the triggering offense need not have been charged by indictment or by information following a waiver of indictment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-12\">In <em>United States v. Burrell, </em>963 F.2d 976 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 357, 121 L.Ed.2d 270 (1992), the Seventh Circuit also held that the prior convictions that trigger the 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 enhancement need not have been brought by indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 992. The court in <em>Burrell </em>followed the analysis adopted by the <em>Espinosa </em>and <em>Adams </em>courts, characterizing these decisions as \u201ccareful[ly] reason[ed].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 993. Moreover, in <em>United States v. Trevino-Rodriquez, </em>994 F.2d 533 (8th Cir.1993), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>Eighth Circuit adopted the same reasoning of the other circuits stating, \u201cWe agree with our sister circuits and hold that the language of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(2) refers to the prosecution of the current offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">The reasoning adopted by each of our sister circuits in holding that the language of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(2) refers to the prosecution of the current offense is sound. Accordingly, we adopt that same reasoning and reject Brown\u2019s claim that a defendant\u2019s sentence may not be enhanced pursuant to section 851 unless the \u201ctriggering offenses\u201d were charged by indictment or by information following waiver of indictment. Therefore, we affirm Brown\u2019s convictions and sentences in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
