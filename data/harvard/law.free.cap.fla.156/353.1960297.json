There is no burden resting on the defendant to prove or otherwise establish his innocence. The burden of proving the defendant guilty of the offense charged, beyond a reasonable doubt, is upon the State. Before there can be a conviction of the defendant, the State must prove all the material elements of the alleged offense. If from the evidence introduced, or from a lack of evidence, you entertain a reasonable doubt as to whether or not the defendant committed said offense, you should acquit the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Which was refused and exception noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The Court had in the general charge instructed the jury as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">\u201cA doubt which is not suggested by, or does not arise from the evidence is not a reasonable doubt, and should not be considered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">We think in view of this condition that the refusal to give the requested charge, <em>supra, </em>constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">Charges of this character were discussed in Wallace v. State, 41 Fla. 547, 26 So. 713. See text Fla. page 580. See also Sims v. State, 54 Fla. 100, 44 So. 737, Vasquez v. State, 54 Fla. 127, 44 So. 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">In State v. Andrews, 77 N.J.L. 108, 71 Atl. 109, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-13\">\u201c . . . the instruction that a reasonable doubt must be one founded upon some evidence that was presented in the case was erroneous, as it excluded all reasonable doubt that may have arisen from the lack or want of evidence. Mackey v. People, 2 Colo. 13; McElven v. State, 30 Ga. 869; Brown v. State, 105 Ind. 385, 5 N.E. 900; Wright v. State, 69 Ind. 163, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>35 Am. Rep. 212; Densmore v. State, 67 Ind. 306, 33 Am. Rep. 96; State v. Case, 96 Iowa 264, 65 N.W. 149; Hale v. State, 72 Miss. 140, 16 South, 387; Bray v. State, 41 Tex. 560; Bland v. State, 4 Tex. App. 15.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">See also Kelley v. State, 112 Miss. 245, 72 So. 928.</p>\n<p id=\"A4xX\">In Walker v. State, 82 Fla. 465, 9 So. 376, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">\u201cThe 9th ground of the motion for a new trial is predicated upon the instruction to the jury on reasonable doubt in which this language is used: \u2018A doubt which is not suggested by or does not arise from the evidence is not a reasonable doubt, and should not be considered.\u2019 It is contended th\u00e1t the words \u2018or lack of evidence\u2019 should have been, included in the charge. While there seems to be much force in this contention, this court in the ease of Vasquez v. State, 54 Fla. 127, 44 South. Rep. 739, held that the absence of these words is not ground for reversal; notwithstanding a reason\u00e1ble doubt, as to a person\u2019s guilt may arise more readily from lack of evidence than from evidence itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">We are not prepared to overrule the Vasquez case, <em>supra, </em>but we think if the charge of reasonable doubt always contained the additional words \u2018or lack of evidence\u2019 it would state the true.rule more clearly, and remove all criticism that the instruction without these words is misleading, and tends to prejudice the rights of a person on trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">This case is to be differentiated from the Walker case in: that in the Walker case there was no affirmative request for the giving of the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">In December, 1929, the Supreme Court of Iowa, which had theretofore held in harmony with our Walker case, <em>supra, </em>had before it the case of State v. Anderson, 209 Iowa 510, 228 N.W. 353, 67 A.L.R. 1366, in which it, in a well reasoned opinion, overruled its former holding in this regard and reversed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">, We adopt the reasoning and conclusion reached, in that opinion. \u25a0 \u25a0 \u2022 \u2022 . \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"AqiI\">TERRELL,' BROWN and ADAMS, JJ\u201e. concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"pAvP\">CHAPMAN, C. J., THOMAS and SEBRING, dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>CHAPMAN, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ANqS\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">I think the conclusion reached .is a departure from our ruling in cases viz: Walker v. State, 82 Fla. 465, 90 So. 376, where we held that \u201cor the lack of evidence,\u201d while subject to criticism, was not reversible error; Vasque v. State, 54 Fla. 127, 44 So. 739, where the words \u201cor the lack of evidence\u201d was not\u2019ground for reversal. The rule was reaffirmed by this Court in Bennet v. State, 127 Fla. 759, 173 So. 817; reaffirmed in Kimball v. State, 134 Fla. 849, 184 So. 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">, In State v. Anderson, 209 Iowa 510, 228 N.W. 353, 67 A.L.R. 1366, the cited cases hold that two states \u2014 Mississippi and Missouri \u2014 hold to the minority rule viz: that in a definition of reasonable doubt, omitting \u201cor the lack of evidence\u201d is reversible error. Most other states, inclusive of Florida, hold that it is not reversible error to omit \u201cor the lack of evidence\u201d from a charge defining reasonable doubt. See 67 A.L.R. 1379. Florida is committed to the rule that the omission of the words \u201cor the lack of evidence\u201d from a charge defining reasonable doubt is not erroneous.</p>\n<judges id=\"b380-6\">THOMAS and SEBRING, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
