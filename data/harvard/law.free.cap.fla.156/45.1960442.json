That the members of the Commerce and Reciprocal Trade Committee of the House of Representatives are hereby authorized to make such trips as the majority of them may deem necessary to attend sessions of the Legislatures of other states, to confer with committees of other states; and to attend conferences of the Council of State Governments and of such similar organizations as the committee may deem necessary in order to carry out and fulfill the duties of said committee to the fullest possible extent, and the authority hereby conferred shall continue until the 1947 session of the Florida Legislature; and that expense allowances shall be made to said committee as hereinafter provided, and that the expenses of the committee in attending the session of the Georgia Legislature on February 15, 1945, shall be reimbursed in the manner as hereinafter provided for expenses of like character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">\" \u2018Section 2.

The proper officials of the State of Florida are hereby directed to pay to the said committee or its members the sum provided herein for each trip, upon the requisition of the committee, or a majority of the membership thereof, the same to be paid in the same manner as other legislative expense is paid.

CALDWELL,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARO\">Governor\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The subject matter of this letter, Resolution No. 17, 1945 session, is to be differentiated from House Resolution No. 27 because House Resolution No. 17, supra, shows on its face that it is proposed to pay the expenses of a legislative committee, the activities of which were performed and are to be performed outside the legislative session.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">We are, therefore, of the opinion that the items suggested by Resolution No. 17 are not such as to be payable as a part of the legislative expense and that the purpose of the resolution may only be accomplished by a statute duly enacted by the Legislature making the appropriation for the payment of the items contemplated in this resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Respectifully,</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">ROY H.
