Our construction of the statute, Section 230.23, sub-section 6, sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), supra, is that it grants the authority to the County Board of Public Instruction to take such action as was taken in the instant case where the facts and circumstances justify it. This was the holding of the Circuit Judge and he found from the evidence submitted to him, and which is contained in the transcript of the record here, that there was no abuse of the discretion vested by the statute in the said Board. It has not been made to appear that the Circuit Judge was in error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">There was no effort by the Board in this case to change the boundaries of school districts to consolidate school dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>tricts but it merely sought to establish attendance areas and to provide for the transportation and attendance at designated schools of children residing within the designated attendance areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The decree appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b808-6\">CHAPMAN, C.
