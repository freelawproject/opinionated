Although the defendant interposed the plea of self-defense the jury did not believe his version of the controversy, but chose to believe, the testimony offered by the prosecution. The defendant was given a fair trial by an impartial judge and jury and the evidence amply sustains the verdict and judgment. The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b44-5\">CHAPMAN, C. J., TERRELL, BROWN, BUFORD, THOMAS, ADAMS and SEBRING,.
