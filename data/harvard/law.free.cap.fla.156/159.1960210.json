The transcript of record was filed here on the 23rd day of March, 1945. No brief has been filed in behalf of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The Attorney General has filed his motion praying that the judgment against the defendants be affirmed on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The appellants filed in the lower court notice of grounds upon which they rely for reversal of the judgment. There is one ground specified reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">\u201cThe court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion as a whole for a new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">The defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial was upon the following grounds, to-wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">\u201c1. The verdict is contrary to the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">\u201c2. The verdict is contrary to the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">\u201c3. The verdict is contrary to the law and the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-12\">\u201c4. The evidence does not justify a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree against these defendants, or either of them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">The verdict was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-14\">\u201cWe the jury find the defendants guilty of first degree murder as charged. Recommend mercy of court. So say we all.\u201d Signed \u201cL. E. Tidwell, Foreman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-15\">We have carefully examined the record and find no reversible error reflected therein. Therefore, judgment is affirmed as to each and every of said defendants, appellants here.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-16\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b184-17\">CHAPMAN, C.
