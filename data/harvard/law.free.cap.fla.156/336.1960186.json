This is especially true because the record shows that after the plaintiff had closed its case in chief and after the motion had been denied to direct a verdict in favor of the defendant and after the defendant had introduced his testimony, the main witness for the prosecution was recalled to the stand and materially changed a part of his testimony so as to contradict positive statements which he had made when testifying in the case in chief and also contradicting positive statements which he had made in the preliminary trial as to a material fact and without this latter testimony the evidence would not have supported the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The record shows that the information was filed on the 24th day of November, 1944; that the trial was thereafter set to be had on the 28th of November and that on the 27th of November counsel for the accused filed a motion showing that defendant\u2019s counsel had not had time to prepare for the trial of the case and praying for an order postponing the trial for only \u201ctwo or three days\u201d to give counsel time to properly prepare for the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">We think that when the motion for a new trial was presented it had been demonstrated by the occurrences in and at the trial that this motion should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Therefore, on authority of the opinion and judgment in Tedelton v. State, 131 Fla. 106, 178 So. 909 and Coker v. State, 82 Fla. 5, 89 Sou. 222, the judgment should be reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b362-7\">CHAPMAN, C. J., TERRELL and BROWN, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b362-8\">THOMAS, ADAMS and SEBRING, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
