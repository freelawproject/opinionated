She waived a jury and was tried before the court. The only question we consider essential to discuss is whether the evidence is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-16\">Appellant is a naturopath physician and the deceased came to her for treatment. It is the state\u2019s contention that appellant produced an abortion on deceased which resulted in her death. It is appellant\u2019s contention that deceased had the abortion when she first saw her and that she merely treated her for the after effects. It would serve no useful purpose to detail at length the evidence pro and con on these contentions. We have studied it carefully and find it inadequate to satisfy the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-17\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b730-18\">TERRELL, BROWN and BUFORD, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AWO\">CHAPMAN, C.
