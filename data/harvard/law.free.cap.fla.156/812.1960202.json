That claimant suffered an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment with Pan American Airways, Inc., on May 22, 1943.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-6\">\u201c2. That claimant suffered a recurrence of said injury while in the employ of the Pan American Airways, Inc., on November 3, 1943.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-7\">\u201c3. That claimant suffered a recurrence of said injury while in the employ of Miami Air Depot in July of 1944.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-8\">\u201c4. That claimant has been totally disabled since July 4, 1944, as a result of said injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-9\">\u201c5. That claimant is in need of further medical attention.\u201d and thereupon made an award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">The award made by the deputy commissioner was appealed to the full Commission and the full Commission, after consideration thereof, affirmed the award. Thereupon appeal was taken to the Circuit Court and was heard by Judges Ross Williams, Richard Hunt and George E. Holt. Judges Hunt and Holt, upon findings states by them, reversed the award, while Judge Williams was of the opinion that the award should be affirmed and dissented from the opinion and judgment of Judges Hunt and Holt.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">We find that the record overwhelmingly supports the findings of the Deputy Commissioner and, in fact, makes a stronger cas\u00e9 than that presented by the findings of the Deputy Commissioner. It will be observed that the Deputy Commissioner found that in the lifting of a bag of sand in November, 1943, the claimant <em>\u201csuffered a recurrence </em>(emphasis ours) of the injury to his back\u201d . . . \u201cand on or about July 1, 1944, while in the employ of the Miami Air Depot <em>suffered a recurrence </em>(emphasis ours) of the injury to his back when he attempted to lift a propeller blade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">We think that evidence clearly shows that the incident which happened in November, 1943, was not a <em>recurrence of the injury </em>to his back which occurred on May 22, 1943, but was the result of that injury from which he had never re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>covered, and a manifestation of the continuance of that injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">We are also convinced that the incident which happened on or about July 1, 1944, was not a <em>recurrence of the injury </em>of May <em>22, </em>1943, but was the result of that injury and a manifestation of the continuance of that injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The facts appear to be that the man was seriously injured on May 22, 1943, by being struck in the back at about the base of the spine by a large buffer, from which injury he never recovered, and which injury so disabled him that he was unable thereafter to perform the sort of work which he had been accustomed to perform, and which injury caused his back to remain in such condition that attempting to lift heavy weights caused him great pain and suffering and make it impossible for him to continue at work. He demonstrated an exemplary spirit in making an honest effort to continue to earn a livelihood, regardless of his injury, for which we do not think he should be penalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The judgment of the Circuit Court should be, and is reversed with directions to affirm the award of the Florida Industrial Commission and also to enter a judgment for attorney\u2019s fees to be paid to Petitioner\u2019s attorney both for his services in the Circuit Court and in this Court in such sum as the Circuit Judges may determine is just and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b838-9\">CHAPMAN, C. J., TERRELL and ADAMS, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
