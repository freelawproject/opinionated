Such possession as the plaintiffs held was possession under the lease and was not delivery of the property under a contract of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">As we read the record, the evidence is insufficient to establish the authority of Mrs. Cooper as agent for her husband to execute the lease, but, on the contrary, the record shows that Mrs. Cooper signed the lease with option to purchase in duplicate and left one copy with the lessees or their agents and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>took the other copy to Key West for the purpose of having it executed by Charles Cooper. He declined to execute it because of the inclusion of the option to purchase. The property was held by the Coopers as an estate by the entireties and for a contract to be binding it had to be executed by both parties, or by persons in their behalf duly authorized as their agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We think the decree should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b559-7\">BROWN, THOMAS and SEBRING, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b559-8\">CHAPMAN, C.
