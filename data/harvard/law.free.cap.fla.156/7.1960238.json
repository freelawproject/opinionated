A copy of the contract-is attached to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>and made a part of the declaration and is in the following words and figures, viz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">\u201cThis Agreement, made and entered into this 28th day of September A.

The declaration then alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">\u201cPlaintiffs further allege that at the time of execution of said contract hereinabove referred to and copy of which is attached as Exhibit \u2018A,\u2019 the said Board of Public Instruction on the 28th day of September, 1926, did cause to be executed seven (7) certain promissory notes as part of the purchase price for said real estate hereinabove described, said notes' being in the principal aggregate sum of $114,000.00 and said notes being numbered No. 1, for the principal sum of $2,000.00; No. 5 in the principal sum of $10,000.00; No. 6 in the principal sum of $10,000.00; No. 7 in the principal sum of $2,500.00; No. 8 in the principal sum of $6,166.66; No. 11, in the principal sum of $41,666.66 and No. 12, in the principal sum of $41,666.68, a photostatic copy of each of said notes being made a part hereof and attached hereto as Exhibits \u2018C\u2019 through T; said notes being made payable to the order of Whitphel Properties, Inc., and each of said notes drawing interest at the rate of 8% per annum from date until paid and each of said notes waiving demand, notice of non-payment and protest as well as providing for reasonable, attorneys fee to be paid by the maker thereof in the event the same was not paid at maturity and placed in the hands of attorneys for collection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">\u201cPlaintiff, Grace Whiting Wicker, further alleges that she is the owner of each of said notes, photostatic copies of which are hereto attached, having acquired the same in due course by proper endorsement as appears on the back of each of said notes hereto attached and that she is such owner and holder of each of said notes at this time and that there has been nothing paid on any of said notes but that the total amount of principal and interest provided for by the terms and tenor of said notes is now long past due, owing and payable to the plaintiffs and that the said Board of Public Instruction of Dade County, Florida, has failed and refused to pay said notes or any part thereof, principal or interest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>although demand has been duly made upon the said Board of Public Instruction for the payment thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-4\">\u201cPlaintiffs further allege that soon after the acquisition of said real estate, hereinabove described, by the Board of Public Instruction of Dade County, Florida, for school site purposes the said property was exempted from taxation as school property and has been so exempt down to the present time and that this benefit of exemption of said premises as school property has been accepted by the said Board of Public Instruction throughout the period of its exemption from taxes, the said Board having full knowledge throughout the entire period that exemption was being made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-5\">\u201cPlaintiffs further allege that after the execution of the contract and notes hereinabove referred to, copies of which are made Exhibits hereto, to-wit, on the 2nd day of November, 1927, a regular meeting of the said Board of Public Instruction, a demand for payment was made upon the said Board and said Board recognized the said notes as a valid, subsisting outstanding, unpaid obligation and directed that the then holder of said notes be advised of the Board\u2019s then existing financial condition and that said Board was unable at said time to make payment of said notes, a copy of said minutes being hereto attached and marked Exhibit \u2018J\u2019 and made a part hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">\u201cPlaintiffs further allege that the said Board of Public Instruction of Dade County filed in the Circuit Court of said County on the common law side thereof on January the 20th 1942, a condemnation proceeding seeking to condemn under the authority vested in said Board by law certain lands adjacent to the lands hereinabove described and in said petition for condemnation the said Board of Public Instruction among other things alleged:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">\u201c \u2018That under the aforesaid Constitution and Laws of the State of Florida,' your petitioner is empowered and it is made the duty of petitioner to acquire school sites and to erect school buildings, and in the acquisition of such school sites to provide for recreational playground facilities, having due regard for the convenience of the public, the convenience and safety of the students and of the instructional personnel of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>the several school centers of said County of Dade, state aforesaid; that in the performance of its duty and in the exercise of its powers and discretion aforesaid, the petitioner acquired and now is the owner of a certain school site situate . . . the same being known and designated as Block Three (3) of Kensington Park, Seventh Street Addition, according to plat, of said Kensington Park, recorded in Plat Book 30 at page 32 of the Public Records of Dade County, Florida, . . .\u2019 said petition having been signed by J. G. Turner, Chairman of the Board of Public Instruction of Dade County and attested by James Wilson, Secretary of said Board and under the seal of said Board and that said condemnation suit terminated in the acquisition of the property sought to be condemned and the title to the condemned property is now held by said Board. Copy of said condemnation petition being attached hereto and marked Exhibit \u2018K\u2019 and made a part hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\">\u201cPlaintiffs further allege that the Board of Public Instruction of Dade County, Florida, acquired said real estate herein-above described for school purposes and executed as a part of the purchase price thereof, the notes, photostatic copies of which are hereto attached, and that they owned, held and made use of said real estate for school site purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">This Court has repeatedly upheld the authority of a Board of Public Instruction to purchase lands for school purposes. See Board of Public Instruction v. Cassidy, 122 Fla. 536, 155 So. 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The declaration is on an obligation arising as the result of an executed <em>contract. </em>See Board of Public Instruction v. Cassidy, supra, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">This case comes squarely within the doctrine enunciated in the Cassidy case, supra, wherein we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-9\">\u201cBoard of Public Instruction which accepted deed to land for school purposes and failed to pay for land or to exercise its option to reconvey, <em>held </em>estopped to deny liability to vendor for purchase price.\u201d (Comp. Gen. Laws 1927, Sec. 561).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">The notes involved here are void as independent obligations (Babcock v. Board of Pub. Instr. of Dade Co., 104 Fla. 693, 140 So. 694; First National Bank of Key West v. Board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Public Instr. of Dade County, 107 Fla. 525, 145 So. 203), but they are relevant as evidence of the agreed purchase price of the land involved and, when transferred by endorsement, constitute a transfer of the cause of action under the contract. The endorsement of the notes to the plaintiff passed all rights and remedies resting in the endorser. See Am. Jur. page 74, Sec. 339, also Ellison v. Henion, 183 Cal. 171, 190 P. 793, 11 A.L.R. 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">The declaration does not entirely fail to state a cause of action on which plaintiff may recover. Therefore, judgment is reversed with directions to vacate the judgment and the order sustaining demurrer to declaration on authority of Zorn v. Britton, 112 Fla. 579, 150 So. 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b38-6\">CHAPMAN, C. J., TERRELL, THOMAS and ADAMS, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b38-7\">BROWN and SEBRING, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b38-8\">BROWN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZ\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">I think the appellant\u2019s only remedy, if any, is in equity under the doctrine laid down in Special Tax School District v. Hillman, 131 Fla. 725, 179 So. 805. In view of our decisions in Babcock v. Board of Public Instruction of Dade County and First National Bank of Key West against the same board, cited, in the opinion of Mr. Justice BUFORD, I do not see how the trial court could have rendered any judgment in favor of appellant on these notes, which were of the same series as those sued on in the two cited cases.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
