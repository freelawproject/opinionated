THE CITY TREASURER OF THE CITY OF ELIZABETH, DEFENDANT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b350-5\">Submitted February 23, 1911</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ae8_\">Decided June 6, 1911.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b350-6\">1. Where an ordinance provides that when a railroad train shall stand on a sidewalk or crossing for a longer period than five minutes, the person in charge of the train shall break the same upon the request of any pedestrian, or other person wishing to go over the crossing, and a suit is brought for a penalty for refusing to break the train, the complaint must set out that there was a request to have the train broken by one wishing to go over the crossing.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b350-7\">2. In a suit for a penalty under an ordinance which forbids a train of cars to obstruct a sidewalk for a longer period than is absolutely necessary for the safe discharge of passengers, and the making up and drilling of freight and coal trains, a complaint which fails to aver that the train had obstructed the crossing longer than was absolutely necessary for either of such purposes is insufficient.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-8\">On <em>certiorari </em>to review judgment imposing penalty for violation of ordinance relating to obstructing streets at railroad crossings.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b350-9\">Before Justices Swayze, Bergen .and Minturn.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-10\">Eor the prosecutor, <em>George Holmes.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-11\">For the defendant, <em>James Q.

Tlie complaint does not aver that the crossing was obstructed longer than it was absolutely necessary for the purposes permitted by the ordinance, nor that any pedestrian or other person wishing to go over the crossing had requested the person in charge of the train to break tlie train after the obstruction bad continued five minutes, for all that appears in this complaint the complainant may not have wished to cross, but to annoy the trainmen by compelling them to break the train without the reason therefore required by the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">This ordinance was under consideration in <em>Central Railroad Co. </em>v. Elizabeth, 35 <em>Vroom </em>534, where it was held that one or the other of these conditions must appear in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The proceedings and judgment under review are set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
