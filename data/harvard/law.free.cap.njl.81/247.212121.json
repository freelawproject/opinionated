To a declaration in an action for damages for an injury resulting to the plaintiff, an employe of the defendant, the defendant jileaded a release under seal of all claims for damages, to which plea the plaintiff replied that the release was executed and delivered on Sunday. To this replication the defendant rejoined that the release was executed in consideration of the re-employment of the plaintiff at his old wages, and <em>the </em>payment of his medical bills, and that such medical bills and wages had been paid' on secular days, and that the defendant was ready to perform its promises.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b287-10\">2.

This, however, is a mistake. The rejoinder is not intended to set up a new ground of defence. It is intended to fortify the plea, to exhibit facts which, notwithstanding the execution of the release on a Sunday, yet leaves it a defence to plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The question is whether the facts pleaded accomplish this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">It is insisted by the defendant that the contract was not completed on Sunday. This insistence is based upon the facts set out in the rejoinder respecting the consideration for the release, namely, that the defendant would do certain things in the future. The point uiwed is that the release, was not a completed contract until these things were done.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">But the fact that the consideration for a contract may consist of certain executory acts to he done in the future does not affect the completeness of the contract. The obligation can be completed, although performance may lie in the future. In the case of <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Nivison, </em>5 <em>Buch. </em>241, cited in support of the proposition of the defendant, the obligation only became effective when approved by the principal to the transaction, and that approval was not obtained until Monday. In the present ease, the obligation would have been completed if its execution and delivery had been on a secular day instead of on Sunday, and therefore the release was completed on a Sunday.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">It is again insisted that a contract is held invalid upon the ground that it was executed on Sunday only when one is invoking some affirmative action upon the strength of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">It is, of course, clear that a court will not aid any party who asks judicial assistance by force of a completed Sunday contract. Whether the contract is invoked in aid of the plaintiff or the defendant, the fact that reliance is put upon the contract to support a right of action, or a right of defence, leaves the contract open to attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">In the present case, the defendant asked affirmative action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>by seeking by virtue of the contract of release, to bar the right of the plaintiff to an action which would otherwise exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">We think there is no immunity from attack upon this ground!</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In the argument of the counsel for the defendant, it is not definitely insisted that the acceptance in part of the consideration of the contract of release amounted to a ratification of the contract; nor could this ground be successfully taken in view of the rule announced in <em>Reeves </em>v. <em>Butcher, </em>2 <em>Vroom </em>224. In that case it was held that the subsequent payment of the interest upon a note given on a Sunday did not amount to a ratification of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">So, in this case, although wages and medical bills had been paid in pursuance of the agreement for the execution of the release, yet this will not amount to a ratification of the release itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">We are of the opinion that there should be judgment for the plaintiff upon the demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
