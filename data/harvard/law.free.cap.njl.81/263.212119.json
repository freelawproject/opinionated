He sued out an ordinary writ of error, and the cause has been presented by a bill of exceptions. The entire record of the proceedings had upon trial has not been returned with the writ, and the causes relied upon for reversal have not been specified nor served upon the attorney-general or prosecutor of the pleas, as required by sections 136 and 137 of the Criminal Procedure act of 1898. <em>Pamph. L., p. </em>915. The defendant must therefore be confined to the errors assigned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Labriola, </em>46 <em>Vroom </em>483.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">The first assignment of error requiring consideration is that presenting an exception to the refusal of the trial judge to direct the acquittal of the defendant at the close of- the state\u2019s case, made upon the <em>grounds\u2014first, </em>that the court had no jurisdiction for the reason that the proofs showed the offence to have been committed in another county, and <em>second, </em>that there was no proof that the defendant knew, the goods were stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">But the error assigned cannot be considered as presented. This court has held that the denial of a motion, made on the trial of an indictment, to direct an acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case, and before the evidence is wholly closed, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>not the subject of review on an ordinary writ of error. <em>Burnett </em>v. <em>State, </em>33 <em>Vroom </em>510. Moreover, Chancellor Magie, speaking for the Court of Errors and Appeals, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jaggers, </em>42 <em>Id. </em>281, 283, referring to a like motion, said: \u201cThis motion was addressed to the discretion of the court, and the action of the court is not reviewable on error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">We are not called upon to consider the effect of a denial of such a motion at the close of the whole case, as no such motion was made after the defendant had put in his defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">There being no other assignment of error to he considered, the judgment of the court below will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
