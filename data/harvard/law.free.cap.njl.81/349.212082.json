NATIONAL BENEFIT ASSOCIATION.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b389-7\">Submitted March 23, 1911</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A9y\">Decided June 9, 1911.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b389-8\">Where a contract of life insurance, in which the beneficiary is described as \u201cguardian\u201d prescribes that \u201cThe beneficiary must have something more than a pecuniary interest in the insured, as speculative policies are not issued by this <em>association\u201d\u2014Held, </em>that such provision is vague and subject to interpretation by the court, and that the issuance of the policy and the receipt of premiums by the company amounted to a practical interpretation of the policy by the parties, precluding the insurer from avoiding the policy because of the lack of insurable interest by the beneficiary in the insured.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-9\">On appeal from District Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b389-10\">Before Justices Garrison, Parker and Yoorhees.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-11\">For the appellant, <em>George </em>/L <em>Douglass </em>and <em>Frank E. Bradner.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-12\">For the respondent, <em>Richard Stockton.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b389-13\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"AGZ\">Yoorhees, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7b\">This is an appeal from the Second District Court of Kewark. The record shows a summons, state of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>demand, copy of docket and memorandum of decision, in the ' form of an opinion. There is no settled or agreed state of the ease, although the judge certifies \u201cthe foregoing to be the state of the above-entitled case.\u201d Certain testimony was filed after judgment rendered, which is in no way certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Granting that the official opinion of the court certified to be the state of the case is, in fact, such, it appears that the action is upon a life insurance policy, and that judgment in . the court below passed for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The first cause for reversal is that the plaintiff had no insurable interest in the life of the insured, and therefore should have been nonsuited. This contention cannot prevail. <em>Trenton Mutual Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>4 <em>Zab. 576; Vivar </em>v. <em>Knights of Pythias, 23 Vroom </em>455; <em>Sun Insurance Office of London </em>v. <em>Merz, </em>34 <em>Id. </em>365.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Moreover, the contract, \u25a0 in which the beneficiary is described as \u201cguardian,\u201d prescribes that \u201cthe beneficiary must have something more than a pecuniary interest in the insured, as speculative policies are not issued by this association\u201d\u2014a vague provision and subject to interpretation by the court. But the writing and delivery of the policj', and the acceptance by the defendant of. premiums, amounts to a practical interpretation of the policy by the parties, and it would be a fraud to permit the defendant thus to contract and receive the premiums, with full knowledge that the policy was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The other reasons for reversal relate to dealings with the company and to waiver of forfeitures by the defendant. They are fact questions, and as there was evidence to support the findings of the court, its decision will not be reviewed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">The judgment will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
