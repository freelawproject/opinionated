The ground urged for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>reversal is that there was no evidence on which a judgment for the plaintiff could be based, and that in consequence the court should have nonsuited or found for the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b770-5\">\u2022 Horn was a journeyman painter in the employ of one Badenhauscn, who had the general painting contract for all the defendant\u2019s steamships. As the steamer Auguste Victoria was at the Hoboken wharf, Horn and another man employed by Badenhausen were painting her side, standing on a raft for this purpose, when someone on the vessel threw a pailful of hot water over the taffrail, scalding Horn. The locality was that of the \u201csteam kitchen,\u201d or kitchen for steerage passengers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b770-6\">It is said that plaintiff was not there by invitation so as to throw any duty of care on defendant. But we think a <em>prima facie </em>case of invitation was sufficiently made out. Badenhausen, as it appears, had a general painting contract, and it was in the performance of that contract that plaintiff and his fellow were working on the raft. There is nothing to show that they were in the wrong place, as in the case of <em>Daug </em>v. <em>North German Lloyd Steamship co., </em>44 <em>Vroom </em>770. Hence there was a duty of care resting on defendant and its servants on the steamer, to avoid injury to the painters by anything thrown over the side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b770-7\">Appellant claims that there is no proof that the man that threw the water was a servant of defendant. But as the steamer was in dock and all her passengers were gone, the presumption would be that such person was a servant unless he was the employe of some other contractor. The evidence of Brotzer, the other man on the raft, that it \u201cwas a kitchen man,\u201d was struck out as a conclusion, but without destroying the inference arising from the testimony that he wore, clothes like those of a kitchen man, and that he was dumping a pail of hot water from the part of the ship where the kitchen was situated. The captain, for the defence, swore that the rail was four feet high and solid, so that a man\u2019s clothes could not be seen; but this was a contradiction of evidence and raised a question of fact for the court, sitting as a jury, as to what the man\u2019s employment was.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b770-8\">The questions of negligence and contributory negligence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>the case were of course questions of fact and within the control of the trial judge sitting as a jury. If there was any evidence to support the plaintiffs claim, the judgment cannot be disturbed. <em>Lavin </em>v. <em>Public Service Railway Co., </em>48 <em>Vroom </em>217.
