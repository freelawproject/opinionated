The defendant applied for and was allowed a rule that relator show cause why the information should not be quashed and the rule to plead discharged upon the ground that\u2014first, the action can only be brought in the name of the state; second, that the information does not show right in relator to bring <em>quo warranto </em>because it appears from the information that relator is not entitled to the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">It was admitted on the argument, although it does not appear in the record presented, that the rule was subsequently modified, and the relator given leave to make the state a party, and defendant required to plead within ten days, which he did, raising in his plea the questions presented in support of this rule. The defendant has not filed reasons, but in his brief claims that relator was elected io a different office from that which the defendant claims\u2014that is, that when elected there were three offices, and now there are but two, and even if relator succeeded in showing that defendant\u2019s office was vacant, he would not be entitled <em>to </em>it, and therefore as the present proceeding is to remove defendant and install relator he has mistaken his remedy, because even if he succeeds in showing that defendant is not entitled, that could not result in inducting relator into the office held by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">As modified, the rule to show cause is little more than an embarrassment to the progress of the cause. Under the view most favorable to the defendant, all that can be said is that it is perhaps a stay which prevents the trial of the cause which is at issue. We would not quash the information for any ir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>regularity in form after plea to the merits, for such plea waives any irregularity, and if the defendant intended to dispute the legal effect of the facts set up in the information, he should have demurred to it instead of pleading to the merits. If what remains of the rule to show cause amounts to a stay of the trial of the issue, it should be discharged for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">If we consider the merit of defendant\u2019s claim, the situation as disclosed by the information is this: each ward in Passaic was entitled to three eouncilmen, and defendant, Kevitt and the relator had each been elected as councilman from the Second ward, and all three were serving when, by the promulgation of the census of 1911, each ward became entitled to but two members, and according to law the younger in point of service mnst be dropped, and as it is admitted that relator was the youngest, his office would be abolished under normal conditions, but the information charges, and that must be taken to be true on this application, that the defendant, although acting, was not a <em>de jure </em>officer, and that his office was then vacant, so that on March 7th, 1911, when the number of councilmen was reduced to two, there were but two <em>de jure </em>officers, of whom relator was one, filling the offices, and that defendant had intruded into relator\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">My opinion is that if the defendant had, by removal, vacated his office, and wffien the census of 1911 was promulgated, Kevitt and the relator were the only <em>dp jure </em>officers, they would be \"the oldest and next oldest members thereof, in point of service,\u201d and therefore under the statute entitled \"An act concerning the constitution of the common council, board of aldermen or other governing body of certain cities in this stale\u201d <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1898, <em>p. </em>95), the relator has shown by his information a <em>prima facie </em>right to the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The ease being at issue, there is no reason why the relator should not have a prompt trial, and as there appears to be nothing to prevent this, except the possibility that the present <em>rule to show </em>cause still acts as a stay to further proceedings, the rule should he discharged, wit'll costs, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
