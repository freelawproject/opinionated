We hold that\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   does not extend to the sentences in this case and they are not otherwise cruel and unusual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On Tuesday, May 4, 2004, Matthew Timothy McCullough, the appellant, and Martise Williams, both students at\n   Randallstown High School, in Baltimore County, got into an argument when Williams called the appellant a \"bitch.\" Over the next several days, the controversy escalated. Efforts by school officials to \"calm the waters\" by meeting with the students and their parents proved fruitless. School officials told appellant not to be on school grounds on Friday, May 7, 2004. He came to the school that day anyway and during the course of a school basketball game let it be known that he and three companions were looking for a fight. School officials ordered them off the grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Later that afternoon, when the basketball game was letting out, the appellant returned with his three companions. The appellant was 17\u00bd years old, but his companions were older and were not students. The four walked together \"towards the school where a group of kids were hanging out on the sidewalk.\"\n   <em>\n    Mc Cullough v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 2812, Sept. Term. 2004, slip op. at 2 (filed Nov. 28, 2005). According to a teacher who witnessed what happened next, the four approached a group of students, \"[a] few words were exchanged, a punch was thrown, and there was a fight.\" A crowd of 30 or 40 students formed. When it became clear that the four were not going to prevail, one of them, Tyrone \"Fat Boy\" Brown, retrieved a handgun from his car. \"Fat Boy\" and the appellant shared the handgun, using it to fire a total of 12 shots into the crowd. Four students were seriously wounded ; one of them was shot in the back of the neck and is paralyzed from the chest down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 23, 2004, a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County convicted the appellant of four counts of first degree assault, one for each victim. Sentencing took place on January 27, 2005. Exercising his right to allocution, the appellant made the following statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Your Honor, I would like to say what happened on May 7th was a tragedy. I'd like to apologize for what happened that day and I'd like to apologize for putting the victims and their families through\n   the pain and suffering. And I know that a punishment is acceptable, and I'm here to accept the punishment. Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When asked by his lawyer whether he thought that, \"[a]t some point in [his] life,\" he could \"rejoin [the] community and be a productive part of society[,]\" the appellant responded, \"Yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court sentenced the appellant to the maximum 25 years for each conviction, to be served consecutively, for an aggregate sentence of 100 years. In doing so, the judge characterized the crimes as \"vicious and heinous,\" described the \"horror\" endured by the families of the students and the fear the crimes created in the community, and recounted the seriousness of the victims' injuries. He characterized the appellant as a \"suburban terrorist\" and a \"coward\" and observed that until sentencing he had shown no remorse and had bragged about \"beat[ing] the attempted murder wrap [sic]\" and the use of a handgun charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Eleven years later, on March 25, 2016, the appellant filed a motion to correct illegal sentence, arguing that his aggregate sentence of 100 years violated the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and in Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The circuit court denied the motion without a hearing, by order entered on June 27, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The appellant noted a timely appeal, asking:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Does a juvenile nonhomicide offender's prison sentence of 100 years violate the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and/or Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the order of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Eighth Amendment to the federal constitution, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

In our view, the courts that read\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   to \"hold\" that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   juvenile nonhomicide offenders must be given an opportunity to seek release at some time, regardless of the individual circumstances (and for some courts, early enough that they can build a life for themselves) are interpreting the case well beyond its actual holding. The holding of\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   is that a juvenile convicted of one nonhomicide crime may not be given a LWOP sentence that from the outset affords him no opportunity to obtain release based on growth and maturity. Given the very different considerations that are in play when a juvenile commits multiple nonhomicide crimes against multiple victims and receives multiple term-of-years cumulative sentences, each of which individually is not grossly disproportionate, we cannot say that the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   is implicated. This is not a \"same sentence different label\" situation. Moreover, the rarity of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   to impose a categorical restriction outside the context of the death penalty militates in favor of a narrow construction of its categorical bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   We hold that\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   's categorical bar on the imposition of LWOP sentences against juvenile nonhomicide offenders does not apply to a sentence such as the appellant's sentence that comprises multiple sentences imposed for multiple crimes against multiple victims, where no sentence individually is lengthy enough to trigger a\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   -based challenge. Sentences of this sort were not addressed by the\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   Court and are dissimilar from a LWOP sentence (or even a lengthy term-of-years sentence) imposed for a single offense in terms of the penological goals being served. The appropriate Eighth Amendment analysis when there are multiple nonhomicide crimes committed by a juvenile against multiple\n   victims, with no single sentence for LWOP, is whether, upon consideration of all the relevant circumstances (including the age of the offender), each individual sentence is grossly disproportionate to the crime for which it was imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Even if we were to adopt the appellant's position that\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   applies to multiple term-of-years sentences, we nevertheless would hold that the sentences imposed here are not cruel and unusual. The appellant may seek release on parole when he is 67 years old. Most of the cases holding that\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   applies to cumulative term-of-years sentences dealt with much longer periods of parole ineligibility that plainly exceeded the defendant's life expectancy.\n   <em>\n    See Caballero\n   </em>\n   (age 116);\n   <em>\n    Boston\n   </em>\n   (age 116);\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   (age 101);\n   <em>\n    Henry\n   </em>\n   (age 95); and\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   (age 92). As the appellant tacitly acknowledges, age 67 is less than his average life expectancy. Therefore, his sentences only would amount to a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   LWOP sentence if we were to adopt the reasoning of those courts that have held that\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   mandates not only that a juvenile nonhomicide offender be afforded an opportunity for release within his or her lifetime but also an \" 'opportunity to truly reenter society or have a[ ] meaningful life outside of prison.' \"\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20N.E.3d%201127\">\n    76 N.E.3d at 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Casiano v.
