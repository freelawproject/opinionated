Dejana, appeals from the judgment of the trial court denying her postjudgment motion for contempt against the defendant, Michael Dejana. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court, in declining to hold the defendant in contempt, improperly interpreted the parties' separation agreement, which had been incorporated into the judgment of dissolution. In support of this claim, the plaintiff argues that the court improperly determined that the separation agreement (1) required the defendant to pay unallocated alimony and child support based upon a percentage of his base salary and annual incentive cash bonus, and (2) permitted the defendant to use the entirety of the income he received from vested stock units, pursuant to his employer's long-term incentive program, to fund the private college education of the parties' son. We affirm the judgment of the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following factual and procedural history is relevant to our resolution of the plaintiff's claims. On April 21, 2015, the plaintiff filed a postjudgment motion for contempt, claiming, inter alia, that the defendant had not paid her the full amount due for unallocated alimony and child support since 2010. On September 2, 2015, and December 16, 2015, a hearing on the motion was\n   held before the court at which both parties testified and presented other evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court found the following facts and procedural history. \"The marriage of the plaintiff and the defendant was dissolved on January 9, 2009. Among the orders entered by the court at the time of dissolution were unallocated alimony and child support orders set forth in article VIII of their separation agreement. [The plaintiff] has filed a motion for contempt, dated April 10, 2015, in which she alleges, inter alia, that the defendant mischaracterized his 2010-2013 compensation as base salary, resulting in [the] plaintiff receiving $84,821 less than she was entitled to receive....\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Article VIII of the separation agreement sets forth the terms of the parties' agreement regarding unallocated alimony and child support.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to the alimony and support obligations set forth in paragraph 8.1 of [that article of] the separation agreement, the parties further agreed in article VII, [paragraph] 7.1, that the defendant would be obligated to pay all of the undergraduate college education expenses\n   for the parties' minor son .... The agreement provided that the defendant shall have the option of fulfilling this obligation by scholarships and grants obtained by [the parties' son] and the use of [the defendant's Long-Term Incentive Award Program (LTIP), or as it is alternatively referenced, Performance Stock Deferred Plan, an award\n   program established by his former employer, the Royal Bank of Canada (bank) ].\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The parties do not dispute the following facts. [Their son] attended Trinity College from September, 2011, until he graduated in May, 2015, at a total cost of approximately $240,000. Pursuant to the parties' separation agreement, [the] defendant paid all of [the son's] college expenses. In compliance with the parties' separation agreement, [the] defendant utilized the funds in his [LTIP] to pay for ... college expenses at Trinity College. [The defendant] received $225,746 from the [LTIP] program, net of taxes. He paid Trinity College $235,021 using funds from the ... LTIP account in full, and supplementing his obligation to pay for [his son's] education from other funding sources. [The defendant] is no longer employed by [the bank] and is therefore no longer entitled to participate in, or receive benefits from, the [LTIP]. Following [their son's] graduation from Trinity College, [the] plaintiff filed the within motion for contempt, alleging that [the defendant] did not pay her the proper amount [of] unallocated alimony and child support, as required by the terms of the separation agreement. In simplest terms, [the] plaintiff's\n   claim arises from the fact that [the] defendant did not pay [the] plaintiff support from that portion of his compensation which was comprised of mon[eys] declared as 'income' on his income tax return from [the LTIP].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[The plaintiff] called Dr. Daniel Purushothan in support of her claim that the LTIP mon[eys] [the] defendant received should be included in the calculation of her alimony payment. [Purushothan] was qualified to testify on the issue of executive compensation as related to [the] defendant's compensation. He provided a clear explanation of executive compensation. In this case, as noted, [the] defendant received, in addition to a base salary, a portion of his compensation as income pursuant to the [LTIP] established by his [former] employer, [the bank].... Purushothan testified that, as an individual rises through the executive ranks, the proportion of [his] income attributed to regular salary diminishes, and the individual receives a higher proportion of income based on variable factors, such as bonuses or equity in the organization. In this case, [the] defendant's income is comprised of a base salary, annual incentive or cash bonus\n   [ (annual incentive cash bonus) ] and the [LTIP].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Notwithstanding the testimony of ... Purushothan, at the time of dissolution, the parties themselves had determined how the portion of the defendant's income which was derived from his participation [in the bank's LTIP] award program should be utilized. That agreement clearly gave the defendant the right to apply those funds to their son's college education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The court has carefully considered the evidence and testimony presented and has applied the facts to the terms of the parties' [separation] agreement. Based on the foregoing, the [court] concludes that the plaintiff is attempting to require the defendant to pay her a portion of the LTIP income as alimony when she has\n   already agreed that these funds shall be applied to [their] son's education expenses. There is no limitation on the defendant's right to use the LTIP income for [the son's] college expenses. The parties could have provided that the portion of the ... LTIP income remaining, net of any percentage paid as alimony, could be applied to ... college expenses. They did not do so. The terms of the separation agreement are clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The plaintiff has not sustained her burden of proving that the defendant has failed to pay her alimony as ordered by the court at the time of dissolution and that she has been ... underpaid. [The plaintiff's] argument would require a finding that she was entitled to receive a percentage of the defendant's income from the ... LTIP program and that, only thereafter, could the defendant apply the LTIP mon[eys] to pay for their son's college education. As agreed by the parties at the time of dissolution, the defendant had the option, i.e., it was his sole right to apply all or any portion of the funds in the LTIP account from that source to pay for the ... college education [of the parties' son] without any claim by the plaintiff to receive any portion of the LTIP funds for her benefit.\" (Footnotes added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court denied the plaintiff's motion for contempt and counsel fees. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We first address the defendant's assertion that the claim that the plaintiff presents on appeal was not preserved in the trial court and, therefore, we should decline to review it. We are not persuaded by this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant claims that the plaintiff asserts for the first time on appeal that the defendant's arrearage \"comes to about $100,000,\" based upon a new theory\n   of the case: that the defendant paid her the correct percentage of his base salary and annual incentive cash bonus, but that, pursuant to article VIII, paragraph 8.1, of the separation agreement, he also should have paid her 30 percent of the income realized annually from the LTIP as additional unallocated alimony and child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"It is well established that an appellate court is under no obligation to consider a claim that is not distinctly raised at the trial level....

During the hearing, the court made several efforts to clarify the precise nature of the basis for the plaintiff's contempt motion. Midway through the second day of the contempt hearing, the defendant raised a due process claim on the basis of the plaintiff's lack of clarity as to her allegation of contempt. The court engaged in a lengthy discussion with the plaintiff's counsel regarding this lack of clarity, but determined that, essentially, the plaintiff was asserting an underpayment on the part of the defendant of his obligation under article VIII, paragraph 8.1, of the separation agreement, and given the amount of evidence that already had been presented, the court allowed the plaintiff to continue pursuing her motion despite the defendant's objection. At one point, however, the court characterized the plaintiff's claim as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"The Court: Isn't the plaintiff's claim a matter of setting forth for the court a mathematical chart that says here's what I claim I'm entitled to? I, the plaintiff. Forty percent of the-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff's Counsel]: Right\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The Court: -base salary. The salary. Thirty percent of the [annual incentive cash bonus]. And according to the plaintiff's claim, if I understand correctly, also 30 percent of the [LTIP], because the plaintiff's argument is that the [LTIP] and the [annual incentive cash bonus] are both in that category. Isn't that what the plaintiff is claiming?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff's Counsel]: \"We're claiming exactly that, the [LTIP] and [the annual incentive cash bonus] both belong in-in the general-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"The Court: Well, it's not exactly clear from this.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendant testified that, in accordance with his interpretation of the separation agreement, he paid the plaintiff 40 percent of his semimonthly, base salary paycheck, and at the end of each year, when he was awarded his annual incentive cash bonus, he paid the plaintiff 30 percent of that. He further testified that he used all the income he received from his LTIP to pay for the college expenses of the parties' son, and that he actually incurred a shortfall after exhausting the LTIP funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Later during the hearing, counsel for the plaintiff indicated that one of the bases for the plaintiff's claim of an arrearage being owed to her is that the defendant \"should have paid [the plaintiff] a portion of the vested LTIP shares as he received them ... in addition to ... using [them] to pay for college,\" and that the LTIP, as part of the defendant's total direct cash compensation, should be treated as either base or bonus salary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, during the plaintiff's testimony, she referred to a spreadsheet of calculations she had prepared in support of her claim, and she requested that the court either find that the defendant should have been paying her, as unallocated alimony and child support, 40 percent of his total compensation, including his base salary, annual incentive cash bonus, and the LTIP funds,\n   <em>\n    or in the alternative\n   </em>\n   , 40 percent of his base salary, 30 percent of his annual incentive cash bonus, and 30 percent of his LTIP income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We therefore conclude that the claim on appeal-that the court should have awarded the plaintiff an arrearage consisting of 30 percent of his LTIP compensation for additional unallocated alimony and child support owed-was preserved, albeit somewhat inartfully, and considered by the trial court. In its memorandum of decision, the court noted that the basis of the plaintiff's claim that her unallocated alimony and child support had been underpaid was that she was entitled to receive a percentage of the defendant's income from the LTIP funds. Although this alleged percentage owed, as claimed by the plaintiff, was either 30 percent or 40 percent, the court ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to no percentage share of the defendant's LTIP income, as that income was expressly reserved to the defendant by the terms of the separation agreement for use in paying the son's college expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We next address both aspects of the plaintiff's claim together, as they each involve the court's interpretation of the parties' separation agreement, and are inter-related.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We begin with general principles and the applicable standards of review. The order at issue in the present case is contained in the parties' separation agreement, which was incorporated into the court's judgment of dissolution. \"It is well established that a separation agreement that has been incorporated into a dissolution decree and its resulting judgment must be regarded as a contract and construed in accordance with the general principles governing contracts.... When construing a contract, we seek to determine the intent of the parties from the language used interpreted\n   <em>\n    in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction\n   </em>\n   .... [T]he intent of the parties is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable\n   construction of the written words and ... the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract.... When only one interpretation of a contract is possible, the court need not look outside the four corners of the contract....

The defendant argues that the court properly interpreted the plain and unambiguous language of the separation agreement as requiring the defendant, under article VIII, to pay unallocated alimony and child support based upon a percentage of his base salary and annual incentive cash bonus, and permitting the defendant under article VII to use the entirety of any income he received from his LTIP to fund his son's college education. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At the time of the parties' divorce in 2009, the defendant worked at the bank, and the parties had one minor child. The defendant's compensation from the bank consisted of three components: (1) a base salary; (2) an annual incentive cash bonus paid in December of each year; and (3) the LTIP, an award of stock units that automatically vested three years after each award of stock was made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The parties' separation agreement addressed the three components of the defendant's compensation package in two separate and independent provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The first two components of the defendant's compensation, specifically, the defendant's base salary and annual incentive cash bonus, are indisputably addressed in article VIII, entitled \"Unallocated Alimony and Child Support.\" That article sets forth that the defendant would pay to the plaintiff 40 percent of his base salary and 30 percent of his annual bonus as unallocated alimony and child support until the earlier of the\n   defendant's death, the plaintiff's death or remarriage, or thirteen and one-half years from the first payment, with the percentages reduced to 35 percent of the defendant's base salary and 25 percent of the defendant's bonus on April 1, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although, during the contempt hearing, the plaintiff also argued that all three compensation components were part of the defendant's base salary, she now concedes on appeal that there is no dispute as to the precise meaning of \"base salary,\" which consists of the semimonthly gross salary paid to the defendant by the bank, 40 percent of which was to be paid to the plaintiff upon receipt. The parties also do not disagree over the inclusion of the annual incentive cash bonus within the meaning of the word \"bonus\" in paragraph 8.1 of article VIII of the separation agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The dispute centers around whether, in addition to the annual incentive cash bonus that the defendant received every December 15, the term \"bonus,\" in paragraph 8.1 of article VIII, also includes the income derived from the defendant's vested LTIP stock awards. To resolve the claim presented in this appeal, we must determine whether the court properly concluded that article VII, paragraph 7.1, of the separation agreement unambiguously provides that the defendant could use his existing and future LTIP income toward the payment of college expenses. That issue presents a question of\n   law over which our review is plenary to determine if the court's conclusions are legally and logically correct.

As a result, viewing the contract as a whole, the LTIP funds were necessarily excluded from the reference to bonus income in article VIII, paragraph 8.1,\n   which described how the amounts of the defendant's payments of unallocated alimony and child support were to be calculated. Significantly, the court did not articulate any factual findings\n   with respect to the intent of the parties in enacting the contractual language at issue. Had the court found article VII, paragraph 7.1, to be ambiguous, it necessarily would have made factual findings as to the intent of the parties.

In fact, paragraph 7.1 provides that the defendant must fulfill his total educational obligation even if the LTIP decreases in value in the future, which implicitly acknowledges that the value of the fund might increase\n   or decrease in future years and, therefore, the LTIP might not entirely provide the defendant with the means to pay the son's college expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Although the plaintiff would like to have the expansive general definition of the word \"bonus\" applied to incorporate the LTIP funds into paragraph 8.1 of article VIII for the purpose of calculating unallocated alimony and child support, the specificity of the permitted usage of the LTIP funds to meet the defendant's obligation for college expenses in paragraph 7.1 of article VII should control and be given greater weight than the general definition of the word \"bonus.\" See 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 203 (1981). If the parties had intended that the defendant would pay the plaintiff a percentage of his LTIP income annually to the plaintiff, there was no reason to include any language in article VII specifically permitting him to use the funds for college expenses; he would not have needed permission to spend the remaining percentage, after paying unallocated alimony and child support, in any way he chose. We decline to interpret the language of article VII referencing the LTIP funds in a manner that would render this provision superfluous. \"When interpreting a contract, we must look at the contract as a whole, consider all relevant portions together and, if possible, give operative effect to every provision in order to reach a reasonable overall result.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    R.T.

The agreement provides that it is \"expressly understood that the terms of this agreement and the financial arrangement hereunder were made upon the representations contained in said affidavits,\" and that \"the parties hereto relied upon said representations in executing this agreement.\" This is significant because the defendant's financial affidavit references only one \"bonus,\" the annual incentive cash bonus, which he listed, along with his base salary, as part of his weekly income. The LTIP fund was not listed as bonus income, but rather as an asset, on the defendant's financial affidavit. The fact that the financial affidavit includes only the annual incentive cash bonus as bonus income lends further support to the court's determination that the LTIP income was not part of the bonus referred to in article VIII, which governed unallocated alimony and child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The court correctly determined that the language in article VII, paragraph 7.1, of the separation agreement was clear and unambiguous, and effectively removed the LTIP funds from the calculation of the 30 percent of bonus income contemplated in article VIII, paragraph 8.1, of the unallocated alimony and child support provision of the agreement. The defendant, therefore, had complied with paragraph 8.1 of the separation agreement. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the plaintiff's postjudgment motion for contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Although not clearly expressed in the plaintiff's statement of issues, we presume that the plaintiff is also claiming that the court erred in denying her motion for contempt.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The court noted that the \"[p]laintiff further submits that the amount of alleged underpayment for 2014 has not yet been determined.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Article VIII of the parties' separation agreement is entitled, \"Unallocated Alimony and Child Support.\" Paragraph 8.1 of article VIII provides: \"The Husband, during his lifetime, shall pay to the Wife as alimony, immediately upon receipt of each of his base salary paycheck[s], forty (40%) percent of the gross amount of the base salary and thirty (30%) percent of any bonus upon receipt of same.

It would be nonsensical to claim that the defendant mischaracterized bonus income as base salary, which would have resulted in his paying more than he was obligated to under the separation agreement.

This agreement, which was in writing, modified the terms of the judgment, but was never made an order of the trial court. The defendant testified that he complied with this modification agreement.
