The critical question in this appeal is whether, under the terms of an automobile insurance contract providing coverage for bodily injury, a loss of consortium claim is entitled to a separate per person liability limitation from the principal bodily injury claim of another person from which the loss of consortium claim arises. The defendant argues that the trial court's ruling was improper because the language of the policy at issue is ambiguous and the matter should be remanded for further proceedings to determine the scope of the policy. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the resolution of this appeal is controlled by our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Izzo v. Colonial Penn Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"499265\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/203/305/\">\n    203 Conn. 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=524%20A.2d%20641\">\n    524 A.2d 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court, which properly applied Izzo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following undisputed facts and procedural history give rise to the present appeal. At all relevant times, an individual named Rebecca Bahre\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   was the holder of\n   an automobile insurance policy issued by the plaintiff. The declaration section of this policy provided liability limits for bodily injury of $100,000 per person and a total limit of $300,000 per accident for bodily injury. The policy further provided that this limit of liability is the plaintiff's \"maximum limit of liability for all damages including damages for care, loss of services or death, arising out of bodily injury sustained by any one person in any one auto accident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 27, 2012, this policy was in effect when a vehicle operated by Bahre collided with a motorcycle operated by the defendant's husband, Bryan Piquette (husband). As a result of this collision, Piquette suffered physical injuries. The defendant was not present at the time of the collision and did not witness it. On July 23, 2013, by service of process, the defendant and her husband commenced an action against Bahre, raising claims for bodily injury suffered by the defendant's husband and for loss of consortium suffered by the defendant as a result of her husband's physical injuries. On December 4, 2013, Bahre, with her insurer, offered to settle all claims for a total sum of $100,000, inclusive of all costs and interest. This amount represented the full per person limit of coverage for bodily injury. Through counsel, the defendant and her husband counteroffered to settle the matter for a total sum of $200,000. The counteroffer was based on\n   the assertion that the defendant's loss of consortium claim was entitled to a separate per person limit of $100,000 from the $100,000 per person limit covering her husband's bodily injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, the plaintiff commenced the present declaratory judgment action to determine the proper scope of coverage provided by the policy. The plaintiff asserted that a claim for loss of consortium is derivative of the bodily injury claim brought by the defendant's husband, who was directly and physically injured in\n   the collision, and, therefore, the loss of consortium claim is not entitled to a separate per person limit of liability. Accordingly, the plaintiff asserted that its maximum liability under the policy for the defendant's loss of consortium claim\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   her husband's corresponding bodily injury claim was a total of $100,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 29, 2015, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment on the ground that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding the scope of the policy under its unambiguous terms, and that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The plaintiff relied on\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Colonial Penn Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"499265\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/203/305/\">\n    203 Conn. at 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=524%20A.2d%20641\">\n    524 A.2d 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which held that, under the terms of the insurance policy at issue in that case, an uninjured spouse's claim for loss of consortium is derivative of the injured spouse's claim for bodily injury, and, therefore, does not trigger a separate per person limit under the terms of that policy. The plaintiff argued that the policy language in the present case is substantially the same as that presented in\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   , and, accordingly, that\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   was controlling. The defendant responded that the policy language in the present case was ambiguous and substantively distinguishable from the language in\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   , and that summary judgment, therefore, was inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 14, 2016, the trial court granted summary judgment for the plaintiff. The court concluded that the policy language was not ambiguous or substantively distinguishable from the language in\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, the trial court concluded that it was bound by our Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   that the policy language did not create a separate per person limitation of liability for one spouse's claim for loss of consortium that was derivative of an injured spouse's claim for bodily injury. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   She argues that significant differences exist between the policy language at issue here and the policy language construed in\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   , such that\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable. She argues that wording of the policy is ambiguous and, as such, the policy should be construed against the plaintiff, in favor of coverage, in accordance with established principles of insurance contract interpretation. The plaintiff responds that the trial court properly concluded that this matter is controlled by\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   and properly granted summary judgment. We agree with the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We begin with the standard of review. \"Summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits, and other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Dairyland Ins.

The policy interpreted in\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   provided coverage for damages \"\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   bodily injury\"; (emphasis altered) id., at 309,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=524%20A.2d%20641\">\n    524 A.2d 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; while the policy at issue here provides coverage for damages \"\n   <em>\n    arising out of\n   </em>\n   bodily injury.\" Principally, the defendant argues that the latter language does not require the direct causal relationship indicated by the phrase \"because of\" that was used in\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   , and that, accordingly, it was improper for the trial court to rely on\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   to determine the limits of liability in the present case. The defendant's interpretation tortures the language of the policy in order to find ambiguity where there is none. We conclude, on the facts present here, that this slight variation in policy language is a distinction without a difference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The resolution of this appeal, therefore, turns on our Supreme Court's construction of substantively similar policy language in\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Colonial Penn Ins.

Indeed, the facts of\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   are remarkably similar to those of the present appeal. In\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   , a\n   woman suffered permanent and disabling injuries, including the loss of a leg, in an automobile accident caused by another driver.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=524%20A.2d%20641\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Although the injured woman's husband was not involved in the accident, he claimed that he suffered a loss of consortium as a result of the injuries to his wife.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=524%20A.2d%20641\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The decision in\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   arose from a declaratory judgment action regarding these claims to determine, under the terms of an insurance contract owned by the driver that caused the accident, whether separate liability limitations applied to each claim or whether the derivative loss of consortium claim was covered by the same limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The driver that caused the accident in\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   held an insurance policy that provided liability limitations for bodily injury of $100,000 \"per person\" and $300,000 \"per\n   occurrence.\" Id., at 308,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=524%20A.2d%20641\">\n    524 A.2d 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court concluded that the derivative nature of a loss of consortium claim caused it to be \"inextricably attached\" to the bodily injury claim and therefore covered by the same per person limitation under the policy language at issue, which did not expressly provide separate coverage for loss of consortium claims.

[A]lthough loss of consortium is a separate cause of action, it is an action [which] is derivative of the injured spouse's cause of action. ... Loss of consortium ... is not truly independent, but rather derivative and inextricably attached to the claim of the injured spouse. The [husband's] loss of consortium claim, therefore, clearly fits within the 'per person' limit [covering the wife's bodily injury claim] as [the husband's claim] is a loss sustained 'because of bodily injury to one person [the wife] caused by any one occurrence.' \" (Citations omitted.)

There is no question that both policies cover loss of consortium claims, and neither policy expressly provides separate per person coverage for loss of consortium claims. In\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   , the per person limitation of liability applied to \"damages\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   bodily injury to one person caused by any one occurrence.\" (Emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.)

Here, the policy's per person limitation of liability applies to \"damages ...\n   <em>\n    arising out of\n   </em>\n   bodily injury sustained by any one person in any one auto accident.\" (Emphasis added.) It is clear that both policies refer to claims that flow from and are derivative of the bodily injury sustained by another person. In light of our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   , it is equally clear that the derivative nature of the loss of consortium claim requires coverage under the same per person limitation as the injury from which it flows under the policy language present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Our conclusion in this appeal, as in\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   , is driven largely by the nature of a loss of consortium claim,\n   which is \"not truly independent, but rather derivative and inextricably attached to the claim of the injured spouse.\"\n   <em>\n    Izzo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Colonial Penn Ins.

The term 'personal injury' is broad enough to encompass a claim for injury which is personal to the claimant, although flowing from the physical injury of another. ... [T]he term 'bodily injury,' however, is narrower in that it connotes an element of personal contact. ... A claim for loss of consortium, although a 'personal injury,' is not a 'bodily injury' to the claimant.\" (Citations omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Izzo\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Colonial Penn Ins.
