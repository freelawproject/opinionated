The first is whether the trial court in a medical\n   malpractice action was wrong to give jury instructions on negligence framed in terms of the conduct of a reasonable person. The second is whether the court abused its discretion when, in response to a question from the jury during its third day of deliberations, it imposed a one-hour deadline to conclude deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mark Armacost sued his neurosurgeon, Reginald J. Davis, M.D., for malpractice and failure to obtain informed consent. At the end of a five-day trial, the court gave its instructions to the jury. Over Dr. Davis's objection, the jury's charge included an instruction on the general negligence concept of foreseeable circumstances-describing how \"a reasonable person changes conduct according to the circumstances and the danger that is known or would be appreciated by a reasonable person\" in addition to an instruction couched in terms of the standard of care that should be employed by a reasonably competent health care provider engaged in a similar practice and acting in similar circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During its third day of deliberations, the jury sent a note to the court asking what would happen if it could not reach a unanimous verdict. The court told the jurors that a mistrial would result from continued deadlock and also issued a modified\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge. In addition, the court requested the jurors to deliberate for another hour but also told them that they would not be asked to return the following day. About an hour later, the jury returned a verdict\n   in favor of Mr. Armacost on the malpractice issue and in favor of Dr. Davis on the informed consent claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, Dr. Davis raises two questions, which we have rephrased:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. Did the trial court commit reversible error by giving the foreseeable circumstances instruction (Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instruction 19:3), prejudicially altering or heightening the duty owed by Dr. Davis to patient Mr. Armacost?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2. Were the court's supplemental instructions unduly coercive?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As we will explain, we conclude that the trial court should not have given the foreseeable circumstances instruction nor, for that matter, another instruction defining negligence framed in terms of the conduct of a reasonable person. The court also erred in attaching a seeming one-hour deadline for the jury to reach a verdict after disclosing that a mistrial would result from a failure to reach a unanimous decision and issuing a modified\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge. Each error warrants reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 17, 2012, after years of neck and shoulder pain and a recent onset of numbness in his right hand, Mr. Armacost consulted with Dr. Davis, the chief neurosurgeon at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center (GMBC). They discussed both surgical and nonsurgical treatments, and Mr. Armacost ultimately agreed to Dr. Davis's recommendation of a four-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery. Dr. Davis performed the procedure on March 1, 2012, and removed the damaged discs from Mr. Armacost's cervical spine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Armacost's recovery was not a smooth one. Although he expressed no concerns in the first few weeks following the surgery, Mr. Armacost contacted Dr. Davis and GBMC several times between March and August, by telephone and by visiting the emergency room. He complained of a \"pin-point opening\" at the end of his incision and, later, of chest pain and episodic and progressive numbness in his left arm. A nurse found no active drainage from the opening, and X-rays showed that the hardware from his fusion procedure was well placed. Mr. Armacost had no fever. Nonetheless, at one appointment he was given oral antibiotics, and Dr. Davis eventually ordered a CT myelogram\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to attempt to figure out the cause of Mr. Armacost's symptoms. Mr. Armacost took more than a month\n   to schedule that procedure, but it was eventually performed on July 20. Dr. Davis interpreted the CT myelogram as normal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 17, 2012, Mr. Armacost came to the GBMC emergency room reporting swelling and tenderness in his neck, redness near the incision, fever and chills. The \"pin-point opening\" had developed into an abscess. A doctor drained the abscess, and the fluid tested positive for a methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacterial infection\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   -some five months post operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 3, 2014, Mr. Armacost filed a statement of claim with the Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office. Mr. Armacost waived arbitration, and on November 3, 2014, he sued Dr. Davis and GBMC for malpractice and a failure to obtain informed consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At trial, Mr. Armacost's expert witness testified that the fusion procedure performed on Mr. Armacost, although performed well,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   was not medically necessary and was not appropriate for someone of Mr. Armacost's age and overall health condition. The same expert also told the jury that Dr. Davis and other members of GBMC's staff were too slow in diagnosing and treating Mr. Armacost's post-operative infection. Dr. Davis's experts, on the other hand, testified that Dr. Davis had complied with the standard of care in determining that Mr. Armacost was a candidate for the fusion surgery and that Dr. Davis had obtained Mr. Armacost's informed consent to the operation after appropriate disclosures. An infectious diseases expert testified that Mr. Armacost's infection, diagnosed in\n   mid-August, had been present for only a couple of weeks before it was caught; in other words, it hadn't been lingering for months, undetected by Dr. Davis's staff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The jury was excused for deliberation in the afternoon of May 23, 2016. On May 25, the jury returned a verdict for Dr. Davis on the informed consent issue but for Mr. Armacost on the malpractice issue, awarding him $329,000 in damages. Dr. Davis appeals from that judgment, challenging parts of the initial instructions and the court's supplemental instruction given in response to a note from the jury. The content and context of those instructions are discussed in detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The standard-of-care instructions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The first part of Dr. Davis's appeal focuses on the court's instructions to the jury at the close of the five-day trial. One instruction combined the substance of Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instructions 19:1 (defining negligence) and 19:3 (explaining the general-negligence concept of foreseeable circumstances) (emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Negligence is doing something that a person using\n   <em>\n    reasonable care\n   </em>\n   would not do, or not doing something that a person using\n   <em>\n    reasonable care\n   </em>\n   would do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Reasonable care\n   </em>\n   means that caution, attention or skill a\n   <em>\n    reasonable person\n   </em>\n   would use under similar circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A\n   <em>\n    reasonable person\n   </em>\n   changes conduct according to the circumstances and the danger that is known or would be appreciated by a\n   <em>\n    reasonable person\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, if the foreseeable danger increases, a\n   <em>\n    reasonable person\n   </em>\n   acts more carefully.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The trial court also instructed the jury on the requisite standard of care for physicians in the context of medical malpractice specifically:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A health care provider is negligent if the health care provider does not use that degree of care and skill which a reasonably competent health care provider engaged\n   in a similar practice and acting in similar circumstances would use.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After all the instructions were given, Dr. Davis objected:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [Defendant's Counsel\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]: I respectfully except to your decision to give the model pattern jury instruction 19:3, foreseeable circumstances....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   I believe giving the foreseeable circumstances instruction confuses the notion of whether or not Doctor Davis had to see into the future as to what may or may not happen with Mr. Armacost and therefore had a heightened duty to act in a different way....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The question for Doctor Davis in this case is ... was he negligent, did he do a surgery that wasn't indicated, did he fail to advise the Plaintiff about the surgery, and did he fail to properly appreciate the signs and symptoms of infection postoperatively.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   There are no facts in this case which would suggest that Doctor Davis had any duty beyond the normal standard that would apply to a health care professional....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court: Why don't we do this, it's 10:05 and the jury-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [Defendant's Counsel]: I'm done.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court: Good. Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: In responding to that, Your Honor, I think that the-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court: I don't need you to respond to that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: Very well. We have no exceptions for the Plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court: Okay. All right. One divisive issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The court did not otherwise respond to Dr. Davis's objection or modify the instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After the instructions were given to the jury, trial counsel gave their closing arguments. During the plaintiff's closing argument, counsel made the following comment to the jury (emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   What do you look to if you want to\n   <em>\n    ignore all of the expert testimony\n   </em>\n   ? You could do that in this case. It is your right [to] credit what you want to credit and ignore what you want to ignore.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The jury was sent to deliberate with a printed copy of the court's instructions and a verdict sheet to guide deliberation. The questions on the verdict sheet relevant to this appeal read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   1. Do you find that [Dr. Davis], and [GMBC] as his employer, were negligent in their treatment of [Mr. Armacost]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   2. Do you find the negligence of [Dr. Davis], and [GBMC] as his employer, caused injury to [Mr. Armacost]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The jury answered both questions affirmatively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Dr. Davis argues that the trial court committed reversible error by giving the foreseeable circumstances instruction, prejudicially heightening the duty owed to the plaintiff patient, Mr. Armacost. According to Dr. Davis, the contested instructions, sounding in general negligence, modified the standard of care to which Dr. Davis was expected to adhere, inviting the jury to compare his conduct to that of a reasonable person without his specialized\n   knowledge or skill. Dr. Davis contends that instructing the jury about foreseeable circumstances permitted the jury to speculate about inapplicable legal principles\n   and implied there was some type of foreseeable danger that required Dr. Davis to change his conduct accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mr. Armacost's response is straightforward: The instructions given were correct because the general rules of negligence apply to malpractice claims, which sound in negligence. Because the instructions were not erroneous, Mr. Armacost argues, they could not be prejudicial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We hold that giving the challenged instruction constitutes reversible error because (1) pattern jury instructions framed in terms of the conduct of a reasonable person are inapplicable in a medical malpractice case and (2) the context surrounding the given instruction did not dispel a probability of prejudice to Dr. Davis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

This error was reinforced by including Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instruction 19:1, which focuses on \"reasonable care\" and the \"caution, attention or skill [of] a reasonable person.\" While the instructions on general negligence and foreseeable circumstances may have been correct statements of negligence law in Maryland, they failed to account for a medical doctor's specialized knowledge and skill. The appropriate standard of care for Dr. Davis (Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instruction 27:1)-also given by the court-already takes account of the risks involved in the decision to operate and in any post-operative treatment.

In\n   <em>\n    Barksdale,\n   </em>\n   the plaintiff sued the owners of her childhood home, claiming she had been injured by lead paint on the premises. The Court of Appeals held an instruction given at trial, on a tenant's duty to keep a dwelling \"clean and sanitary,\" was erroneous because it \"was not relevant to the issues before the jury, i.e., whether the landlord was negligent or engaged in deceptive trade practices in renting the Property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698227\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/419/649/#p669\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698227\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/419/649/#p669\">\n    at 655-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698227\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/419/649/#p669\">\n    20 A.3d 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The instruction was prejudicial because it suggested that the plaintiff's grandmother, who rented the home from the defendant, may have been contributorily negligent for failing to report flaking paint to her landlord. Whether the grandmother had been negligent was not an issue before the jury, however, because the grandmother's failure to report the flaking paint could not be attributed to the child, who was also too young to have had any duty to report at that time.

In\n   <em>\n    Lindstrom v.

Even though the trial court later withdrew its instructions on the \"reasonably-prudent-person standard of care,\" it ended up granting the plaintiffs' motion for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed that grant because \"repeated references\" to the ordinary-care standard, in the court's words, \"permeated\" the jury's charge and \"failed to convey clearly to the jury the single standard of care applicable to a common carrier.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 677.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Application of this case law leads us to conclude that the erroneous instructions in the present case were prejudicial. The general negligence instructions struck at the heart of the case,\n   <em>\n    viz.,\n   </em>\n   Dr. Davis's liability, and permitted speculation about inapplicable legal principles (the hypothetical conduct of a reasonable person in the face of foreseeable harm). The concept of reasonable care as decided by ordinary people, \"permeated\" the charge given to the jury and left the jurors with two distinct standards against which Dr. Davis's conduct was\n   to be measured: that of a \"reasonable person\" and that of a \"reasonably competent health care provider engaged in a similar practice and acting in similar circumstances.\" Jurors were also asked to consider whether Dr. Davis had failed to consider some set of risks or to adapt his behavior to them-an issue, like contributory negligence in\n   <em>\n    Barksdale,\n   </em>\n   that was not raised by the evidence at trial. The misleading effect of the instruction was compounded by comments in Mr. Armacost's closing arguments inviting the jurors to disregard the expert testimony needed to establish the appropriate standard of care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Our concerns about juror speculation beyond the bounds permitted by the proper standard of care for health care professionals were not allayed by the following exchange between this Court and appellee's counsel at oral argument (emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   The Court: If the medical health care provider instruction encompasses a duty to consider the patient's preexisting health condition as part of the standard of care and skill, then how [is] the 19:3 instruction ... pertinent to what the jury is supposed to do? What legal principle does it add to the ... standard instruction for a medical malpractice case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Appellee: [I]t helps the jury to understand this idea of what is reasonable care. It is an additional piece of information for jurors who don't in their everyday lives think about what is reasonable care and what is reasonable care under the circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   The Court:\n   <em>\n    [A]re you saying that it allows them to make an assessment about reasonableness outside of what the experts have testified to?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Appellee: It allows them to make an assessment of reasonableness based on the evidence, which is what we asked them to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court: [A]nswer my question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Appellee:\n   <em>\n    The answer to your question is yes\n   </em>\n   because that's what we ask them to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Additionally, while the erroneous instruction was not reread for the jury, a printed version of the erroneous instruction accompanied the jury during its deliberations. And the other instructions given, orally and in print, did not remedy the error. The trial judge gave the proper standard of care only once. In total, the \"reasonably competent health care provider\" was mentioned one time in the instructions, while the \"reasonable person\" was named four times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   We are further inclined to find the error prejudicial because, although the jury completed a verdict sheet, the questions therein do not permit us to rule out the probable\n   prejudice of the error. The questions on the verdict sheet and the jury's yes-or-no answers to them tell us that Dr. Davis was found negligent but do not evince the standard of care upon which that verdict was based. As it was for the Court in\n   <em>\n    Barksdale,\n   </em>\n   it is impossible for us to divine the extent to which the erroneous instruction affected the jury's deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The law is clear that the jury was supposed to evaluate Dr. Davis against his peers. But the erroneous instructions from the trial judge and the invitation from plaintiff's counsel to disregard the opinions of the experts permitted a jury not made up of neurosurgeons to impermissibly speculate about how they would have approached the risks attendant in a four-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery. The instructions also implied that Dr. Davis's failure to adapt his course of treatment to an increasing danger was at issue when no such evidence was put before the trier of fact. For those reasons, we conclude that the challenged instructions were both erroneous and prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The supplemental jury instruction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The second part of Dr. Davis's appeal focuses on the timing and the wording of the modified\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge given by the trial judge, as well as the court's preface to the instruction. As noted above, the jury began to deliberate during the afternoon of May 23. Deliberation continued for all of May 24, until the jury sent a note to the court: \"Undecided. Please recess until tomorrow.\" The jury resumed deliberations on the next morning, and, at around 2:15 p.m., the jury sent the court another note that read, \"Please advise as to what happens if we are unable to reach a unanimous decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   At this point, the trial court conferred with counsel about how to respond to the jury's question (emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court: I propose to have them come out and read the Allen charge.\n   <em>\n    I'm going to let them know-I mean, today, if they can reach a decision today I think that's it, but we will give them another hour and see if anybody wants to re-examine his or her evidence.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   [Defendant's Counsel]: May I be heard briefly?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   [Defendant's Counsel]: I know that the Allen charge is relatively widely recognized but I would object to it being given.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   I think it unfairly indicates to people that they should sway their views and perhaps give up a position that they hold very firmly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   I would ask that the jury be given to the end of the day without it. And if they can't, at that point in time I would move for a mistrial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   The Court: Not responding to this note for two hours? Just let them sit in there, and stew, that's your proposal?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   [Defendant's Counsel]: Oh, no, Your Honor. I would bring them out and say we would ask that you continue your ... deliberations and attempt to reach a unanimous conclusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court: All right.

He first argues that the court abused its discretion in telling the jurors a mistrial would result from a failure to reach a unanimous decision. He also claims it was an abuse of discretion to give the modified\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge at all because it was not established that the jury was deadlocked. Finally, he challenges the court's addition to the approved language of the modified\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge, providing an apparent one-hour deadline to reach a verdict, which, he claims, unduly coerced the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Mr. Armacost responds that the trial court acted within its broad discretion in answering the jury's question about a failure to reach a unanimous decision and in deciding to issue the modified\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge on the third day of deliberations, after the jury had sent two notes indicating its inability to reach a unanimous decision. He also contends that the judge's asking jurors to deliberate for one more hour and telling them they would not be brought back the following day did not actually impose a deadline for a verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   We agree with Mr. Armacost on the first two points. But the third issue-the court's apparent one-hour deadline to reach a verdict-is more problematic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
