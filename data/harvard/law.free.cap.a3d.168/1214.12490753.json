Appellant left her first employer after accepting new employment that was to commence within seven days; her new employer, however, rescinded the offer before she ever began work. Finding this statute inapplicable-because appellant hadn't commenced her new employment within seven days-the Board found she was disqualified from receiving benefits. We reject the Board's interpretation and reverse,\n   finding a claimant need not actually start the new employment to be exempt from disqualification under\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   43:21-5(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant Patricia J. McClain began working as a teacher at Learning Edge Academy, Inc. in January 2013. She was on disability leave commencing in August 2015, and was scheduled to return to work in October.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 12, 2015, McClain accepted an offer from Kids Choice Academy for full-time employment. She immediately submitted a letter of resignation to Learning Edge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The next day, the director of Kids Choice requested McClain's permission to contact McClain's former employer and advised her an appointment would be made for her to be fingerprinted. Later in the day, the director rescinded the job offer to McClain because the person McClain was supposed to replace decided to return to work at Kids Choice. McClain also received an email from Learning Edge accepting her resignation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   McClain began looking for other jobs. She did not contact Learning Edge following its acceptance of her resignation because she did not think Learning Edge would want her to return since she had resigned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   McClain applied for unemployment benefits. Her claim was denied and she appealed. The Appeal Tribunal held a hearing, McClain testified, and the Appeal Tribunal affirmed the denial. The Appeal Tribunal found McClain resigned from her position with Learning Edge on October 12, 2015 to accept a higher paying position with Kids Choice, and that on October 13, 2015, Kids Choice rescinded the offer \"because the employee who originally held the position decided to return to work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Appeal Tribunal explained that a claimant is disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation benefits under\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   43:21-5(a) where the claimant \"has left work voluntarily\n   without good cause attributable to such work.\" The Appeal Tribunal also noted there is an exemption from the disqualification for\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   an individual who voluntarily leaves work with one employer to accept from another employer employment which commences not more than seven days after the individual leaves employment with the first employer, if the employment with the second employer has\n   weekly hours or pay not less than the hours or pay of the employment of the first employer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   43:21-5(a).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Appeal Tribunal determined McClain was not covered by the exemption because she did not actually commence employment with Kids Choice within seven days of her last day of employment at Learning Edge. The Appeal Tribunal therefore found McClain was disqualified from receiving benefits under\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   43:21-5(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   McClain appealed to the Board of Review. On April 14, 2016, the Board issued its final agency decision affirming the Appeal Tribunal's findings and ruling. The Board subsequently denied McClain's request for reopening. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Our scope of review of an administrative agency's decision is limited.\n   <em>\n    In re Stallworth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151881\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/208/182/#p194\">\n    208\n    <em>\n     N.J.\n    </em>\n    182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 194,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151881\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/208/182/#p194\">\n    26\n    <em>\n     A\n    </em>\n    .3d 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). \"In order to reverse an agency's judgment, an appellate court must find the agency's decision to be 'arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, or [ ] not supported by substantial credible evidence in the record as a whole.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151881\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/208/182/#p194\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Henry v.

The Board found the amendment required that a claimant actually commence employment within the seven-day period, and that McClain was disqualified from receiving benefits because she did not actually commence her employment at Kids Choice within seven days of her last day of employment at Learning Edge. McClain argues the Board misinterprets the amended statute, and that she was covered by its plain language because she voluntarily left the employment of Learning Edge \"to accept\" employment with Kids Choice that commenced within the seven-day period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We have carefully considered the amendment to\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   43:21-5(a) and are convinced its plain language is inconsistent with the Board's interpretation. The amendment does not expressly require that a claimant actually commence work within the seven-day period. To the contrary, the amendment requires only that a claimant leave work with the first employer \"to accept\" employment with the second employer which commences within the seven-day period. The Board's interpretation requires the imposition of a condition the Legislature did not include in the amendment: that the employee not only leave employment with the first\n   employer to accept employment which commences within the seven-day period, but also that the claimant actually commence the new employment within the seven-day period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We find nothing in the plain language of the amendment supporting the imposition of such a condition. If the Legislature intended to impose the requirement that a claimant actually commence employment within the seven-day period, it could have done so directly. Instead, the amendment provides only that there is no disqualification where, as here, a claimant leaves work to accept employment which commences within the seven-day period. We therefore reject the Board's interpretation of the amendment because it is not our function \"to 'rewrite a plainly-written enactment of the Legislature or presume that the Legislature intended something other than that expressed by way of the plain language.' \"\n   <em>\n    DiProspero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1186159\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/183/477/#p492\">\n    183\n    <em>\n     N.J.\n    </em>\n    at 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1186155,1186159\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/874/1039/\">\n    874\n    <em>\n     A\n    </em>\n    .2d 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    O'Connell v.

Moreover, the Board's argument that the legislative history supports its interpretation is contradicted by the plain language of the amendment. The Board relies on the following Senate Sponsor's statement annexed to the bill that was subsequently enacted as the 2015 amendment to\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   43:21-5(a) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   This bill provides that an individual is not disqualified from unemployment insurance\n   (UI) benefits for voluntarily leaving work if the individual leaves work\n   with one employer to accept from another employer employment which commences not more than seven days after the individual leaves employment with the first employer, and the employment with the second employer has weekly hours or pay not less than the hours or pay of the employment of the first employer, except that if the individual notifies the first employer that the individual will leave employment on a specified date and the first employer terminates the individual before that day, the seven-day period will commence from the specified date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Current law, [\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   ] 43:21-5(a), disqualifies an individual who voluntarily leaves a job from receiving UI benefits and requires the individual to become reemployed and work at least eight weeks, earning at least 10 times the individual's weekly UI benefit rate, before again being eligible for UI benefits.\n   <em>\n    This bill makes an exception from that requirement for an individual who leaves one job to accept a subsequent job at least equal in hours or pay, but is laid off from the subsequent job\n   </em>\n   . The UI laws of 26 states, and the regulations of five other states,\n   <em>\n    treat accepting other work as good cause for leaving work\n   </em>\n   , and do not disqualify workers for UI benefits for doing so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Sponsor's Statement to S. 2082, 216th Leg.\n   </em>\n   (May 19, 2014) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Board argues that the reference in the sponsor's statement to a claimant being \"laid-off\" means the amendment to\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   43:21-5(a) requires that the claimant actually commence work with the new employer within the seven-day period because an employee must begin work in order to be \"laid-off.\" However, the plain language of the enacted amendment is bereft of any requirement that the claimant actually commence work, and makes no reference to the claimant being \"laid-off.\" To the contrary, the best evidence of the Legislature's intent-the plain language of the amendment-requires only that a claimant leave work to accept employment which commences within the seven-day period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We are also unpersuaded by the Board's contention the sponsor's statement's reference to the unemployment insurance laws of twenty-six other states supports its interpretation of the amendment. According to the sponsor's statement, the laws in the other states do not require that a claimant actually commence work with\n   the new employer. Instead, the sponsor's statement explains that the laws in the other states \"treat accepting work as good cause for leaving work.\" Thus, the sponsor's statement describing the laws in the other states is consistent with the plain language of the amendment; accepting new employment which commences within the seven-day period is sufficient.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"In reading and interpreting a statute, primary regard must be given to the\n   fundamental purpose for which the legislation was enacted.

Here, we interpret only the language in the amendment to\n    <em>\n     N.J.S.A.\n    </em>\n    43:21-5(a), which is different from the statutory language of the other states referred to in the Board's brief.

We are not persuaded. The Iowa and Indiana statutes only highlight that where a Legislature intends that actual commencement of new employment is required for the exemption from disqualification, the requirement will be directly expressed in the applicable statute. The New Jersey Legislature chose not to expressly include such a requirement in the amendment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The Board adopted the Appeal Tribunal's factual finding that McClain resigned from her employment with Learning Edge \"to accept higher paying employment with\" Kids Choice.
