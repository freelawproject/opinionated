On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred when it (1) determined that this court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Visco\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cody\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1964248\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/16/444/\">\n    16 Conn.App. 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=547%20A.2d%20935\">\n    547 A.2d 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988), was inapplicable to the defendant's special defense of retaliatory eviction under \u00a7 47a-20 ; (2) determined that its complaint did not allege nonpayment of rent; and (3) interpreted the definition of rent in \u00a7 47a-20a to include the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's payment of its share of the agreed total rent for the premises such that the total amount of money received by the plaintiff was unaffected by the defendant's alleged underpayment. Following oral argument before this court, but before this court rendered its judgment, the plaintiff obtained possession of the apartment. Notified of this fact, we ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the issue of mootness. Following our review of the parties' supplemental briefs, we dismiss the appeal because it is moot and no exception to the mootness doctrine is applicable to the facts and circumstances of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are not in dispute. The defendant was served with a notice to quit possession of the apartment on September 3, 2014. This summary process action was commenced on September 15, 2014. The defendant filed a special defense claiming that the retaliatory eviction statute, \u00a7 47a-20, barred the plaintiff's summary process action because he had complained to a municipal authority about housing code violations and such authority had found violations of the housing code within six months of the commencement of the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 10, 2015, the defendant moved for summary judgment on the ground that \u00a7 47a-20 prohibited the plaintiff from maintaining a summary process action within six months of a complaint to, or notice by, a government agency of a housing code violation. On September 8, 2015, the plaintiff submitted its memorandum in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, arguing that the reason for the action was the \"fraud committed by the defendant in failing to report his income, which constitut[ed] a material violation of his lease.\" The plaintiff also argued that\n   <em>\n    Visco\n   </em>\n   required that the claimed defects constituting a violation of the housing code materially affect health and safety, and that the defendant failed to submit detailed information regarding the requested repairs. The court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment on February 5, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In its corrected memorandum of decision, the court determined that \u00a7 47a-20\n   barred the plaintiff's action, and that the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that any exception under \u00a7 47a-20a to the \u00a7 47a-20 bar applied. Specifically, the court concluded that, contrary to the plaintiff's assertion, the fitness and habitability requirements enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Visco\n   </em>\n   , relating to requested \"repairs\" as set forth in \u00a7 47a-20 (3), did not apply in the circumstance of a municipal agency's finding of\n   housing code violations as set forth in \u00a7 47a-20 (2). The court determined that \u00a7 47a-20 (2) required an actual finding by a municipal agency of a code violation, and concluded that New Haven's Livable City Initiative, the relevant municipal agency in the present case, found the existence of such code violations in the defendant's apartment, thereafter entering an order requiring remediation by the plaintiff within twenty-one days under threat of criminal liability. The court also determined that the exception claimed by the plaintiff under \u00a7 47a-20a (a) (1) was inapplicable to the facts of this case. Accordingly, the court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties agree that, following oral argument before this court on March 16, 2017, the defendant vacated and relinquished possession of the plaintiff's property on May 10, 2017. After the parties apprised this court of this fact, we ordered supplemental briefing on the issue of mootness and any possible exceptions thereto because the sole remedy sought by, and available to, the plaintiff in its summary process action was possession of the premises. The parties have since submitted supplemental briefs, and each argues that the \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" exception to mootness applies to this case. The plaintiff also argues in its supplemental brief that collateral consequences to the plaintiff will continue without a decision and, thus, the appeal is not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Mootness is a question of justiciability that must be determined as a threshold matter because it implicates this court's subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Wendy V.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20Conn.%20540\">\n    319 Conn. 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 545,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20A.3d%20983\">\n    125 A.3d 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). \"Justiciability requires (1) that there be an actual controversy between or among the parties to the dispute ...

When, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    In re Emma F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20Conn.%20414\">\n    315 Conn. 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 423-24,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20A.3d%20947\">\n    107 A.3d 947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). \"This court has consistently held that an appeal from a summary process judgment becomes moot where, at the time of the appeal, the defendant is no longer in possession of the premises.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Friedman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489668\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/703/#p260\">\n    172 Conn.App. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 260,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489668\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/703/#p260\">\n    159 A.3d 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As the defendant is no longer in possession of the property, the appeal is clearly moot, unless an exception applies and the parties do not contest this conclusion. Recognizing this, the parties argue that the issue raised on appeal, that this court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Visco\n   </em>\n   applies to retaliatory eviction defenses brought under \u00a7 47a-20 (2), satisfies the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception to the mootness doctrine. The plaintiff also argues that the collateral consequences doctrine applies because the court's interpretation of \u00a7 47a-20 (2) will allow other\n   tenants to utilize it as a defense, and, therefore, the appeal is not moot. We determine that neither of the claimed exceptions applies and, thus, the appeal is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"To qualify under the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception, three requirements must be met. First, the challenged action, or the effect of the challenged action, by its very nature must be of a limited duration so that there is a strong likelihood that the substantial majority of cases raising a question about\n   its validity will become moot before appellate litigation can be concluded. Second, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the question presented in the pending case will arise again in the future, and that it will affect either the same complaining party or a reasonably identifiable group for whom that party can be said to act as surrogate.

Moreover, if the question presented is not strongly likely to become moot in the substantial majority of cases in which it arises, the urgency of deciding the pending case is significantly reduced.

When the defendant vacated the premises in May, 2017, this appeal was under consideration by this court. In light of this recent history, we are not persuaded that this court or our Supreme Court will not be able to resolve in a later appeal, with a more complete factual record concerning\n   the fitness and habitability aspect of each of the code violations, whether the\n   <em>\n    Visco\n   </em>\n   fitness and habitability gloss to the meaning of repairs, as set forth in \u00a7 47a-20 (3), is applicable to a finding of code violations, pursuant to \u00a7 47a-20 (2). Accordingly, in the specific context of this appeal, after review of the parties' arguments in support of the application of the capable of repetition, yet evading review mootness exception, and in light of the somewhat limited contents of the factual record on which we must rely in part to resolve the\n   <em>\n    Visco\n   </em>\n   issue, we conclude that the first prong of that exception has not been satisfied by the parties.

[T]o invoke successfully the collateral consequences doctrine, the litigant must show that there is a reasonable possibility that prejudicial collateral consequences will occur. Accordingly, the litigant must establish these consequences by more than mere conjecture, but need not demonstrate that these consequences are more probable than not. This standard provides the necessary limitations on justiciability underlying the mootness doctrine itself. Whe[n] there is no direct practical relief available from the reversal of the judgment ... the collateral consequences doctrine acts as a surrogate, calling for a determination whether a decision in the case can afford the litigant some practical relief in the future.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Iacurci\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wells\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5754359\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/108/274/#p277\">\n    108 Conn.App. 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 277,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=947%20A.2d%201034\">\n    947 A.2d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiff argues that the failure of this court in this appeal to determine whether the\n   <em>\n    Visco\n   </em>\n   fitness and habitability gloss previously applied to \u00a7 47a-20 (3) is also applicable to \u00a7 47a-20 (2) would give rise to prejudicial collateral consequences to landlords in future summary process cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff, however, argues for an overbroad application of the collateral consequences doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Our appellate courts have applied the doctrine to instances in which the decision of the trial court gave rise to collateral consequences specific to a party to the case.

Without opining on the meaning of the provisions of \u00a7 47a-20 (2), we note that this may be one of those instances where the plaintiff's sought after remedy lies with the General Assembly because the current statutory language omits any requirement that a health code violation must implicate a leased unit's fitness and habitability. Additionally, the alleged consequences that are of concern to the plaintiff are general consequences potentially applicable to any residential landlord, not specific consequences unique to the plaintiff. We see this argument, therefore, as addressed to the capable of repetition and public interest prongs of the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception to mootness rather than the collateral consequences exception.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    The parties' arguments regarding the exceptions to mootness concern only the court's determination of the nonapplicability of\n    <em>\n     Visco\n    </em>\n    to \u00a7 47a-20 (2). Neither party has argued that the other claims raised on appeal are not moot or that an exception to mootness applies to them. The other claims also became moot when the defendant vacated and surrendered possession of the apartment to the plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
