Having considered the plain language of the Drug Court expungement statute, and its legislative history, we conclude that\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-14(m)(2) clearly imports the public interest requirement under\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:52-2(c)(3). We therefore vacate orders expunging the criminal records of T.B., J.N.-T. and R.C.,\n   and remand for appropriate application of the public interest test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As these appeals require us to consider the interplay between\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-14(m) and\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:52-2(c)(3), we review those key statutory provisions before considering the parties' arguments. Effective April 18, 2016,\n   <em>\n    L.\n   </em>\n   2015,\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   261, \u00a7 10, the Drug Court expungement statute generally provides for the expungement\n   of an offender's entire prior criminal record-\"all records and information relating to all prior arrests, detentions, convictions, and proceedings for any offense enumerated in Title 2C\"-after successfully completing, or graduating from, Drug Court probation without any intervening convictions.\n   <em>\n    L.\n   </em>\n   2015,\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   261, \u00a7 1, codified as\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-14(m)(1). The law applies to persons sentenced pursuant to\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-14.2 and\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:45-1.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The statute initially speaks permissively, stating, \"The Superior Court\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   order the expungement ... upon successful discharge from a term of special probation\" if the person satisfies two conditions: first, \"the person satisfactorily completed a substance abuse treatment program as ordered,\" and second, the person \"was not convicted of any crime, or adjudged a disorderly person or petty disorderly person, during the term of special probation.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Yet, the statute then speaks mandatorily: \"The court\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   grant the relief requested,\" unless the court finds one of two grounds for denial.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The first ground arises if \"the need for the availability of the records outweighs the desirability of having the person freed from any disabilities associated with their availability[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The second ground exists if \"the person is otherwise ineligible for expungement pursuant to paragraph (2)\" of\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-14(m).\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Paragraph 2 in turn provides, \"[a] person shall not be eligible for [a Drug Court] expungement ... if the [offender's] records include a conviction for any offense barred from expungement pursuant to subsection b. or c. of\n   <em>\n    N.J.S. [A.]\n   </em>\n   2C:52-2.\"\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-14(m)(2). Subsection (b) identifies several crimes that absolutely bar a person from regular expungement under\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:52-2 and, therefore, from any Drug Court expungement under\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-14(m).\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:52-2(b). These include, for example, kidnapping, murder, manslaughter, and various sexual offenses.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The focus of this appeal is subsection (c), which addresses crimes involving the sale, distribution, or possession with intent to sell a controlled dangerous substance (CDS).\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:52-2(c). Some crimes are absolutely barred from expungement if they are first- and second-degree offenses, while crimes involving roughly fourth-degree quantities of marijuana or hashish are not barred at all.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-5(b)(12),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:52-2(c)(1) and (2). However, some crimes-third- and other fourth-degree offenses-are barred unless the court finds expungement serves the public interest.\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:52-2(c)(3). Subsection (c) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   In the case of conviction for the sale or distribution of a controlled dangerous substance or possession thereof with intent to sell, expungement shall be denied except where the crimes involve:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) Marijuana, where the total quantity sold, distributed or possessed with intent to sell was 25 grams or less;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (2) Hashish, where the total quantity sold, distributed or possessed with intent to sell was five grams or less; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (3) Any controlled dangerous substance provided that the conviction is of the third or fourth degree, where the court finds that expungement is consistent with the public interest, giving due consideration to the nature of the offense and the petitioner's character and conduct since conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:52-2(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Drug Court expungement statute also requires the prosecutor \"to notify the court of any disqualifying convictions or any\n   other factors related to public safety\" that the court should consider.\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-14(m)(2). If a person who secures a Drug Court expungement thereafter commits a crime, \"the full record of arrests and convictions may be restored to public access and no future expungement shall be granted to such person.\"\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-14(m)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A person who graduates from Drug Court after the effective date need not file a formal petition for expungement as required by\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:52-7 to -14.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-14(m)(1) (stating that the \"provisions of\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.[A.]\n   </em>\n   2C:52-7 through\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.[A.]\n   </em>\n   2C:52-14 shall not apply\"). It is sufficient simply to convey the request to the Drug Court judge prior to graduation; submission of a form of order suffices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Administrative Directive #02-16 (May 23, 2016),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/notices/2016/n160526a.pdf. However, a person who graduated before the effective date of\n   <em>\n    L.\n   </em>\n   2015,\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   261, and seeks the relief provided by the statute must file \"a duly verified petition as provided in\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.[A.]\n   </em>\n   2C:52-7 for each crime or offense sought to be expunged.\"\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-14(m)(5). This petition \"shall proceed pursuant to\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.[A.]\n   </em>\n   2C:52-1 et seq. except that the requirements related to the expiration of the time periods specified in\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.[A.]\n   </em>\n   2C:52-2 through\"\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:52-4.1 are inapplicable.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The State contends that since convictions for third- and fourth-degree drug offenses bar expungement under\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:52-2(c)(3), absent a court finding that expungement serves the public interest, it follows that such convictions bar a Drug\n   Court expungement without an identical public interest finding. The applicants\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   contend, since such convictions are not an absolute bar to expungement under\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:52-2(c), a public interest finding is not required for a Drug Court expungement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court adopted the applicants' interpretation. The court had before it requests for expungement from three Drug Court graduates. All three entered Drug Court in 2011 after pleading guilty to third-degree crimes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   T.B. was convicted of possessing CDS,\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-10(a)(1). R.C. was convicted of the same crime, as well as manufacturing, distributing or dispensing CDS, or possessing it with intent to do so,\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-5(a)(1), -5(b)(3), and conspiracy,\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:5-2. J.N.-T. was convicted of burglary,\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:18-2. All three successfully completed Drug Court probation in May 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The applicants then sought orders under\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-14(m) expunging their entire criminal records, which included numerous prior convictions. T.B. and R.C. each had a third-degree conviction for manufacturing, distributing or dispensing CDS, or possession with intent to do so,\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-5. T.B. had eleven convictions since 1990-seven in municipal court and four in Superior Court-including a violation of\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-5(b)(3) in 1993. R.C. had three Superior Court convictions dating back to 1996, including a 2010 conviction under\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-5(a)(1) and -5(b)(3). Thus, his most recent conviction was his second such offense. J.N.-T. had\n   a third-degree conviction, from 1995, for distributing, dispensing or possessing CDS with intent to distribute within 1000 feet of a school,\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He was also convicted of seven other indictable offenses, plus one disorderly persons offense in municipal court, and one in family court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Over the State's objection, the trial court granted the three applications. In its written opinion, the court concluded that since\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:52-2(c) did not categorically bar expungements of the specified third- and fourth-degree CDS offenses, it did not present a barrier to Drug Court expungements. The court found that the applicants satisfied the requisites of\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:35-14(m)(1), and that the State failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence grounds to deny the requested relief. Nonetheless, the court found that it served the public interest to expunge the applicants' records:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The [applicants] have not been arrested in the last five years while on special probation. They have each completed substance abuse treatment programs. They are employed full-time and they have paid all fines and costs. They are current in their child support payments, and in the case of [J.N.-T.], paid $7,000 in child support arrearage. They are confirmed Drug Court graduates. Thus, they have satisfied their burden and meet all requirements to obtain the expungement of their criminal records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   To the extent the State maintains that [applicants'] drug offenses are disqualifying convictions, the Court concludes that precluding [applicants] with drug offenses from \"drug court expungement,\" absent other bases for rejection, is antithetical to the Drug Court mandate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Given the nature of the [applicants'] criminal records, [applicants'] respective commitments to sobriety and the Drug Court program, the Court concludes that all requirements for Drug Court expungement have been met. As such, to advance the [applicants'] goals of becoming productive members of society, it is in the public interest to provide them with the means to rejoin the community without the burden of a criminal record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The court thereafter expunged the applicants' convictions, as well as prior arrests not followed by convictions. The State's appeals followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We review de novo the trial court's interpretation of the statute.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court shall make the appropriate finding consistent with the principles set forth above and in\n   <em>\n    Kollman\n   </em>\n   . We express no opinion on the appropriateness of the requested expungements in these three cases, and leave it to the trial court's sound exercise of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Vacated and remanded. We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    This is also a basis for denying regular expungement under Chapter 52.\n    <em>\n     See N.J.S.A.\n    </em>\n    2C:52-14(b).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    We note that the excluded CDS offenses are not congruent with the definitions of related CDS offenses in Chapter 35. For example,\n    <em>\n     N.J.S.A.\n    </em>\n    2C:35-5(b)(12) makes it a fourth-degree crime to manufacture, distribute or dispense, or to possess with the intent to do so, less than one ounce of marijuana-which equals 28.3 grams-or less than five grams of hashish. However,\n    <em>\n     N.J.S.A.\n    </em>\n    2C:52-2(c) imposes no bar to expungement for convictions involving the sale, distribution, or possession with intent to do so, marijuana of 25 grams or less, or hashish of five grams or less. Also,\n    <em>\n     N.J.S.A.\n    </em>\n    2C:35-5 makes it unlawful \"[t]o manufacture, distribute or dispense, or to possess or have under his control with intent to manufacture, distribute or dispense\" CDS. Yet, the bar to expungement in\n    <em>\n     N.J.S.A.\n    </em>\n    2C:52-2(c) pertains only to convictions for \"the sale or distribution of a [CDS] or possession thereof with intent to sell,\" without reference to convictions for manufacturing, dispensing, or possession with intent to distribute by means other than sales.\n    <em>\n     Cf.
