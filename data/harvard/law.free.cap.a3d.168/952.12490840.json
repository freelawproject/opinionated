Petitioner, Timothy Alan Moats, was convicted of possession of child pornography, based in large part on photographs and a video the police found on his cell phone while executing a warrant to search it. Before trial, Petitioner filed a motion to suppress the photographs and video. The circuit court denied the motion and, on appeal following Petitioner's conviction, the Court of Special\n   Appeals affirmed the circuit court's ruling, holding that the affidavit in support of the warrant provided a substantial basis for the judge who issued the warrant to find probable cause to search the cell phone.\n   <em>\n    Moats v.

We therefore have no need to address the applicability of the good faith doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The case before us stems from discoveries the police made while investigating an unrelated incident. The pertinent facts of that investigation and its connection to this case were presented through the testimony of Sergeant Robert Zimmerman of the Garrett County Sheriff's Office. Sergeant Zimmerman was the only witness to testify at the hearing on Petitioner's motion to suppress the evidence discovered during the search of Petitioner's cell phone. Sergeant Zimmerman's undisputed testimony and the affidavit for the search warrant supplied the following information:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   One night in early January 2015, Petitioner and three other teenagers were riding in Petitioner's car through parts of Garrett County. During the ride, Petitioner provided marijuana and a pill containing Suboxone, a prescription drug used to treat opioid addiction. Petitioner crushed the pill with a lighter, snorted some of the substance using a dollar bill, and then passed it to the others. Later that night, the four teenagers arrived at a party, where it was later alleged that one member of the group, A.D.C., was sexually assaulted. Approximately two weeks later, Sergeant Zimmerman interviewed A.D.C., who recounted the events of the night in question, including Petitioner's provision of Suboxone. Sergeant Zimmerman later\n   interviewed the others who had been in the car that night, including Petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Petitioner told Sergeant Zimmerman that he and the others had used drugs, but he denied any involvement in the sexual assault of A.D.C. Relying in part on that admission, as well as the reports and interviews with A.D.C. and the other teenagers, the police obtained a warrant to arrest Petitioner on the drug-related charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sergeant Zimmerman testified that the police arrested Petitioner on January 23, 2015, and transported him to the Garrett County jail, where he was searched and the police seized the cell phone he was carrying.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioner was released from custody on January 24, 2015. His cell\n   phone was not returned to him. Sergeant Zimmerman retained it \"[t]o obtain further information on the investigation with [A.D.C.] and the sex offense, along with the CDS case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 26, 2015, two days after Petitioner's release, Sergeant Zimmerman prepared an application and affidavit for a warrant to search the cell phone. Consistent with his testimony at the suppression hearing, Sergeant Zimmerman included in the affidavit Petitioner's admission to distribution of Suboxone and marijuana. He also recounted his interview with A.D.C., who explained in detail the car ride during which Petitioner used and distributed the Suboxone. Sergeant Zimmerman further recounted that he had interviewed the other passengers in the vehicle on the night in question and obtained from them the same information regarding the drug\n   use. Sergeant Zimmerman also included information concerning his interview of a fifth person, R.W., who was not in the vehicle on the evening in question but later learned from A.D.C. about the drug distribution and sexual assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The warrant affidavit also included the circumstances of Petitioner's arrest on January 23, 2015, and the seizure of the cell phone in Petitioner's possession at the time of his arrest. The warrant affidavit further stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Your Affiant knows through his training and experience as a Criminal Investigator that individuals who participate in such crimes communicate via cellular telephones, via text messages, calls, e-mails etc.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Your Affiant avers, based on the information received from the aforementioned sources, your Affiant's observations, training, knowledge and expertise as a member of the Garrett County Sheriff's Office, Criminal Investigation Division, that there is probable cause to believe, and does believe, that evidence of violations of the laws relating to Sexual Offense, and related crimes, as well as the Possession and Distribution of Controlled Dangerous Substances as herein before cited, is contained in and upon the aforementioned cellular telephone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The affidavit details Sergeant Zimmerman's training and experience as a seventeen-year veteran of the Garrett County Sheriff's Office, including his work with the Garrett County Narcotics Task Force and with crimes involving Controlled Dangerous Substances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The affidavit also provided\n   detail regarding the types of cell phone data to be searched:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Therefore, your Affiant prays that a Search and Seizure Warrant be issued for the aforesaid cellular phone more\n   particularly described aforesaid with the necessary and proper assistance to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (A) Seize and cause to be completely examined by Your Affiant or, if necessary, a competent forensic cellular phone examiner, any and all electronic data processing and storage devices located in the above-described cellular telephone. Any phone call records being sent or received on these devices, any text mail \"messages\" sent or received on these devices, any stored, un-stored, unsorted phone numbers on these devices, any photographs stored on these devices, any external memory devices used on these devices in or incidental to the mentioned aforesaid crimes, as defined in the Annotated Code of Maryland, amended and revised; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (B) Seize and cause to be completely examined by Your Affiant or, if necessary, a competent forensic cellular telephone[ ] examiner[,] all media storage devices, including but not limited to e-mail content, text messages, photos and/or financial records and/or any and all account information that would relate to the aforesaid crimes, as defined in the Annotated Code of Maryland[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Later that same day, a judge of the District Court sitting in Garrett County issued the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Detective Keith Parks conducted a forensic investigation of the cell phone. In the course of that search, he discovered sexually explicit photographs and a video of a young female, taken between January 16 and 21, 2015. It was eventually discovered that the female in the photographs and video was Petitioner's girlfriend, who\n   was fifteen years old at the time those images were created. Petitioner, eighteen years old at that time, was indicted in the present case with three counts relating to child pornography and one count of second degree assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The motion to suppress\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Petitioner filed a motion to suppress the cell phone and the evidence obtained from the search of it. He advanced several\n   arguments, all of which were grounded in the protections provided by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A hearing on that motion was held on June 18, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Petitioner argued first that his arrest on January 23, 2015, was not supported by probable cause and, therefore, the cell phone and its contents must be suppressed as the tainted \"fruits\" of the illegal arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He further argued that, even if that arrest was lawful, the continued retention of his cell phone after his release on January 24, 2015, constituted an illegal warrantless seizure. From that premise, he further argued that the subsequent search of the cell phone, notwithstanding that it was conducted pursuant to a warrant, was the tainted fruit of the seizure of the cell phone. Petitioner also attacked the search warrant on the ground that it did not set forth probable cause to conduct the search. He asserted, in particular, that the affidavit in support of the warrant did not set forth probable cause for either the police to have arrested him for the crimes alleged in early January 2015 or to establish a \"nexus\" between those crimes and the contents on his cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Petitioner did not testify at the hearing on the motion, call any witnesses, or offer any evidence other than a document from \"Case Search\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   reflecting his release on January 24, 2015. Following arguments from counsel, the court issued its ruling on the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The circuit court rejected Petitioner's argument that his arrest was not supported by probable cause, thereby also rejecting his argument that the fruits of the arrest-the cell phone and the photos and video found on it-were tainted and must be suppressed. The circuit court also rejected Petitioner's alternative contention that Sergeant Zimmerman did not have probable cause to retain the cell phone following Petitioner's release on January 24. Finally, the court disagreed with Petitioner that the warrant to search the cell phone was not supported by probable cause. The court ultimately ruled that the warrant was properly issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The trial, appeal, and writ of certiorari\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The parties agreed that Petitioner would be tried on an agreed statement of facts on one count of possession of child pornography. The court found Petitioner guilty on that count, and, as further agreed by the parties before trial, the remaining counts were dropped, as were the unrelated drug charges then pending in the District\n   Court. The court sentenced Petitioner to eighteen months of incarceration, all suspended but the time he had already served. The court also sentenced Petitioner to two years' probation and required that he register as a sex offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Petitioner appealed the judgment to the Court of Special Appeals. Petitioner raised before the intermediate appellate court all but one of the arguments he had presented to the suppression court, abandoning only the claim that the cell phone and its contents were tainted fruits of an unlawful arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals rejected Petitioner's arguments. The court held, first, that the police were justified in continuing to retain Petitioner's cell phone after his release, in anticipation of seeking a warrant to search it. The Court of Special Appeals determined that the police reasonably believed that the phone would contain evidence pertaining to the then-ongoing police investigation of Petitioner's alleged involvement in the early January 2015 incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Moats\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487899,12171023\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/230/374/\">\n    230 Md.App. at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487899,12171023\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/230/374/\">\n    148 A.3d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Special Appeals also concluded that the information provided in the warrant affidavit supported a reasonable inference that Petitioner allegedly engaged in drug-related activity and was involved in the sexual assault upon A.D.C. The court further held that the affidavit supported a similarly reasonable inference that evidence of one or the other of those alleged offenses would be found on Petitioner's cell phone, thereby establishing a substantial basis for issuance of the search warrant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487899,12171023\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/230/374/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487899,12171023\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/230/374/\">\n    at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487899,12171023\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/230/374/\">\n    148 A.3d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Alternatively, the Court of Special Appeals held that, even if there was not a substantial basis for issuance of the warrant, Petitioner was not entitled to suppression of the evidence because \"[t]he record demonstrates that Sergeant Zimmerman acted in good faith in preparing the affidavit and obtaining a warrant before searching the electronic contents of [Petitioner's] cellular phone.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487899,12171023\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/230/374/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing and applying the good faith doctrine established in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He argues that the police unlawfully\n   retained the cell phone after his release because, at that time, the police did not have probable cause that it contained evidence of the crimes for which he had been arrested. He separately argues that the search warrant failed for lack of the requisite probable cause that his cell phone contained evidence of the drug-related activity and the alleged sexual assault of A.D.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The State replies that the police lawfully retained the cell phone because the authority to seize it incident to Petitioner's arrest did not evaporate upon Petitioner's release. As for Petitioner's argument that\n   the search warrant was not supported by probable cause, the State argues that there was a substantial basis for the warrant's issuance.

Petitioner challenges not the initial seizure of the cell phone, but rather its continued retention after his release. He argues that the continued\n   retention of the cell phone violated the Fourth Amendment because it was retained without the police having possessed, evidently at the moment of his release, probable cause that the cell phone contained evidence of the drug charges for which he had been arrested three days earlier. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Petitioner does not argue at this juncture that his arrest on charges related to drug distribution was unlawful. He could not do so successfully, in any event, given his admission to Sergeant Zimmerman that he shared Suboxone and marijuana with the other teens while they were together in Petitioner's car in early January 2015. Petitioner further appears to concede that the police had the authority automatically to seize the cell phone he had on his person at the time of the arrest. That is also a wise concession, given the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Riley v. California\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), decided seven months before Petitioner's arrest.

That information-that Petitioner brought Suboxone and marijuana in the car, consumed, at the least, some of the Suboxone, and offered it to the others, as well as the then-still ongoing investigation of an alleged sexual assault of one of the teens later that night-provides a substantial basis for the judge who issued the warrant to find probable cause that Petitioner's cell phone contained evidence of some or all of that suspected criminal behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We conclude, from all of the above, that the warrant-issuing judge had a substantial basis for issuing the warrant to search Petitioner's cell phone. We therefore hold that the suppression court did not err in denying Petitioner's motion to suppress\n   the images of his fifteen-year old girlfriend that the police found while executing the warrant to search Petitioner's cell phone. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, which came to the same conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Some Final Observations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Before concluding this opinion, we offer a few thoughts for judges-whether they be tasked with examining a warrant application or reviewing the decision of the warrant-issuing judge-that they might want to consider when the search at issue involves a cell phone. Unlike those of us who review search warrants for substantial basis or good faith execution, the judges of our circuit courts and the District Court to whom warrant applications are presented have the more challenging task of determining whether probable cause exists in the first instance. In examining an affidavit in support of a warrant to search a cell phone, as in any other warrant application, judges always must consider the totality of the information contained in the affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Not every affidavit will (or should) result in issuance of a warrant to search a cell phone. We can imagine situations in which the nature of the crime will not support a warrant to search the suspect's cell phone; examples might include traffic offenses, public nuisance crimes, and the like. Even in cases where the connection between the suspected crime and the cell phone is more likely to be established, the lack of factual detail or other circumstances might countenance against a finding of probable cause. The affiant's professed training and experience might fall short of demonstrating to the judge's satisfaction that the affiant's prediction can be relied upon in determining whether the evidence sought will be found in the cell phone the affiant wants to search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In the end, each application for a warrant to search a cell phone is to be addressed by the judge on the merits of the affidavit. The judge will necessarily consider the nature of the crime being investigated, the facts provided in support of the\n   connection between that crime and the cell phone to be searched, and, depending upon the affiant's demonstrated training and experience, the degree to which the deference owed to the affiant adds to the ultimate decision. The decision of the warrant-issuing judge will ultimately rest on whether, in its totality, the affidavit sets forth a fair probability that the information will be found in the cell phone to be searched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Greene and Adkins, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Concurring Opinion by Adkins, J., which Greene, J., joins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Most respectfully, I write separately because I am troubled by the implications of the Majority's opinion regarding probable cause and the lack of particularity in the search warrant.

This Court has explained that \"constitutional and statutory provisions demand that a search warrant shall contain a description of the premises to be searched definite enough to prevent any unauthorized and\n   <strong>\n    unnecessary invasion\n   </strong>\n   of the rights of privacy.\"\n   <em>\n    Saunders v.

Therefore, temporal limitations on data searches may be essential to satisfy the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment. Although the affiant knew when the alleged CDS distribution occurred, the warrant authorized him to search through every scrap of data on Petitioner's phone. This includes any \"external memory devices\"-presumably including any cloud storage-regardless of the temporal proximity to criminal conduct justifying the search. I would not read the Fourth Amendment, and its particularity requirement, to allow such a warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Police officers already capably draft search warrant affidavits for a range of property such as cars, houses, and other personal effects. They can do so for cell phones as well. I would require that, at a minimum, a search warrant for a cell phone should contain a temporal limitation to prevent the \"unnecessary invasion of the rights of privacy.\"\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2230148\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/199/568/#p572\">\n    199 Md. at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20618\">\n    87 A.2d 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To permit otherwise would sanction search warrants lacking particularity. I would affirm the Court of Special Appeals' determination that the photographs and videos recovered from Petitioner's phone were admissible under the good faith exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
