HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Scott Matthew Marshall pleaded guilty to murdering Staci Montgomery and was sentenced to forty years in prison. He signed a judicial confession stating that he \u201cintentionally and knowingly\u201d caused Montgomery\u2019s death, and that he \u201cintentionally and knowingly\u201d committed aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by threatening her with imminent bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Donna Cowey, Montgomery\u2019s mother, then sued Marshall and others under the Texas Wrongful Death and Survival Acts. State Farm Lloyds (\u201cState Farm\u201d) agreed to defend Marshall under a renters\u2019 insurance policy, subject to a reservation of rights to deny indemnity for any judgment against him. Cowey obtained a judgment of $700,633.44 against Marshall in February 2014. In particular, the jury awarded $190,000 for past and future loss of companionship and society, $150,000 for past and future mental anguish suffered by Cowey, $250,000 for pain and mental anguish experienced by Montgomery \u201cbefore her death,\u201d $19,587 in funeral and burial expenses, and $75,000 in exemplary damages, awarded \u201cas a penalty or by way of punishment.\u201d Meanwhile, State Farm sued Marshall and Cowey, seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no duty to indemnify Marshall or pay a judgment against him for damages arising out of Montgomery\u2019s death. The district court granted State Farm\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered a declaratory judgment against Marshall and Cowey. Cowey filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, viewing \u201call facts and evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Juino v. Livingston Parish Fire Dist. No. 5, </em>717 F.3d 431, 433 (5th Cir.2013). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A genuine dispute of material fact exists when the \u201cevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Royal v. CCC &amp; R Tres Arboles, L.L.C., </em>736 F.3d 396, 400 (5th Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202, (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">Texas law applies to this diversity lawsuit. Under Texas law, an \u201cinsurer\u2019s duty to indemnify depends on the facts proven and whether the damages caused by the actions or omissions proven are covered by the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>D.R. Horton-Tex., Ltd. v. Markel Int\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>300 S.W.3d 740, 744 (Tex.2009). \u201cIn Texas, the insured carries the burden to establish the insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify by presenting facts sufficient to demonstrate coverage.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. Puget Plastics Corp., </em>532 F.3d 398, 401 (5th Cir.2008). Given that \u201c[t]he underlying case often does not resolve all the factual issues necessary to determine coverage,\u201d \u201ccourts are not precluded from making factual findings in coverage actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>In construing an insurance policy under Texas law, we apply general principles of contract law. <em>Gilbert Tex. Constr., L.P. v. Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s London, </em>327 S.W.3d 118, 126 (Tex.2010). To determine the parties\u2019 intent, we first look to the language of the policy, seeking to harmonize and give effect to all provisions. <em>Id. </em>\u201cPolicy terms are given their ordinary and commonly understood meaning unless the policy itself shows the parties intended a different, technical meaning.\u201d <em>Don\u2019s Bldg. Supply, Inc. v. OneBeacon Ins. Co., </em>267 S.W.3d 20, 23 (Tex.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The policy at issue indemnifies Marshall for a suit brought against him \u201cfor damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this coverage applies, caused by an occurrence.\u201d An \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined as \u201can accident, including exposure to conditions, which results in: (a) bodily injury; or (b) property damage.\u201d \u201cBodily injury\u201d is defined as \u201cphysical harm to a person,\u201d and does not include \u201cemotional distress, mental anguish ... or similar injury unless it arises out of actual physical injury to some person.\u201d Although the term \u201caccident\u201d is not defined in the policy, the Texas Supreme Court has defined an \u201caccident\u201d in the insurance context as \u201ca fortuitous, unexpected, and unintended event.\u201d <em>Lamar Homes, Inc. v. Mid-Continent Cas. </em>Co., 242 S.W.3d 1, 8 (Tex.2007). \u201cIn Texas, deliberate acts may constitute an accident unless: (1) the resulting damage was \u2018highly probable\u2019 because it was \u2018the natural and expected result of the insured\u2019s actions,\u2019 (2) \u2018the insured intended the injury,\u2019 or (3) the insured\u2019s acts constitute an intentional tort, in which case, the insured is presumed to have intended the injury.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa., </em>532 F.3d at 402 (quoting <em>Lamar Homes, Inc., </em>242 S.W.3d at 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Cowey concedes that Montgomery\u2019s murder was not an \u201coccurrence\u201d and therefore was excluded from policy coverage. Instead, Cowey argues that the policy covers damages resulting from Marshall\u2019s actions before the murder. However, under the policy, damages are recoverable only if they arise from \u201cbodily injury or property damage.\u201d \u201cBodily injury\u201d is defined as \u201cphysical harm,\u201d and Cowey does not identify any physical harm separate from the injuries caused by the murder. While Cowey points to the award for mental anguish suffered by Montgomery before she died, mental anguish is a \u201cbodily injury\u201d only if it \u201carises out of actual physical injury.\u201d In the civil lawsuit, Marshall stipulated that after he shot Montgomery, she did not die immediately, but rather attempted to leave the residence while bleeding profusely. To the extent that the award was based on Montgomery\u2019s mental anguish during that time, the -anguish was caused by her murder, which Cowey concedes is not an accident. To the extent the award was based on Montgomery\u2019s mental anguish before the shooting, Cow-ey does not identify any physical injury from which that anguish arose. In addition, the record compels the conclusion that Marshall\u2019s actions before the murder either were intentional or had a high probability of causing damage. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">No reasonable jury could find that State Farm had a duty to indemnify Marshall or pay a judgment against him for damages. We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of State Farm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b804-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
