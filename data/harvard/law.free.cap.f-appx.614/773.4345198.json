Williams appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his pro se complaint which asserted various federal and state law claims in relation to the 2012 foreclosure of real property (\u201cthe Property\u201d) located at 2815 Austin Road, Nesbit, .Mississippi. On motion of some of the defendants pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (b)(6), the district court concluded that Williams failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted, that he lacked standing, and that his claims are barred by res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Article III standing is a jurisdictional prerequisite. <em>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 101, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998); <em>Xerox Corp. v. Genmoora Corp., </em>888 F.2d 345, 350 (5th Cir.1989). Article III requires that, at a minimum, a plaintiff show an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d that is fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct and that is likely to be redressed by the requested relief. <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). An injury in fact is one that is \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d and \u201cactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">Williams has failed to allege any injury in fact that is not barred by collateral estoppel. All of Williams\u2019s claims and the alleged injuries resulting from the defendants\u2019 actions rest on his alleged ownership interest in the Property. In dismissing Williams\u2019s state law claims stemming from the foreclosure proceedings with prejudice, the DeSoto County (Mississippi) Chancery Court expressly determined that Williams has \u201cno valid, lawful interest\u201d in the Property. Thus, Williams cannot seek recovery for any of the alleged harms set forth in his federal complaint, as amended, without relitigating his purported interest in the Property. <em>See Stafford v. True Temper Sports, </em>123 F.3d 291, 295 (5th Cir.1997). Without any injury in fact, he does not have standing to bring this action. <em>See Rohm &amp; Hass Tex., Inc. v. Ortiz Bros. Insulation, Inc., </em>32 F.3d 205, 209 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">Although we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Williams\u2019s amended complaint for lack of standing, we modify the judgment. Ordinarily, when a complaint is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, including lack of standing, it should be without prejudice. We therefore modify the district court\u2019s judgment to make it without prejudice and affirm it as thus modified. <em>See, e.g., In re Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. LLC, </em>624 F.3d 201, 209 (5th Cir.2010); <em>cf. </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b796-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
