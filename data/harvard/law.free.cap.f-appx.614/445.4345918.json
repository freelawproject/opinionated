We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">A. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">We construe the facts in the light most favorable to Morrison, as did the district court. The facts arise from Morrison\u2019s attendance at a concert at Chastain Park Amphitheater in August 2010. Morrison attended the Friday night concert with her husband and one of his co-workers. During the concert, Morrison moved to approach the stage and noticed a security guard directing other attendees to move back from the stage. She decided to go up the bleachers, away from the stage, and smoke a cigarette. On the way up the stairs, someone grabbed her around the throat and forcefully slammed her down onto the cement. She landed on the right side of her body and her face hit the cement. It was dark, and she did not know who attacked her, so she kicked the attacker in defense. She then heard her husband ask an individual why he slammed his wife to the ground. At that point, Morrison realized it was an officer. The officer punched her husband in the face, knocked him to the ground and then smashed Morrison\u2019s face into the cement until he secured her with handcuffs. Morrison stated that although she was injured and in pain, no EMS personnel checked her injuries. She did admit that she and her husband had been drinking at the concert.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">The officer transported Morrison and her husband to a police station. Morrison did not identify her specific injuries, but claimed that she sustained abrasions to her face, neck, shoulder, and knee. During the five hours the police detained her at the station, no one checked her injuries or cleaned her wounds. During this time, she repeatedly asked to use a restroom, but none of the officers responded to her request. Eventually, she soiled herself. Morrison stated that no officer offered her or her husband water during their detention. At some point, her husband was able to use a restroom and get some water. Morrison asked him to bring her some water in his mouth. He was able to do that, and he spit the water into her mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">After someone informed Morrison that she was going to jail and would not be released until Monday, she started \u201cfreaking out\u201d and hyperventilating. She was concerned for her 2 year-old child, who was with a sitter and had a medical condition that required regular medications. The sitter did not have enough medicine for the child, and Morrison begged the officers to allow her to call the sitter, but she received no response. Morrison became so distraught and anxious and requested someone help her obtain her medicine, but no one offered to help. \u25a0 She then began to bang her head on the wall to get attention and treatment. Eventually, officers transported her to the Fulton County Jail, where she remained until early the next day, when the authorities released her.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>B. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Morrison filed her complaint against the City of Atlanta, Officers Boyd and Walker, Fulton County, and other defendants asserting claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and state law for excessive force and inadequate medical care. The Fulton County defendants and the City defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims. The district court granted summary judgment to all defendants on all claims. Morrison filed her notice of appeal. This court granted a joint motion to dismiss with prejudice the appeal as to the Fulton County defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">II.ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the City defendants on Morrison\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">III.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Myers v. Bowman, </em>713 F.3d 1319, 1326 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">Like the district court, we \u201cmust consider the facts and the justifiable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmov-ing party,\u201d which here is Morrison. <em>West v. Davis, </em>767 F.3d 1063, 1066 (11th Cir.2014). \u201cSummary judgment may be granted only if there is no genuine dispute of any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn issue of fact is \u2018material\u2019 if, under the applicable substantive law, it might affect the outcome of the case. An issue of fact is \u2018genuine\u2019 if the record taken as a whole could lead a rational\u2019 trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Harrison v. Culliver, </em>746 F.3d 1288, 1298 (11th Cir.2014) (quoting <em>Hickson Corp. v. N. Crossarm Co., </em>357 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (11th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">IV.DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b469-15\">A. <em>Excessive Force</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-16\">\u201cThe Fourth Amendment\u2019s freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures encompasses the plain right to be free from the use of excessive force in the course of an arrest.\u201d <em>Lee v. Ferraro, </em>284 F.3d 1188, 1197 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cFourth Amendment jurisprudence has long recognized that the right to make an arrest or investigatory stop necessarily carries with it the right to use some degree of physical coercion or threat thereof to effect it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1871-72, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989)). This circuit has explained that the \u201capplication of de minimis force, without more, will not support\u201d an excessive force claim and will not defeat an officer\u2019s qualified immunity. <em>Nolin v. Isbell, </em>207 F.3d 1253, 1257 (11th Cir.2000). Qualified immunity functions as immunity from suit, and officials seeking qualified immunity must first establish that they were acting within their \u201cdiscretionary authority when the alleged constitutional violation occurred.\u201d <em>Lewis v. City of W. Palm Beach, </em>561 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2009). The burden then shifts to the plaintiff, who can overcome the qualified immunity defense by showing that (1) the defendant\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right and (2) this right was \u201cclearly established at the time of the alleged violation.\u201d <em>Townsend v. Jefferson Cnty., </em>601 F.3d 1152, 1158 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-17\">To prevail on a Fourth Amendment excessive-force claim, the plaintiff must show both that a seizure occurred and the force used was unreasonable. <em>See Troupe v. Sarasota Cnty., Fla., </em>419 F.3d 1160, 1166 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe \u2018reasonableness\u2019 inquiry in an excessive force case is an ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>jective one: the question is whether the officer\u2019s actions are \u2018objectively reasonable\u2019 in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him, <em>without regard to his underlying intent or motivation.\u201d Kesinger ex rel. Estate of Kesinger v. Herrington, </em>381 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2004) (emphasis added). As a result, the question whether Officer Boyd acted unconstitutionally is answered from the perspective of a reasonable officer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">The \u201creasonableness\u201d of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.... The calculus of reason- - ableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments \u2014 in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving \u2014 about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\"><em>Troupe, </em>419 F.3d at 1168 (quoting <em>Menuel v. City of Atlanta, </em>25 F.3d 990, 996 (11th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Morrison\u2019s excessive force claim fails. First, in her declaration, she admitted that she had no idea who slammed her to the ground. Despite this fact, she submitted no testimony or other evidence (other than her own hearsay statement) from the one person who allegedly identified Officer Boyd as her attacker \u2014 her husband \u2014 in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. On the other hand, Officer Boyd attested that he had no interaction with Morrison until after she was already on the ground and engaged in an altercation with private security officers. Morrison offered no competent evidence to refute Boyd\u2019s statement or to support her conclusory assertion that Officer Boyd was the individual who slammed her to the ground. Against Officer Boyd\u2019s specific testimony regarding when his involvement with Morrison began, Morrison\u2019s conclusory and speculative assertion is insufficient to raise a genuine issue for trial. <em>See Leigh v. Warner Bros. Inc., </em>212 F.3d 1210, 1217 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that an affidavit that contains a brief conclusory assertion without supporting facts has no probative value).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Second, Morrison cannot demonstrate that the force Officer Boyd used to detain her was objectively unreasonable. Morrison admits that she had been drinking at the concert, and when Officer Boyd arrived at the scene, Morrison was struggling with security personnel. Officer Boyd used the force necessary to subdue Morrison. Moreover, Morrison does not demonstrate that she suffered more than minor injuries. She does not identify any specific injuries, but contends that she did not receive medical care to clean her open wounds. Morrison fails to overcome her burden to show that Officer Boyd is not entitled to qualified immunity under these circumstances. Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment to Officer Boyd.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">B. <em>Inadequate medical care</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">Morrison alleges that Officers Boyd and Walker provided no medical care for her injuries at the event facility or in the police precinct and contends that such conduct violated her constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">Due process requires penal facilities to provide inmates with adequate medical care. A pretrial detainee\u2019s rights exist under the due process clause of the Four<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>teenth Amendment rather than the Eighth Amendment. Nonetheless, this circuit has applied the Eighth Amendment\u2019s \u201cserious medical needs\u201d analysis to pretrial detainee\u2019s claims of inadequate medical treatment under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Hamm v. DeKalb Cnty., </em>774 F.2d 1567,1574 (11th Cir.1985). To prevail on a deprivation of medical care claim, a prisoner must show that she suffered a serious medical need, the defendants exhibited deliberate indifference to that need, and the indifference caused the plaintiffs injury. <em>See Mann v. Taser Int'l, Inc., </em>588 F.3d 1291, 1306-07 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Morrison cannot prevail on her claim of inadequate medical care. She does not present any sufficient evidence that she suffered from \u201can objectively serious medical need,\u201d so grave that \u201cif left unattended, pose[d] a substantial risk of serious harm.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Adams, </em>221 F.3d 1254, 1258 (11th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Morrison mentions only that she suffered facial wounds that were not cleaned and eventually became infected. These wounds do not constitute a serious medical need. <em>See Duncan v. Corr. Med. Serv., </em>451 Fed.Appx. 901, 903 (11th Cir.2012) (stating that a serious medical need can be either (1) \u201cone that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor\u2019s attention\u201d or (2) one where \u201ca delay in treating the need worsens the condition\u201d (quoting <em>Mann, </em>588 F.3d at 1307)). Accordingly, the district court properly granted judgment to the officers on Morrison\u2019s inadequate medical needs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The district court properly granted summary judgment to the City and the officers on Morrison\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims of excessive force and inadequate medical care. The district court also properly dismissed the state law claims of assault and battery against the City, as it was entitled to sovereign immunity. <em>See Cameron v. Lang, </em>274 Ga. 122, 549 S.E.2d 341, 346 (2001) (sovereign immunity protects all levels of government from legal action unless they have waived immunity). Similarly, the district court properly granted official immunity to the officers on Morrison\u2019s state law claims of assault and battery because she failed to offer any evidence that either officer acted negligently or with malice. <em>See Gilbert v. Richardson, </em>264 Ga. 744, 452 S.E.2d 476, 481 (1994) (finding that official immunity offers limited protection from suit to governmental officers and employees); <em>Grammens v. Dollar, </em>287 Ga. 618, 697 S.E.2d 775, 777 (2010) (noting that public officer is personally liable for acts negligently performed or acts performed with malice or an intent to injure). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\">. Morrison made no claims as to excessive force against Officer Walker and made no argument that any other defendant, including the City, should be liable for Officer Boyd\u2019s conduct. Thus, the district court properly dismissed these claims and granted judgment for Officer Walker and the City on Morrison\u2019s claim of excessive force.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
