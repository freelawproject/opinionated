Harrison brought this two-count action in an attempt to invalidate an administrative decision of the defendant Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the \u201cFDIC\u201d) that effectively nullified Harrison\u2019s prior settlement agreement with the defendant Ocean Bank. After Ocean Bank terminated his employment, Harrison threatened to assert claims against Ocean Bank, and under the terms of the settlement agreement, Harrison would receive $1,000,000 in return for the release of those claims. The FDIC\u2019s decision to classify the proposed settlement payments as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments and to deny Ocean Bank\u2019s request for approval of the payments, however, had the effect of voiding the agreement. Harrison contended that the FDIC\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious and not in accordance with applicable law,\u201d in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">The district court (1) granted defendant FDIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, (2) denied plaintiff Harrison\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and (3) dismissed Harrison\u2019s claims against defendant Ocean Bank. Harrison appeals <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">After a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">I. RELEVANT STATUTES AND REGULATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b452-16\">Section 1828(k)(l) of Title 12 of the U.S.Code authorizes the FDIC to \u201cprohibit or limit, by regulation or order, any golden parachute payment or indemnification payment.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1828(k)(l). Accordingly, the FDIC has generally prohibited banks from making \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments unless the bank first obtains approval for the payment from the bank\u2019s primary federal regulator. <em>See </em>12 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>\u00a7 359.2 (general prohibition on golden parachute payments); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 359.4 (permissible golden parachute payments).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">But what is a \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payment? Section 1828(k)(4)(A) defines a \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payment, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">The term \u201cgolden parachute payment\u201d means any payment (or any agreement to make any payment) in the nature of compensation by any insured depository institution or covered company for the benefit of any institution-affiliated party pursuant to an obligation of such institution or covered company that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">(i) is contingent on the termination of such party\u2019s affiliation with the institution or covered company; and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">(ii) is received on or after the date on which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">(III) the institution\u2019s appropriate Federal banking agency determines that the insured depository institution is in a troubled condition (as defined in the regulations prescribed pursuant to section 1831i(f) of this title).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1828(k)(4)(A). An \u201cinstitution-affiliated party\u201d includes \u201cany director, officer, [or] employee\u201d of the insured bank. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1813(u).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1828(k), the FDIC has promulgated a regulation in 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 359.1(f) that further defines \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments, in relevant part, as follows: (1) \u201cany payment (or any agreement to make any payment)\u201d by an FDIC-insured bank; (2) \u201cin the nature of compensation\u201d; (3) \u201cfor the benefit of any current or former\u201d employee; (4) that \u201c[i]s contingent on, or by its terms is payable, on or after, the termination\u201d of the employee\u2019s employment by the bank; and (5) is or would be received on or after a determination by the FDIC that the insured bank is \u201cin a troubled condition.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 359.1(f)(1). Under regulation \u00a7 359.1(k), a \u201cpayment\u201d is further defined as \u201c[a]ny. direct or indirect transfer of any funds\u201d and \u201c[t]he conferring of any benefit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 359.1(k)(l), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">This \u00a7 1828(k)(4) statute, as further defined by the \u00a7' 359.1 regulations, is just one of the numerous restrictions and controls that arises when an insured bank is in a \u201ctroubled condition,\u201d <em>see, e.g., id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 371.1-371.5 (maintenance of records by banks in a troubled condition); the restrictions are designed to protect the capital of the troubled bank and the regulatory insurance fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b453-17\">A. Harrison\u2019s Termination and Settlement Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b453-18\">Harrison served as senior vice president and chief appraiser for Ocean Bank for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>about a year from October 22, 2007, until October 24, 2008, when the bank involuntarily terminated his employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following his termination, Harrison threatened to file a lawsuit against Ocean Bank, alleging various claims arising out of alleged mistreatment by Ocean Bank and its management during his employment and in connection with his termination. Specifically, Harrison threatened to assert claims of defamation; intentional infliction of emotional distress; whistleblower retaliation, in violation of state and federal laws; and discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, in violation of state law and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Although no lawsuit was filed, Harrison and Ocean Bank engaged in pre-suit mediation to avoid litigation costs. Mediation yielded a settlement agreement signed on March 6, 2009. Under the terms of the settlement, Ocean Bank agreed to pay Harrison $1,000,000, attributable to Harrison\u2019s claimed damages for lost back pay; non-pecuniary compensatory damages for emotional distress, humiliation, and loss of dignity; and attorney\u2019s fees. The sum included $78,000 for \u201cback pay,\u201d $589,000 for \u201calleged compensatory damages,\u201d and $833,000 for \u201cattorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d The settlement agreement provided that Harrison \u201cacknowledges that these payments are consideration to which he is not already, entitled.\u201d The funds were deposited in an interest-bearing escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In exchange for the settlement payments, Harrison released any and all claims he had against Ocean Bank, including any claims relating to his employment, as well as those claims relating to his termination. Harrison also agreed that he would \u201cnot re-apply for employment or seek reinstatement\u201d at Ocean Bank and that Ocean Bank would have \u201cno obligation to re-employ [him] in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">The settlement agreement, however, was conditional. At the time of Harrison\u2019s terminatibn and the execution of the agreement, the FDIC had classified Ocean Bank as being in a \u201ctroubled condition,\u201d pursuant to 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 303.101(c). As such, Ocean Bank was generally prohibited from making \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments without first obtaining the approval of the FDIC. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 182800; 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 359.2 and 359.4(a). The settlement agreement provided that Harrison and Ocean Bank \u201cunderstand that this Agreement is subject to approval by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u2018FDIC\u2019), as the primary bank regulator of Ocean Bank, and the Florida Office of Financial Regulation (\u2018OFR\u2019).\u201d The agreement further provided that the settlement would \u201cbecomef ] null and void without penalty to any party if the Agreement is not approved by the FDIC and the OFR.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">On March 16, 2009, Ocean Bank requested approval of the settlement agreement from the FDIC.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its letter .requesting approval from the FDIC, Ocean Bank stated that it \u201cdid not believe there was any merit to Harrison\u2019s claims\u201d but made \u201ca business decision\u201d to engage in pre-suit mediation and settle the claims. Ocean Bank further stated that, \u201c[although [it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>did] not believe that the payments to Harrison under the Settlement Agreement constitute \u2018golden parachute\u2019 payments, in an abundance of caution, [Ocean Bank] made the Settlement Agreement subject to the consent of the FDIC.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In April 2009, the FDIC informed Ocean Bank that it considered the proposed settlement payments to be \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments, as defined by 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 359.1(f). On October 20, 2009, the FDIC denied Ocean Bank\u2019s request for approval of the settlement. The FDIC reiterated its conclusion that the proposed settlement payments would constitute \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments. The FDIC, however, did not explain in any more detail why it classified the Ocean Bank payments as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments under the relevant statute and regulations. Rather, the FDIC stated that approving the settlement would \u201cset[ ] a dangerous precedent for .settlements should the Bank wish to terminate other employees who have not performed to their expectations.\u201d The FDIC also stated that the \u201cmaterial the Bank provided to support the settlement does not make a compelling case to settle the matter at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">B. Harrison\u2019s First Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">On January 11, 2010, Harrison filed a two-count lawsuit against Ocean Bank and the FDIC. Hai\u2019rison alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the FDIC\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious, erroneous, and unjustifiable\u201d under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2), because it was \u201cwithout any analysis or legal justification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">The FDIC and Harrison eventually filed competing motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Harrison argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the FDIC\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d because the FDIC \u201cfail[ed] to provide any rationale, explanation, or justification for its decision\u201d to classify the proposed settlement payments as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments. Harrison also contended that the FDIC\u2019s conclusion that the proposed settlement payments would constitute \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments was \u201carbitrary, capricious, erroneous, and contrary to the statutory and regulatory language and intent\u201d because the proposed payments were not \u201cin the nature of compensation,\u201d as required by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1828(k)(4)(A) and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 359.1(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">On July 23, 2010, the district court granted Harrison\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denied the FDIC\u2019s motion, and remanded the issue to the FDIC for further proceedings. Specifically, the district court found that the FDIC\u2019s decision to classify the proposed settlement payments as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments \u201cwas. arbitrary and capricious under the APA for its failure to articulate its reasoning behind the decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">Because the district court concluded that the FDIC failed to explain its rationale, it did \u201cnot address whether the FDIC reached the correct decision in finding that the Settlement Agreement was a golden parachute payment\u201d and thus did not consider Harrison\u2019s argument that the proposed settlement payments were not \u201cin the nature of compensation.\u201d The district court\u2019s order merely remanded the issue to the FDIC for further proceedings, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the FDIC could articulate its reasoning for classifying the payments as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">C. The FDIC\u2019s Decision on Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">On July 30, 2010, one week after the district court remanded the \u201cgolden parachute\u201d issue to the FDIC, Ocean Bank sent a letter to the FDIC, requesting that, \u201c[i]n the event that the FDIC again concludes that the settlement payment meets the definition of a \u2018[g]olden [p]araehute\u2019 under the regulations,\u201d the FDIC nonetheless approve the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">On August 5, 2010, the FDIC issued a final agency decision denying approval of the proposed settlement payments. In that decision, the FDIC again concluded that the proposed settlement payments would constitute \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments. Specifically, the FDIC stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">Pursuant to 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 359.1(f)(1), any payment payable to a current or former institution-affiliated party (\u201cIAP\u201d) on or after the termination of his employment by the institution and received on or after the Bank is in troubled condition is a golden parachute payment. A payment is defined as any direct or indirect transfer of funds and the conferring of any benefit. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 359.1(k)(l) and (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">The FDIC\u2019s decision then applied that definition to Harrison. It stated that Harrison was an institution-affiliated party, that Ocean Bank was in troubled condition, and that \u201c[t]he payment of funds was to be made after Harrison\u2019s termination from the Bank, and is made contingent on his termination.\u201d . Turning to Harrison\u2019s argument that the proposed payments were not \u201cin the nature of compensation,\u201d under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1828(k)(4)(A) and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 .359.1(f)(1), the FDIC decision explained why the settlement payments to Harrison would be \u201cin the nature of compensation\u201d under the statute and regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">While 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 359.1(f)(1) defines a golden parachute payment to be a payment in the \u201cnature of compensation,\u201d the term \u201ccompensation\u201d was intended to be broadly construed in the regulation. The payment at issue not only arose out of the employer-employee relationship, but includes elements of back pay, front pay, and \u201ccompensatory damages.\u201d All of the proposed amounts are considered to be compensation to Harrison for his termination, and thus constitute compensation for purposes of the regulation. A payment to avoid litigation that otherwise satisfies the definition of a golden parachute is covered by the regulation. Some of the central purposes of this regulation are to prevent the improper disposition of institution assets and to protect the financial soundness of insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies, and the federal deposit insurance fund. Our decision that the proposed payment to Harrison under the Agreement constitutes a golden parachute payment is consistent with those purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">As the district court noted, the FDIC\u2019s formal denial letter \u201cfinishefd] with three bullet points on the FDIC\u2019s general view of the Settlement\u2019s relationship to Ocean Bank\u2019s best interests\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-12\">\u201c[T]he total proposed payment of $1,000,000 under the Agreement is excessive in relation to Harrison\u2019s compensation, duties, and short tenure at the Bank[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-13\">\u201c[T]he total proposed settlement payment and the amount the Bank would pay directly are significant\u201d and \u201c[t]his amount represents a significant charge to the Bank\u2019s already battered earnings and troubled financial position.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>\u201c[TJhere has been no demonstration that the payment to Harrison would be a long-term savings to the Bank\u201d and it \u201cmight set a dangerous precedent for settlements should the Bank wish to terminate other employees who have no[t] performed to expectations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Accordingly, the FDIC concluded that the proposed settlement payment \u201cmeets all of the terms of the golden parachute definition in 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 359.1(f).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">As a result of the FDIC\u2019s decision, Ocean Bank has not made any payment pursuant to the settlement agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ocean Bank, however, has kept the funds in the interest-bearing escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">D. Harrison\u2019s Second Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">On August 31, 2010, following the FDIC\u2019s final decision, Harrison filed this action \u2014 a two-count lawsuit against Ocean Bank and the FDIC. Harrison fashioned Count I as a \u201cDeclaratory Judgment of Contract\u201d and sought (1) a declaratory judgment that the proposed settlement payments would not be \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments under 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 359.1(f), (2) an order directing the FDIC to approve the payments, (3) an order directing Ocean Bank to release and disburse the escrowed funds, and (4) costs and attorney\u2019s fees. Harrison labeled Count II \u201cDeclaratory Relief under APA\u201d and requested the same relief as sought' in Count I, except to add a request that the district court declare that the FDIC\u2019s decision was \u201cnot in accordance with applicable law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Harrison and the FDIC eventually filed competing motions for summary judgment. Harrison contended that the 'FDIC\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious and not in accordance with applicable law\u201d because, <em>inter alia, </em>the proposed settlement payments were not \u201cin the nature of compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">The FDIC argued that the proposed settlement payments were \u201cin the nature of compensation\u201d because \u201cthe proposed payment included substantial \u2018compensation\u2019 for claims arising out of his termination of employment, as well as for \u2018back pay.\u2019 \u201d The FDIC further asserted that the payments were deniable under both the statute and regulations, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsO\">Harrison cannot plausibly assert that the proposed payment is not \u201ccompensation\u201d within the meaning of the regulation. The FDIC submits that the application would be deniable under the terms of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1828(k)(4), without even resorting to the definition in Regulation \u00a7 359.1(k)_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-13\">[TJhe language of the Settlement Agreement describes the payments as \u201ccompensation\u201d and this falls squarely under the FDIC\u2019s statutes and regulation. The back pay component of the settlement cannot possibly be argued not to be \u201ccompensation.\u201d Further, the damages were described in the Agreement as \u201ccompensatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">On June 30, 2011, the district court entered an order (1) granting the FDIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment and (2) denying Harrison\u2019s motion\" for summary judgment. The district court found \u201cno evidence that the FDIC\u2019s determination was arbitrary or capricious.\u201d Specifically, the district court noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-15\">In the [August 5, 2010 final agency decision], the FDIC defines payment pursuant to 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 359.1(k)(l) and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 359.1(k)(2) as any direct or indirect transfer of any funds and the conferring of any benefit. The FDIC categorizes Harrison as an institution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>affiliated party (\u201cIAP\u201d) pursuant to the regulation after brief description of his title and length of employment with Ocean Bank....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\">The FDIC then details its application of the regulation to the termination and resulting Settlement to Harrison. The FDIC explains its rationale that the term compensation \u201cwas intended to be broadly construed in the regulation.\u201d It also states that \u201c[a]ll the proposed amounts are considered to be compensation to Harrison for his termination, and thus constitute compensation for purposes of the regulation.\u201d The FDIC analysis continues, explaining that it applied the regulation in an attempt [to] follow the central purposes of the regulation as it interprets it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">(Paragraph break added).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The district court also concluded that \u201cthe FDIC adequately explained to Harrison the manner in which it applied 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 359.1(f) to Harrison\u2019s Settlement Agreement and how that application led to it to determine the Agreement to be a golden parachute payment. The FDIC was the agency required to make the determination and in doing so, it provided the rationale for its determination in its letter ... dated August 5, 2010.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Harrison timely appealed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Federal courts review a challenge to an agency decision under the standard set forth by the APA. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706; <em>see also Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Rice, </em>85 F.3d 535, 541 (11th Cir.1996). The APA provides, in relevant part, that a court shall \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions\u201d that are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2). We apply this same standard on appeal that the district court applied below. <em>See Fund for Animals, </em>85 F.3d at 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">As an initial matter, we agree with the district court\u2019s thorough analysis as to (1) the FDIC\u2019s determination that Harrison was an \u201cinstitution affiliated party,\u201d (2) the FDIC\u2019s conclusion that Ocean Bank was in \u201ctroubled condition,\u201d and .(3) the sufficiency of the rationale provided by the FDIC. As to these issues, Harrison has failed to establish that the FDIC\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). Thus, to the extent Harrison claims the district court erred on these three points, we conclude that the district court did not err and is due to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-15\">Harrison\u2019s only argument that requires further consideration is his contention that the proposed settlement payments were not \u201cin the nature of compensation,\u201d pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1828(k)(4)(A), and thus the FDIC\u2019s decision was \u201cnot in accordance with law,\u201d under 5 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\u00a7 706(2)(A). Harrison contends that the FDIC thus lacked the authority to prohibit those payments.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">A.Review of Agency Regulations</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">We begin with the well-settled principle that, \u201c[w]hen Congress has \u2018explicitly left a gap for an agency to fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation,\u2019 and any ensuing regulation is binding in the courts unless procedurally defective, arbitrary or capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d <em>United States v.

Johnson, </em>436 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Auer v. Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 461, 117 S.Ct. 905, 911, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997)). We offer the same level of deference to agency interpretations even where an agency interprets terms concerning the scope of the agency\u2019s authority. <em>See City of Arlington, Tex. v. F.C.C., </em>569 U.S. -, -, 133 S.Ct. 1863, 1868-69, -L.Ed.2d - (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">However,.a regulation may be \u201cparroting regulation\u201d \u2014 a regulation that uses the same terms as the statute authorizing the agency to issue the regulation. <em>See Gonzales v. Oregon, </em>546 U.S. 243, 257, 126 S.Ct. 904, 916, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006). Where a plaintiff challenges an agency\u2019s application of a parroting regulation, the question for the courts \u201cis not the meaning of the regulation but the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-15\">B. Regulation \u00a7 359.1</p>\n<p id=\"b459-16\">The regulatory definition of \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments in \u00a7 359.1(f)(1) clarifies the meaning of several statutory terms in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1828(h)(4). For example, the regulation broadly defines the statutory phrase \u201cinstitution affiliated party,\u201d <em>see </em>12 U.S.C. .\u00a7 1828(k)(4)(A), to include \u201cany current or former\u201d employee, <em>see </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 359.1(f)(1). In addition, the regulation expansively defines agreements that are \u201ccontingent on [an employee\u2019s] termination,\u201d <em>see </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1828(k)(4)(A)(i), to include any agreement to make a payment that \u201cby its terms is payable on or after\u201d the termination of the employee, <em>see </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 359.1(f)(l)(i). Furthermore, the regulation adopts a broad interpretation of the statute\u2019s use of the word \u201ctermination,\u201d <em>see </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1828(k)(4)(A)(i), by specifying that the \u201ctermination\u201d of an employee includes the termination of the employee\u2019s \u201cprimary employment\u201d (and, thus, not necessarily all employment) with the bank, <em>see </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 359.1(f)(l)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-18\">While the regulation itself does not define \u201cin the nature of compensation,\u201d the FDIC\u2019s decision in this case, in interpreting the statute, returned to the phrase\u2014 contained in both the statute and the regulation \u2014 and explained that its modifying language \u2014 \u201cin the nature of\u2019 \u2014 meant that \u201ccompensation\u201d was to be construed broadly. In explaining its interpretation, the FDIC relied heavily on the purpose of the statute and the regulation, as noted above:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>&lt; Some of the central purposes of this regulation are to prevent the improper disposition of institution assets and to. protect the financial soundness of insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies, and the federal deposit insurance fund. Our decision that the proposed payment to Harrison under the Agreement constitutes a golden parachute payment is consistent with those purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">It is debatable here whether interpretation of the phrase \u2014 \u201cin the nature of compensation\u201d \u2014 remains a question of statutory construction, not a question of interpreting agency regulations with the deference that is due to an agency interpretation. <em>See Gonzales, </em>546 U.S. at 257, 126 S.Ct. at 916. While the regulations do not define that precise phrase, they do provide an expansive reading of other terms surrounding that phrase to provide further context for interpreting \u201cin the nature of compensation.\u201d And there is no requirement that every word in a statute be defined in a regulation for deference to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In any event, whether deference or <em>de novo </em>review is required, we conclude that Harrison has not shown the FDIC\u2019s interpretation of \u201cin .the nature of compensation\u201d as applied to his specific proposed settlement payments was erroneous. Both the statute \u00a7 1828(k)(4) and regulation \u00a7 359.1(f)(1) employ the phrase \u201cin the nature of\u2019 before the term \u201ccompensation.\u201d The phrase \u201cin the nature of\u2019 signals that the term \u201ccompensation\u201d should be construed broadly. Put simply, the settlement agreement purports to pay Harrison $1,000,000 in compensation related to the termination of his affiliation with the bank. The sum includes $78,000 for \u201cback pay,\u201d $589,000 for \u201calleged compensatory damages,\u201d and $330,000 for \u201cattorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d These payments are plainly compensatory in nature and relate directly to Harrison\u2019s position as senior vice president and chief appraiser at the bank. These payments would not have been offered in the absence of Harrison\u2019s termination as an officer and employee of Ocean Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">y. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">For the all the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the FDIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-12\">. The regulation states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-13\">The term golden parachute payment means any payment (or any agreement to make any payment) in the nature of compensation by any insured depository institution or an affiliated depository institution holding company for the benefit of any current or former IAP pursuant to an obligation of such institution or holding company that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9i\">(i) Is contingent on, or by.its terms is payable on or after, the termination of such party's primary employment or affiliation with the institution or holding company; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH7\">(ii) Is received on or after, or is made in contemplation of, any of the following events:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aql\">(C) A determination by the insured depository institution's, or depository institution holding company\u2019s appropriate federal banking agency, respectively, that the insured depository institution or depository institution holding company is in a troubled condition, as defined in the applicable regulations of the appropriate federal banking agency (\u00a7 303.101(c) of this chapter).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMN\">12 C.F.R. \u00a7 359.1(f)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b454-6\">. Harrison was an at-will employee of Ocean Bank and had no written employment agreement with the bank. Harrison received an annual salary of $150,000, and he collected a $20,000 signing bonus and quarterly bonuses totaling $31,125.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\">. On March 16, 2009, Ocean Bank also requested the approval of the OFR. On March 20, OFR replied to Ocean Bank\u2019s request, stating that, because \"the settlement payment to Mr. Harrison does not violate any law or regulation which this office is responsible for enforcing, the Office of Financial Regulation takes no position on the payment to Mr. Harrison.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\">. While Harrison\u2019s first lawsuit was pending \u2014 and thus after the FDIC denied Ocean Bank's request for approval of the settlement agreement \u2014 Ocean Bank and Harrison agreed to an alternative settlement, in which Harrison would receive $529,000. On May 19, 2010, Ocean Bank submitted a formal request for the FDIC's approval of the alternative settlement. The FDIC denied approval of the alternative settlement \"for the same reasons that the original Golden Parachute application was denied.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b457-10\">. Because the FDIC also rejected the alternative settlement agreement, <em>see supra </em>note 5, Ocean Bank \u00e1lso has not made any payments to Harrison pursuant to that document.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b458-10\">. In its June 30, 2011 order, the district court did not specify whether Harrison\u2019s claims against Ocean Bank survived its order. And the district court\u2019s order of final judgment stated that \"judgment [was] entered in favor of the Defendant [FDIC] and against Plaintiff [Harrison].\" The order of final judgment made no mention of Ocean Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">On August 6, 2012, this Court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Harrison\u2019s initial appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the \"district court's June 30, 2011 order [was] not final as to all claims and parties, and the court [had] not entered a certification\u2019\u2019 pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. On April 30, 2014, the district court entered an order dismissing all claims against Ocean Bank and an amended final judgment in favor of the FDIC and Ocean Bank.
