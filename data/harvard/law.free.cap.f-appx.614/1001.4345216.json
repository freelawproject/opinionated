Christian challenges his convictions on two grounds. First, he contends that plain error occurred because the prosecutor commented on Christian\u2019s pre-trial incarceration and suggested that he belonged in custody because he was dangerous. Second, he argues that the district court abused its discretion in limiting his cross-examination concerning a cooperating co-defendant\u2019s bias. After review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-19\">Just before noon on March 28, 2012, a PNC Bank in Gainesville, Florida, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>robbed. Surveillance photos showed the robber, later determined to be Christian, being dropped off by a white Chevrolet Tahoe. Dressed all in black except for white gloves, Christian entered the bank with a gun in his right hand and a ski mask over his face. Christian pointed a gun at one of the bank managers, threw a bag at him, and told him to fill it with money. The manager took the bag to one of the tellers, who filled the bag with just over $2,000 and a dye pack. Christian grabbed the bag and fled the bank. The dye pack exploded as Christian ran to the same white Tahoe. During the course of the robbery, Christian twice threatened to shoot the manager if bank employees did not hurry up.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">A day or two after the robbery, Christian called an acquaintance, Joseph Riley, to ask if he could stop by and request a favor. Christian and his girlfriend, Dania Ifill, went to Riley\u2019s residence. While there, Christian told Riley he needed a place to hide out for a couple of days. He eventually admitted to both Ifill and Riley that he had robbed the PNC Bank. Ifill then left. Riley and his wife allowed Christian to stay one night in their house. Out of fear, they did not call the police, although Riley later told his employer what Christian had said. Christian left early the next morning. At some point thereafter, Christian fled to the United States Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">In investigating the robbery, police searched records of white Chevrolet Ta-hoes in the central Florida area. One of the vehicles belonged to the stepfather of Kentrell Houston. Houston was pulled over in the Tahoe several times by police following the robbery, but he denied involvement. During one of .these stops, police searched the Tahoe with Houston\u2019s consent and found white gloves in the back portion of the vehicle. In a later interview with police, Houston eventually admitted to being the getaway driver for the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">Christian was arrested in the Virgin Islands and transported to the Alachua County Jail in Gainesville. He asked to speak with federal officials because he wanted the case to be prosecuted federally. On September 7, 2012, two detectives and a federal agent jointly interviewed Christian. During the recorded interview at the jail, Christian confessed that he had committed the bank robbery. He also provided details about the robbery, including that he had used a .40-caliber pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">Christian and Houston were indicted in November 2012. Christian was charged with one count each of armed bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), 2113(d), and 2, possessing and brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) and 2, and being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). Christian proceeded to trial. Houston pled guilty and testified for the government at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">A jury found Christian guilty of all three counts. The district court adjudicated Christian guilty and sentenced him to a total term of 346 months of imprisonment. Christian now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">Christian argues for the first time on appeal that the prosecutor, when questioning Ifill during the trial, suggested that Christian belonged in custody because he was dangerous. According to Christian, this exchange, when viewed in context of a pattern of references to his incarceration throughout the trial, impaired his presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">Where no objection is made at trial, we review for plain error whether comments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>about a defendant\u2019s incarceration deprived him of a fair trial in violation of due process. <em>See United States v. Barcenas, </em>498 F.2d 1110, 1113 (5th Cir.1974).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To establish plain error, a defendant must show (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>478 F.3d 1332, 1338 (11th Cir.2007). If all three conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to recognize the error, but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">The Supreme Court has held that the presumption of innocence may be iin-paired, and the due-process right to a fair trial violated, where the accused is compelled to stand trial while dressed in clearly identifiable prison clothing. <em>Estelle v. Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 503-05, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 1692-93, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976); <em>see also United States v. Harris, </em>703 F.2d 508, 509-12 (11th Cir.1983) (holding that due process was violated where the defendant was compelled to dress in prison clothing during jury voir dire). The Court explained that prison clothing is a \u201cconstant reminder of the accused\u2019s condition\u201d that is likely to be a \u201ccontinuing influence throughout the trial,\u201d presenting an unacceptable risk of \u201cimpermissible factors coming into play\u201d and corrupting a juror\u2019s judgment. <em>Estelle, </em>425 U.S. at 504-05, 96 S.Ct. at 1693. For example, we have noted that a jury\u2019s knowledge of a defendant\u2019s pre-trial incarceration \u201cmay lead the jury to speculate that the defendant is particularly dangerous.\u201d <em>United States v. Villabona-Garnica, </em>63 F.3d 1051, 1058 n. 6 (11th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Harris, </em>703 F.2d at 510).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Likewise, we have recognized that comments about a defendant\u2019s incarceration also can impair the presumption of innocence. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 1058. Comments about a defendant\u2019s incarceration do not, however, constitute reversible error <em>per se. Id. </em>Rather, we consider the context and circumstances to determine whether the comments prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>See id. </em>(collecting cases); <em>see also United States v. Flores, </em>572 F.3d 1254, 1262 (11th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>565 F.3d 1324, 1335 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201c[Wjhere the comment is brief, unelicited, and .unresponsive, adding nothing to the government\u2019s case, the denial of a mistrial is proper.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">During direct examination of Ifill as part of the government\u2019s case-in-chief, the prosecutor asked, \u201cAre you concerned for your safety?\u201d Ifill responded, \u201cA little.\u201d The government replied, \u201cDo you know he\u2019s in custody, though?\u201d Ifill responded, \u201cYes, I know.\u201d Christian contends that the prosecutor\u2019s comments improperly suggest that Christian should be incarcerated because he was dangerous and posed a threat to Ifill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">The prosecutor\u2019s question to Ifill about Christian being in custody was improper. In contrast to <em>Barcenas </em>and <em>Villabonar-Garnica, </em>for example, the .reference to pre-trial custody did not come from a witness\u2019s non-responsive answer but instead came directly from the prosecutor. <em>See Villabona-Garnica, </em>63 F.3d at 1058; <em>Barcenas, </em>498 F.2d at 1113-14. Although Christian acknowledges in his reply brief that his dangerousness \u201cwas germane to the case,\u201d the reference to Christian\u2019s pre-trial custody should have been avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-11\">Nonetheless, we cannot conclude that Christian has shown \u201cthat the remark[s] so influenced the trial\u2019s outcome or affected his rights as to constitute plain error.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number><em>United States v. Veteto, </em>701 F.2d 136, 140 (11th Cir.1983). Viewing the remarks in context, we believe that any prejudice resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s questioning did not substantially affect the fairness of the trial. <em>See United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 20, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1048-49, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (holding that a prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks did not rise to the level of a plainly erroneous due-process violation because they did not \u201cundermine the fairness of the trial and contribute to a miscarriage of justice error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">First, the government introduced extensive evidence, unchallenged by Christian both below and on appeal, establishing Christian\u2019s dangerousness even before the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments. Ifill herself testified that she was threatened several times by Christian, including that Christian was \u201cgoing to make [Ifill\u2019s] life a living hell.\u201d Given that the reference to Christian\u2019s pre-trial incarceration immediately followed this discussion of Christian\u2019s threats, the prosecutor\u2019s comments did not inject into the trial any implication of dangerousness that was not already present to a significant extent. Other evidence before the improper comments similarly supports that Christian was dangerous. Riley and his wife both testified that they were fearful of Christian. And both Ifill and Riley testified that Christian admitted committing the armed bank robbery, which, according to the bank employees\u2019 earlier testimony, involved threats of shooting innocent employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">Second, other references to Christian\u2019s pre-trial incarceration were made for the purpose of establishing a foundation and context for the admission of Christian\u2019s confession at the county jail.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As such, these later referehces to jail and Christian\u2019s pre-trial incarceration were relevant to issues properly before the jury at trial. <em>See Barcenas, </em>498 F.2d at 1113 (stating that references to \u201cjail,\u201d \u201cprison,\u201d and similar terms are \u201cto be avoided, <em>where irrelevant </em>\u201d) (emphasis added). And since they independently established Christian\u2019s in-custody status, the prosecutor\u2019s comments to Ifill added nothing that was not already admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">Third, and finally, the evidence overwhelmingly established Christian\u2019s guilt of the bank robbery. <em>Cf. Harris, </em>703 F.2d at 513 (\u201c[I]f the evidence of guilt is overwhelming, then the constitutional error occasioned by the defendant\u2019s appearance in a prison uniform is harmless under <em>[Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967)].\u201d) Both Ifill and Riley testified that Christian told them that he had robbed the bank. Houston testified that he was the getaway driver for Christian when Christian robbed the bank. And in Christian\u2019s confession, played before, the jury at trial, Christian admitted that he robbed the bank, and he provided details about the bank robbery that were consistent with the other evidence in the case, \u25a0 In addition, Ifill testified that she found dye-stained money in their washing machine, after being told by Christian not to look inside, and Christian\u2019s brother\u2019s wife testified that she received a bag from Ifill after the robbery containing Christian\u2019s clothing and a .40-caliber pistol, which was the type of gun used in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">Consequently, even if the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper, Christian has not shown that the remarks so influenced the trial\u2019s outcome or affected his right to a fair trial as to constitute plain error. <em>See Veteto, </em>701 F.2d at 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-12\">Christian next argues that his inability to question Houston about other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>crimes violated his right to cross-examination under the Sixth Amendment because he was unable to explore part of the benefits that Houston received from testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">We review a district court\u2019s decision limiting cross-examination for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Orisnord, </em>488 F.3d 1169, 1178 (11th Cir.2007). Nonetheless, the district court\u2019s discretion in limiting the scope of cross-examination is subject to the requirements of the Sixth Amendment. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1319 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment \u201cguarantees criminal defendants an opportunity to impeach through cross-examination the testimony of witnesses for the prosecution.\u201d <em>United States v. Baptista-Rodriguez, </em>17 F.3d 1354, 1370 (11th Cir.1994). \u201cThe importance of full cross-examination increases where the witness is the star government witness or participated in the crimes for which the defendant is being prosecuted.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>526 F.3d at 1319. Also, \u201cwhere a prosecution witness has been threatened with a criminal charge or actually charged with a criminal offense, the defendant is entitled to explore those circumstances on cross-examination in order to bring to the jury\u2019s attention the witness\u2019 possible motive or self-interest with respect to the testimony given.\u201d <em>United States v. Garrett, </em>727 F.2d 1003, 1011 (11th Cir.1984), superseded by statute on other grounds, <em>United States v. Elgersma, </em>929 F.2d 1538, 1544-45 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">But not all limitations on otherwise permissible cross-examination violate the Confrontation Clause. <em>Baptista-Rodriguez, </em>17 F.3d at 1370. Trial judges may impose reasonable limits on otherwise permissible cross-examination based on various concerns, including confusion of the issues or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant. <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1435, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986). \u201cThe test for the Confrontation Clause is whether a reasonable jury would have received a significantly different impression of the witness\u2019 credibility had counsel pursued the proposed line of cross-examination.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>13 F.3d 1464, 1469 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">At trial, Houston testified that he had pled guilty to bank robbery and to aiding and abetting in the possession of a firearm, and that he was cooperating with the government in hopes of receiving a reduced sentence. Houston further explained that, on May 31, 2012, a detective asked Houston to come to the police station to speak with him about \u201csomething else.\u201d At some point the discussion turned to the bank robbery and, after initially lying about his involvement, Houston eventually confessed to knowing about and participating in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Houston if he had ever been charged with the crime \u2014 the \u201csomething else\u201d \u2014 that the detective originally wanted to talk to him about. The government objected. During a sidebar conference, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-10\">[Prosecutor]: My concern is [defense counsel] has been asking him have you ever been charged with a crime. That\u2019s not proper impeachment \u2014 but to say he has been charged because he has one prior charge and I have a copy of the <em>nolle prosequi</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-11\">[Defense Counsel]: That\u2019s precisely what I want to ask him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-12\">[The Court]: It is your contention that that\u2019s part of a plea bargain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-13\">[Defense Counsel]: That\u2019s my contention. He didn\u2019t get charged with a shooting incident involved with a firearm that\u2019s not involved in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>While the transcript does not reflect a ruling by the court, the parties agree that the court sustained the government\u2019s objection. Defense counsel then cross-examined Houston about his possession of another firearm and proceeded to question Houston about how he hoped to benefit from testifying against Christian. In response to defense counsel\u2019s questions, Houston responded that he had to earn any benefit he would receive from the government, and that one of the ways to do so was to testify that Christian was the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">Under the circumstances, we cannot say that a reasonable jury would have received a significantly different impression of Houston\u2019s credibility , had the court allowed the proposed line of questioning to continue. <em>See Garcia, </em>13 F.3d at 1469. While the importance of cross-examining Houston was heightened because he was involved in the robbery at issue and was potentially threatened with some unspecified other criminal charge, Houston\u2019s motives for testifying and potential biases were sufficiently explored during cross-examination. Houston testified that he was a bank robber, that he had repeatedly lied to police, that he had pled guilty to this robbery, that he faced' up to life imprisonment, that he had testified with the hope of receiving a more l\u00e9nient sentence, and that one of the ways for him to earn a lesser sentence was to say that Christian was involved in the robbery. Other than the \u201csomething else,\u201d Christian\u2019s cross-examination of Houston was not limited by the court. Taken together, the jury was presented with substantial evidence to draw a. fair inference about Houston\u2019s credibility and his motives for testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">Christian suggests that the \u201csomething else\u201d was so significant that, when confronted with it, Houston changed his tune and admitted to his involvement with the bank robbery. We disagree with that characterization of Houston\u2019s testimony. Although Houston was at the police station to talk about \u201csomething else,\u201d his testimony Reflects that he changed his story after the discussion had already turned to the bank robbery. He testified that he initially lied and said that he was unaware that Christian planned to commit a bank robbery and that he was innocently driving him to see a girl, but when pressed about his explanation, he told the police the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">Overall, the jury would not have received a significantly different impression of Houston\u2019s credibility had the court allowed the proposed line of questioning to continue. Therefore, the Confrontation Clause was satisfied, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in limiting cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">.
