Anderson raises several issues on appeal, which we address in turn. After review, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-15\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b438-16\">\n<em>A. Motion to amend complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b438-17\">Anderson first appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his untimely motion to amend his complaint to add a retaliatory hostile work environment claim. In <em>Gow</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number><em>ski v. Peake, </em>this Court recognized for the first time a cause of action for retaliatory hostile work environment. 682 F.3d 1299, 1311-12 (11th Cir.2012). We noted that every other circuit had previously recognized such a claim, and that it was consistent with Title VII\u2019s text and remedial goal, congressional intent, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s own interpretation of Title VII. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">A party seeking to amend his complaint, after having previously amended it as of right, may do so only with the opposing party\u2019s written consent or leave of court. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2). Rule 15 instructs that such leave should be freely given when justice so requires. <em>Id. </em>Where the motion for leave to amend is filed after the scheduling order\u2019s deadline for such motions, however, the party must show good cause why leave to amend should be granted. Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b)(4); <em>Smith v. Sch. Bd. of Orange Cnty., </em>487 F.3d 1361, 1366 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Anderson\u2019s untimely motion for leave to amend the complaint to add a retaliatory hostile work environment claim. <em>See Smith, </em>487 F.3d at 1366 (reviewing the denial of a motion for leave to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion). Anderson filed his motion approximately eight months after the scheduling order\u2019s deadline for motions to amend the pleadings, and did not provide any justification for his untimely request. As the district court noted, <em>Gowski </em>was decided nearly six months before Anderson filed his motion for leave to amend, during which time Anderson had ample opportunity to discover and raise that issue. <em>See Oravec v. Sunny Isles Luxury Ventures, L.C., 527 </em>F.3d 1218, 1232 (11th Cir.2008) (stating in order to satisfy Rule 16\u2019s good cause standard, the party must show diligence in pursuing his claims). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Anderson\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">\n<em>B. Judicial Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">Anderson appeals the denial of his post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law and new trial for several reasons. First, Anderson contends the district court improperly applied the doctrine of judicial estoppel to bar him from asserting that Josh Cox, his alleged harasser, was not his supervisor, and that the <em>Faragher-Ellerth</em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> affirmative defense was therefore inapplicable. Anderson asserts his change in position regarding Cox\u2019s supervisory status resulted from an intervening change in controlling law, namely, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Vance v. Ball State University, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2434, 2439, 186 L.Ed.2d 565 (2013), which held that, for purposes of the <em>Faragher-ElleHh </em>defense, a supervisor is someone with the authority to take tangible employment actions against the plaintiff. Additionally, Anderson asserts the necessary elements of judicial estoppel were not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-15\">The purpose of judicial estoppel is to protect the integrity of the judicial process by preventing parties from taking inconsistent positions according to the exigencies of the moment. <em>Robinson v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>595 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2010) (citing <em>New Hampshire v. Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 749, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001)). In <em>New Hampshire v. Maine, </em>the Supreme Court identified three factors that generally inform when judicial estop-pel may be invoked: (1) whether the present position is clearly inconsistent with the prior position; (2) whether the party per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>suaded the court to accept the earlier position, such that acceptance of the inconsistent position would create a perception that the court was misled; and (3) whether the party advancing the inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party. 532 U.S. at 750-51, 121 S.Ct. 1808.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">We employ a two-factor inquiry, requiring a showing that (1) the allegedly inconsistent positions were made under oath in a prior proceeding, and (2) the inconsistencies were calculated to make a mockery of the judicial system. <em>Robinson, </em>595 F.3d at 1273. We have held that our two-factor approach is consistent with the principles announced in <em>New Hampshire v. Maine. Burnes v. Pemco Aeroplex, </em>291 F.3d 1282, 1285-86 (11th Cir.2002). To show that a party intended to make a mockery of the judicial system, we require that the contradicting positions be intentional, not merely inadvertent. <em>Robinson, </em>595 F.3d at 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">As an initial matter, we have not addressed the question of whether judicial estoppel is appropriate when the party alleges that its.change in position is based on an intervening change in controlling law. However, we need not decide that issue here because <em>Vance </em>does not constitute an intervening change in controlling law for purposes of this case. <em>Vance </em>was decided on June 24, 2013, nine months prior to the commencement of trial in this case on March 24, 2014. Thus, both (1) Anderson\u2019s representations that Cox was his supervisor in his trial testimony and proposed jury instructions and (2) his current position that Cox was not his supervisor, post-dated the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Vance. </em>Accordingly, Anderson\u2019s change in position did not result from an intervening change in the law, and his argument that judicial estoppel was inappropriate on that basis lacks merit. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Moreover, Anderson does not prevail on his alternative argument that the necessary elements of judicial estoppel were not met. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s three-factor approach, judicial es-toppel was appropriate because Anderson\u2019s position at trial was clearly inconsistent with his position in his post-trial motions, Anderson convinced the court to accept his earlier position, and Anderson would derive an unfair benefit from being allowed to contest the jury\u2019s verdict on a ground that was available to him at trial, but that he merely failed to raise. Likewise, under our two-factor inquiry, judicial estoppel was appropriate because Anderson\u2019s prior inconsistent position was made under oath, and it can be inferred from the record that Anderson\u2019s assertion of contradictory positions was intentional, rather than inadvertent. Anderson failed to raise the <em>Vance </em>issue until after the jury returned a verdict in Brown\u2019s favor, despite the fact that <em>Vance </em>was issued long before trial commenced and Anderson had raised other challenges to the applicability of the <em>Far-agher-Ellerth </em>defense. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in applying judicial estoppel, and we affirm the denial of Anderson\u2019s post-trial motions on this ground. <em>See Burnes, </em>291 F.3d at 1287 (reviewing the applicability of judicial estoppel, an equitable doctrine invoked at the court\u2019s discretion, for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\n<em>C. Jury instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Anderson asserts that district court erred in concluding he waived any objection to the <em>Faragher-Ellerth </em>jury instruction because he objected to the instruction, albeit on different grounds, in his pre-deliberation motion for directed verdict. Anderson asserts this earlier objection was sufficient to preserve his post-verdict challenge to Cox\u2019s supervisory status, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Brown was not entitled to the <em>Faragher-Ellerth </em>instruction as a matter of law because Cox was not a supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">When a party fails to object to a jury instruction prior to jury deliberations, that party waives its right to challenge the instruction on appeal, unless the party made its position clear to the court previously and further objection would be futile, or it is necessary to correct a fundamental error. <em>Parker v. Scrap Metal Processors, Inc., </em>386 F.3d 993, 1018 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The district court correctly concluded that Anderson waived any challenge to the jury instruction regarding Cox\u2019s supervisor status because Anderson repeatedly testified that Cox was his supervisor, included a jury instruction to that effect in his proposed jury instructions, and did not object to the district court\u2019s instruction that he alleged that Cox was his supervisor. Accordingly, because Anderson waived any objection to the instruction regarding Cox\u2019s supervisor status, and, as discussed above, is estopped from arguing that Cox was not his supervisor, he cannot challenge the <em>Faragher-Ellerth </em>instruction on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">\n<em>D. Supervisor Status</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Finally, Anderson contends that the district court erred in denying his post-trial motions because there was insufficient evidence to support a jury finding that Cox was his supervisor. Anderson asserts that no evidence at trial showed that Cox was empowered to take tangible employment actions against him, and that the court could not rely on his testimony to support its determination that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Cox was his supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">As discussed above, the district court correctly concluded that Anderson was judicially estopped from asserting that Cox was not his supervisor and waived any challenge to the jury instruction regarding Cox\u2019s supervisory status. Further, Anderson invited the jury to conclude that Cox was his supervisor through his testimony and proposed jury instructions, and should not now be allowed to complain that the jury may have accepted his invitation in rendering its verdict. <em>See Pensacola Motor Sales, Inc. v. Eastern Shore Toyota, LLC, </em>684 F.3d 1211, 1231 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201cA party that invites an error cannot complain when its invitation is accepted.\u201d). To permit such a challenge would essentially allow Anderson to unfairly benefit from providing insufficient support for his own position at trial and punish Brown for failing to provide evidence in support of a position it never asserted. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Anderson\u2019s post-trial motions. <em>Myers v. TooJay\u2019s Mgmt. Corp., </em>640 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir.2011) (reviewing for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion for new trial, and reviewing <em>de novo </em>the denial of a Rule 50(b) renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Anderson\u2019s untimely motion to amend because he failed to show good cause. Additionally, the district court did not err in denying Anderson\u2019s post-trial motions because Anderson was estopped from challenging Cox\u2019s supervisory status. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-7\">.
