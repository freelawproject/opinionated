He appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissing his habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the judgment-of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">In 2006, after a federal jury trial in the District of Hawaii (case number 05-cr-00261), Troiano was convicted of one count each of (1) conspiring to obstruct commerce by robbery (Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951. and \u00a7 2); (2) obstructing commerce by robbery (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951 and 2); (3) using a firearm while obstructing commerce by robbery (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)); and (4) being a felon in possession of a firearm (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e)). The sentencing court imposed an aggregate sentence of twenty-four years. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, and on April 14, 2008, the United States Supreme Court denied Troiano\u2019s petition for a writ of cer-tiorari. On April 14, 2009, through counsel, Troiano filed a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, raising two claims of ineffective assistance of prior counsel. In August 2009, the sentencing court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion on the merits. No notice of appeal was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">Several years later, in August 2014, Troiano filed his \u00a7 2241 habeas petition in the District Court. He raised ten issues, nine of which related to the trial proceedings. In his tenth claim, Troiano invoked the then-new Supreme Court decision in <em>Rosemond v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1240, 188 L.Ed.2d 248 (2014). Acknowledging his \u00a7 2255 history, Troiano cited our decision in <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245 (3d Cir.1997), asserting that he is entitled to \u00a7 2241 habeas relief because \u00a7 2255 is inadequate and ineffective to raise his statutory claim under <em>Rosemond; </em>he conceded that he cannot meet the criteria for filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. The District Court dismissed Troiano\u2019s habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction, explaining that Troiano\u2019s personal inability to meet \u00a7 2255\u2019s gatekeeping requirements for filing a second or successive motion did not allow him to evade those requirements by pursuing relief under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-18\">Troiano appeals. Upon notification that this appeal would be submitted for possible dismissal or summary action, Troiano submitted a response containing argument in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>support of his appeal. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2258(a). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to any factual findings. <em>Cradle v. United States, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">As discussed by the District Court, a \u00a7 2255 motion filed in the sentencing court is the presumptive means for a federal prisoner to challenge the validity of a conviction or sentence. <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974); <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 249. A petitioner can seek habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 only if the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 249-51. As explained by the District Court, a \u00a7 2255 motion is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d merely because the petitioner cannot meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements of \u00a7 2255, <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002), or because the sentencing court does not grant relief, <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 539. Rather, the \u201csafety valve\u201d provided under \u00a7 2255 is extremely narrow and has been held to apply in unusual situations, such as those in which a prisoner has had no prior opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime later deemed to be noncriminal by an intervening change in law. <em>See Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120 <em>(citing In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Troiano contends that the District Court erred in failing to address his arguments in support of \u00a7 2241 habeas jurisdiction. We will consider his assertions in turn. First, Troiano contends that his claim under <em>Rosemond </em>meets the safety valve criteria for proceeding under \u00a7 2241. Noting that his conspiracy and Hobbs Act robbery convictions were as an aider and abettor under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, Troiano asserts that, under <em>Rosemond, </em>the jury should have been instructed that proof of Troiano\u2019s advance knowledge of the conspiracy and Hobbs Act robbery was required to find him guilty. He claims that he is entitled to habeas relief as to all counts of the indictment because the trial court\u2019s jury instructions did not include the element of advance knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The offense at issue in <em>Rosemond </em>was the aiding and abetting, 18 U.S.C \u00a7 2, of a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), which prohibits using or carrying a firearm when engaged in a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. The Supreme Court clarified the requirements for showing that a defendant aided and abetted a \u00a7 924(c) offense, holding that the government must prove that \u201cthe defendant actively participated in the underlying drug trafficking or violent crime <em>with advance knowledge </em>that a confederate would use or carry a gun during the crime\u2019s commission.\u201d 134 S.Ct. at 1243 (emphasis added). In the context of the drug crime facts in <em>Rosemond, </em>the Court explained that to aid and abet a \u00a7 924(c) violation, a defendant must have advance knowledge that the criminal plan was- \u201cnot just for a drug sale, but for an armed one\u201d; in continuing with the crime instead of walking away, the defendant shows intent to aid in an <em>armed </em>offense. <em>Id. </em>at 1249. The Supreme Court thus concluded that the jury instructions in that case were erroneous because they did not require the jury to find that the defendant had advance knowledge that a cohort in the plan would be armed. <em>See id. </em>at 1251-52. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Troiano\u2019s situation is distinguishable from <em>Rosemond, Rosemond </em>addresses the requirements and jury instructions concerning aiding and abetting a \u00a7 924(c) offense, but Troiano\u2019s claim relates to the jury instructions concerning aiding and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>abetting a Hobbs Act robbery. Unlike in <em>Rosemond, </em>the issue of advance knowledge that a confederate would use or carry a firearm in relation to the underlying crime appears to be irrelevant in Troiano\u2019s case, not least because Troiano was convicted of violating \u00a7 924(c), not aiding and abetting a \u00a7 924(c) violation. He has not demonstrated that he was convicted of conduct that is no longer criminal under <em>Rosemond </em>and correspondingly has not demonstrated that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Troiano also contends that the District Court erred in failing to consider his other arguments that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. He points to the declarations given by his mother and himself and states that various circumstances \u2014 including the ineffective assistance of counsel in his \u00a7 2255 motion filed in 2009, the misconduct and abandonment by prior retained counsel to pursue \u00a7 2255 relief, and his solitary confinement conditions while under psychiatric care \u2014 rendered ineffective his pursuit of \u00a7 2255 relief. As explained by the District Court, in order to pursue his claims via \u00a7 2241, Troiano must show that the inadequacy of \u00a7 2255 relief involves a limitation of scope or procedure preventing a full adjudication of the wrongful detention claims. <em>See, e.g., Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538. \u201cIt is the inefficacy of the [\u00a7 2255] remedy, not the personal inability to use it, that is determinative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although unfortunate if true, Troiano\u2019s personal difficulties \u00e1nd dissatisfaction with counsels\u2019 handling of his \u00a7 2255 proceedings do not render the remedy inadequate or ineffective for purposes of pursuing \u00a7 2241 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">For the above reasons, the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Troiano\u2019s \u00a7 2241 habe-as petition for lack of jurisdiction was appropriate. We have considered Troiano\u2019s arguments and the record and find that no substantial question is presented. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b72-12\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
