Caruthers, federal prisoner # 16601-075, appeals the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, which challenged the 180-month sentence imposed upon his conviction of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924. Pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Nevertheless, when an appellant fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed that issue, <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Because Caruthers has failed to brief any challenge to the reasons the district court dismissed his \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction, he has abandoned the critical issue of this appeal. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Ml motions pending before this court are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b797-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
