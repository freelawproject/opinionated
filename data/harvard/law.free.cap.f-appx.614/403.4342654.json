Shortly after his arrest, Bennett agreed to an interview with certain agents of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies. During that interview, Bennett and the agents discussed the possibility that a third party would \u201ccooperate\u201d with law enforcement on Bennett\u2019s behalf in order to increase the likelihood that Bennett would receive a shorter sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). What the agents did not know was that Bennett was planning to pay the third party to cooperate and to market a cooperation-for-hire scheme to inmates seeking sentence reductions. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). Bennett later wrote the would-be cooperator a nine-page letter detailing the scheme, promising him \u201cat least 20,000 dollars in cash or cars\u201d as long as he kept the business \u201con da low.\u201d He then pleaded guilty as charged. As Ben-n\u00e9tt awaited sentencing, the government got ahold of his letter and learned of his secret business plan. The bottom line for Bennett wasn\u2019t pretty: instead of receiving a shorter sentence, he received a two-point enhancement for obstruction of justice, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, and lost the three-point reduction he otherwise would have received for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. He is now serving a 156-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-15\">Bennett contends that the district court erroneously applied the enhancement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>obstruction of justice. To decide that issue, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of \u00a7 3C1.1 to those facts <em>de novo. See United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In relevant part, \u00a7 3C1.1 provides for a two-level increase to the defendant\u2019s base offense level if \u201c(1) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing\u201d of his offense of conviction, and \u201c(2) the obstructive conduct related to ... the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. We have interpreted the term \u201cwillfully\u201d to mean that \u201cthe defendant must consciously act with the purpose of obstructing justice.\u201d <em>Massey, </em>443 F.3d at 819. We have also said that \u201cthe relevant question is whether the obstructive conduct occurred during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the offense of conviction or a closely related offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Doe, </em>661 F.3d 550, 566 (11th Cir.2011) (alteration and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The district court properly applied the obstruction of justice enhancement. Bennett understood that he would likely secure a shorter sentence via a government-sponsored motion under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5K1.1 if a third party cooperated with the government on his behalf. He also understood that paying the third party to cooperate (and running an illegitimate cooperation-for-hire business) was not what the government had in mind. Otherwise, he would not have instructed his would-be business partner to keep their dealings \u201con da low.\u201d In short, Bennett willfully attempted to conceal information from the United States Probation Office that would tend to influence his sentencing. That conduct falls within \u00a7 3C1.1. <em>Cf </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n. 4(H) (noting that obstructive conduct under \u00a7 3C1.1 includes \u201cproviding materially false information to a probation officer [with] respect to a presentence or other investigation for the court\u201d); <em>id. </em>cmt. n. 6 (defining \u201cmaterial\u201d information as \u201cinformation that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination\u201d); <em>Doe, </em>661 F.3d at 565-67 (noting that Application Note 6\u2019s \u201cthreshold for materiality is conspicuously low\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Bennett\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unconvincing. First, he argues that \u00a7 3C1.1 does not cover his allegedly obstructive conduct because that conduct is not specifically listed among Application Note 4\u2019s numerous examples. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n. 4. But Application Note 4 specifically states that its list of examples of covered conduct is \u201cnon-exhaustive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And Application Note 3 provides that obstructive conduct is a broad concept that \u201ccan vary widely in nature, degree of planning, and seriousness\u201d and \u201cis not subject to precise definition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 3.. Second, Bennett argues that he did not have the state of mind required under \u00a7 3C1.1 because, \u201c[although [his] intent was driven by his hope to obtain a sentence reduction, that intent does not amount to a criminal intent.\u201d That argument misses the mark. As the district court explained to Bennett at his sentence hearing, although there is nothing wrong with \u201cwanting] to cooperate and [to] get the benefit of [that cooperation],\u201d the \u201cparticular method or means of doing so\u201d that Bennett chose was corrupt, and Bennett knew it. He willfully attempted to obstruct the administration of justice with respect to his sentencing, and that conduct fell within \u00a7 3Cl.l\u2019s broad scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Finally, we note that the written judgment contains scrivener\u2019s errors because it: (1) states that Bennett was convicted of one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine in excess of 500 grams and marijuana in excess of 100 <em>pounds, </em>instead of 100 <em>kilograms; </em>and (2) omits any reference to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii). <em>Compare </em>Doc. 279 (superseding information), <em>and </em>Doc. 280 at 3 (plea agreement), <em>with </em>Doc. 369 at 1 (judgment). We remand for the limited purpose of correcting those scrivener\u2019s errors. <em>See, e.g., Massey, </em>443 F.3d at 822 (noting that this Court \u201cmay <em>sua sponte </em>raise the issue of clerical errors in the judgment and remand with instructions that the district court correct the errors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
