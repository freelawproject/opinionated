Court for the District of New Jersey dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AGu\">In 1998, Tawalebah was convicted by a jury in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia of conspiracy to commit arson, arson, and use of a destructive device during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 844(i), and 924(c). The convictions stem from Tawalebah\u2019s involvement in the burning of a competitor\u2019s market by use of a Molotov cocktail. He was sentenced to 430 months in prison. His convictions and sentence were affirmed on appeal. <em>United States v. Abed, </em>No. 98-4637, 2000 U.S.App. LEXIS 261, at *50, 2000 WL 14190, at *16 (4th Cir. Jan. 10, 2000). Since then, Tawalebah has filed many unsuccessful collateral challenges in the sentencing court and the Fourth Circuit, including motions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 and 2255, and a petition for a writ of error coram nobis. In 2009, he filed a habeas petition pursuant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the New Jersey District Court claiming that he had newly discovered evidence of innocence. The court dismissed the petition for. lack of jurisdiction, concluding that the claim could be raised only, if at all, in a \u00a7 2255 motion. We affirmed. <em>Tawalbeh v. Grondolsky, </em>362 Fed.Appx. 232, 235 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-16\">In 2014, Tawalebah filed another \u00a7 2241 petition, this time claiming that he is innocent of his \u00a7 924(c) conviction pursuant to the holding of <em>Rosemond v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1240, 188 L.Ed.2d 248 (2014). The District Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, chiefly concluding that conspiracy and burning a competitor\u2019s business with a Molotov cocktail still remained criminal acts and that Tawalebah was thus not able to proceed in a \u00a7 2241 petition. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-19\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam). If no substantial question is presented, we may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6; <em>Tourseher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-20\">We agree with the District Court that Tawalebah\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition was not viable, but on a somewhat different rationale. In general, \u201c[mjotions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences that are al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>legedly in violation of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). However, a petitioner may challenge a conviction via a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition if a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). A \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate \u201cwhen a petitioner asserts a claim of \u2018actual innocence\u2019 on the theory that \u2018he is being detained for conduct that has subsequently been rendered non-criminal by an intervening Supreme Court decision\u2019 ... but is otherwise barred from challenging the legality of the conviction under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>United States v. Tyler, </em>732 F.3d 241, 246 (3d Cir.2013) (quoting <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 252 (3d Cir.1997)). Although the District Court recognized that Tawalebah was attempting to proceed on this theory, it did not address his reliance on <em>Rosemond.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">In <em>Rosemond, </em>the Supreme Court clarified the standard for showing that a defendant aided and abetted a \u00a7 924(c) offense, holding that the government must prove that \u201cthe defendant actively participated in the underlying ... violent crime with <em>advance knowledge </em>that a confederate would use or carry a gun during the crime\u2019s commission.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 134 S.Ct. at 1243 (emphasis added). The Court explained that advance knowledge of the use of a firearm was necessary so that a defendant would have the opportunity to choose whether to continue with the crime or withdraw. <em>Id. </em>at 1249. Tawalebah, who was not involved in the actual commission of the arson, argues that he had no advance knowledge \u25a0that his co-conspirators would use a Molotov cocktail to burn the market, thus making him innocent of aiding and abetting the \u00a7 924(c) offense under <em>Rosemond.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">We have not yet addressed whether a claim based on <em>Rosemond </em>may be brought via a \u00a7 2241 petition pursuant to the exception we recognized in <em>Dorsainvil, </em>and we need not do so here because the record does .not support Tawalebah\u2019s claim of innocence. <em>See Tyler, </em>732 F.3d at 247 (noting that when a petitioner claims he is incarcerated based on conduct that subsequently has been rendered non-criminal, we must consider whether the record supports the claim). On direct appeal, Ta-walebah challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his \u00a7 924(c) conviction, arguing that he could not be convicted as an aider or abettor because he did not directly facilitate or encourage the use of a Molotov cocktail. <em>See Abed, </em>2000 U.SApp. LEXIS 261, at *36-*37, 2000 WL 14190, at *12. The Fourth Circuit rejected this argument, holding that the following evidence was sufficient to support the conviction under an aiding and abetting theory: (1) testimony from a witness that Tawalebah asked him several times to burn down the market with a Molotov cocktail; and (2) testimony from a co-conspirator, Chisom, that he and other conspirators met with Tawalebah a week before the arson, that the others conversed in Arabic, and that a conspirator translated the conversation for Chisom, telling him that Tawalebah would pay for the market to be burned and that it was to be burned with a Molotov cocktail. <em>Id. </em>at *38-*40, 2000 WL 14190, at *12. This evidence is also sufficient to show \u2014 contrary to Ta-walebah\u2019s current assertion \u2014 that he had advance knowledge that a Molotov cocktail would be used in the arson. Therefore, Tawalebah has not demonstrated that he was convicted of conduct that is no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>criminal under <em>Rosemond </em>and correspondingly has not demonstrated that a \u00a7 2255 motion would be inadequate to test the legality of his detention.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">For this reason, dismissal of the \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction was appropriate and we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b69-13\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-5\">. Section 924(c) uses the term ''firearm,\u201d which can encompass a \"destructive device.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(B)(ii). The Molotov cocktail used in the arson was held to be a \"destructive device\u201d within the meaning of the statute. <em>See Abed, </em>2000 U.S.App. LEXIS 261, at *49-*50, 2000 WL 14190, at *16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b71-16\">. The Fourth Circuit also held on appeal that the evidence was sufficient to support Tawale-bah's \u00a7 924(c) conviction under a theory of vicarious liability pursuant to <em>Pinkerton v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 640, 647-48, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946), which permits the conviction of a defendant for acts by a co-conspirator that were \"done in furtherance of the conspiracy\u201d and that could have been \"reasonably foreseen as a necessary or natural consequence\u201d of the conspiracy. <em>See Abed, </em>2000 U.S.App. LEXIS 261, at *38-*40, 2000 WL 14190, at *12. This alternate basis for Tawalebah's \u00a7 924(c) conviction would usually make it unnecessary to address the <em>Rosemond </em>challenge. We have addressed the argument because the District Court failed to do so and Tawalebah raised the issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
