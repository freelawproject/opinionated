We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Robinson is the founder of Benji\u2019s Special Education Academy, Inc. (\u201cBenji\u2019s Academy\u201d). In 1998, Benji\u2019s Academy received a Texas Education Agency (\u201cTEA\u201d) charter to operate as an \u201copen enrollment\u201d charter school. Some time later, the TEA determined that Benji\u2019s Academy was not meeting certain obligations. The TEA did not renew the school\u2019s charter in 2008 but allowed the school to continue operating pending approval of its renewal application. Over the next few years, the TEA asked Benji\u2019s Academy to address several issues. After learning about certain violations in the summer of 2010, the TEA appointed an interim Board of Managers to operate the school. The new Board of. Managers discovered that the school was in urgent financial condition and voted to declare financial exigency and suspend all school programs after September 14, 2010. However, Robinson and others at Benji\u2019s Academy continued to operate the school after the suspension. As a result, TEA Commissioner Robert Scott suspended the school\u2019s authority to operate as a charter school on September 16, 2010, and issued a notice of intent to revoke its charter on September 24. An administrative hearing was held in August 2011, and a final order revoked the school\u2019s charter in January 2012, permanently closing the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">A number of teachers and parents filed lawsuits in federal court. In the first lawsuit, two teachers claimed that the closure of Benji\u2019s Academy deprived them of their property rights in continued employment at the school without due process. <em>See Comb v. Rowell, </em>538 Fed.Appx. 371, 372 (5th Cir.) (unpublished), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 684, 187 L.Ed.2d 550 (2013).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants after concluding that the teachers had no property interest in continued employment because they were at-will employees of the school. <em>See Comb v. Benji\u2019s Special Educ. Acad., </em>No. 10-CV-3498, 2012 WL 1067395, at *6 (S.D.Tex. Mar. 28, 2012). We affirmed. <em>Rowell, </em>538 Fed.Appx. at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">In this lawsuit, Robinson and other employees of Benji\u2019s Academy sued Defendants under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, again arguing that Defendants violated their constitutional rights to due process by depriving them of their property rights in continued employment. Defendants moved for summary judgment, and the district court granted the motion after determining that the plaintiffs were at-will employees with no expectation of continued employment. Robinson appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Mesa v. Prejean, </em>543 F.3d 264, 269 (5th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>may affirm the district court\u2019s grant -of summary judgment on any ground supported by the record and presented to the district court. <em>Hernandez v. Velasquez, </em>522 F.3d 556, 560 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">On appeal, Robinson raises a number of claims and arguments that were not before the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The only cause of action properly asserted before the district court is Robinson\u2019s claim that the closure of Benji\u2019s Academy deprived her of due process related to the loss of her job. Thus, Robinson has waived the other claims and arguments by failing to raise them in the district court proceeding. <em>See New Orleans Depot Servs., Inc. v. Dir., Office of Worker\u2019s Comp. Programs, </em>718 F.3d 384, 387 (5th Cir.2013) (en banc) (\u201cGenerally, we do not consider issues on appeal that were not presented and argued before the lower court.\u201d); <em>see also Singleton v. Wulff </em>428 U.S. 106, 120, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976) (\u201cIt is the general rule, of course, that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Turning to Robinson\u2019s due process argument, Robinson must raise a genuine dispute of fact as to whether she has a property interest in continued employment to survive summary judgment. <em>See DePree v. Saunders, </em>588 F.3d 282, 289 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cThe threshold requirement of any due process claim is the government\u2019s deprivation of a plaintiffs ... property interest.\u201d). \u201cIn Texas, there exists a presumption that employment is at-will unless that relationship has been expressly altered .... \u201d <em>Muncy v. City of Dallas, </em>335 F.3d 394, 398 (5th Cir.2003). An at-will employee does not have a protected property interest because employment may be terminated at any time. <em>Conner v. Lavaca Hosp. Dist., </em>267 F.3d 426, 439 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Robinson did not contest the district court\u2019s determination that she was an at-will employee in her opening brief on appeal, but she argues in her reply brief that she had a five-year contract with Benji\u2019s Academy and thus had an expectation of continued employment. We generally do not consider matters raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Elashyi, </em>554 F.3d 480, 494 n. 6 (5th Cir.2008) (\u201cAn appellant that fails to adequately brief an issue in his opening brief waives that issue.\u201d). In any event, Robinson previously admitted in response to Defendants\u2019 Requests for Admissions that her employment with Benji\u2019s Academy was at will.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cA matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court, on motion, permits the admission to be withdrawn or amended.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 36(b); <em>In re Carney, </em>258 F.3d 415, 420 (5th Cir.2001); <em>cf. Amour v. Knowles, </em>512 F.3d 147, 154 n. 14 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201c[The] affidavit contrary to the binding admissions may not be permitted to rebut the admissions at trial.\u201d). As Robinson cannot succeed on her due process claim if she is an at-will employee, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
