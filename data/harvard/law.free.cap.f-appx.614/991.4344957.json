(PAC-CAR). On December 23, 2011, Weaver, then a diesel mechanic at Wall Timber Products, Inc. in Georgia, was permanently injured when a model-year 2004 Ken-worth T800 semi-truck that he was inspecting rolled over his leg. The semi-truck was manufactured by PACCAR. We\u00e1ver filed suit against PACCAR in district court, alleging that PACCAR\u2019s failure to install a \u201cneutral safety switch\u201d on the semi-truck was the proximate cause of the accident and PACCAR was thus strictly liable under Georgia\u2019s products liability statute for his injuries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On PACCAR\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court found that PACCAR\u2019s design of the semi-truck did not proximately cause Weaver\u2019s injuries and granted PACCAR\u2019s motion on that ground. Weaver appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">Proximate cause is a necessary element of a products liability action. <em>See Talley v. City Tank Corp., 158 </em>Ga.App. 130, 279 S.E.2d 264, 269 (1981); <em>CaMicol v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., a Subsidiary of Textron, Inc., </em>117 F.3d 490, 494 (11th Cir.1997) (citing O.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-1-11(b)(l)) (\u201cTo prevail in a Georgia products liability action ... a plaintiff must show that the proximate cause of the injury was a defect which existed when the product was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>sold\u201d). \u201cUnder Georgia law \u2018proximate cause\u2019 is not the last act or cause, or the nearest act to the injury. It is the negligent act that actively aids in producing the injury as a direct and existing cause.\u201d <em>Cain v. Vontz, </em>703 F.2d 1279, 1282 (11th Cir.1983). The initial actor is not always the \u201cdirect and existing cause.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Where, for example, \u201can independent, intervening, act of someone other than the defendant, which was not foreseeable by defendant, was not triggered by defendant\u2019s acts, and which was sufficient of itself to cause the injury,\u201d is interposed between the original negligent act and the plaintiffs injury, there can be no proximate cause. <em>Walker v. Giles, </em>276 Ga.App. 632, 624 S.E.2d 191, 200 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). An act is \u201cforeseeable\u201d when it is reasonably expected to occur, \u201cnot merely what might occur.\u201d <em>Jonas v. Isuzu Motors, Ltd., </em>210 F.Supp.2d 1373, 1377 (M.D.Ga.2002). Thus, when a manufacturer \u201creasonably could have anticipated or foreseen the intervening act and its consequences, ... the intervening act of negligence will not relieve [the manufacturer] from liability for the consequences resulting [therefrom].\u201d <em>Lindsey v. Navistar Int\u2019l Transp. Corp., </em>150 F.3d 1307, 1317 (11th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Here, the proximate causal connection between PACCAR\u2019s design of the T800 sans neutral safety switch and Weaver\u2019s injuries is missing. The facts relevant to Weaver\u2019s injuries are not in dispute: PACCAR manufactures the T800 and offers the neutral safety switch as an optional feature; the semi-truck at issue here did not have a neutral safety switch; a truck driver, Chris Manning, brought the semi-truck to Wall Timber for service and, while Weaver was working underneath the semi-truck, Manning absent-mindedly cranked the semi-truck, causing it to lurch forward and crush Weaver\u2019s leg. Manning\u2019s conduct was an intervening act between PAC-CAR\u2019s allegedly negligent decision to manufacture a truck on which a neutral safety switch did not come standard and Weaver\u2019s injuries. Manning cranked the truck, either at the direction of mechanics at Wall Timber or on his own volition, knowing it was in gear and would thus lurch forward, and the parties do not dispute that he acted negligently in doing so. Manning\u2019s conduct was sufficiently independent of PACCAR\u2019s original allegedly negligent act and was sufficient itself to cause Weaver\u2019s injuries. <em>See Walker, </em>624 S.E.2d at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">We further agree that Manning\u2019s actions and the resulting consequences were not foreseeable to PACCAR. <em>See id. </em>PACCAR reasonably expected that the operator of a T800 semi-truck would be trained in operating large trucks with manual transmissions, would possess a valid Commercial Driver\u2019s License to operate the semi-truck, and would operate the semi-truck in accordance with the rules and procedures attendant to 'that license. Indeed, Manning was an experienced, trained semi-truck driver, and he appreciated the risk of cranking the T800 semi-truck while it was in gear with the parking break disengaged; still, despite his knowledge and training, he cranked the truck when he \u201cwasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d As noted by the district court, \u201cDefendant-manufacturers may be expected to foresee negligence born of ignorance, but they are not expected to foresee negligence from distraction, inattentiveness, or. absent-mindedness.\u201d Here, Manning\u2019s negligence was born of absent-mindedness, not ignorance. PAC-CAR could not have reasonably foreseen or anticipated that an experienced, trained driver like Manning would abjectly fail to follow protocol in starting one of its semi-trucks. <em>See Lindsey, </em>150 F.3d at 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>Even if an alleged design defect in the T800 semi-truck left it prone to lurching, unforeseeable operator error and negligence was the proximate cause of the accident and Weaver\u2019s resulting injuries. <em>See, e.g., Jonas, </em>210 F.Supp.2d at 1378-80. Because Weaver cannot show that PAC-CAR\u2019S design was the proximate cause of his injuries, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to PACCAR.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 1377 (\u201cNo matter how negligent a party may be, if their act stands in no causal relation to the injury it is not actionable.\u201d); <em>see also Talley, </em>279 S.E.2d at 269; <em>Carmical, </em>117 F.3d at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">. A \"neutral safety switch\u201d prevents a truck from starting when the transmission is not in neutral. The function of the switch is to prevent unintended movement of the vehicle when starting the engine. The neutral safety switch does not come standard on PACCAR's vehicles, but it is \"offered ... as an option.\u201d PACCAR\u2019s witnesses testified below that a majority of purchasers of PACCAR\u2019s vehicles do not exercise that option.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1014-13\">. We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standards as those applied by the district court below. <em>See Thrasher v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cos. Co., </em>734 F.2d 637, 638-39 (11th Cir.1984) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1016-15\">. Because we agree with the district court that PACCAR's design of the semi-truck sans \"neutral safety switch\u201d was not the proximate cause of Weaver\u2019s injuries, we need not address whether the semi-truck was, in fact, defective.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
