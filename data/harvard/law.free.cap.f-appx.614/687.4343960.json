Coleman alleged that Sellars violated her rights under the Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, and Fourteenth Amendments by conspiring with and advising a Dallas County constable and officers that they could proceed to evict her from her Grand Prairie, Texas residence despite an automatic stay resulting from both her prior Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding and her removal of the forcible detainer action from state court to federal court. The district court granted in part Sellars\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and dismissed Coleman\u2019s federal claims with prejudice as frivolous under 28 U.S.C.. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Coleman\u2019s state law claims were dismissed without prejudice. The district court certified that the appeal had not been taken in good faith and denied Coleman permission to proceed IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">By moving to proceed IFP, Coleman is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that her appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We may dismiss the appeal if it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-15\">Because the district court dismissed the complaint as both frivolous and for failure to state a claim, we will review the matter de novo. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005) (\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae); <em>Beavers v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>566 F.3d 436, 438-39 (5th Cir.2009) (Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)). To state a claim, \u201ca complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Contrary to Coleman\u2019s argument, the district court was not required to allow her to conduct discovery prior to dismissing her complaint. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(e)(2); <em>Southwestern Bell Tel., LP v. City of Houston, </em>529 F.3d 257, 263 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-16\">In her brief, Coleman challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of her \u00a7 1983 claims against Sellars based upon his participation in her November 12, 2012 eviction. None of her arguments suffices to show a nonfrivolous appellate claim. First, Coleman\u2019s allegations do not raise a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>viable Fourth Amendment claim, as her filing of a notice of removal of the state court detainer action\u2014in which a default judgment of possession had been entered eight months earlier and a writ of possession to enforce the judgment had been issued several days earlier\u2014does not render Sellars\u2019s directive to proceed with the eviction an unreasonable seizure. <em>See Soldal v. Cook. Cnty., Ill., </em>506 U.S. 56, 71, 113 S.Ct. 538, 121 L.Ed.2d 450 (1992); <em>Freeman v. City of Dallas, </em>242 F.3d 642, 653-54 (5th Cir.2001). Likewise, she fails to state a claim that Sellars violated her Fifth Amendment right to due process, as that amendment pertains to federal, not state, actors. <em>See Jones v. City of Jackson, </em>203 F.3d 875, 880 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Coleman also maintains that Sel-lars\u2019s participation in the eviction deprived her of her right to a jury trial, as guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment. However, Coleman does not explain how her right to a jury trial could have been violated by Sellars\u2019s actions, where she was served with the forcible detainer suit and made no appearance, resulting in a default judgment taken against her months before her bankruptcy proceedings and notice of removal. Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that the Seventh Amendment\u2019s guarantee of a civil jury does not apply to the States. <em>Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis R.R. Co. v. Bombolis, </em>241 U.S. 211, 217, 36 S.Ct. 595, 60 L.Ed. 961 (1916); <em>see McDonald v. City of Chicago, </em>561 U.S. 742, 765 n. 13, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 177 L.Ed.2d 894 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In addition, Coleman does not show that the district court erred in dismissing her Fourteenth Amendment due process claim. Nothing in the complaint suggests any deficiency in the notices provided to her, which Coleman acknowledges were posted on the door of her residence more than 24 hours prior to the eviction. Further, as noted by the district court, Coleman\u2019s due process claim is an impermissible challenge to the state court judgment that awarded possession of her residence to a bank. <em>See Hale v. Harney, </em>786 F.2d 688, 691 (5th Cir.1986). In her last \u00a7 1983 claim, Coleman contends that Sellars acted with reckless negligence because he did not have the authority or jurisdiction to order her removal from the residence. This claim, too, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted; negligent conduct is not actionable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Marsh v. Jones, </em>53 F.3d 707, 711-12 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Coleman also contends that Sellars conspired to enforce the detainer action and eviction and deprive her of her property. However, she alleged no facts regarding a discriminatory animus or an agreement between Sellars and any other person, as required by \u00a7 1985(3). <em>See Bryant v. Military Dep\u2019t of Miss., </em>597 F.3d 678, 687 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Green v. State Bar of Tex., </em>27 F.3d 1083, 1089 (5th Cir.1994). Thus, the district court did not err in determining that Coleman failed to state a claim for conspiracy under \u00a7 1985(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Finally, Coleman argues that the district court should not have dismissed her claims alleging abuse of process, fraud, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, trespass, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. A district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims if it has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). Coleman has not shown any abuse of discretion. <em>See Batiste v. Island Records Inc., </em>179 F.3d 217, 226 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Coleman\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Coleman\u2019s request, for IFP status is denied, and her appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number><em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Additionally, Coleman has a history of filing numerous duplicative and frivolous filings in the district court and this court challenging her eviction. As a result, Coleman is warned that any further filing of repetitious or frivolous pleadings involving the November 12, 2012 eviction may result in the imposition of sanctions against her. These sanctions may include dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on her ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b710-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
