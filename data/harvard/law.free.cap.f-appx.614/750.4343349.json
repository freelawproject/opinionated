We review forfeited Rule 11 objections for plain error, and the \u201csilent defendant has the burden to satisfy the plain-error rule.\u201d <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 58-59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). Holmes must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). A violation of Rule 11(c)(1) violates a defendant\u2019s substantial rights if the record as a whole reflects a reasonable probability \u201cthat, but for the [district court\u2019s] exhortations, [the defendant] would have exercised his right to go to trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Davila, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2139, 2150, 186 L.Ed.2d 139 (2013). If Holmes shows a clear or obvious error that affects his substantial rights, we have the discretion to correct the error but only, if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">During a pre-trial hearing on Holmes\u2019s motion for appointment of new counsel, the district court questioned defense counsel about whether Holmes had seen the \u201csickening\u201d evidence against him, which included images that were \u201cthe worst that [the court had] ever seen in any child pornography case.\u201d The court indicated that potential jurors would view a sample of the images during voir dire and noted it \u201cwould keep the ones that didn\u2019t get sick.\u201d After reiterating that the jury pool would see the images before the trial began, the court asked whether the Government had offered Holmes a plea deal and the details concerning the offer. The court instructed the prosecutor to put the parties\u2019 tentative agreement on the record and questioned Holmes about his interest in the plea offer. The court agreed to appoint new counsel to give Holmes his requested \u201csecond opinion\u201d about the case but declined to \u201csaddle\u201d anyone else in the Federal Public Defender\u2019s office with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">The district court\u2019s comments suggested that it \u201chad a predisposition to believe that [Holmes] was guilty\u201d and \u201cwere akin to the court advocating ... that the plea was in [his] best interest.\u201d <em>United States v. Hemphill, </em>748 F.3d 666, 674-75 (5th Cir.2014). Taken in context and read in their entirety, the comments amounted to \u201cparticipation in or interference with the plea negotiation process\u201d that was a clear or obvious violation of the \u201cblanket prohibition\u201d of Rule 11(c)(1). <em>See id. </em>at 672-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">Although Holmes claims that he pleaded guilty because of the trial court\u2019s comments, he cites to nothing in the record that supports his claim. The record reflects that he waited three months after the court\u2019s comments to enter his guilty plea, and he testified at his rearraignment that no one had threatened, coerced, or intimidated him to plead guilty. Because he fails to show a reasonable probability that he would have proceeded to trial but for the district court\u2019s comments, we find no plain error. <em>See Davila, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2149-50; <em>Vonn, </em>535 U.S. at 58-59, 122 S.Ct. 1043. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b773-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
