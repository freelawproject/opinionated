Godoy-Castaneda appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court incorrectly concluded that his prior conviction in New York for conspiracy in the second degree and solicitation in the second degree relating to second-degree murder was a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or the \u201cGuidelines\u201d). We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Godoy-Castaneda was charged with being unlawfully present in the United States after deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b). Godoy-Castaneda pleaded guilty to the charge without a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) concluded that Godoy-Castaneda had a total offense level of 22 and a criminal history category of IV, applying a 16-level enhancement for a crime of violence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The enhancement was based upon Godoy-Cas-taneda\u2019s previous conviction in New York state for five counts of second-degree conspiracy and five counts of second-degree solicitation in connection with a second-degree murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With an additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the Guidelines range became 57 to 71 months. Godoy-Castaneda objected to the 16-level crime of violence enhancement only on the following grounds: (1) that solicitation is not listed in the application notes to \u00a7 2L1.2 and (2) that the definition of \u201cconspiracy\u201d under New York law does not fit within the generic, contemporary meaning of \u201cconspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">The district court overruled Godoy-Cas-taneda\u2019s objections and sentenced Godoy to 57 months. Godoy-Castaneda timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-13\">Where a sentencing error is preserved, we review a district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). If the defendant fails to preserve an error, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497 (5th Cir.2012). \u201cPlain error review requires four determinations: whether there was error at all; whether it was plain or obvious; whether the defendant has been substantially harmed by the error; and whether this court should exercise its discretion to correct the error in order to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-14\">On appeal, Godoy-Castaneda argues for the first time that the district court erred in applying the 16-level enhancement because neither conspiracy in the second degree nor solicitation in the second degree under New York law qualifies as a crime of violence. Godoy-Castaneda further argues that the district court plainly erred in finding that the underlying offense, second-degree murder under New York law, qualifies as \u201cmurder\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2. Reviewing for plain error, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-15\">Under the Guidelines, a defendant convicted of illegal reentry is subject to a 16-level sentencing enhancement if he was deported following a prior conviction for a crime of violence.. See \u00a7 2L 1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). The Application Notes define a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in two ways: first, as one of several enumerated offenses, including murder and conspiracy, and, second, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>\u201cany other offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment n. l(B)'(iii). This court applies \u201cslightly different methodologies to determine whether a prior conviction,constitutes a crime of violence under each respective definition.\u201d <em>United States v. Herrera-Alvarez, </em>753 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2014). Both methodologies are \u201citerations of the elements-based categorical approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For the enumerated offenses, \u201cwe conduct a \u2018common-sense\u2019 categorical approach, looking to various sources \u2014 such as \u2018the Model Penal Code, the LaFave' and Scott treatises, modern state codes, and dictionary definitions\u2019 \u2014 to define each crime by its \u2018generic, contemporary meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Moreno-Florean, </em>542 F.3d 445, 449 (5th Cir.2008)); <em>see also United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 552 n. 17 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 512, 187 L.Ed.2d 365 (2013). For the second category, \u201cwe analyze whether the offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\u201d <em>Herrera-Alvarez, </em>753 F.3d at 137. Under this provision, force \u201cmust rise to the level of \u2018destructive or violent force\u2019; mere \u2018offensive touching\u2019 with a deadly weapon is insufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Dominguez, </em>479 F.3d 345, 348 (5th Cir.2007)). \u201cUnder both approaches, we determine the elements to which a defendant pleaded guilty by analyzing the statutory definition of the offense, not the defendant\u2019s underlying conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137-38 (citing <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2281, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">We first consider whether the underlying offense, second-degree murder, constitutes a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 372 (5th Cir.2009) (considering first whether the crime underlying defendant\u2019s \u201cattempt\u201d conviction would constitute a crime of violence). Murder, is one of the enumerated offenses in comment l(B)(iii) of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. We therefore consider whether New York\u2019s statute is consistent with the generic, contemporary meaning of murder. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">Under New York Penal Law \u00a7 125.25, a person is guilty of murder in the second degree, a Class A felony, when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-12\">1. With intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person ...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-13\">3. ... he commits or attempts to commit robbery, burglary, kidnapping, arson, rape in the first degree, criminal sexual act in the first degree, sexual abuse in the first degree, aggravated sexual abuse, escape in the first degree, or escape in the second degree, and, in the course of and in furtherance of such crime or of immediate flight therefrom, he, or another participant, if there be any, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants ...;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-15\">N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 125.25(1),(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-16\">Godoy-Castaneda contends that the third subsection of the statute is broader than the contemporary, generic meaning of murder. Though LaFave and the Model Penal Code recognize felony murder, Go-doy-Castaneda argues that the third subsection does not necessarily involve conduct that is \u201cdangerous to life.\u201d <em>See </em>2 W.R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 14.5(b) (2d ed.2003) (noting that for felony murder, the \u201cfelony attempted or committed by the defendant must be dangerous to life\u201d). For example, under New York law, a person is guilty of sexual abuse in the first degree if he \u201csubjects another person to sexual contact ... [b]y forcible compulsion.\u201d N.Y. Penal Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>\u00a7 130.65. Godoy-Castaneda contends that a person could be convicted of second-degree murder in New York for touching another person\u2019s leg, which is \u201csexual contact\u201d by \u201cforcible compulsion,\u201d and, when running away, that person knocks a third person down, causing that person\u2019s death. Godoy-Castaneda argues that this hypothetical is far from the dangerous felonies required by the Model Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Godoy-Castaneda points to no New York case employing such a far-fetched approach. <em>See United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 460 (5th Cir.2014) (requiring a \u201crealistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1892, 191 L.Ed.2d 767 (2015). Even putting that aside and assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Godoy-Castaneda is correct that New York\u2019s second-degree murder statute is broader than the enumerated offense of murder, where a divisible statute has some sections that qualify as a crime of violence and some that do not, we apply the \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-7\">Under the modified categorical approach, we may consult a limited class of documents, such as indictments and jury instructions, to determine which alternative formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction. The court can then do what the categorical approach demands: compare the elements of the crime of conviction (including the alternative element used in the case) with the elements of the generic crime, or, as the case may be, assess whether the crime of conviction has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force. Those records are generally limited to ... the charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented. By reviewing the extra-statutory materials approved in those cases, courts c[an] discover \u2018which statutory phrase\u2019 contained within a statute listing \u2018several different\u2019 crimes, \u2018covered a prior conviction.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-9\"><em>Herrera-Alvarez, </em>753 F.3d at 138 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (holding that, under the modified categorical approach, courts are \u201cgenerally limited to examining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">Godoy-Castaneda\u2019s indictment and judgment do not explicitly identify the statutory subsection for the underlying offense of second-degree murder. For the five conspiracy counts, the indictment states that Godoy-Castaneda acted \u201cwith intent that conduct constituting the crime of Murder in the Second degree ... be performed [and] agreed with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct.\u201d Similarly, with respect to the five solicitation counts, the indictment states that Godoy-Castaneda \u201cdid solicit, request, command, importune, or otherwise attempted to cause such person\u201d to \u201cengage in conduct constituting the crime of Murder in the Second Degree.\u201d However, in the description of the overt acts associated with the conspiracy, the indictment alleges that Godoy-Castaneda, with his co-conspirators, paid a third party to \u201cfund the murders,\u201d met with the third party to identify the \u201cintended murder target,\u201d and provided a photograph of the \u201cintended murder target.\u201d Godoy-Cas-taneda pleaded guilty to all of the counts of the indictment. The language in the indictment indicates that the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>second-degree murder fell within the first subsection, as Godoy-Castaneda solicited a third party and conspired with others to cause the death of a person <em>with the intent to cause the death </em>of that person. <em>See </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 125.25(1). The first subsection of the second-degree murder statute is within the generic, contemporary meaning of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Godoy-Castaneda did not object to the enhancement on this basis before the district court. Thus, we review this issue for plain error only. <em>Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d at 497. To demonstrate plain error, a defendant must show a forfeited error that is, inter alia, clear or obvious. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). In light of the record, which shows that the indictment to which he pleaded guilty alleges that Godoy-Castaneda, with others, identified the murder target and paid another person to carry out the murder, the implicit conclusion that \u00a7 125.25(1) is the statute of conviction and application of the enhancement on this basis is not clear or obvious error.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Next, we turn to the crimes of conviction. Godoy-Castaneda was convicted of conspiracy in the second degree and solicitation in the second degree for his role in the second-degree murder. It is not clear that Godoy-Castaneda preserved the arguments as to solicitation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As we conclude that solicitation supports the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement even under a less deferential review standard, we do not decide the standard of review and we do not decide whether conspiracy in the second degree under New York law constitutes a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Under New York state law, \u201c[a] person is guilty of criminal solicitation in the second degree when, with intent that another person engage in conduct constituting a class A felony, he solicits,. requests, commands, importunes or otherwise attempts to cause such other person to engage in such conduct.\u201d N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 100.10. Godoy-Castaneda contends that the crime of conspiracy under New York law does not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because New York\u2019s solicitation statute is similar to its conspiracy statute, and federal law does not recognize a unilateral conspiracy (such as conspiring with an undercover government agent).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">We rejected this 'reasoning in <em>United States v. Mendez-Casarez, </em>624 F.3d 233, 240 (5th Cir.2010), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Mendez-Casarez, </em>we considered whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>North Carolina solicitation statute could be a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d even though solicitation is not one of the enumerated crimes. To this end, we compared \u201cthe <em>mens rea </em>(mental state) and <em>actus reus </em>(action or conduct) of the prior offense to those of conspiracy, aiding and abetting, and attempt\u201d to determine whether the prior offense is \u201cclearly less serious\u201d than the enumerated offense. <em>Id. </em>at 238; <em>see also Mejia-Aguilar, 575 </em>Fed.Appx. at 237 (applying the same methodology to determine whether solicitation under Arizona law is a crime of violence). Upon comparing the North Carolina statute to the \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning\u201d of conspiracy, we found that the <em>\u201cmens rea </em>and <em>actus reus </em>of solicitation [under North Carolina law] are not clearly less serious than those of conspiracy.\u201d <em>Mendez-Casarez, </em>624 F.3d at 239. First, North Carolina\u2019s solicitation statute required the same mens rea as conspiracy: \u201cthe defendant must intend .that the underlying crime be committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, \u201cboth offenses involve the defendant taking a step, whether agreeing or soliciting, towards fulfilling his intention that the crime be committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240. Moreover, the fact that solicitation did not require an overt act, whereas conspiracy statutes often require an overt act, did not render solicitation \u201cclearly less serious\u201d than conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>In reaching the conclusion, we explicitly rejected the argument \u201cthat the response of the other person determines the seriousness of the acts of soliciting or agreeing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The New York statute here is similar to the North Carolina statute. Like the North Carolina law, the New York solicitation statute requires proof that the defendant intended that the underlying crime be committed (the mens rea) and that the defendant \u201csolicits, requests, commands, importunes or otherwise attempts to cause [another] person to engage in such conduct\u201d (the actus reus). N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 100.10; <em>People v. Cheathem, </em>239 A.D.2d 595, 596, 658 N.Y.S.2d 84 (N.Y.App.Div.1997). As we have previously found that it is the act of the <em>defendant, </em>and not the other person, that determines the seriousness of the act of soliciting, we reject Godoy-Castaneda\u2019s argument that solicitation cannot be a crime of violence because it is unilateral. We conclude that Godoy-Castaneda fails to show reversible error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that conviction for solicitation in the second degree based on the underlying crime of second-degree murder under New York law constitutes a crime of violence for the purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b790-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

As the substance of the \"unilateral\u201d argument was before the district court, one could argue that the error was preserved. See <em>United States v.
