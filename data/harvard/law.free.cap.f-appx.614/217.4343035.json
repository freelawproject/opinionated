Lorenzo contends he is entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period that applies to motions to reopen due to his counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. In that regard, he asserts counsel was inef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>fective in failing to properly advise him of the law regarding his application for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Lorenzo does not challenge the BIA\u2019s refusal to consider his equitable-tolling contention because he failed to raise it before the IJ. <em>See, e.g., Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 195 &amp; n. 14 (5th Cir.2004) (The BIA need not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal). Nor does he challenge the BIA\u2019s alternative ruling that, even if it did consider that contention, he failed to exercise due diligence. Accordingly, Lorenzo has abandoned his challenge to these issues. <em>See, e.g., Brinkmann v. Dall. Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987) (stating claims not pressed on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
