The district court dismissed their action after concluding that, under the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), it did not have jurisdiction to consider AVIC\u2019s claims that the arbitration panel, as selected and presently existing, \u201cdeviates\u201d from the arbitration provisions of the parties\u2019 agreement and fails to meet the constitutional requirement of impartiality. The court ruled that it could not' address such complaints before the arbitration panel renders its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Our review of the district court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order and the record on appeal, including the briefs of the parties, and their excerpts, satisfies us that the district court ruled correctly, committing no error \u2014 reversible or otherwise. The agreement at issue was entered into by sophisticated and experienced parties on advice of highly qualified counsel; that agreement contains their carefully crafted arbitration provision; one or more of the parties validly invoked arbitration in compliance with that provision; several of the parties to the agreement \u2014 not just two \u201csides\u201d \u2014 followed by appointing one arbitrator each; and, as noted, arbitration is now before the panel comprising those arbitrators and is presumably proceeding pursuant to the rules and procedures of the AAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">As noted by the district court, AVIC has failed to demonstrate that, as it claims, there has been a \u201clapse\u201d in the appointment of arbitrators. In <em>BP Exploration Libya Ltd. v. ExxonMobil Libya, Ltd.,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we defined that term as \u201ca lapse in time in the naming of the arbitrator or in the filling of a vacancy on a panel of arbitrators, or some other mechanical breakdown in the arbitrator selection process.\u201d AVIC\u2019s allegations do not identify any occurrences that meet that definition. Simply put, when its position is reduced to its bare essentials, AVIC is asking us to rewrite their agreement\u2019s arbitration provision to require that every arbitration among these multiple parties comprise only two \u201csides.\u201d It is apparent from the plain wording of that provision, however, that the agreement contemplates the possibility of there being three or more \u201csides\u201d among the several parties to the agreement. More to the point, AVIC\u2019s strained interpretation of the arbitration provision would mandate that there be precisely three arbitrators in any and every instance, no more and no fewer \u2014 one selected by one \u201cside,\u201d a second selected by the other \u201cside,\u201d and the third selected by the first two. The unambiguous wording of the arbitration provision eschews such a reading: The agreement expressly contemplates the possibility of (1) an even number of arbitrators (an impossibility under AVIC\u2019s proposed, three-only arbitrators interpretation) and (2) adding either one <em>or two </em>more arbitrators to achieve an odd number (also an impossibility under a three-only arbitrator situation).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">All that aside, we agree with the analysis of the district court and its conclusions that at this stage of the ongoing arbitration proceedings, a stay to deal with the issues advanced by AVIC would be premature, and that any resolution of AVIC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>objections to the makeup of the arbitration panel must await completion of the arbitration process. For essentially the reasons expressed by the district court, its Judgment is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b240-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
