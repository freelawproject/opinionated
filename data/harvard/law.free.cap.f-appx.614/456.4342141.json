On appeal, Mr. O\u2019Neal argues that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred by finding that he did not meet the requirements of the listed impairment for mental retardation, 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 12.05(C) (\u201cListing 12.05(C)\u201d). Because substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s determination, we affirm the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-16\">Mr. O\u2019Neal filed for social security disability insurance benefits and for supplemental security income. The Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) denied his application both initially and on reconsideration. Mr. O\u2019Neal then requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). Following the hearing, the ALJ denied Mr. O\u2019Neal\u2019s application. The next day, the Appeals Council granted Mr. O\u2019Neal\u2019s request for review and remanded the case to the ALJ to further develop the record with medical treatment records, including opinion evidence from Mr. O\u2019Neal\u2019s doctors, and to explain the reasons for the decision. The ALJ held a second hearing and again denied the application. This time, the Appeals Council declined Mr. O\u2019Neal\u2019s request for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>review, and the rejection of his application became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Mr. O\u2019Neal then filed this lawsuit. Adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendations, the district court affirmed the AL J\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In Social Security appeals, we review <em>de novo </em>the legal principles upon which the ALJ\u2019s decision is based. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). We may not decide facts anew, make credibility decisions, or re-weigh the evidence. <em>Id. </em>Instead, we review the Commissioner\u2019s ultimate decision only to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938); <em>see also Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (applying <em>Consolidat\u00e9d Edison\u2019s </em>substantial evidence standard to disability determinations under the Social Security Act). When a decision is supported by substantial evidence, we must affirm, \u201c[e]ven if we find that the evidence preponderates against the Secretary\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>MacGregor v. Bowen, </em>786 F.2d 1050, 1053 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">To be eligible for disability insurance benefits or supplemental security income, a claimant must be unable \u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a)(1)(E) <em>&amp; </em>(d). To determine whether a claimant is disabled, the Social Security Act applies a five-step sequential evaluation. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a) (establishing the five-step evaluation for disability insurance benefit claims); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a) (applying the same five-step inquiry to supplemental security income claims). If the claimant is conclusively found to be disabled or not disabled at any step, then the ALJ does not proceed to the next step.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">At step one, the ALJ determines whether the claimant is engaged in \u201csubstantial gainful activity.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). If not, then the claimant must show at step two that her impairment is \u201csevere,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>that it \u201csignificantly limits [her] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(c). If the claimant makes that showing, then at step three she must show that she has an impairment that meets or equals the criteria contained in the Listings of Impairments. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). If the claimant meets her burden of proving that her impairment meets or equals a Listing, then she is determined to be disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a), 416.920(d). If she does not, then at step four, the ALJ considers the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d), which determines whether the claimant could still perform her past relevant work activity. <em>Id. </em>If the claimant could not do so, then the ALJ moves to step five and determines whether, in light of the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience, the claimant could perform other work. <em>Id. </em>If so, the claimant is not disabled; if not, the claimant is disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">On appeal, Mr. O\u2019Neal argues that the ALJ erred at the third step of the analysis by failing to conclude that he is disabled under Listing 12.05, which covers intellectual disability. To prevail at step three, Mr. O\u2019Neal must provide evidence showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>that his impairment meets all of the criteria in the Listing. If his impairment meets all of the Listing criteria, then he is \u201cconclusively presumed to be disabled,\u201d and the ALJ should have approved his application. <em>Crayton v. Callahan, </em>120 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">To qualify under Listing 12.05, Mr. O\u2019Neal must first meet the diagnostic criteria in 12.05\u2019s introductory paragraph: he \u201cmust at least (1) have significantly subav-erage general intellectual functioning; (2) have deficits in adaptive behavior; and (3) have manifested deficits in adaptive behavior before age 22.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 12.00 (\u201cListing 12.05 contains an introductory paragraph with the diagnostic description for intellectual disability.\u201d). In addition, Mr. O\u2019Neal must meet the specific severity requirements in one of the subparagraphs, A through D. He argues that he qualifies under 12.05(C), which requires \u201c[a] valid verbal, performance, or full scale IQ of 60 through 70 and a physical or other mental impairment imposing an additional and significant work-related limitation of function.\u201d 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 12.05(C). The Commissioner does not dispute that Mr. O\u2019Neal meets the requirements of subsection (C). Rather, the Commissioner argues the ALJ correctly determined that Mr. O\u2019Neal failed to establish that he meets the additional requirements found in the diagnostic description in the Listing\u2019s introductory paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">At step three, the ALJ determined that Mr. O\u2019Neal \u201cdoes not have an impairment or combination of impairments that meets or medically equals the severity of one of the listed impairments.\u201d Although Mr. O\u2019Neal is correct that there was no explicit finding regarding Listing 12.05, the ALJ did \u201cgive[ ] particular consideration to ... [Listing] 12.00 et seq., Mental Disorders,\u201d in reaching this determination. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to uphold the ALJ\u2019s implicit rejection of Listing 12.05 because Mr. O\u2019Neal \u201cfailed to establish \u2014 let alone even mention \u2014 that he meets the additional requirements found in the diagnostic description in the introductory paragraph.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">We agree with the district court that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Mr. O\u2019Neal does not meet the criteria for presumptive disability under Listing 12.05. The introductory paragraph in 12.05 requires that Mr. O\u2019Neal exhibit (1) significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning (2) with deficits in adaptive functioning (3) that manifested before age 22. 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 12.05; <em>Crayton, </em>120 F.3d at 1219. Even though the SSA has not specifically defined \u201cdeficits in adaptive functioning,\u201d the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\u201cDSM\u201d) states that adaptive functioning \u201crefers to how effectively individuals cope with common life demands and how well they meet the standards of personal independence expected of someone in their particular age group, sociological background, and community setting.\u201d DSM-IV-TR at 42. Although Mr. O\u2019 Neal has a qualifying full scale I.Q. score of 63, which creates a rebuttable presumption that he manifested deficits in adaptive functioning before age 22, the Commissioner may present evidence relating to a claimant\u2019s daily life to rebut this presumption. <em>See Hodges v. Barnhart, 276 </em>F.3d 1265, 1269 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">The record evidence shows that Mr. O\u2019Neal held a job as a dishwasher for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>many years without receiving any special accommodation or training. He quit his job only for family reasons. Afterward, he worked occasionally as a handy man, helping with carpet and trim work and installing siding. Mr. O\u2019Neal helps at home with light yard work, looks after his two children, independently performs all his activities of personal care and daily living, and attends church every Sunday. He holds a driver\u2019s license and drives locally three times per week. These facts support the ALJ\u2019s implicit conclusion that, despite his low I.Q. score, Mr. O\u2019Neal does not have sufficient adaptive functioning deficits to meet the requirements of the diagnostic description in Listing 12.05. While there may be other record evidence to support Mr. O\u2019Neal\u2019s arguments, there is substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we must affirm the district court\u2019s order and the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">. <em>See Hutchison v.
