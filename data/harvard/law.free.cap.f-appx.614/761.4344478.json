(\u201cLufkin\u201d) on Harrelson\u2019s interference and retaliation claims under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615 of the Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d). Because Harrelson waived his interference claim by failing to argue that he suffered from a \u201cserious health condition\u201d and cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">Harrelson began working for Lufkin in August of 2004 and was chronically absent from work due to an upper-respiratory condition. On May 1, 2012, Harrelson brought an FMLA form provided by Luf-kin to his physician, Dr. Saxton, who indicated that Harrelson\u2019s condition began on May 1, 2012, and would probably conclude on May 3, 2012. Harrelson was absent from work on May 1, 2012, and May 2, 2012, and returned the completed FMLA form to Lufkin\u2019s Human Resource Manager, David Duford, on May 4. Harrelson was absent from work on seven more occasions between May 9, 2012, and June 3, 2012, and he claims that on each occasion he received permission to take FMLA leave from an unidentified supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-14\">On June 5, 2012, Harrelson met with two supervisory employees who informed him that a computer-generated warning indicated that Harrelson had been repeatedly absent from work. Harrelson explained that he had submitted FMLA paperwork and that he was entitled to leave for the days in question. Harrelson was then fired on June 11, 2012, for excessive absences. At that point, Harrelson was advised that the FMLA forms signed by Dr. Saxton only entitled Harrelson to two days of leave. Harrelson explained that Dr. Saxton had made a mistake when filling out the forms and requested that Dr. Saxton be allowed to amend the forms. Lufkin consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-15\">Dr. Saxton revised the FMLA form to indicate that Harrelson would require leave for an \u201cunknown\u201d number of days, even though the form specified that \u201c \u2018[u]n-known\u2019 or \u2018indeterminate\u2019 is not sufficient to determine FMLA coverage ... [and failure t\u00f3 provide sufficient information may cause the employee\u2019s FMLA request to be delayed or denied.\u201d -Lufkin refused to reconsider Harrelson\u2019s termination in light of Dr. Saxton\u2019s revision. Harrelson filed suit on May 28, 2013, and the district court subsequently granted summary judgment in Lufkin\u2019s favor. Harrelson timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-17\">\u201cWe review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court.\u201d <em>Ion v. Chevron USA, Inc., </em>731 F.3d 379, 389 (5th Cir.2013). Summary judgment is appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>\u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). We \u201cconsider all facts and evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Ion, </em>731 F.3d at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">\u201cThe FMLA provides eligible employees with twelve workweeks of leave during a twelve-month period upon a triggering event, including [as relevant here] \u2018a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of [his] position.\u2019 \u201d <em>Silva v. City of Hidalgo, Tex., </em>575 Fed.Appx. 419, 424 (5th Cir.2014) (unpublished) (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D)). To establish a prima fa-cie case for interference with FMLA rights, plaintiffs must demonstrate that they are entitled to leave under the FMLA. <em>See Mauder v. Metro. Transit Auth., </em>446 F.3d 574, 580 (5th Cir.2006).. As part of this showing, Harrelson must present evidence of a \u201cserious health condition,\u201d <em>see Mauder, </em>446 F.3d at 580, which the FMLA defines as \u201can illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves \u2014 (A) inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility; or (B) continuing treatment by a health care provider.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2611(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Although the district court concluded that Harrelson failed to make the necessary showing, Harrelson failed to address this issue on appeal. It is well established that the \u201c[f]ailure adequately to brief an issue on appeal constitutes waiver of that argument.\u201d <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. v. Amway Corp., </em>376 F.3d 496, 499 n. 1 (5th Cir.2004) (citing Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A)). Harrelson\u2019s waiver means that his interference claim necessarily also fails; he cannot demonstrate as a matter of law that all of the elements of his-interference claim are satisfied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">Harrelson also claims that he was retaliated against for taking FMLA leave. Where there is no direct evidence of discrimination, the court applies the <em>McDonnell </em>Douglas<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> framework.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Hunt v. Rapides Healthcare Sys., LLC, </em>277 F.3d 757, 768 (5th Cir.2001). Under this framework, Harrelson must first establish a prima fa-cie case of retaliation by showing: (1) he was protected under the FMLA; (2) he suffered an adverse employment decision; and either (3a) he was treated less favorably than an employee that had not requested FMLA leave; or (3b) the adverse decision was made because he took FMLA leave. <em>Id. </em>Once Harrelson has established a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to Lufkin to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Harrelson\u2019s termination. <em>Id. </em>If Lufkin can articulate such a reason, the burden shifts back to Harrel-son to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the proffered reason was pretextual. <em>Id. </em>Harrelson\u2019s claim fails at several steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>Lufkin argues that Harrelson cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation because Harrelson did not engage in protected conduct under the FMLA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While \u201ca plaintiff need not establish a violation of the substantive, prescriptive provisions of the FMLA to allege a violation of the proscriptive provisions,\u201d <em>Hunt, </em>277 F.3d at 769, Harrelson\u2019s failure to substantiate his interference claim is inconsistent with his retaliation claim under the facts of this case. The FMLA bars an employer only from retaliating against an employee for engaging in conducted protected by the Act. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615(a). As discussed above, Harrelson did not engage in protected conduct when he was repeatedly absent during May and June of 2012. As such, he was not protected by the FMLA, and his retaliation claim fails at the first step. <em>See id. </em>at 768; <em>see also Lanier v. Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr., </em>527 Fed.Appx. 312, 317 (5th Cir.2013) (unpublished) (holding that plaintiffs retaliation claim necessarily failed where the plaintiff did not submit a proper request for FMLA leave); <em>cf. Grubb v. Sw. Airlines, </em>296 Fed.Appx. 383, 390 (5th Cir.2008) (unpublished) (concluding that there was \u201cenough of an issue of fact as to whether [the plaintiff] had a \u2018serious health condition\u2019 for the purposes of FMLA \u2018protection\u2019 to survive summary judgment\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Even assuming arguendo that Harrelson can establish a prima facie case, he fails to rebut Lufkin\u2019s proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for dismissing Harrelson. Harrelson\u2019s employment contract provides that employees are permitted six unpaid, unauthorized absences per year. The employee receives a written warning for each additional absence and is terminated upon the thirteenth unpaid, unauthorized absence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Lufkin maintains that it fired Harrelson pursuant to this policy, as Harrelson never received authorized leave for his repeated absences between May 9, 2012, and June 3, 2012. Although Harrelson disputes this contention, attesting that he received authorization to take FMLA leave from an unnamed supervisor and therefore did not violate the absence policy in his contract, it is insufficient to create a material dispute of fact as to whether the proffered reason was pretextual. Lufkin\u2019s policy required employees to contact the Human Resources Manager with requests for FMLA leave. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.302(d) (stating that an employee may be denied leave for failing to abide by an employer\u2019s \u201cusual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave\u201d). Thus, Harrelson\u2019s conversations with his supervisor cannot shield him from dismissal. Because Harrelson does not provide any further evidence to rebut Lufkin\u2019s proffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>reason for dismissing him, his retaliation claim fails. <em>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (noting that \u201ca weak issue of fact as to whether the employer\u2019s reason was untrue\u201d is insufficient to prove retaliation).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b784-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-7\">. Because we conclude that Harrelson waived this argument, we need not address the district court\u2019s alternate.holding that Harrelson failed to provide adequate notice in accord with the FMLA's requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b785-8\">. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b785-9\">. Neither party argues that the court should apply the but-for standard articulated in <em>University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2517, 2534, 186 L.Ed.2d 503 (2013), which is employed in Title VII retaliation cases. We have yet to decide whether <em>Nassar </em>applies to the FMLA context. As Harrelson contends that Lufkin fired him solely in retaliation for taking FMLA leave, the mixed-motive argument is not at issue in this case. <em>See Ion, </em>731 F.3d at 389-90. Therefore, we need not address <em>Nas-sar </em>'s effect, if any, on FMLA retaliation claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b786-4\">. There is no dispute that Harrelson was \"eligible\u201d for FMLA leave as defined by the Act. An \"eligible employee\u201d is one who has been employed \"for at least 12 months by the employer with respect to whom leave is requested\u201d and has been employed \"for at least 1,250 hours of service with such employer during the previous 12 month period.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2611(2)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b786-5\">. Although <em>Lanier </em>and <em>Grubb </em>are not \"controlling precedent,\u201d they \"may be [cited as] persuasive authority.\u201d <em>Ballard v. Burton, </em>444 F.3d 391, 401 n. 7 (5th Cir.2006) (citing 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b786-7\">.Harrelson maintains that Lufkin violated its own policy by not providing Harrelson with a written warning for each subsequent absence, but instead only provided a warning for two of-his absences. Lufkin disputes this characterization, claiming that it provided Harrelson with a warning for each absence. This dispute is immaterial as the \"[failure to follow internal procedures is generally not enough to create a genuine issue of fact as to discriminatory purpose.\u201d <em>See Grubb, </em>296 Fed.Appx. at 390 (citing <em>Moore v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>990 F.2d 812, 819 (5th Cir.1993)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
