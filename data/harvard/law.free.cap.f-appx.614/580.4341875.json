We will deny a certificate of ap-pealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to the extent that one is required and will otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">In 2006, Hawkins was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). In light of Hawkins\u2019s criminal history, which included a Pennsylvania state conviction of conspiring to possess with the intent to deliver crack cocaine, the District Court sentenced him to a mandatory term of fifteen years in prison under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). We affirmed. <em>See United States v. Hawkins, </em>280 Fed.Appx. 117 (3d Cir.2008). Hawkins later filed a \u00a7 2255 motion seeking relief from his criminal judgment. The District Court denied it on the merits, and we denied a COA. (C.A. No. 09-1682, July 20, 2009.)</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">At issue here is another \u00a7 2255 motion that Hawkins filed in the District Court. Hawkins argued that, under <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), his Pennsylvania conspiracy conviction no longer constitutes a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Hawkins also argued that his \u00a7 2255 motion should not be deemed second or successive or, in the alternative, that the District Court should permit him to proceed under Rule 60(b) or \u00a7 2241. The District Court disagreed, and it dismissed Hawkins\u2019s motion in part and denied it in part. Hawkins appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-14\">Primarily for the reasons explained by the District Court, jurists of reason would not debate whether Hawkins was entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2255 or Rule 60(b), and we agree that he was not entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241 either.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-15\">First, Hawkins\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion constitutes a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion because his previous \u00a7 2255 motion was denied on the merits and his present \u00a7 2255 motion attacks the same criminal judgment. <em>See United States v. Winkelman, </em>746 F.3d 134, 135 (3d Cir.2014). Hawkins argues that, by reference to the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine that predated the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), his \u00a7 2255 motion is not successive because he could not have raised his argument under <em>Descamps </em>before. <em>Cf. Benchoff v. Colleran, </em>404 F.3d 812, 817-18 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-16\">Hawkins is incorrect. The substance of Hawkins\u2019s challenge was both ripe and available at the time of his criminal judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>ment, <em>see Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), and he previously challenged the District Court\u2019s reliance on his Pennsylvania conspiracy conviction both on direct appeal and in his previous \u00a7 2255 motion, <em>see, e.g., Hawkins, </em>280 Fed.Appx. at 121-22. His attempt to do so again on the basis of <em>Descamps </em>is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244 and 2255(h), which, as relevant here, require him to obtain our authorization to proceed on the basis of a \u201cnew rule of constitutional law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A), 2255(h)(2). Because he had not obtained our authorization, the District Court was required either to dismiss his \u00a7 2255 motion for lack of jurisdiction or transfer it to this Court to be treated as an application under \u00a7\u00a7 2244 and 2255(h). <em>See Robinson v. Johnson, </em>313 F.3d 128, 139 (3d Cir.2002). There was no reason for the District Court to transfer it to this Court because Hawkins\u2019s argument under <em>Descamps </em>does not prima facie satisfy the \u00a7\u00a7 2244 and 2255(h) standard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Second, and despite Hawkins\u2019s protestations to the contrary, his request to proceed under Rule 60(b) constituted a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion as well because it-asserted a claim for relief from his criminal judgment. <em>See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 531, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). Thus, the District Court lacked jurisdiction over this aspect of his motion for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Finally, the District Court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Hawkins\u2019s motion under \u00a7 2241 because \u00a7 2241 petitions must be filed in a prisoner\u2019s district of confinement and Hawkins was and is confined within the Eastern District of Kentucky. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a); <em>Rumsfeld v. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 442, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004). The District Court also concluded that Hawkins\u2019s request to proceed under \u00a7 2241 lacked merit because \u00a7 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>Cf. United States v. Tyler, </em>732 F.3d 241, 246 (3d Cir.2013); <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997). There was no reason for the District Court to consider whether \u00a7 2241 relief might be available under the law of this circuit, however, because Hawkins is confined and should have requested \u00a7 2241 relief in Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">In that regard, the District Court could have considered whether transferring Hawkins\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition to the proper forum would have been \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. We will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>remand for that purpose because we see no indication that Sixth Circuit law would permit Hawkins to proceed under \u00a7 2241. <em>See, e.g., Davis, </em>751 F.3d at 775 (\u201cThe Supreme Court in <em>Descamps </em>explained that it was not announcing a new rule[.]\u201d); <em>Martin v. Perez, </em>319 F.3d 799, 804 (6th Cir.2003) (recognizing <em>Dorsainvil-like </em>exception permitting resort to \u00a7 2241 but explaining that it requires \u201ca rigorous showing, because [n]o circuit court has to date permitted a post-AEDPA petitioner who was not effectively making a claim of actual innocence to utilize \u00a7 2241 ... as a way of circumventing \u00a7 2255\u2019s restrictions on the filing of second or successive habeas petitions\u201d) (quotation marks and alteration omitted). For present purposes, however, we express no definitive opinion on the merits of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">For these reasons, we will deny a COA to the extent that one is required and will otherwise affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b603-10\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-11\">. A COA is not required to appeal the denial of a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition, and we thus have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 to the extent that the District Court denied Hawkins\u2019s request to proceed under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Burkey v. Marberry, </em>556 F.3d 142, 146 (3d Cir.2009). A COA is required to the extent that the District Court dismissed Hawkins's request for relief under \u00a7 2255 and denied his request to proceed under Rule 60(b). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B); <em>United States v. Rinaldi, </em>447 F.3d 192, 195 (3d Cir.2006). A COA may issue only if jurists of reason would debate both the District Court's procedural rulings and whether Hawkins has stated a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-5\">. Hawkins argues that Pennsylvania's general conspiracy\u2019statute criminalizes some conduct that does not constitute a \u201cserious drug offense,\" that the statute is indivisible, and that, under <em>Descamps, </em>the District Court thus erred in applying the modified categorical approach in determining that his Pennsylvania conviction was an ACCA predicate. In <em>Descamps, </em>the Court merely reaffirmed that, under its existing precedent (including <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Shepard), </em>courts may apply the modified categorical approach in determining whether a conviction is an ACCA predicate only when the statute of conviction is divisible and only to determine the subpart under which the defendant was convicted. <em>See Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2281-82. Thus, the rule applied in <em>Descamps </em>is neither new nor constitutional. <em>See Ezell v. United States, </em>778 F.3d 762, 765-66 (9th Cir.2015); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>751 F.3d 769, 775 (6th Cir.2014). Indeed, although we do not reach the merits of Hawkins's claim, we note that we already have decided that <em>Descamps </em>does not alter our previous ruling that 35 Pa. Stat. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30), which is the statute that Hawkins was convicted of conspiring to violate, is divisible and properly subject to the modified categorical approach. <em>See United States v. Abbott, </em>748 F.3d 154, 156 &amp; n. 1 (3d Cir.2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
