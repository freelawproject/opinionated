Gammage, a former attorney, appeals his 70-month sentence imposed after pleading guilty to one count of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. Gammage asserts two arguments on appeal: (1) the district court erred by applying a 4-level enhancement to his guideline range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 (b)(2)(B) for an offense involving at least 50 victims, and (2) the district court erred in finding the offense involved sophisticated means for purposes of applying a 2-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C). Upon review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AEX\">\n<em>A. Gammage\u2019s Law Firm Fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Gammage was licensed to practice law in the State of Georgia from approximately June 1979 through January 2012. Gam-mage owned and operated The Gammage Firm in Cedartown, Georgia, where he specialized in workers\u2019 compensation cases and represented people who were seriously injured at work. Gammage took over The Gammage Firm when his father, who founded the firm, passed away.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Over the course of The Gammage Firm\u2019s existence, The Gammage Firm had developed an excellent reputation among injured workers. Gammage leveraged the firm\u2019s name, as well as his eloquent speaking ability, to gain clients\u2019 trust. Gam-mage was a \u201csweet talking man,\u201d which made it easy for clients to believe him and to believe the good things they had heard about The Gammage Firm. Gammage\u2019s clients were also reassured by Gammage\u2019s special status as a fiduciary. They \u201ctrust[ed] in the legal system in this country\u201d and believed Gammage\u2019s fiduciary status required him to \u201ctake care of [them] and give them what they were due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">From about January 2008 until January 2012, Gammage defrauded his injured clients out of more than $2 million. He used these stolen funds to enrich himself and to pay his law firm\u2019s payroll and operating expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">The scheme went as follows: Gammage settled claims on behalf of injured clients without their authorization. Thereafter, Gammage did not notify his injured clients that he had received their settlement checks. Instead, Gammage forged his clients\u2019 names on the settlement checks and deposited those checks into bank accounts he controlled for his own use. Meanwhile, his injured clients \u2014 some of whom were disabled or unable to work\u2014 struggled to make ends meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">In order to keep the scheme going for four years, Gammage used various tactics that lulled his clients into a false sense of security and delayed their complaints to law enforcement authorities. Gammage refused to provide clients with a full and accurate accounting of their funds and delayed the disbursement of settlement funds as long as possible. When clients called to ask about their settlement money, Gammage would either not return their phone calls or make up excuses and blame others. Gammage told one client \u201chis bank accounts were frozen because of IRS problems.\u201d He told another client \u201cthere is some kind of holdup' and lots of red tape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">When Gammage\u2019s clients insisted they needed money to pay medical bills, purchase medication, and, in some instances, put food on the table, Gammage provided them partial payments, which he referred to as \u201cadvances\u201d and \u201cinterest-free loans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">\n<em>B. The Investigation and Guilty Plea</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">In 2011, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) began investigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Gammage. At that time, the Government believed Gammage had already defrauded more than 60 of his injured clients out of more than $2 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The Government\u2019s investigation revealed Gammage commingled his clients\u2019 funds with his own funds. The Government believed, among other things, Gammage committed the following acts: deposited checks made payable to his business into his personal bank account; withdrew money from, his business checking account to pay personal expenses without documentation; used the same bank account for his business and personal needs; and moved money back and forth between his business and personal accounts without documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">As a result of the Government\u2019s investigation, Gammage was named in a single-count information charging him with mail fraud for devising and participating in a scheme to defraud his clients, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. On January 8, 2013, Gammage signed a plea agreement, pleading guilty to the charges in the single-count information.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\n<em>C. Plea Colloquy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">At the plea colloquy, the Government stated it would prove the following facts if the case proceeded to trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">The Defendant .Gammage was licensed to practice in the State of Georgia-from approximately June 1979 through January 2012. He owned and operated the Gammage Law Firm in Cedartown, Georgia where he specialized in workers\u2019 compensation cases and represented people who were seriously injured at work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">Approximately January 2008 through January 2012, he converted to his own use more than $2.5 million in settlement proceeds entrusted to him for the benefit of his injured clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">He used those stolen funds to pay his own expenses; to pay expenses of his children, and to pay the law firm payroll and operating expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">In furtherance of the scheme, he settled claims on behalf of injured clients without their authorization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">He deliberately' ignored clients and refused to provide them information concerning their settlements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-13\">He forged clients\u2019, names on settlement checks and deposited those checks into his own bank account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-14\">He commingled his clients\u2019 funds with his own funds and refused to provide clients with a full and accurate accounting. concerning the disposition of their funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-15\">He also delayed disbursing any portion of the settlement proceeds to his clients as long as possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-16\">And often clients would ask why they had not received their settlement funds, defendant made up excuses and blamed the delay on others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-17\">When clients insisted they needed money to pay medical bills and purchase medication, he tried to pacify them by giving them partial payments which he referred to as advances or interest-free loans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-18\">By engaging in such [tactics], he lulled his clients into a false sense of security and delayed their complaints to law enforcement authorities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-19\">Following the Government\u2019s statement of facts, the district court asked Gam-mage\u2019s attorney if the Government\u2019s statement was \u201cpretty well how [Gammage] view[ed] what happened.\u201d Gammage\u2019s attorney responded \u2018Tes, your honor. We believe that the Government would be able to show that if it proceeded.\u201d The district court asked Gammage\u2019s attorney if he wanted \u201cto add anything to it or take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>anything from it or make any correction.\u201d Gammage\u2019s attorney responded \u201cnot to that statement and not to add anything at this time, reserving all for later at sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The court accepted Gammage\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\n<em>D. The Pre-Sentence Investigation Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The pre-sentence investigation report (PSI) set forth the offense conduct described at the plea colloquy and identified 86 individual \u201cvictims.\u201d A chart in the PSI provided the following victim information: name, \u201cfunds received by Gammage,\u201d funds \u201cpaid to client,\u201d and the outstanding funds \u201cowed to client.\u201d According to the \u201cowed to client\u201d column, Gammage owed 60 victims money as of the time of the chart\u2019s compilation. The chart also showed Gammage had fully reimbursed losses to fourteen victims as of the time of its compilation. By adding the amounts listed in the \u201cowed to client\u201d column, the PSI calculated a \u201cTotal Loss and Restitution\u201d amount of approximately $2,426,112.97.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">The PSI assigned Gammage a base offense level of 7, pursuant to the applicable Guideline for Gammage\u2019s crime, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(l). The PSI. recommended three enhancements: (1) a 16-level enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(I), because the intended loss was more than $1,000,000 but less than $2,500,000; (2) a 4-level enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B), because the offense involved at least 50 but fewer than 250 victims; and (3) a 2-level enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C), because the offense involved sophisticated means. With regard to the sophisticated means enhancement, the PSI noted \u201cGammage forged victims\u2019 checks, commingled funds, and . set up different bank accounts to conceal his fraudulent activity.\u201d Gammage also received two additional adjustments: (1) a 2-level upward adjustment, pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.3, for abusing a position of trust to facilitate the commission or concealment of the offense; and (2) a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. With an adjusted offense level of 28 and a criminal history category I, Gammage faced an advisory guideline range of 78-97 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">\n<em>E. Gammage\u2019s Objections to the PSI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">Gammage filed a sentencing memorandum raising four objections to the PSI, only two of which are relevant to this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, Gammage objected to the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B) enhancement for an offense involving at least 50 victims. According to Gammage, the actual number of victims was 39. Gammage reached this number by calculating the restitution owed to each victim \u201cthrough a review and reconciliation of client files, bank records, and other discovery material produced by the Government.\u201d He presented his calculation in a two-column chart identifying the 39 clients to whom he contended some amount of restitution was still owing, as well as the specific amount that he contended each client was owed at that time. Each of the 39 individuals listed in Gam-mage\u2019s chart were also identified in the four-column chart in the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">Second, Gammage objected to the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C) enhancement for an offense involving sophisticated means. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Gammage argued his scheme was \u201cabout as unsophisticated as it gets,\u201d explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIm\">While Gammage victimized many people [over] the course of years, no intricate planning was involved. No shell corporations were used. No offshore accounts concealed funds. No fraudulent identification papers were created or used. No other people were required to further-the scheme. He did not make us[e] of any hidden accounts. He simply deposited settlement checks into his trust account, lied about possessing those funds to clients, and used those funds for his own purposes. When clients became suspicious, he did not create a false paper trail or recruit third parties to aid in his deception, he merely provided an amount of cash to each victim to alleviate their fears, referring to it as an \u201cadvance\u201d or \u201cinterest free loan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\n<em>F. The Sentencing Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">At the sentencing hearing, Gammage elaborated on his argument as to. the total number of victims. According to Gam-mage, there were only 39 victims because there were only \u201c39 people remaining with an out-of-pocket loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Gammage also renewed his objection to the sophisticated-means enhancement. Gammage did not contest the underlying facts of the offense contained within the PSI. Gammage simply contended \u201cthe offense conduct ... outlined in the presen-tence report\u201d was not sufficient to show Gammage used sophisticated means. Gammage explained he \u201ccertainly did the things he is charged in the criminal information with doing, but it does not meet the sophisticated means as that term is defined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\n<em>G. The District Court\u2019s Fact Findings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">After reviewing the PSI and considering the parties\u2019 arguments, the district court overruled both of Gammage\u2019s objections. First, the district court found Gammage\u2019s offense involved more than 50 victims. In doing so, the court rejected Gammage\u2019s legal argument that those who have been repaid do not count as \u201cvictims.\u201d The district court explained it \u201c[d]oesn\u2019t make any difference if today [the victims] are not owed money, they are still victims.\u201d The district court recognized the amount Gammage still owed to each victim \u201cgoes to how much the restitution may be.\u201d However, the court reasoned \u201c[i]f a person was cheated out of their money, and then repaid, that\u2019s admirable,\u201d but \u201c[t]hat doesn\u2019t mean they were not cheated out of their money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Second, the district court found Gam-mage\u2019s offense involved sophisticated means. The court accepted the underlying fact findings in the PSI and observed \u201cthey are not objected to.\u201d The district court adopted the PSI\u2019s recommendation to enhance Gammage\u2019s sentence for sophisticated means. Specifically, the district court found Gammage\u2019s crime \u201cwas very well planned and carried out by the defendant according to the sentencing guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">At the end of the sentencing hearing, the court asked Gammage if he had any objections. Gammage\u2019s attorney replied, \u201cNone, save the objections raised in the [PSI].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">\n<em>II. DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">On appeal, Gammage makes two arguments. First, he argues the district court erred by applying the 4-level enhancement for an offense 'involving at least 50 victims because there was no competent evidence before the district court of more than 50 victims. Second, he argues the district court erred by finding Gammage\u2019s offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>involved sophisticated means. We reject both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\n<em>A. Number of victims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Gammage\u2019s offense involved at least 50 victims.. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>732 F.3d 1299, 1305 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201cThis Court reviews ... underlying factual findings, including the District Court\u2019s calculation of the number of victims, for clear error.\u201d). The PSI contained a victim chart listing more than 50 clients who had suffered loss at some point in time. Gammage did not object that this chart accurately showed the number of clients he at one point defrauded. Therefore, the district court was entitled to rely on the victim chart in concluding Gammage\u2019s offense involved at least fifty victims. <em>See United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cIt is the law of this circuit that a failure to object to allegations of fact in a PSI admits those facts for sentencing purposes.\u201d); <em>United States v. Aguilar-Ibarra, </em>740 F.3d 587, 592 (11th Cir.2014) (\u201cIndeed, the defendant\u2019s failure to object to conclusory statements in the [PSI] renders those statements undisputed and permits the sentencing court to rely upon them without error even if there is an absence of supporting evidence.\u201d (quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">To be clear, Gammage\u2019s only objection as to number of victims in the district court was a legal objection \u2014 i.e., that the number of \u201cvictims\u201d under the Guidelines should not, as a matter of law, include individuals who have been reimbursed. The district court did not err by overruling this objection. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>427 F.3d 881, 894-95 (11th Cir.2005) (rejecting the argument that people who have been reimbursed cannot qualify as victims for purposes of \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\n<em>B. Sophisticated Means</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">The district court also did not clearly err in finding Gammage\u2019s offense involved sophisticated means for purposes of applying the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C) enhancement. <em>See United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1267 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s findings of fact related to the imposition of sentencing enhancements, including a finding that the defendant used sophisticated means, for clear error.\u201d (quotations omitted)). \u201cSophisticated means\u201d is defined as \u201cespecially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 comment. (n.9(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">The record is replete with evidence that Gammage employed sophisticated means to defraud his victims. Gammage\u2019s fraud was not, as he argues, \u201ca simple, \u2018garden-variety\u2019 crime.\u201d Rather, it required careful and continual deception and planning carried out over at least four years. From January 2008 until January 2012, Gam-mage capitalized on The Gammage Firm\u2019s established reputation among injured workers to manipulate prospective clients into entrusting him with their money. Gammage then exploited his specialized knowledge and training in the law to negotiate settlements with third parties on his clients\u2019 behalf. He did this even though he knew he did not have his clients\u2019 authorization to settle. Upon receiving the settlement checks, Gammage forged his clients\u2019 names and deposited the checks into accounts from which he drew personal funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">Gammage employed various tactics to conceal and extend his fraud and to lull his clients into a false sense of security. Gam-mage deliberately failed to disclose information about his clients\u2019 settlements and refused to provide clients an accurate accounting of their settlement funds. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>clients asked about their settlement money, Gammage frequently misdirected them by blaming third parties, like the IRS, or by blaming the ubiquitous \u201cred tape.\u201d Gammage\u2019s pattern of excuses and lies went on for several years, with Gammage stealing more than $2 million before being caught. He was able to continue the scheme undetected for so long, in part, by giving cash payments to clients under the guise of \u201cadvances\u201d, and \u201cinterest-free loans.\u201d These cash payments were likely drawn from money owed to previous victims, given that Gammage commingled his own funds with his clients\u2019 funds. In this sense, Gammage\u2019s law firm operated like a classic, Ponzi scheme, where \u201c[m]oney from the new investors is used directly to repay ... earlier investors.\u201d <em>See </em>Blagk\u2019s Law DiCtionary 1348 (10th ed.2014)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">We therefore disagree with Gammage\u2019s assertion that \u201cthere was nothing complex or sophisticated in the execution or concealment of Gammage\u2019s fraud.\u201d The facts of this case illustrate a complex, well-planned fraud that Gammage carefully concealed for four years. Based on the totality of the record, we cannot say \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that\u201d the district court erred in finding Gammage\u2019s crime involved sophisticated means. <em>See U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, </em>749 F.3d 967, 974 (11th Cir.2014) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-9\">. In his sentencing memorandum, Gammage also argued the total restitution amount is $1,312,375.84 and requested a downward variance based on the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.- These objections are not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
