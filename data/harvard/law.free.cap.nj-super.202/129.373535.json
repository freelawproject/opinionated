At the time of the work-related accidental death, the worker\u2019s widow, Carol Stone, and Dawn, her minor daughter from a former marriage, constituted the decedent\u2019s household. He was also survived by his former wife, Gladys Stone, who lives with Stacy and Colleen, two minor children of the decedent\u2019s marriage to Gladys. For the five years from the divorce until his death, the decedent paid $25 a week for the support of each of his two natural children pursuant to an agreed upon term of the judgment. Their mother earned $18,000 the year of his death. She never sought additional support for the girls. The widow\u2019s income was negligible. All <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>agree that Carol, Dawn,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stacy and Colleen qualify as dependents under the Act, and that Carol and Dawn were wholly dependent. The compensation judge determined that as a matter of law all four were wholly dependent, thereby rejecting as immaterial Carol\u2019s claim that as a matter of fact Stacy and Colleen were only partially dependent. We reverse and remand for a determination of the actual dependency of Stacy and Colleen.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">At issue is the interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-13,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides for the computation and distribution of compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>to dependents of a worker accidentally killed in the course of his employment. Total weekly compensation to be shared by all dependents is computed on a graduated scale of percentages of the decedent\u2019s wages, subject to a maximum, and depends upon the number of dependents. The more dependents, the higher the percentage. The four dependents here are entitled to share $236 a week, the maximum death benefits for four dependents. If all four were wholly dependent on the decedent, each would be entitled to $59 a week. If, however, Stacy and Colleen are partially dependent, as Carol contends, they would only be entitled to that percentage of $236 as the decedent\u2019s actual contribution to their support bore to $398, his total wages. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15\u201413(f). <em>See Ricciardi v. Damar Products Co., </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>54, 64-67 (1965). If we assume that the decedent\u2019s contribution to Stacy and Colleen was no more than the $25 a week he paid for each under the divorce judgment, as partial dependents each would be entitled to 6.28%<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of $236 or $14.82. In that case, Carol and Dawn would receive $103.18 each. Stated generally, once the amount of total compensation is determined by the number of dependents, the less a partial dependent receives, the more a total dependent receives. <em>See State v. Gosnell, </em>106 <em>N.J.Super. </em>279, 284 (App.Div.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The statute provides the following as to Stacy\u2019s and Colleen\u2019s dependency status:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">... [I]n the case of persons only partially dependent, except in the case of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>spouse and [natural]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> children who were actually a part of the decedent\u2019s household at the time of death, the compensation shall be such proportion of the scheduled percentage as the amounts actually contributed to them by the deceased for their support constituted of his total wages____ <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:15\u2014 13(f)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The statute thus deems Carol wholly dependent because she was \u201cactually a part of the decedent\u2019s household at the time of death.\u201d Dawn, the decedent\u2019s stepchild, is conceded to be wholly dependent in fact. Stacy and Colleen, however, may not be considered wholly dependent unless they actually were.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Despite the language of the statute, our courts have not based children\u2019s dependency benefits solely upon the \u201camounts actually contributed to them by the deceased\u201d because in some cases the deceased worker had deserted his family and then contributed little or nothing to their support. The decedent\u2019s desertion left his children without the benefit of the presumption of total dependency given to children who were \u201ca part of a decedent\u2019s household\u201d and also left them with little or no amount of actual contribution from the decedent on which to base a claim of dependency in fact. To ameliorate the plight of such children, the statutory status of a \u201cwholly dependent\u201d child was interpreted to be the legal status of dependency regardless of the amount the decedent actually contributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">In <em>Santiago v. N.J. Fireworks Mfg. Co., Inc., </em>88 <em>N.J.Super. </em>495 (App.Div.1965), the decedent\u2019s wife deserted him and their infant son in Puerto Rico. Thereafter the decedent came to New Jersey leaving the boy in the care of his parents. The decedent sent his father only $10 a week for the support of the boy and for the support of the decedent\u2019s father, mother, sister and two brothers. We held that as a matter of law the son was wholly dependent upon the decedent under the statute even though others were also supporting the child. <em>Id. </em>at 500. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number><em>also Kolakowski v. Thomas Manufacturing Corporation, </em>88 <em>N.J.Super. </em>478 (App.Div.1965), certif. den., 45 <em>N.J. </em>595 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In both cases we relied on <em>Comparri v. James Readding, Inc., </em>120 <em>N.J.L. </em>168 (E. <em>&amp; </em>A.1937). In that case the decedent deserted his wife and infant daughter. The wife obtained a court order requiring him to pay $5 a week for the child\u2019s support. The decedent was deeply in arrears when he was killed at work. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">[T]he tost is as to the dependency of a child upon the father. It is not governed in the slightest degree by the amount of money actually contributed to, or expended upon the child. It is undoubted that the law imposed upon the decedent the duty of fully and wholly maintaining his daughter____ There is nothing to indicate that this daughter was not legally and actually wholly dependent upon her father---- The undoubted fact that the father failed in his duty to provide for her, did not render the daughter any less dependent. By the term of the statute, dependency is presumed if the child is a member of the father\u2019s household, but, when a child under sixteen is without means to support herself, and a court of competent jurisdiction has found dependency and ordered the father to contribute weekly to her support and maintenance, it cannot logically be said that she is only a partial dependent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-12\">The test being dependency, and dependency having been legally determined as before stated, and nothing appearing to the contrary, the statute fixes the amount of the compensation without regard to the amount actually expended by the father on his daughter. <em>[Id. </em>at 170-171]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-13\"><em>Comparri </em>holds that as a matter of law an infant child of a deceased father is entitled to the compensation due a person wholly dependent on the father \u201cwithout regard to the amount actually expended by the father\u201d so long as there is \u201cnothing appearing to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">There was evidence in <em>Comparri </em>that actually the mother fully supported the child. The Court, however, treated the mother\u2019s contribution as the contribution of one having no duty to support the child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-15\">As was said by the Supreme Court in <em>Fay v. John Waldron Corp., </em>117 <em>N.J.L. </em>123, \u201cthe gratuitous help given by their aunt should not be a bar to their claim of total dependency if in fact they were totally dependent upon their father, * *.\u201d So here, the fact that the mother may have spent more upon the daughter than the amount fixed by the court as necessary for her support would not change the situation. [120 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 170]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Over the years, the Legislature and courts have gradually rejected the doctrine that the father has the primary duty to support his child. In 1902 the Legislature first permitted a court to order a mother to support her child. L.1902, <em>c. </em>157, \u00a7 19. In 1921 the Legislature adopted what is now <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4, which for the first time charged both parents \u201cequally\u201d with their children\u2019s \u201ccare, nurture, education and welfare.\u201d See <em>Kopack v. Polzer, </em>5 <em>N.J.Super. </em>114, 116 (App.Div.1949), aff\u2019d, 4 <em>N.J. </em>327 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Until relatively recent years, a mother satisfied that duty by providing care and nurture and the father by paying for the child\u2019s education and welfare. In a dependency action brought by a widow who left the decedent because of his cruelty and was working to support herself when he died, the former Supreme Court, reflecting the mores of its day, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">But by working and helping herself and her husband she did not lose her legal status as a total dependent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\"><em>[Alexander v. Cunningham Roofing Co. Inc., </em>124 <em>N.J.L. </em>390, 397-398 (Sup.Ct.1940), aff\u2019d, 125 <em>N.J.L. </em>277 (E. &amp; A.1940)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Today\u2019s mores are radically different. It can no longer be assumed that a working mother is in the labor market involuntarily because her spouse neglected to support her and their children. A recent Gallup Poll of women reveals that over half of the 72 percent who view marriage with children as the most satisfying way of life also prefer having a full-time job outside the home. <em>N. Y. Times, </em>May 12, 1985, p. 20. It is now commonplace for a mother to work to help support her family. The March 1984 census report indicates that 54% of children who are under 18 and members of a \u201cmarried-couple family\u201d have parents who are both in the work force. U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, <em>Household and Family Charateristics: March 1984, Series P-20, No. 398 </em>at 171 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Our Supreme Court has recognized the changed place of women in many families. Speaking of a husband\u2019s duty to support his wife, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">A closer look should also be taken at the supported spouse\u2019s ability to contribute to his or her own maintenance, both at the time of the original judgment and on applications for modification. The fact that our State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>alimony and support statute is phrased without reference to gender, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23, will accomplish little if judicial decision making continues to employ sexist stereotypes. The extent of actual economic dependency, not one\u2019s status as a wife, must determine the duration of support as well as its amount. [Citations omitted].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">Not only the realities of the marketplace, but also the constitutional guarantee of \u201cthe equal protection of the laws,\u201d <em>U.S.Const., </em>Amend. XIV, compels this approach. It is no longer permissible to ground the law of domestic relations in the \u201c \u2018old notio[n]\u2019 that \u2018generally it is the man\u2019s primary responsibility to provide a home and its essentials.\u2019 \u201d Orr <em>v. Orr, </em>440 <em>U.S. </em>[268] at 279-280, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>[1102] at 1112, 59 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>[306] at 319 [(1979)] (quoting <em>Stanton v. Stanton, </em>421 <em>U.S. </em>7, 10, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>1373, 1375, 43 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>688, 692 (1975)). \u201cNo longer is the female destined solely for the home and the rearing of the family, and only the male for the marketplace and the world of ideas.\u201d <em>Orr, </em>440 <em>U.S. </em>at 280, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1112, 59 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 319 (quoting <em>Stanton, </em>421 <em>U.S. </em>at 14-15, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1377-1378) [Citations omitted]. The law must be concerned with the economic realities of contemporary married life, not a model of domestic relations that provided women with security in exchange for economic dependence and discrimination. This does not mean that relative economic dependence\u2014when proven\u2014is irrelevant to the determination of support obligations. But a court of equity cannot rely on antiquated presumptions; gender is no longer a permissible proxy for economic need. See <em>Orr, </em>440 <em>U.S. </em>at 281, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1112, 59 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 320. The need for support must be assessed with a view towards the earning capacity of the individual woman in the marketplace. <em>[Lepis v. Lepis, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>139, 155-156 (1980) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-7\"> We adhere as we must to the holding in <em>Compar ri </em>that a child\u2019s dependency on the decedent is a matter of legal status and is not necessarily determined by the decedent\u2019s \u201cactual contribution\u201d to the child\u2019s support. The extent of a particular child\u2019s legal dependency requires that a determination be made of the decedent\u2019s legal obligation to support the child. The Division of Worker\u2019s Compensation is charged under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-13(g) with the duty to \u201cdetermine, upon the facts presented to it, the proportion to be paid to or on behalf of each dependent according to the relative-dependency.\u201d In discharging that duty, the compensation judge must consider the same facts the same way a family part judge would in fixing the decedent\u2019s obligation to support the child at the time of his death. Thus, where the surviving parent was providing support for the child of a worker killed in a work-related accident, the child would ordinarily be entitled to only partial, not total, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>dependency benefits unless the child was a member of the worker\u2019s household at the time of death.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-6\"> Dependents can include \"stepchildren.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15\u201413(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b162-7\"><em> N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-13 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">Except as hereinafter provided, in case of death, compensation shall be computed, but not distributed, on the following basis:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">a.

Todd Shipyards, </em>97 <em>N.J.Super. </em>289, 293-294 (App.Div.1967), certif. den., 51 <em>N.J. </em>9 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b168-10\"> Where some of the children who survive a decedent were a part of his household and some were not, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15\u201413(f) will often treat unfairly those who were not. For instance, where the decedent is survived by children of two marriages, all of whom were partially dependent upon him at his death, the children of the second marriage, because they were a part of his household at death, will be deemed wholly dependent, whereas the children of the first marriage will not. To avoid this inequity, the statutes of some states deem all children wholly dependent. Others deem children wholly dependent if they were actually at least partially dependent. <em>See </em>2 <em>Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 62.30, pp. 11-62 to 11-64 (1983).
