Taxpayer brought one action for 1977 and the taxing district filed the other for 1978 and 1979. Prior to commencement of trial, taxpayer moved pursuant to the Freeze Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:51A-8, for application of the Tax Court judgment for 1977 to the two assessment years following, 1978 and 1979. The Tax Court reserved on the motion and thereafter conducted a consolidated trial covering all years. It then found as true value for 1977, $15,363,800, for 1978, $16,-722,800, and for 1979, $16,564,100. The Tax Court thereafter granted taxpayer\u2019s motion and applied the valuation for 1977 to the years 1978 and 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">Defendant contends that the Freeze Act becomes applicable only where a judgment for a particular year has become \u201cfinal,\u201d and that such finality does not occur until after the right to an appellate remedy has either expired or has been exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The statutory language in effect at the time of the judgments under review is found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:51A-8. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">Where a <em>final judgment </em>has been rendered by the <em>tax court </em>involving real property <em>the </em>judgment shall be conclusive and binding upon the municipal assessor and the taxing district, parties to <em>the proceeding, </em>for the assessment year and for the 2 assessment years succeeding the assessment year covered by the final judgment, except as to changes in the value of the property occurring after the assessment date. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The foregoing statute became effective January 28, 1983. L.1983, c. 45. Previously it provided, in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:2-43, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">Where <em>a judgment final </em>has been rendered by the <em>Division of Tax Appeals in the State Department of Taxation and Finance </em>involving real property <em>such </em>judgment shall be conclusive and binding upon the municipal assessor and the taxing district, parties to <em>such appeal, </em>for the assessment year and for the two assessment years succeeding the assessment year covered by the final judgment, except as to changes in the value of the property occurring after the assessment date. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">The italicized language highlights the changes brought about by the 1983 amendment under which the Tax Court acted. In <em>Curtiss Wright Corp. v. Wood-Ridge, 4 N.J.Tax </em>68 (Tax Ct. 1982), the Tax Court addressed the earlier statute and differentiated between \u201cjudgment final\u201d and \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">\u201cJudgment final,\u201d as used in the Tax Court freeze act <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>54:2-43), is not to be equated with \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d As employed in the act, a final judgment becomes a judgment final when the period of appeal therefrom has terminated. <em>[Id. </em>at 73 n. 4],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">We conclude that all amendments to the Freeze Act were intended to effectuate purposeful and meaningful changes in the statutory content. See <em>Nagy v. Ford Motor Co., </em>6 <em>N.J. </em>341, 348 (1951); <em>Essex Co. Retail, etc. v. Newark, etc., Bev. Control, 11 N.J.Super. 10, 18 </em>(App.Div.1962). Clearly, the Legislature acted within the definitional framework provided during the preceding year by <em>Curtiss Wright Corp. v. Wood-Ridge, supra. </em>\u201cWhen words used in a statute have previously received judicial construction, the Legislature will be deemed to be using them in the sense that has been ascribed to them.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Posey, </em>89 <em>N.J.Super. </em>293, 301 (Cty.Ct.1965), aff\u2019d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>o.b. 92 <em>N.J.Super. </em>259 (App.Div.1966). Cf. <em>Cox v. Hruza, </em>54 <em>N.J.Super. </em>54, 61 (App.Div.1959). Further, it is \u201cassumed that the Legislature is thoroughly conversant with prior legislation and the iudicial construction placed thereon.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Posey, </em>89 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 302. Courts are obliged \u201cto give purposeful significance to words used by the legislature and if at all possible to give effect thereto.\u201d <em>Lanning v. Hudson County Court of Common Pleas, </em>127 <em>N.J.L. </em>10, 16 (Sup.Ct.1941), aff'd o.b. 127 <em>N.J.L. </em>604 (E. &amp; A.1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">By substituting the phrase \u201cfinal judgment\u201d for \u201cjudgment final,\u201d shortly after <em>Curtiss Wright, supra, </em>differentiated the terms so as to signify that a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d is one for which appellate review is still available, the Legislature could only have intended to provide relief under the Freeze Act regardless of whether the right to an appellate remedy had expired or had been exhausted. Accordingly, we find no error in the Tax Court\u2019s application of the Act to the years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">In this case, as in the companion cases also decided today, <em>Americana Associates v. Borough of Fort Lee, </em>A-593-84T7, and <em>Inganamort v. Borough of Fort Lee, </em>A-5649-83T7, the Tax Court also concluded that the property enjoyed an unquantified value for its condominium conversion potential independent of its value as an income producing asset. However, because the taxing district failed in its proof as to the quantum of potential conversion value the Tax Court entered judgments for 1977 through 1979 based upon capitalized income. Although higher than the determinations of value reached by the County Board of Taxation, obviously these were lower than if additional value for conversion potential had been allowed. Defendant argues that having found \u201cinherent conversion value\u201d the Tax Court should have affirmed the original municipal assessments, that the Tax Court erred in rejecting evidence of conversion value for tax years 1977 through 1979 and failed to make sufficient findings of fact. We are unper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>suaded by these contentions and affirm substantially for the reasons given by the Tax Court in its written opinion of June 28, 1984 and those expressed by us in the companion cases mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
