On motion of the prosecutor pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26, the Chancery Division\u2014Family Part waived jurisdiction and referred the complaint \u201cto the Prosecutor of Essex County and to the Criminal Part for further proceedings as an adult.\u201d R.L. filed a notice of appeal to this court, characterizing the waiver order as a \u201cfinal order.\u201d The State now moves to dismiss the appeal, urging that a waiver order is interlocutory and thus appealable only upon leave granted by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\"><em>R. </em>2:2-3(a)(l) permits appeals to be taken to this court \u201cas of right ... from final judgments of the Superior Court trial divisions\u201d; <em>R. </em>2:2-4 permits us to \u201cgrant leave to appeal, in the interest of justice, from an interlocutory order of a court.\u201d The narrow but important question presented is whether a juvenile waiver order is a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the meaning of <em>R. </em>2:2\u20143(a)(1) or whether it is an \u201cinterlocutory order\u201d within the meaning of <em>R. </em>2:2-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">The term \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as used in <em>R. </em>2:2-3(a)(l) and its predecessors has long and consistently been interpreted as meaning a judgment \u201cdisposing of all issues as to all parties.\u201d <em>Hudson v. Hudson, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>549, 553 (1962); <em>Nicholas v. Sugar Lo Co., </em>192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>444, 450 (App.Div.1983), certif. den. 96 <em>N.J. </em>284 (1984). That interpretation is designed to avoid piecemeal adjudication of controversies. <em>Hudson, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>at 552-53. Tested by that standard, an order transferring a prosecution from one division of the Superior Court to another can only be characterized as interlocutory, for it disposes only of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>threshold jurisdictional issue. <em>Cf. In re Old Colony Coal Co., </em>49 <em>N.J.Super. </em>117 (App.Div.1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">R.L. acknowledges that the waiver order \u201cdoes not finally dispose of the case.\u201d But he urges that it should be treated as \u201cfinal\u201d because it \u201cabsolutely disposes of his right to remain within the juvenile system and not be subject to criminal prosecution\u201d and that his \u201crights to be free from publicity and ... not to undergo the very process of a criminal trial\u201d would be \u201cirreparably lost\u201d if he is deprived of interlocutory review. Those considerations do not persuade us that the waiver order is appealable as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">We recognize that \u201cthe waiver of jurisdiction is a \u2018critically important\u2019 action determining vitally important statutory rights of the juvenile.\u201d <em>Kent v. United States, </em>383 <em>U.S. </em>541, 556, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1045, 1055, 16 L.Ed.2d 84 (1966). But neither the importance nor the immediate effect of the waiver order transforms it into a \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d Many critical determinations having immediate effect are made by interlocutory orders; yet our cases consistently hold them reviewable prior to final judgment only upon leave granted. <em>See, e.g., State v. Davis, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>611 (1984) (rejection of expert testimony in penalty phase of capital murder case reviewable prior to judgment only on leave granted); <em>State v. Leonardis, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>85 (1976), reh\u2019g 73 <em>N.J. </em>360 (1977) (defendant\u2019s rejection for pretrial intervention appealable prior to conviction only by leave); <em>Gloucester v. Pub. Emp. Rel. Comm., </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>333 (1970) (order of PERC certifying a negotiation unit or directing an election is interlocutory); <em>United Cannery Maintenance v. Local 80-A, </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>264 (1954) (order requiring witnesses to answer questions propounded at depositions appealable only by leave granted); <em>Kriegsman v. Kriegsman, </em>150 <em>N.J.Super. </em>474 (App.Div.1977) (order denying application to be relieved as attorney appealable only on leave granted). In a few narrowly circumscribed situations, the Supreme Court has permitted interlocutory orders to be appealed as of right, but it has done so through the adoption of rules specifically granting such rights of appeal. <em>See R. </em>4:42-2 (certifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>tion by trial judge that \u201cthere is no just reason for <em>delay\u201d)R. </em>5:8-6 (final custody order in bifurcated family action)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; <em>R. </em>5:10-6 (order entered on preliminary hearing in adoption action).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In support of his contrary contention, R.L. relies principally on <em>State v. Evangelista, </em>134 <em>N.J.Super. </em>64 (Law Div.1975), which held that juvenile waiver orders \u201cshould be considered final orders or judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68. We find the analysis in <em>Evangelista </em>unpersuasive. The trial judge there did not refer to, much less discuss, our court rules or case law governing appeals from interlocutory or final orders. Rather he relied upon what he found to be \u201cthe prevailing view in the country\u201d and his observation that \u201cNew Jersey courts have permitted direct appeal from referral hearings in the past,\u201d citing <em>State v. Loray, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>179 (1965), <em>State v. Tuddles, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>565 (1962) and <em>State v. Van Buren, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>548 (1958). <em>See also State in the interest of C.A.H. and B.A.R., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>326 (1982). It is not at all clear that the \u201cprevailing view\u201d is, or ever was, that waiver orders are immediately appealable as of right. <em>See </em>Note, \u201cReview of Improper Juvenile Transfer Hearings,\u201d 60 <em>Va.L.Rev. </em>818, 837 (1974); <em>D.H. v. People, </em>192 <em>Colo. </em>542, 561 <em>P.</em>2d 5 (Sup.Ct.1977); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal, </em>195 <em>Conn. </em>303, 488 A.2d 778 (Sup.Ct.1985); <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>351 So.2d 1142 (Fla.Ct.App.1977); <em>Buchanan v. Commonwealth, </em>652 S.<em>W.</em>2d 87 (Ky.Sup.Ct.1983); <em>Matter of Welfare of Lewis, </em>89 <em>Wash. </em>2d 113, 569 <em>P.2d </em>1158 (Sup.Ct.1977). In any event the case law of other jurisdictions is of little guidance because those holdings turn principally upon the varying provisions of local statutes. <em>See People v. Jiles, </em>43 Ill.2d 145, 251 N.E.2d 529 (Sup.Ct.1969). And we find no guidance at all from the fact that our Supreme Court has reviewed waiver orders prior to final judgment where the State apparently interposed no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>We are not insensitive to the difficulty which can result from deferring appellate review of a waiver order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">The principal advantage of immediate appeal is avoidance of the reconstructed waiver hearing, the proceeding necessary when an appellate court finds a defect in the original waiver hearing after the person waived is, because of the time consumed by the criminal trial, beyond the age jurisdiction of the juvenile court. The appellate court which upholds a waiver appeal must either free the improperly waived individual\u2014because neither juvenile nor criminal court has jurisdiction\u2014or reconstruct the waiver process to determine if a hearing free from error would have resulted in waiver. The reconstructed hearing must attempt to imagine the juvenile as he or she was at the time of the original hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-6\"><em>Institute of Judicial Administration and American Bar Association, Juvenile Justice Standards Relating to Transfer between Courts, </em>\u00a7 2.4 at 53 (1980). <em>See also </em>Note, <em>supra, </em>60 <em>Va.L.Rev. </em>at 836-38.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Those considerations, however, must be weighed against the public interest in the prosecution of criminal cases with all reasonable dispatch <em>(State v. Appice, </em>23 <em>N.J.Super. </em>522, 530 (App.Div.1952), aff\u2019d 13 <em>N.J. </em>286 (1953), <em>cert. </em>den. 346 <em>U.S. </em>939, 74 <em>S.Ct. </em>380, 98 <em>L.Ed. </em>427 (1954)) and in the avoidance of fragmented litigation. <em>Hudson, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>at 552-53. <em>R. </em>2:2-4 calls for such competing demands to be weighed on a case-by-case basis as \u201cthe interest of justice\u201d may indicate. There is no sound reason for us to circumvent that procedure, readily available on a <em>R. </em>2:2-4 motion, by denominating the waiver order as a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d appealable of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">We accordingly hold that a juvenile waiver order is an interlocutory order which may be appealed only by leave granted under <em>R. </em>2:2-4. The contrary holding of <em>State v. Evangelista </em>is overruled. The appeal is dismissed. Recognizing, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>that the improvident filing resulted from counsel\u2019s reasonable reliance on <em>Evangelista, </em>we grant leave to R.L. to file a motion for leave to appeal within 15 days following the issuance of this opinion. See <em>R. </em>2:8-1.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\"> Indiscriminate application of this rule has been criticized. <em>DiMarino v. Wishkin, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390 (App.Div.1984); <em>Delbridge v. Jann Holding Co., </em>164 <em>N.J.Super. </em>506 (App.Div.1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-8\"> R.L. also argues that the waiver order deprives him of the right to be incarcerated separate from adults pending trial and exposes him to publicity. But <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-36 a permits the court waiving jurisdiction to determine \u201cwhether to remand the juvenile to a juvenile or adult detention facility.\u201d And <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4A-60 d and g provide for public disclosure of juvenile adjudications and for public attendance at delinquency proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
