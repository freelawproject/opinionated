The insurance with respect to the vendor does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">(a) any express warranty, or any distribution or sale for a purpose, unauthorized by the named insured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">(b) bodily injury or property damage arising out of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">(i) any act of the vendor which changes the condition of the products,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">(ii) any failure to maintain the product in merchantable condition,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">(iii) any failure to make such inspections, adjustments, tests or servicing as the vendor has agreed to make or normally undertakes to make in the usual course of business, in connection with the distribution or sale of the products, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">(iv) products which after distribution or sale by the named insured have been labeled or relabeled or used as a container, part or ingredient of any other thing or substance by or for the vendor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">(c) bodily injury or property damage occurring within the vendor\u2019s premises.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">The operative facts of this case are not complex nor is there a material dispute as to any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">Absorbent sells a number of products to American including absorbent cotton which it first processes for absorbency and bleaches. The cotton is then carded and sold to American in the form of \u201cheader rolls,\u201d obviously a sale in bulk, contained in cases which are marked as to the number of rolls, size and weight of each roll and the weight of the entire case. American, under an agreement with its customer Shop Rite/Wakefern, a supermarket firm, then sterilizes the cotton, cuts it into smaller units, weighs them, wraps each unit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>separately places it in a box, the design and the labelling of which is developed by American and its customer for sale in supermarkets. The foregoing facts are confirmed by the deposition of an employee of American who testified that Absorbent sends American cotton in a \u201csemi-raw material state\u201d without \u201cany labelling whatsoever\u201d and the small packages produced by American and eventually intended to be sold to consumers bear labels as to which Absorbent had no input as to either design or content.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">On August 16, 1978, Denise Baran purchased a number of these cotton packages in a Shop-Rite supermarket and from them contrived a \u201ccostume\u201d by wrapping cotton around all of her body except her head. While in this unusual attire, apparently at some social affair, the cotton was ignited by a match or cigarette and Baran sustained severe burns. In some manner, her husband was also burned. They sued Absorbent, American and another company, which had manufactured the paper wrapping for the cotton, on strict liability and negligence grounds. An excerpt from the deposition of an expert intended to be used at trial by the Barans reveals that he viewed the cotton product purchased by Baran as highly flammable \u201cand for that reason ... defective unless the user of that cotton is instructed on how to use, how not to use.\u201d He opined that the product defect was a \u201c[pjackaging and labeling defect.\u201d The deposition of American\u2019s president, taken in the Baran suit, is of interest; he admitted that the flammability of cotton is a matter of common knowledge and that American needed no warnings from Absorbent on that subject. He also conceded that Absorbent had nothing to do with the packaging of the product sold to the Barans.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">When sued by the Barans, American demanded a defense and eventual indemnification from Continental under the vendor\u2019s endorsement. Continental disclaimed coverage on the ground of the endorsement\u2019s exclusions 1(b)(1), \u201cchange in the condition of the product,\u201d and l(b)(iv), \u201clabeled or relabeled ... by ... the vendor,\u201d but undertook defense of Absorbent, its named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>insured. American through its carrier, North American, investigated, defended and eventually settled .the Baran suit which was then dismissed as to the other defendants. The present suit was then instituted against Continental. Cross motions for summary judgment were decided adversely to Continental\u2019s coverage position and in a later hearing before the same judge it was determined that the amount paid by North River in behalf of American to the Barans was reasonable as was the amount of defense costs claimed. Accordingly, a judgment of $620,809 in favor of American and North River was entered. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">No reported New Jersey case has interpreted the vendor\u2019s endorsement here considered and it has received scant attention elsewhere. The trial judge noted that there were only two decisions construing a similar endorsement, <em>Mattocks v. Daylin, Inc., </em>452 <em>F.Supp. </em>512 (W.D.Pa.1978), aff\u2019d mem., 614 F.2d 770 (3rd Cir.1979) and <em>Sears, Roebuck and Co. v. Reliance Ins. Co., </em>654 <em>F.2d </em>494 (7th Cir.1981). Unlike the case at hand, neither of those cases involved a claim that the product defect was a failure to warn. As we shall later explain, we accept the reasoning applied in those cases but when applied to the facts of this case, that reasoning requires a finding that American was not covered by this vendor\u2019s endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The question here presented requires analysis of the intended purposes of a vendor\u2019s endorsement, viewing realistically its nature and its place not only in the commercial marketplace but within the world of insurance from which it springs. Although the question here involved is one of intended coverage, in such analysis the law of strict liability in tort as it affects the product chain from manufacturer to distributor to retailer and eventually to the ultimate consumer cannot be ignored because it illustrates the underlying reasons for the existence of the vendor\u2019s endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">When a manufacturer produces a product which contains a defect in design or one caused by faulty workmanship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>and it is sold to a distributor who in turn sells it to a retailer, the latter two links in the chain to the ultimate consumer ordinarily are merely conduits in the stream of commerce which ends at the ultimate consumer. The manufacturing or design defect, as to which they had no creative role, was in existence when each of them received the product and each is merely a nonculpable accessory in the eventual sale. Nevertheless, each, in that role, is strictly liable to the injured ultimate user. <em>Milchalko v. Cooke Color &amp; Chem. Corp., </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>386, 394 (1982); 2 <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 402A, comment f, at 350 (1965). This is so even where the product is one which is pre-packaged and is merely passed along to the consumer. <em>Newmark v. Gimbel\u2019s Inc., </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>585, 600-601 (1969). The nonculpable distributor or retailer is not, however, without remedy and has \u201can action over against the manufacturer who should bear the primary responsibility for putting the defective products in the stream of trade.\u201d <em>Newmark, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>at 600. It is in this complex of the facts of merchandising life and the imposition of strict liability at law that the vendor\u2019s endorsement has its natural role and serves specific purpose. Since, in the ordinary case, the liability trail eventually leads back to the manufacturer, and consequently to his insurer, it is a matter of common sense and fair dealing that the coverage of the manufacturer should be extended to the distributor and the insurance of the distributor in turn cover the retailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Thus, in the ordinary circumstances we have depicted, the risk of defense or indemnity loss being underwritten by extension of coverage to the vendor would appear to be not much greater than that already incurred by the existence of the basic coverage already available in the policy issued to the named insured. Although there is here no proof of the cost of premium for such extended coverage, it is a fair inference that that cost probably does not approach the premium charged for the basic products liability policy initially issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Moreover, it is obvious that the vendor\u2019s endorsement here considered is not a grant of the same kind of coverage Continental gave to its named insured. The vendor receives a more limited form of coverage which does not protect it against its own acts proximately related to the consumer\u2019s injury. In that respect the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that when American \u201cbought Absorbent\u2019s cotton it was also buying Absorbent\u2019s coverage,\u201d is without realistic basis. American had its own product liability coverage with North River. What it bought and what it received was what it had a right to expect\u2014a vendor\u2019s endorsement which was unambiguous in its provisions. Granted, this single sheet of paper, sent to American in the form of a \u201ccertificate of insurance,\u201d states that the \u201cPersons Insured\u201d provision of the underlying products policy \u201cis amended to include any ... organization (herein referred to as \u2018vendor\u2019), as an insured\u201d but the scope of such additional coverage is immediately, and in no uncertain terms, restricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The endorsement states that it only covers the vendor \u201cwith respect to the distribution or sale in the regular course of the vendor\u2019s business <em>of the named insured\u2019s products.\u201d </em>It provides that the \u201cinsurance <em>with respect to the vendor \u201d </em>does not apply to \u201cany express warranty, or any distribution or sale for a purpose unauthorized by the named insured.\u201d (emphasis ours). With respect to coverage for claims of bodily injury, it excludes coverage where that injury arises out of an \u201cact of the vendor\u201d which \u201cchanges the condition of the products,\u201d or \u201cany failure to maintain the product in merchantable condition.\u201d It also excludes coverage where the vendor fails \u201cto make such inspections, adjustments, tests or servicing as the vendor has agreed to make or normally undertakes to make in the usual course of business in connection with the distribution or sale of the products.\u201d These exclusions are not vague, each is directed to denial of coverage where some act of the vendor affects the product and thereby causes personal injury. This insurance is clearly designed to cover the vendor when he is only a conduit of the product in the stream of commerce but not when he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the instrumentality causing bodily injury to another. The labeling or relabeling provision is to the same effect. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">1. The insurance with respect to the vendor does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">(b) bodily injury ... arising out of ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">(iv) products which after distribution or sale by the named insured have been labeled or relabeled ... by or for the vendor____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">We perceive no ambiguity in this exclusion. It declares that there is no coverage for claims for \u201cbodily injury\u201d which arise \u201cout of\u201d products which after sale by the named insured \u201chave been labeled or relabeled ... by ... the vendor.\u201d The Barans\u2019 claims for bodily injuries were premised on a failure to warn defect in American\u2019s eventual product. That product was one reduced from the bulk raw material sold by Absorbent. It was rewrapped, repackaged and independently covered by a label of American\u2019s choosing, which lacked the allegedly necessary warning as to the inherent, and commonly known, flammable property of cotton. It clearly is excluded from Continental\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">In our view, the trial judge approached this case in less than realistic fashion. Where there was no genuine ambiguity he applied the principles that interpretations favoring coverage must always be adopted, <em>Kook v. American Sur. Co. of N.Y., </em>88 <em>N.J.Super. </em>43, 52 (App.Div.1965); that exclusions in insurance policies must be construed narrowly, and that all ambiguities must be resolved in favor of the insured. <em>Butler v. Bonner and Barnewell, Inc., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>567, 576 (1970). That approach overlooked the obvious fact that only \u201cgenuine ambiguities engage the so-called \u2018doctrine of ambiguity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Weedo v. Stone-E-Brick, Inc., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>233, 246 (1979). <em>Weedo </em>also instructs us that a genuine ambiguity arises only \u201cwhere the phrasing of the policy is so confusing that the average policyholder cannot make out the boundaries of coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247. That is not the case here and to find the necessary ambiguity the trial judge had to strain. He deemed the Baran claim of defect not as a claim based on a failure to properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>warn in the label chosen by American but rather as one of \u201cfailing to label.\u201d From this premise he concluded that since the exclusion only referred to labeling and to relabeling and did not exclude \u201cfailing to label,\u201d Continental \u201cdid not intend to include failing to warn among the exceptions to coverage.\u201d We must reject this skewed reasoning. Coverage was not afforded here because in reducing Absorbent\u2019s product to a size attractive to and useable by a consumer, American made a bulk product its own. In that process American also undertook to do what the coverage here excluded: it labeled the product as its own or that of its customer and, having made it available to ordinary consumers, failed to include in its label the warning the law requires. The product defect of which the Barans complained, upon which they rested the case, and as to which North River, as products liability carrier for American settled, was created by American at that point in the stream of commerce. That claim does not fall within the vendor\u2019s coverage extended by Continental\u2019s policy and provides no basis for the indemnity sought by North River through its subrogated right.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Unlike the trial judge, we do not find that the decisions in <em>Mattocks v. Daylin, Inc. </em>and <em>Sears, Roebuck and Co. v. Reliance Ins. Company </em>require a judgment for plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In <em>Mattocks, </em>Dan River Inc. manufactured fabric which Sullcraft Manufacturing Company tailored into pajamas for Daylin Inc. Daylin was sued by the Mattocks when a pair of such pajamas, purchased from Daylin by Charlotte Mattocks for the use of her son, Kevin, were ignited and burned Kevin while he was wearing them. Daylin sued Sullcraft as a third party defendant and Sullcraft sued Dan River. Sullcraft later brought a declaratory judgment action against the Insurance Company of North America (INA), the carrier for Dan River, claiming INA was obligated to defend Sullcraft and further to indemnify it, under a vendor\u2019s endorsement, in the event Sullcraft was held liable to Daylin.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>The trial against Daylin resulted in a jury verdict in Daylin\u2019s favor and Sullcraft moved its declaratory suit which was then reduced to a claim for defense costs and attorney\u2019s fees. The court in <em>Mattocks </em>specifically noted that it had \u201cno need to consider if Sullcraft is entitled to indemnification by INA.\u201d 452 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 513. The court held INA was obligated to defend Sullcraft under settled law, holding that the obligation to defend arises whenever the complaint filed by the injured party may <em>\u201cpotentially </em>come within the coverage of the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514. The Mattocks\u2019 underlying suit against Daylin apparently was one for strict liability, based upon allegations of a failure to add a flame retardant to the cotton flannelette fabric used in the pajamas, a failure in processing one would expect could readily be traced back to INA\u2019s insured, Dan River. The court noted that at the trial the Mattocks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">also proposed a theory of liability based on defendant\u2019s failure to warn (which was rejected by the court because of plaintiff\u2019s failure to lay the proper factual foundation) with respect to the non-flame retardant propensities of the pajamas. No claim was ever made that Sulleraft\u2019s physical changes of the Dan River material caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries. <em>[Id. </em>at 515J.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The vendor\u2019s endorsement in <em>Mattocks </em>contained exclusionary provisions similar to those presented here and INA claimed it was not obligated to defend Sullcraft because exclusion 1(b)(1) applied since Sullcraft \u201cintentionally\u201d made a \u201cphysical ... change in the form of the product\u201d and l(b)(iv) precluded coverage because, among other things, Sullcraft \u201clabeled\u201d the product sold to Daylin. These contentions were rejected by the court which held that each of these exclusions were qualified by the language of paragraph 1 which required that the excludable claim of body injury be one \u201carising out of\u201d the physical change in the form of the product or the labeling. With respect to the \u201cchange in form\u201d argument, the court held the change in form by the vendor must cause the plaintiff\u2019s injuries before the vendor is excluded from coverage under the endorsement. <em>Id. </em>at 515. The court also applied the \u201carising out of\u201d requirement of the exclusion to INA\u2019s contention that l(b)(iv), the labeling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>exclusion, barred coverage. It held that the labeling undertaken by Sullcraft (apparently application of the seller\u2019s trade mark) did not cause Kevin\u2019s injuries. In short, the <em>Mattocks </em>court held<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that there must be a causal nexus between the conduct of the vendor and the bodily injury before the labeling exclusion can be invoked. We have no dispute with these determinations. They represent a reasonable interpretation of the exclusionary clauses. When, however, they are applied to the factual complex presented to us, they call for an exclusion of plaintiffs\u2019 right to indemnification because the product defect here eventually and specifically asserted was that the label American used did not warn of the inherent flammability of cotton and that this failure caused the Barans\u2019 injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><em>Sears, Roebuck and Co. v. Reliance Ins. Co., </em>which contains facts similar to those in <em>Mattocks, </em>followed the reasoning applied in <em>Mattocks </em>and attained the same result except that the court there held the carriers who had issued vendor\u2019s endorsements to Sears, a retailer, had to both defend and indemnify Sears. So far as the right to indemnification is concerned, the <em>Sears </em>court, in that part of the decision pertinent to this case, held that the labeling exclusion, l(b)(iv), cannot serve to exclude coverage under the vendor\u2019s endorse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ment unless the claim of bodily injury \u201carises out of\u201d the labeling or relabeling of the product. 654 F.2d at 499. Thus, what we have said of the <em>Mattocks </em>decision applies as well to <em>Sears; </em>this case, when the general allegations of the complaint are pierced, presents the required nexus between the vendor\u2019s conduct and the bodily injury asserted by the Barans. Plaintiff\u2019s claim for indemnification for the sums paid to the Barans in settlement of their claims must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The foregoing conclusions. do not mean that plaintiffs must also be barred from recovery of some part of their investigative costs, defense costs and counsel fees. The complaint filed by the Barans consisted of eight counts and except for the fourth count, which asserted the product was marketed \u201cwithout notice or warning to the consuming public ... [of] its inherent propensity and danger,\u201d presented the usual mixture of very general product liability and negligence allegations common to such pleadings. These claims were not specific enough to reasonably give rise to a disclaimer. The complaint was apparently filed November 7, 1980 and, so far as the record before us is concerned, the demand for coverage under the vendor\u2019s endorsement was first made by letter on January 22, 1981. Subsequent requests by letter were made April 29 and June 29, 1981. Although there is a reference in Continental\u2019s reply of July 28, 1981 (a letter from Absorbent/Continental\u2019s attorneys to American/North River\u2019s attorneys) to \u201cour prior exchange of correspondence,\u201d we have no idea of the substance of that correspondence and what the true state of known facts may have been at that time as to American\u2019s involvement or the question of coverage. We only know that in a deposition of plaintiff\u2019s expert taken December 7, 1981 his opinion as to the product defect was narrowed down to a failure to warn.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">In this state the seminal case on the duty to defend is <em>Danek v. Hommer, </em>28 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68 (App.Div.1953), aff\u2019d o.b. 15 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>573 (1954). That case holds that \u201cthe duty to defend comes into being when the complaint states a claim constituting a risk insured against.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77. <em>Danek </em>also recognizes that which Judge Learned Hand stated in <em>Lee v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>178 <em>F.2d </em>750, 752 (2d Cir.1949) (that \u201cthe insurer ought to defend such an action at least until it appears that the claim is not covered by the policy is not free from doubt\u201d). The problem under such an approach is, of course, then made complex. The defending insurer is in a conflict with its own putative insured since it seeks to confine the facts to non-coverage. Moreover, without a reservation of rights agreement, a device which may not cure the conflict, a voluntary defense may give rise to a waiver of the exclusion or an estoppel if the insured can demonstrate prejudice. See the discussion in <em>American Handling Equip. v. T. C. Moffatt &amp; Co., </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>131, 139-142 (App.Div.1982). It may be that there are other factors which should be considered but we need not dwell upon the problem at length. The parties have not briefed the issues which attend the question of whether plaintiffs may recoup some part of the claimed expenses and counsel fees, and upon the facts in the record before us we are ill equipped to do so. It is sufficient for present purposes that we recognize that plaintiffs may have such a right and, in light of that possibility, that aspect of this case is not ripe for summary judgment or appellate decision. We remand this matter for whatever steps the parties may deem necessary to a resolution of that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">So far as the judgment entered in the Law Division holds there is coverage available to plaintiffs by reason of the vendor\u2019s endorsement and awards money damages to plaintiffs on that basis, it is reversed and vacated. The matter is remanded for such further proceedings, consistent with this opinion, as the parties may desire to undertake. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-15\"> Continental\u2019s brief refers to another and later form of endorsement with language which is different from that used in the above endorsement. North River and American point out that the policy in effect at the time in question contained the above endorsement. It is also apparent that the trial judge\u2019s opinion relied upon the wrong endorsement although both forms of endorsement were furnished to the judge. There is no dispute that the above endorsement is the one applicable to this case and we will therefore consider it in this decision. Both endorsements contained the exclusionary language of l(b)(iv), reproduced above, dealing with \"products which after distribution or sale by the named insured have been labeled or relabeled____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b414-5\"> The court\u2019s discussion of the effect of these exclusions appears to be <em>dicta. Mattocks </em>presented no claim for indemnification because of a settlement payment by the vendor. The single question was whether INA owed Sullcraft a defense and thus the question of whether coverage actually was provided was not implicated. The <em>Mattocks </em>court had already held that the very general allegations of the underlying complaint facially stated a claim which, when used against Sullcraft in Daylin's third party complaint, asserted a potential claim within the endorsement\u2019s coverage and that in such circumstances INA had to defend \"until it could confine plaintiffs claims to a recovery outside the policy coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515. In this connection <em>see Lee v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>178 <em>F.2d </em>750, 752-753 (2nd Cir.1949) and <em>Danek v. Hommer, </em>28 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68, 77-78 (App.Div.1953), aff'd o.b. 15 <em>N.J. </em>573 (1954).
