On order of the Court, the application is again considered. MCR 7.305(H)(1). In lieu of granting leave to appeal, we REMAND this case to the Court of Appeals to determine whether the defendants had a duty to warn the plaintiff of the condition.

In short, the defendants could satisfy their duty of care to a licensee like the plaintiff by warning of any conditions that a licensee would not have reason to know of and that posed an unreasonable risk of harm; beyond this duty to warn of certain conditions, the defendants had no affirmative duty to inspect the premises or to make the premises safe for licensees.

The defendants have also consistently presented another argument: that the particular condition complained of here-a single step in a dark room-was not a condition that a licensee would not know of or have reason to know of that posed an unreasonable risk of harm such that the defendants had a duty to warn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   If the defendants prevail on this claim, the trial court's ruling should be affirmed on this alternative basis. In other words, the panel should determine whether the defendants owed a duty to the plaintiff with respect to this particular condition regardless of whether the condition was open and obvious.

(concurring).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I concur in the Court's order remanding this case to the Court of Appeals to address the defendants' remaining summary disposition claims, which could provide an alternative basis for affirming the trial court ruling. I agree that questions of fact remain as to whether the particular condition-an 8-inch step in a dark room-was open and obvious, and that that question may not be material if the defendants had no duty to warn the plaintiff for the other reasons they have given.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I write briefly to respond to the dissent. A lot of the dissent's concerns may be addressed by the Court of Appeals in deciding the defendants' other claims within our traditional doctrinal framework. Indeed, settled doctrine provides an avenue to reach the same result as the dissent would have us reach today where the record so supports. But I want to clarify what I believe that inquiry should look like, and why I believe the dissent's alternative approach departs from well-established doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, the dissent relies mistakenly on principles of comparative negligence to define the scope of the defendants' duty to warn. I am sympathetic to the dissent's view that a social host should expect guests to behave prudently and should not be held liable for their negligence. And there is room for the dissent's underlying concerns to do work in a proper analysis of duty. The Restatement (Second) of Torts, which we adopted in\n   <em>\n    Preston\n   </em>\n   , provides that a possessor has a duty to warn of a condition if the condition \"involves an unreasonable risk of harm to ... licensees\" and the possessor \"\n   <em>\n    should expect that they\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    a licensee\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    will not discover or realize the danger\n   </em>\n   ....\" 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 342, p. 210 (emphasis added). This principle would support the dissent's contention\n   that \"[d]efendants had every right to expect that plaintiff was such a prudent person who would turn on the light and see the step, or at a minimum decline to walk into a darkened room without even the most cursory effort to determine whether it was safe to do so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   And yet, this element of the duty to licensees does not mean that a host has no duty whatsoever to warn a social guest about any condition in a dark room (no matter how dangerous) because the host is entitled as a matter of law to expect guests to take the affirmative step of turning on a light switch to discover hazards. To be sure, a reasonably prudent person, walking through a strange house, might turn on the light before entering a dark room. And when a guest fails to do so, that failure may very well be relevant to apportioning damages under comparative negligence principles. But it will not be a reason for a court to find as a matter of law that there is no duty to the guest at all, no matter what dangerous condition awaited her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Restatement contemplates that a licensee will discover \"conditions which are perceptible by his senses, or the existence of which can be inferred from facts within the licensee's knowledge.\" Restatement, \u00a7 342, comment\n   <em>\n    f\n   </em>\n   , p. 212. Some conditions in a dark room will be more predictable than others-for example, it might be a fact within the licensee's knowledge that \"mudrooms ... are [often] adjacent to garages\" and that \"garages are often themselves not level with the home\" (these \"facts\" seem to be within the dissent's knowledge, curiously). The Restatement's standard thus assigns the homeowner a duty commensurate with the hazard: a slipper on the floor in a dark mudroom is different than an open shark tank in that same dark room. I trust the Court of Appeals can evaluate based on the record where the 8-inch step falls on that continuum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The dissent, in contrast, would create some kind of strange per se rule: defendants as a matter of law do not owe a duty to warn licensees of any danger that lurks in a dark room if there is a light switch nearby. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this rule does not map onto any argument that the defendants made in this case, and it would constitute a new approach to premises doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under it, courts could decide for themselves as a legal matter that if a plaintiff appeared at all negligent (to a judge, unmoored from a factual record), she cannot recover and her suit is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Such a rule also would resurrect a judicial version of our long-dead contributory negligence regime under the camouflage of a duty analysis. But of course such an approach does not comport with the established understanding of negligence doctrine. The dissent owns its doctrinal contortion: \"Although\n   <em>\n    Brusseau\n   </em>\n   was decided on the basis of contributory negligence, I believe that it would today likely be resolved on the basis of duty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   But we judges are not authorized to apply contributory negligence principles by recasting them as duty. The Legislature has foreclosed that approach. Michigan, like most other jurisdictions, went from a contributory negligence jurisdiction\n   to a comparative fault jurisdiction decades ago-comparative fault was judicially adopted in 1979 in\n   <em>\n    Placek v. City of Sterling Heights\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1957162\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/405/638/\">\n    405 Mich. 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=275%20N.W.2d%20511\">\n    275 N.W.2d 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979), and the Legislature specifically adopted comparative fault with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1982%20PA%20147\">\n    1982 PA 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It was codified in its present form in 1995 in MCL 600.2959. The Legislature, by requiring that a plaintiff's recovery be reduced by the percentage of her own negligence, mandated that a plaintiff's negligence could not be used as a basis to dismiss a suit altogether.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And we have clearly held that the Legislature's adoption of comparative fault did not abrogate the common-law, status-based duties of care of premises possessors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Once a defendant's legal duty is established, the reasonableness of the defendant's conduct under that standard is generally a question for the jury.\n   <em>\n    The jury\n   </em>\n   must decide whether the defendant breached the legal duty owed to the plaintiff, that the defendant's breach was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries, and thus, that the defendant is negligent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Conversely, comparative negligence is an affirmative defense. Michigan adopted this standard to promulgate a \"fair system of apportionment of damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Under this doctrine, a defendant may present evidence of a plaintiff's negligence in order to reduce liability\n   </em>\n   .

It is fundamental tort law that before a defendant can be found to have been negligent, it must first be determined that the defendant owed a legal duty to the plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In short, we must operate under the comparative fault regime the Legislature imposed. Comparative fault is a rule of decision for damages. It does not define the contours of the defendant's legal duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, while the dissent does not cite much of the evidence from the deposition testimony, a court considering a motion under MCR 2.116(C)(10) is obligated to evaluate it. The dissent proceeds as if a number of facts are undisputed. For example, the dissent states that \"there is nothing to suggest that defendants had reason to expect that plaintiff would not in a timely manner discover the step.\" But the plaintiff\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   suggested a few reasons: the plaintiff testified in her deposition that the floor of the mudroom appeared level with the wood floor of the hallway; Endia Simmons testified that if she had been the one to enter the mudroom first, she would have fallen, because there was no way to tell any height differential existed; Ebony Whisenant also testified that the floor looked level between the two rooms; and photographs show that the dark floor could\n   make the step difficult to see, even with adequate light.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, even if evidence clearly weighs in favor of the party seeking summary disposition, it is not the role of courts to weigh evidence in a motion brought under MCR 2.116(C)(10). Instead, a court must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and determine if reasonable minds could differ in resolving the evidence.

Just different litigation. Rather than litigating the dangerousness of the condition on the land, the parties instead will wage a war of light-switch litigation. We could look forward to adjudicating questions about where the light switch was, whether it was easily findable, and what a licensee should have to do to find it. And it begins to look like an affirmative duty to ensure that there is an accessible and working light switch. So much for relief for property owners.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Michigan is (mostly) a pure comparative negligence jurisdiction. That is, even if a plaintiff is 99% at fault, she can still recover 1% damages. The one exception to this is for noneconomic damages-like compensation for pain and suffering, emotional distress, or loss of enjoyment-which are barred whenever the plaintiff is more at fault than anyone else. MCL 600.2959 (\"If that person's percentage of fault is greater than the aggregate fault of the other person or persons, whether or not parties to the action, the court shall reduce economic damages by the percentage of comparative fault ... and noneconomic damages shall not be awarded.\")\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    There are also questions of fact that would be relevant if the dissent's no-duty-if-there-is-a-light-switch rule prevailed: whether the plaintiff would have known which light switch corresponded with the mudroom, how obvious that switch was, whether she should have flipped it. And so on.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    While unimportant to resolving this case, I am puzzled by the dissent's view that the open and obvious danger doctrine is only relevant to invitees. I do not follow this doctrinal move. I am aware of no authority that limits the work that the open and obvious danger doctrine can do in the way the dissent views it. We have never held that the open and obvious danger doctrine is limited to invitees. Indeed, the Court of Appeals has routinely applied the doctrine to licensees, and we have not intervened. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Pippin v. Atallah\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"233546\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/245/136/#p143\">\n     245 Mich.

A danger that is open and obvious will always be one a landowner should expect that a licensee should discover.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The Restatement explicitly incorporates the open and obvious danger doctrine as a limit on liability to invitees, who would otherwise be entitled to expect greater protection from the landowner. Comment\n    <em>\n     a\n    </em>\n    to \u00a7 343 instructs that \u00a7 343 \"should be read together with \u00a7 343 A, which deals with the effect of the fact that the condition is known to the invitee, or is obvious to him .... That Section limits the liability here stated.\" And Comment\n    <em>\n     b\n    </em>\n    to Restatement \u00a7 343 offers a detailed explanation of the distinction between the duty owed to licensees and invitees. It concludes:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n    As stated in \u00a7 342, the possessor is under no duty to protect the licensee against dangers of which the licensee knows or has reason to know. On the other hand, as stated in \u00a7 343 A, there are some situations in which there is a duty to protect an invitee against even known dangers, where the possessor should anticipate harm to the invitee notwithstanding such knowledge. [Restatement, \u00a7 343, p 217.]\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Our court's version of this carve out of the open and obvious danger defense for invitees is the special aspects doctrine. As in the Restatement's treatment, there is no reason that the special aspects carve out for invitees should apply to licensees-a possessor owes a licensee nothing more than a duty to warn, and an open and obvious danger comes as its own warning. The work that the open and obvious danger doctrine can do for both classes of visitors is apples to apples: there is no duty to warn\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    visitor of open or obvious dangers. But the extent of residual duty is oranges. Invitees must still be protected from certain known dangers; but a licensee who encounters an open and obvious danger has received the only protection to which he is entitled under our doctrine-a warning.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    I agree with amicus curiae the Michigan Manufacturers Association-a landowner has a duty to warn of dangers she should not expect a licensee to discover, but \"[a]ny duty to warn does not apply to dangers that are open and obvious ....\" The existence of an open and obvious danger\n    <em>\n     itself\n    </em>\n    warns guests of a potential hazard. Thus, if a danger is open and obvious, a property owner has no duty to fix it (for invitees) or to warn about it (for licensees). In my view, property owners should be able to rely on the open and obvious danger doctrine no matter who is visiting.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-36\">\n   Markman, C.J.

She then lost her balance and fell, injuring herself, when she set foot into the room, which was about 8 inches lower than the hallway. Can defendants be held liable in premises liability for plaintiff's injuries? I think not and believe this to be a long-settled matter of common law in this state. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from this Court's order remanding to the Court of Appeals to address the issue of duty because I would instead conclude today that defendants owed no duty. Thus, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court's grant of summary disposition in favor of defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   I. FACTS AND HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff Susan Blackwell attended a December 2013 party at the home of defendants Dean and Debra Franchi. When plaintiff arrived, she was allegedly told by the latter that she could place her purse in a small room to the left, described as the \"mudroom\" by the parties. There was no light on in the mudroom, and according to plaintiff, the hallway that adjoined the mudroom was \"dimly lit.\" However, there was a light switch immediately next to the entrance. There was an 8-inch step creating a drop-off into the mudroom. Plaintiff, however, in the belief that the mudroom was level with the hallway, walked directly into the mudroom, lost her balance and fell, suffering injuries. Plaintiff had made no effort to turn on the light beforehand or otherwise to check to be certain that it was safe to enter the mudroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff sued defendants on the basis of premises liability, alleging that defendants breached the duty owed to her as an invitee by failing to \"inspect for hazards, dangers and improper conditions of the premises\"; \"warn[,] advise and instruct persons regarding potentially dangerous conditions on the premises\"; and \"provide safe, proper and adequate access and egress to the Plaintiff and others similarly situated[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants moved for summary disposition, and the trial court, Oakland Circuit Court Judge Colleen O'Brien, granted their motion, concluding at the outset that plaintiff was a licensee and not an invitee. The court then concluded that even if plaintiff was an invitee, defendants were still entitled to summary disposition because \"reasonable minds could not differ that the alleged condition here was open and obvious. Moreover, there are no special aspects.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff appealed, arguing that she was instead an invitee and that the step was not open and obvious because the hallway floor and the mudroom floor appeared to be level under the lighting conditions confronted. According to plaintiff, defendants were negligent by failing to provide adequate lighting or to warn her that there was a step down into the mudroom. The\n   Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in an opinion authored by Judge SHAPIRO .\n   <em>\n    Blackwell v.

Furthermore, while the step was allegedly concealed by darkness, there is nothing to suggest that defendants had reason to expect that plaintiff would not in a timely manner discover the step. There was a door-sized entrance point separating the hallway from the mudroom and common sense suggests that where two discrete areas of a home are separated by such an entranceway, it is a reasonable possibility that the floor levels may well be different.

Therefore, my conclusion is not only compelled by common sense, but as a result it is also consistent with our common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   A contrary conclusion creating a\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   obligation to warn social guests concerning the pitfalls of walking into dark rooms would hardly define the full extent of our decision. Instead, countless other legal obligations, limited only by the creativity and innovativeness of the bench and bar, would certainly be imposed upon homeowners. Would a host in directing a guest to her bathroom be legally obligated to provide a detailed warning, or otherwise supply a map of the bathroom, to the effect that a failure to turn on the light might cause the guest to run into a sink or bathtub? Would a host be legally obligated to explain to a guest why it is a poor idea to place her hand upon a stove being used to prepare dinner? And would a host be legally obligated to apprise guests of the assorted and sundry risks of dealing with cutlery, throw rugs, fireplaces, spilled drinks, stairways, and rickety chairs? If not, why are\n   <em>\n    those\n   </em>\n   legal obligations any different from the legal obligation to warn a guest about the risks of blindly confronting a darkened room?\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is in the nature of the common law that it\n   <em>\n    reflect\n   </em>\n   social customs and practices and not\n   <em>\n    lead\n   </em>\n   society in new directions\n   that might be favored by the court. Having been presented in this case with nothing that would suggest an evolution or transformation in the customs and practices of the people concerning the social host/social guest relationship, I would be content to maintain and preserve the present common law of this state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   I would reiterate today the principle of our common law that a social host may not be held liable for injuries suffered by a social guest from an allegedly dangerous condition of the land when the host had no reason to expect that the guest would reasonably fail to discover the condition. That is, hosts are not required to monitor or surveil their guests to ensure that they do not suffer injury from commonplace household conditions, conditions to which the hosts and their families themselves are ordinarily and routinely subject. Here, plaintiff was injured when she stepped into the darkened mudroom without turning on the light or otherwise ascertaining that it was safe to enter. In my judgment, the law should not hold defendants liable when they had no reason to expect that plaintiff-or any other guest-would fail to exercise their own reasonable precautions. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court's grant of summary disposition in favor of defendants. Because this Court fails to do so today and instead remands to the Court of Appeals to address the issue of duty-the very issue that we instructed the parties to address in our order nearly nine months ago-I respectfully dissent. I would not further delay a decision by this Court, if it is ever now to come, by requiring the parties to traverse the appellate process a second time in what I view as a matter involving the straightforward application of the settled common law of this state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Zahra and Wilder, JJ., join the statement of Markman, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Plaintiff also brought a claim on the basis of private nuisance, a claim dismissed by the trial court and not at issue here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Judge K.
