The application for leave to appeal the January 16, 2018 judgment of the Court of Appeals and the application for leave to appeal as cross-appellant are considered, and they are DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should now be reviewed by this Court.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
