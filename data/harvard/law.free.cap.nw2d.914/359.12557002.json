On order of the Court, leave to appeal having been denied in\n   <em>\n    Jendrusina\n   </em>\n   on January 12, 2018,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=501%20Mich.%20958\">\n    501 Mich. 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=905%20N.W.2d%20231\">\n    905 N.W.2d 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), the application is again considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the question presented should be reviewed by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <author id=\"p-7\">\n   Markman, C.J. (dissenting).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I respectfully dissent from this Court's order denying leave to appeal and instead would grant leave. This case was held in abeyance pending a decision in\n   <em>\n    Jendrusina v. Mishra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20Mich.%20987\">\n    500 Mich. 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=894%20N.W.2d%20547\">\n    894 N.W.2d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), which involved the application of the \"discovery rule\" set forth in MCL 600.5838a(2) (\"[A]n action involving a claim based on medical malpractice may be commenced at any time within the applicable period prescribed in section 5805 or sections 5851 to 5856, or within 6 months after the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the existence of the claim, whichever is later.\"). Although this Court in a divided decision voted to deny leave to appeal in\n   <em>\n    Jendrusina\n   </em>\n   , I continue to believe that the Court of Appeals seriously misapplied the discovery rule in that case. See\n   <em>\n    Jendrusina v. Mishra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=501%20Mich.%20958\">\n    501 Mich. 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=905%20N.W.2d%20231\">\n    905 N.W.2d 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) ( MARKMAN , C.J., dissenting). In my judgment, granting leave to appeal in this case would afford us the opportunity to thoroughly assess the proper contours of the discovery rule. For these reasons, I would grant leave to further consider and delineate the proper application of the discovery rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Zahra and Wilder, JJ., join the statement of Markman, C.J.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
