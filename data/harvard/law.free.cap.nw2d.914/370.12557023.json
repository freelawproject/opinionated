We further find that the plaintiff is a vexatious litigator under MCR 7.316(C)(3). We direct the Clerk of this Court not to accept any further filings from plaintiff in any matter against the Attorney Grievance Commission without the filing fee required by MCR 7.319.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
