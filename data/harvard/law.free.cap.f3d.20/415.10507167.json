Oliver appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in classifying his prior conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the relevant guideline provision, and in triple-counting his prior robbery conviction in determining-his current offense, his criminal history and his offense level. We hold that possession of a firearm by a convicted felon does not constitute a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning of section 4B1.4, and therefore remand this case for resentencing in light of this opinion. With respect to Oliver\u2019s claim of \u201ctriple-counting,\u201d we conclude that the district court committed no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-19\">Oliver, a convicted felon, was indicted on August 28,1992, for two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(g)(1), and one count of making a false statement in connection with the acquisition of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6). These charges arose from two separate incidents in which Oliver pawned several revolvers to a federally licensed firearms dealer. A jury found him guilty on all counts on November 3,1992. Following a sentencing hearing, the district court adopted the sentencing calculation set forth in the presentence investigation report, and found that Oliver was an armed career criminal pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4. The court determined that \u201cthe three violent felony convictions that cause him to qualify for that treatment would be the 1979 possession of a pistol as a convicted felon, the 1980 carnal knowledge conviction and the 1980 robbery conviction.\u201d The court further suggested that \u201cthose are by no means the extent of [Oliver\u2019s] prior convictions but those are the three that I am focusing on for the purposes of the armed career offender classification.\u201d Oliver was sentenced to 276 months of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-21\">Oliver\u2019s principal contention is that the district court erred in construing his 1980 conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon as one of the three prior convictions necessary to subject him to the mandatory-minimum sentence reserved for armed career criminals. Under the Guidelines, \u201c[a] defendant who is subject to an enhanced sentence under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) is an armed career criminal.\u201d U.S.S.G. 4B1.4(a). The referenced statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-22\">In the case of a person who violates section 922(g)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of this title and has three previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>convictions ... for a violent felony ... such person shall be fined not more than $25,000 and imprisoned not less than 15 years....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The primary question raised by Oliver on appeal requires this court to resolve whether possession of a firearm by a convicted felon is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"A2P4\">Section 924(e) defines a violent felony as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOX\">\u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment of a term exceeding one year, or any act of juvenile delinquency involving the use or carrying of a firearm, knife or destructive device that would be punishable by imprisonment by such term if committed by an adult, that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Those few courts that have addressed the meaning of \u201cviolent felony\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 924(e) as encompassed by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 have looked to the language of a corollary guideline provision for career offenders, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Garcia-Cruz, </em>978 F.2d 537 (9th Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 2453, 124 L.Ed.2d 669 (1993); <em>United States v. Doe, </em>960 F.2d 221 (1st Cir.1992). A \u201ccareer offender\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.1 is defined by, <em>inter alia, </em>the commission of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The definition of \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 4B1.2, is similar to \u201cviolent felony\u201d in \u00a7 924(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2, however, specifically excludes the unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon from the purview of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as that term is defined by the guideline<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, an interpretation to which this court is bound. <em>See Stinson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (\u201c[C]om-mentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d) No like provision exists in the statutory definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-17\">The application note following \u00a7 4B1.4 explicitly states that \u201c[t]he definitio[n] of \u201cviolent felony\u201d ... in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) ... [is] not identical to the definitio[n] of \u2018crime of violence\u2019 .... used in \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d It is important to note that the phrases \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and \u201cviolent felony,\u201d as employed in the guidelines and in \u00a7 924(e) respectively, are distinctly worded terms of art that, while apparently similar, are not interchangeable. Section 924(e), for instance, is far broader in scope than \u00a7 4B1.1, and explicitly encompasses within its reach the commission of any juvenile offense that would constitute a felony if committed by an adult. Language pertaining to juvenile convictions is notably absent from the text of either \u00a7 4B1.1 or its definitional section, \u00a7 4B1.2. Nonetheless, we conclude that the two expressions are not conceptually distinguishable for purposes of the narrow question raised in this appeal. The only language in either \u00a7 4B1.2 or \u00a7 924(e) that might implicate the level of violence involved in the possession of a firearm is that which proscribes \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d As stated previously, courts interpreting \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2, prior to the commentary that binds courts on this issue, almost uniformly held that possession of a firearm by a convicted felon does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>rise to the level - of conduct presenting a serious potential risk of physical injury, and thus cannot be construed as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, </em>953 F.2d 110, 115 (4th Cir.1991) (\u201cWhile a felon in possession of a firearm may pose a statistical danger to society, we refuse to interpret this statistical threat as evidence of specific intent on the part of an individual defendant. We hold, therefore, that the offense, felon in possession of a firearm, in the absence of any aggravating circumstances charged in the indictment, does not constitute a <em>per se </em>\u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2.\u201d); <em>United States v. Chapple, </em>942 F.2d 439, 442 (7th Cir.1991) (\u201c[T]he threat posed by simple possession of a weapon, without more, does not rise to the level of an act that \u2018by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>United States v. Fitzhugh, </em>954 F.2d 253, 255 (5th Cir.1992) (\u201c[T]he specific offense of unlawful possession of a firearm simply\u2019 does not constitute a \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 \u201d) This reasoning was again implemented by the Sentencing Commission in its November, 1992 amendments to the commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2. Precisely the same analytical framework applied by the courts in ascertaining the scope of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d logically obtains with respect to the question of what kind of conduct comprises a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d It is reasonable to suggest that conduct which does not pose a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2 similarly cannot pose such a risk with respect to \u00a7 924(e) and \u00a7 4B1.4. <em>See also, United States v. Bell, </em>966 F.2d 703, 705 (1st Cir.1992) (\u201cAlthough this appeal involves a sentence enhanced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 rather than U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, we believe that the two guideline provisions must be construed <em>in pari passu </em>... \u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">By the same token, settled principles of statutory construction require us to interpret the provision in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) regarding conduct presenting a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury\u201d in light of the language that precedes it, specifically enumerating \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion, [or] use of explosives\u201d as descriptive of violent felonies. These \u2018 offenses each manifest affirmative, overt and active conduct in which the danger posed to others extends beyond the mere possession of a weapon, and is far more threatening in an immediate sense. Most significantly, the statute requires that the <em>use </em>\u2014 rather than possession \u2014 of explosives gives rise to a potential violent felony. It is unlikely that in enacting \u00a7 924(e), Congress intended that the possession of a firearm be deemed a violent felony, while the possession of explosives would not be so categorized. We therefore conclude that possession of a firearm by a convicted felon does not constitute a .\u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 924(e), and thus cannot be considered a predicate prior conviction for purposes of sentence enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">We note that at sentencing, the district court found that Oliver had other prior convictions, but did not articulate whether these convictions might also be violent felonies and thus serve to enhance Oliver\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 4B1.4. Because we can neither discern nor infer which convictions the court may have intended to include in its description of Oliver\u2019s criminal history, we decline to adopt the government\u2019s claim of harmless error. Instead, we remand this ease for resentencing in light of our determination that possession of a firearm by a felon is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as that term is set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Oliver also argues that because his 1980 robbery conviction was used as the basis for the instant offense as well as in the calculation of his offense level and criminal history, the sentencing court erred in \u201ctriple-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>counting\u201d this conviction. We state, without further comment, that this circuit previously has held that double or triple-counting a single offense for entirely distinct purposes under the Guidelines is permissible. <em>See United States v. Wyckoff, </em>918 F.2d 925 (11th Cir.1990). We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in counting Oliver\u2019s 1980 robbery conviction when determining one of the predicate offenses giving rise to his status as an \u201carmed career criminal,\u201d and in calculating his offense level and his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we REMAND this case to the district court with directions to vacate the sentence imposed and to resen-tence Oliver in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-15\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) makes it unlawful for any person</p>\n<p id=\"b480-24\">(1) who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; ...</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-12\">.

The government's suggestion that the conduct giving rise to Oliver\u2019s 1980 conviction for possession of a firearm included pointing a pistol at another individual, thereby making this conduct tantamount to a violent felony, is unavailing. The Supreme Court has expressly held that in analyzing whether an offense is a \"violent felony\" pursuant to \u00a7 924(e), we must employ \"a formal categorical approach, looking only to the statutory definitions of the prior offense, and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.\" <em>Taylor v.
