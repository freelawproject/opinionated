At the <em>Spears</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing conducted by the magistrate judge, Lewis testified that prison officials took him to the jail\u2019s clinic where a prison doctor reopened a nearly-healed wound on his left arm with a scalpel, scraped the wound to remove blood and tissue, and then stitched up the wound. Lewis also testified that he believed the samples were taken for use against him in his pending state-court trial for capital murder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to Lewis, he suffered pain and was left with only limited movement in the arm as a result of the surgical intrusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-16\">During the <em>Spears </em>hearing, the magistrate judge stated that she was going to continue the case because of her concern that further hearing of this claim might prejudice Lewis\u2019 rights in his pending criminal proceeding. Nevertheless, the <em>Spears </em>hearing proceeded at which time Lewis alleged additional claims for unconstitutional grievance procedures and retaliation. The magistrate judge then ordered Lewis to file an amended complaint in an attempt to get a more thorough understanding of the nature of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-17\">Lewis filed an amended complaint in which he reiterated his claim of the alleged unlawful taking of blood and tissue samples and asserted additional assorted violations of his constitutional rights. The magistrate judge issued a report recommending that the lawsuit be stayed until after the conclusion of Lewis\u2019 criminal trial in order to avoid \u201cunwarranted interference with the pending state court proceedings.\u201d The district court overruled Lewis\u2019s objections and, adopting the findings and conclusions of the magistrate judge, placed Lewis\u2019 suit on the inactive docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-18\">\n<em>OPINION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b188-19\">Lewis challenges the district court\u2019s decision to stay his \u00a7 1983 suit until the conclusion of his state criminal proceedings. For purposes of appellate jurisdiction, the district court\u2019s decision to stay a suit pending state court proceedings is a final order. <em>Barnhardt Marine Ins., Inc. v. New England Inter. Surety of America, Inc., </em>961 F.2d 529, 531 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-20\">At the <em>Spears </em>hearing, it became apparent that Lewis\u2019 \u00a7 1983 damages action involved questions likely to be at issue in his pending state criminal prosecution. The magistrate judge recognized that the adjudication of Lewis\u2019 claim that blood and tissue samples were seized contrary to the Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Amendment\u2019s prohibition against brutality, <em>see Rochin v. California, </em>342 U.S. 165, 172, 174, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952), could interfere with the progress of the state proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 45, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), holds that a federal court cannot interfere with a pending state criminal proceeding absent extraordinary circumstances. This Court has held that the <em>Younger </em>abstention doctrine is not applicable to a claim for damages. <em>See Allen v. Louisiana State Bd. of Dentistry, </em>835 F.2d 100, 104 (5th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 112 S.Ct. 1764, 118 L.Ed.2d 426 (1992). In <em>Deakins v. Monaghan, </em>484 U.S. 193, 202, 108 S.Ct. 523, 98 L.Ed.2d 529 (1988), the Supreme Court declined to decide the extent to which <em>Younger </em>applies to a federal action for monetary damages. However, the Court held that, even when <em>Younger </em>abstention is required, a federal district court \u201chas no discretion to dismiss rather than to stay claims for monetary relief that cannot be redressed in the [pending] state proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Lewis\u2019 ease was not dismissed, only stayed. He makes no argument that staying his civil rights suit pending his criminal trial will prejudice him in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Lewis\u2019 amended complaint clearly states a damage claim under \u00a7 1983 sufficient to justify the retention of jurisdiction. <em>See Rochin. </em>Because Lewis\u2019 claim for monetary relief will not be addressed in the pending state criminal prosecution, it was appropriate for the district court to stay his \u00a7 1983 action pending the conclusion of the state court proceedings. <em>See Ballard v. Wilson, </em>856 F.2d 1568, 1572 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">AFFIKMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-13\">. <em>Spears v.
