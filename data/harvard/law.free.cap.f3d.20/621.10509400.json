We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">Jernigan was arrested in September 1990 after purchasing 175 pounds of marihuana from undercover agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration. He was indicted for conspiracy to possess marihuana with intent to distribute, entered a plea of not guilty, and his trial was scheduled for November 19, 1990. Jernigan moved for and was given four continuances, variously citing counsel\u2019s scheduling conflicts and seeking time to pursue plea negotiations or psychological testing, and it was not until March 12, 1993 that his jury trial finally commenced after his fifth request for a continuance was denied. Convicted and sentenced to 63 months imprisonment and a period of supervised release, Jernigan timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-19\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b686-20\">Jernigan\u2019s primary assignment of error on appeal is the alleged deprivation of both statutory and constitutional rights to a speedy trial. By statute, a criminal defendant must be brought to trial within 70 countable days of his indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Jernigan did not move for dismissal on this ground in the district court we do not address same.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-21\">Jemigan\u2019s claim of sixth amendment delay is resolved by considering four factors: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) when the defendant asserted his right; and (4) any prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While a pretrial span of nearly three years raises an inference of tainting delay,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the instant case the remaining factors militate against finding a constitutional violation. The delays were attributable primarily to Jernigan\u2019s multiple requests for continuances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is to be noted that Jernigan did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>complain of any delay prior to this appeal. Further, as to prejudice,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Jernigan alleges that a belated psychiatric examination by the government\u2019s expert prevented the jury from understanding his mental state at the time of the crime. At trial, however, Jernigan offered testimony from two expert witnesses who examined him in 1990. On this record, the complained-of delay caused no possible prejudice. Application of the four-factor <em>Garcia/Barker </em>test discloses no sixth amendment violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Jernigan\u2019s second assignment of error alleges ineffective assistance based upon counsel\u2019s failure to have his two psychiatrists testify in person at a competency hearing. To establish a claim for ineffective assistance Jernigan must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance was outside a broad range of reasonable conduct and, but for counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, the result of the competency hearing likely would have been different.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Unlike in <em>Hull v. </em>Freeman,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> where counsel allowed the testimony of the government\u2019s expert to go unchallenged, counsel herein offered the reports of the two defense psychiatrists and aggressively cross-examined the government\u2019s expert. Further, having heard the evidence on Jernigan\u2019s state of mind, the jury rejected his defense of diminished capacity. We are not persuaded that on these facts it is likely that there would have been a different outcome had Jernigan\u2019s psychiatrists been present in person for the competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Jernigan\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-15\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1).
