The government has filed a \u201cMotion for Summary Disposition,\u201d arguing that the petitioners\u2019 case presents no substantial question. We will grant the government\u2019s motion, which we will treat as a motion for summary action, and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The petitioners are citizens of Indonesia. In 2003, the Department of Homeland Security charged them with being removable under section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), as aliens who were present in the United States in violation of law. The petitioners conceded that they were removable as charged. However, they applied for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They claimed that they had been persecuted and feared future persecution due to their Christianity and Chinese ethnicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">On May 2, 2005, an Immigration Judge (IJ) denied all relief to petitioners. The IJ concluded that they had neither suffered past persecution nor showed that they were likely to be persecuted in the future. As to the claim of future persecution, the IJ ruled that they had failed to establish either that they would be individually singled out for persecution or that there is a pattern or practice in Indonesia of persecuting Christians of Chinese background. Accordingly, the IJ denied their withholding-of-removal claim. The IJ concluded that the petitioners were not entitled to CAT relief because they had not shown that they would be tortured in Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The petitioners then appealed to the BIA, which dismissed the appeal on July 25, 2007, for essentially the reasons set forth in the IJ\u2019s decision. They filed a petition for review in this Court, which the Court denied. <em>See Wongso v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>283 Fed.Appx. 918 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">In September 2010, petitioners filed the motion that is at issue here \u2014 a motion to reopen. In support of the motion, the petitioners presented six news articles and the 2009 Department of State Human Rights Report for Indonesia. They claimed that these documents showed that the country conditions in Indonesia had changed for the worse. Based on this new evidence, they argued, they were entitled to withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">The BIA denied the motion to reopen. It held that the petitioners\u2019 evidence was cumulative of the evidence that they had previously presented and did not establish their prima facie eligibility for relief. The petitioners then filed a petition for review in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 to review the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen. Where the BIA denies a motion to reopen for failure to establish a. prima facie case, the Court will review the BIA\u2019s ultimate decision for abuse of discretion and its underlying findings of fact for substantial evidence. <em>See Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 174 (3d Cir.2002); <em>see also INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 105, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). To make a prima facie showing, \u201cthe alien must produce objective evidence that, when considered together with the evidence of record, shows a reasonable likelihood that he is entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Huang v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>620 F.3d 372, 389 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">In their brief, the petitioners argue that the BIA \u201cdid not consider the additional materials and new evidence\u201d that they submitted. We disagree. While the agency did not expound, at length, on the new material, it did both acknowledge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>submissions and explain why, in aggregate, they were lacking. The BIA need not \u201cwrite an exegesis\u201d on every contention; rather, its \u201canalysis merely must be adequate to allow for meaningful review of [its] decision.\u201d <em>Toussaint v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>455 F.3d 409, 414 (8d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). The BIA\u2019s analysis here comports with that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">On the merits, we conclude the BIA did not err in determining that the petitioners failed to establish their prima facie eligibility for relief. Contrary to the petitioners\u2019 arguments, the 2009 State Department Report does not help their cause. <em>Cf. Wong v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>539 F.3d 225, 234 (3d Cir.2008) (noting that \u201cmore recent State Department reports from 2005 to 2007 document similar or improved treatment of Chinese Christians in Indonesia\u201d since 2004). Rather, as the government points out, the report states that Indonesia\u2019s government \u201cgenerally respected\u201d Indonesians\u2019 constitutional right \u201cto worship according to his or her own religion or belief.\u201d Further, although the petitioners\u2019 articles establish that isolated attacks against Christians in Indonesia have continued, these scattered articles do not show that there is a reasonable likelihood that the petitioners are entitled to withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>See Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 537 (3d Cir.2005) (explaining that applicant seeking relief due to pattern or practice of persecution must establish \u201csystemic, pervasive, or organized\u201d persecution (internal quotations omitted)); <em>Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 187-88 (3d Cir.2003) (explaining that to prevail on CAT claim, the applicant must establish \u201cthat it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see generally Zubeda v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 463, 477-78 (3d Cir.2003). Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Accordingly, we grant the government\u2019s motion for summary action and will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-8\">. The petitioners originally submitted, but then withdrew, an application for asylum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
