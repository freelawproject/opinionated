In this appeal, Bec-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>eerra-Morales argues that his sentence is improper because he did not admit that his prior deportation occurred subsequent to his conviction for a drug-trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">We review this claim for plain error only due to Beccerra-Morales\u2019s failure to present it to the district court. <em>United States v. Rojas-Luna, </em>522 F.3d 502, 504 (5th Cir.2008). An error is plain if it was clear or obvious and affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Our review of the record, Beccerra-Morales\u2019s arguments, and pertinent authority shows that he has not met this standard. Instead, the record shows sufficient support for the district court\u2019s sentencing decision. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>Rojas-Luna, </em>522 F.3d at 504-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">This appeal is not frivolous and, although we conclude that the judgment should be affirmed without further briefing, summary affirmance is not appropriate. <em>See United States v. Holy Land Found. for Relief &amp; Dev., </em>445 F.3d 771, 781 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, we affirm the judgment of the district court and deny the Government\u2019s motion for summary af-firmance or, alternatively, for an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
