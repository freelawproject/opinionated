After review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-24\">Torres-Serrano\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (explaining a sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court properly calculated the Guidelines range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and adequately explained the chosen sentence). First, there is no dispute that the district court properly calculated the Guidelines range. Further, the district court stated that it considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. This statement provides sufficient explanation as to why it chose the sentence that it imposed. The court need not address each \u00a7 3553(a) fae<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>tor. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201cRather, an acknowledgment by the district judge that he or she has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted). Although the court placed specific emphasis on Torres-Serrano\u2019s previous illegal entries in to the United States, the record indicates it did not do so to the detriment of all other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1292 (11th Cir.2006) (holding a sentence was unreasonable when the district court focused \u201csingle-mindedly\u201d on the goal of restitution to the detriment of all other sentencing factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Torres-Serrano\u2019s sentence is also substantively reasonable. The court\u2019s sentence of 15 months for Counts 1-3 represented the lowest end of the applicable Guidelines range of 15-21 months, and this Court would ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (stating although we do not automatically presume a sentence falling within the Guidelines range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable). The district court had discretion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A to either issue a consecutive or concurrent sentence for Counts 1-3, and chose to impose a consecutive sentence. The court expressed concern regarding Torres-Serrano\u2019s past contacts with law enforcement at the border and his past false claims of various nationalities. Considering Torres-Serrano\u2019s history, a custodial sentence within the Guidelines range was appropriate to promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, and deter him from further criminal activity. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The sentence was supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the court did not commit a clear error of judgment in weighing those factors. <em>See Unites States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (stating this Court reverses only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case\u201d). Thus, we conclude Torres-Serrano\u2019s sentence was procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-17\">. Torres-Serrano was given 15-month concurrent sentences for making a false statement in an application for a United States Passport, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1542 (Count 1); impersonating a citizen of the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911 (Count 2); and misusing a social security number, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408 (Count 3). He was also given a statutory mandatory 24-month sentence for aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) (Count 4). The district court made the 15-month sentences concurrent to the 24-month sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b906-26\">.
