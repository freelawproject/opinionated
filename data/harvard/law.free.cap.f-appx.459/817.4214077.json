Brown complained of adverse employment actions when OCSB, his former employer, suspended him twice without pay and then failed to renew his employment contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Brown argues that: (1) the district court erred in finding that he failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination because he could not identify a similarly situated employee; (2) the district court erred in determining that his right to free speech was not violated because, when he complained to OCSB\u2019s Employee Relations Department about OCSB\u2019s hazardous material practices, he was not speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern. Each of these issues is addressed separately below.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Weeks v. Harden Mfg. Corp., </em>291 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is proper if the evidence shows \u201cthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). The movant bears the burden of establishing the absence of a dispute over a material fact. <em>Reynolds v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., </em>989 F.2d 465, 469 (11th Cir.1993). The evidence and factual inferences from the evidence are construed favorably- to the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">I. Racial Discrimination Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">Brown argues that summary judgment was inappropriate as to his discrimination claims under Title VII and \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 because there was an issue of material fact as to whether two of his fellow employees were valid comparators, as they had the same job title, and all three were involved with misconduct regarding the handling of hazardous materials at OCSB facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">Title VII makes it illegal for an employer \u201cto discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race.... \u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, all citizens shall have the same right to \u201cmake and enforce contracts\u201d without the impediment of racial discrimination. Claims against state actors under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>\u00a7 1981 must be brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Butts v. Cnty. of Volusia, </em>222 F.3d 891, 892 (11th Cir.2000). Title VII and \u00a7 1981 have the same requirements of proof and utilize the same analytical framework. <em>Brown v. Amer. Honda Motor Co., </em>939 F.2d 946, 949 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Under Title VII, a plaintiff bears \u201cthe ultimate burden of proving discriminatory treatment by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 975 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A plaintiff may establish a claim of illegal disparate treatment through either direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 975-76. Where, as here, a party seeks to establish discrimination through circumstantial evidence, we evaluate the claim under the framework set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See id. </em>Under this framework, the plaintiff bears the threshold burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir.2004). The elements of a <em>prima facie </em>case and the manner of establishing those elements are not fixed, but will vary depending on the situation. <em>Id. </em>In general, a plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of race discrimination by showing that: (1) he is a member of a racial minority; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; (3) the employer treated similarly situated employees outside his racial minority more favorably; and (4) he was qualified for his employment. <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">\u201cEvidence that similarly situated employees are disciplined more leniently is admissible to support a disparate treatment claim when the plaintiff has established that the co-employees are in fact similarly situated.\u201d <em>Anderson v. WBMG-42, </em>253 F.3d 561, 564 (11th Cir.2001). To be an adequate comparator, the preferentially treated individual from outside plaintiffs protected class must be similarly situated to the plaintiff in all relevant respects. <em>Holifield, </em>115 F.3d at 1562. If this is not the case, \u201cthe different application of workplace rules does not constitute illegal discrimination.\u201d <em>Lathem v. Dep\u2019t of Children &amp; Youth Servs., </em>172 F.3d 786, 793 (11th Cir.1999). We have stated that \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is not whether the employees hold the same job titles, but whether the employer subjected them to different employment policies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When an individual proves that he suffered an adverse employment action while his comparator did not, although they both violated the same work rule, \u201cthis raises an inference that the rule was discrimina-torily applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In addition, we require \u201cthat the quantity and quality of the comparator\u2019s misconduct be nearly identical to prevent courts from second-guessing employers\u2019 reasonable decisions and confusing apples with oranges.\u201d <em>Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Here, we conclude from the record that the district court correctly determined that Brown could not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination because he could not identify a similarly situated employee. OCSB provided evidence establishing that Brown had a different area of responsibility from those employees he sought to establish as comparators. Moreover, OCSB provided evidence to establish that Brown suffered adverse employment action due to an investigation into his area of responsibility. Employees with different areas of responsibility were not similarly situated to Brown in \u201call relevant respects,\u201d <em>see Holifield, </em>115 F.3d at 1562, and their conduct cannot be considered \u201cnearly identical\u201d to that of Brown, <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number><em>Maniccia, </em>171 F.3d at 1368. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment with respect to Brown\u2019s claims of racial discrimination under Title VII and \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">II. First Amendment claim</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Next, Brown argues that the district court erred in concluding that OCSB did not violate his First Amendment right to free speech. Specifically, Brown argues that he spoke in his capacity as a citizen involving a matter of public concern: the deliberate mishandling of hazardous materials on public school campuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The government may not discharge an employee on a basis that infringes the employee\u2019s constitutionally protected speech interest. <em>Bryson v. City of Waycross, </em>888 F.2d 1562, 1565 (11th Cir.1989). However, a public employee\u2019s speech is entitled to protection only when the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern. <em>Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. 410, 418, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 1958, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006). Claims by a public employee alleging retaliation in violation of the First Amendment can be raised pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See, e.g., Randall v. Scott, </em>610 F.3d 701, 703 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">We have applied a multi-stage analysis to cases involving a public employee\u2019s free speech rights. <em>Brochu v. City of Riviera Beach, </em>304 F.3d 1144, 1157 (11th Cir.2002). First, we examine \u201cwhether the employee\u2019s speech may be \u2018fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Rankin v. McPherson, </em>483 U.S. 378, 384, 107 S.Ct. 2891, 2897, 97 L.Ed.2d 315 (1987)). This involves analyzing the content, form, and context of the speech. <em>Brochu, </em>304 F.3d at 1157. If this requirement is met, we then apply a balancing test, weighing the interests of the employee against the interests of the public employer. <em>Id. </em>The first two steps are questions of law. The inquiry ends here unless the first two steps are satisfied. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">In order to determine whether the speech is on a matter of public concern, we must determine whether the speech was made primarily in the employee\u2019s role as a citizen or as an employee. <em>Battle v. Bd. of Regents for Ga., </em>468 F.3d 755, 760 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). When a public employee speaks pursuant to his \u201cofficial duties,\u201d the employee is not speaking as a citizen, and the speech will not be protected by the First Amendment. <em>Id. </em>The practical inquiry asks whether the speech \u201cowes its existence to [the] employee\u2019s professional responsibilities.\u201d <em>Abdur-Rahman v. Walker, </em>567 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Garcetti, </em>547 U.S. at 421, 126 S.Ct. at 1960). Relevant, but nondis-positive factors in this inquiry include an employee\u2019s job description, whether the speech occurred at the workplace, and whether the speech concerns the subject matter of the employee\u2019s job. <em>Abdur-Rahman, </em>567 F.3d at 1282-83. We have not previously allowed employees to obtain constitutional protection for statements that owe their existence to the employee\u2019s performance of his official responsibilities, even if he was not required to make the speech as a part of his official duties. <em>Id. </em>at 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">Here, we conclude from the record that the district court did not err in determining that Brown\u2019s speech at issue was not protected by the First Amendment. Brown\u2019s speech concerned the storage and handling of hazardous materials and dangers encountered during the performance of his job and within his job responsibilities. In addition, Brown\u2019s speech occurred in the workplace, through OCSB\u2019s Employee Relations Department, rather than in a public- forum, another fact indicating that he was not speaking as a citizen on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>matter of public concern. Because Brown cannot establish that he was speaking on a matter of public concern, the inquiry ends here. <em>See Brochu, </em>304 F.3d at 1157. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s determination that OCSB did not violate Brown\u2019s First Amendment right to free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of OCSB.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-8\">. While Brown also complained initially that his white co-workers received better treatment, in that they were given offices and access to county vehicles, because he does not raise these claims on appeal, he has abandoned them. <em>See Greenberg v. BellSouth Tele-comms., Inc., </em>498 F.3d 1258, 1259 n. 1 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (holding that, because the plaintiff did not object to the district court\u2019s disposition of his Rehabilitation Act claim on appeal, the claim had been abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
