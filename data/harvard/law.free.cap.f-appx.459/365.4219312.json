He also moves for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) to challenge his conviction of capital rape and sexual battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-19\">This court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion if necessary, <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987), and we may consider the basis of the district court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>if necessary, <em>EEOC v. Agro Distrib., LLC, </em>555 F.3d 462, 467 (5th Cir.2009). On June 3, 2011, we vacated the first order dismissing Hill\u2019s application as time-barred because the district judge presiding over the \u00a7 2254 proceeding was also the state court judge who had denied Hill\u2019s first state application for postconviction relief. We directed the district court to assign Hill\u2019s case to another district judge. <em>Hill v. Mississippi, </em>427 Fed.Appx. 317 (5th Cir.2011). The mandate in <em>Hill </em>issued on June 27, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-24\">The June 6 dismissal of Hill\u2019s application as time-barred was the result of the district court\u2019s grant of a motion for reconsideration of the initial dismissal order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). Because the mandate had not issued for our June 3 opinion, that opinion was not final, <em>see United States v. Jackson, </em>549 F.3d 963, 980 (5th Cir.2008), and the district court lacked jurisdiction to grant Hill\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion, <em>see Shepherd v. Int'l Paper Co., </em>372 F.3d 326, 329 (5th Cir.2004). Because the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the Rule 60(b) motion, it also lacked jurisdiction to dismiss the ha-beas application as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-25\">The COA and IFP motions are GRANTED. The judgment is VACATED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with our June 3, 2011, opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
