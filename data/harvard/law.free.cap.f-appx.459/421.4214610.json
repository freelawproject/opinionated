Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 734 (5th Cir.1998). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Rhine challenges the dismissal of her libel and slander claims. Therefore, her invasion-of-privacy and constitutional claims (added to original complaint, based on diversity jurisdiction) are abandoned. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">The libel and slander claims concern a 4 October 2009 article published online by a San Antonio, Texas, newspaper. Rhine alleged: she did not read it until 18 March 2010; and, she was not allowed access to her legal materials from 18 June 2010 to 8 October 2010. This action was filed in December 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Texas\u2019 one-year statute of limitations was properly applied to Rhine\u2019s libel and slander claims (state-law; diversity jurisdiction claimed). <em>See Huss v. Gayden, </em>571 F.3d 442, 449-50 (5th Cir.2009); Tex. Civ. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.002(a). As the allegedly libelous and slanderous communications were published, and thus publicly available, the discovery rule was not applicable. <em>Kelley v. Rinkle, </em>532 S.W.2d 947, 949 (Tex.1976). And, Rhine was not entitled to equitable tolling on the claimed basis that she had little or no access to necessary materials for several months in prison. <em>Bailey v. Gardner, </em>154 S.W.3d 917, 920 (Tex.App.2005). As such, the statute of limitations bars these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b448-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
