Fuller pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, and he was sentenced to 33 months in prison. In his Rule 60(b) motion, Fuller argued that his federal sentence should run concurrently with a state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-18\">By moving for IFP, Fuller is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202-03 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Probable success on the merits is not required. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-23\">As federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, Fuller must have statutory authority for the filing of his motion. <em>Veldhoen v. United States Coast Guard, </em>35 F.3d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1994). Fuller\u2019s motion was not properly brought pursuant to Rule 60(b) as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply to criminal cases. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>169 F.3d 281, 289 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-24\">Although 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) allows a district court to modify a sentence under certain narrow circumstances, none of those circumstances are applicable to Fuller\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c). Fuller also is precluded from obtaining relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, as relief thereunder is reserved only for direct appeals. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3742.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-25\">The district court could have construed the motion as arising under \u00a7 2255, but it did not do so, and any error by the district court is harmless. Fuller\u2019s challenge to his sentence is not cognizable in a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Faubion, </em>19 F.3d 226, 232-33 (5th Cir.1994). Fuller\u2019s motion on it face was therefore unauthorized, and the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain it. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-26\">Fuller has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Fuller\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Because his appeal is frivolous, <em>see Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20, his appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
