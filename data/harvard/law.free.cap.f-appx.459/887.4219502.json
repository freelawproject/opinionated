On appeal, she argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying her motion to withdraw her guilty plea, and that the district court erred in sentencing her pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-14\">On appeal, Duval argues that the district court erred in denying her motion to set aside her guilty plea because the record shows that she entered her plea without knowledge of the nature of the charges against her or the possible sentences she could receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brehm, </em>442 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2006). The district court does not abuse its discretion unless its decision is arbitrary or unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>We consider four factors when reviewing the district court\u2019s decision: (1) whether close assistance of counsel was available; (2) whether the plea was knowing and voluntary; (3) the conservation of judicial resources; and (4) prejudice to the government if the defendant were allowed to withdraw her plea. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-16\">Here, Duval has challenged only whether the plea was knowing and voluntary. A guilty plea is knowing and voluntary if the defendant entered the plea without coercion and with the understanding of the nature of the charges and the consequences of the plea. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>586 F.3d 1342, 1346 (11th Cir.2009). There is a strong presumption that the statements made during the plea colloquy are true. <em>United States v. Medlock, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>12 F.3d 185, 187 (11th Cir.1994). The defendant bears a heavy burden to show statements made under oath at a plea colloquy were false. <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>848 F.2d 166, 168 (11th Cir.1988). It is up to the district court to determine the defendant\u2019s credibility and the weight of a defendant\u2019s assertions in support of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea. <em>Brehm, </em>442 F.3d at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">At an extensive plea colloquy, Duval indicated that she had not received any threats, that she was fully satisfied with her attorney\u2019s work, that she understood the charges against her (including four previous felonies that would enhance her punishment under the ACCA), that she had read and signed the plea agreement, that the judge was not bound by any government recommendations, that she understood her waiver of appeal, that she was giving up her trial rights, and that she was facing a minimum of fifteen years in prison with a maximum of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Duval has not demonstrated that her guilty plea was either unknowing or involuntary, particularly in light of the heavy burden she would need to shoulder in order to prove that her statements made under oath at the plea hearing were false. The record reflects that Duval was on notice of the nature and circumstances of the charges against her, the rights that she was foregoing, and the potential minimum and maximum sentences. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying her motion to withdraw her guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Duval also argues that the district court erred in sentencing her pursuant to the ACCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Duval challenges the dates of the predicate convictions used to impose the ACCA enhancement, arguing that the government failed to meet its burden of showing that her crimes arose out of separate and distinct criminal episodes.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">Whether prior convictions meet the ACCA\u2019s separate offenses requirement is a legal determination that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Pope, </em>132 F.3d 684, 689 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">The ACCA imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment for defendants who have three previous convictions \u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). We have held that under \u00a7 924(e)\u2019s different-occasions inquiry, a sentencing court must determine whether \u201cthe perpetrator had a meaningful opportunity to desist his activity before committing the second offense.\u201d <em>Pope, </em>132 F.3d at 690. In making this determination, a \u201cshowing that the crimes reflect distinct aggressions, especially if the defendant committed the crimes in different places, is particularly probative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">The findings of fact of the sentencing court may be based on evidence heard during trial, facts admitted by a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty, undisputed statements in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), or evidence presented at the sentencing hearing. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>884 F.2d 1355, 1356 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">Here, the PSI indicates that on September 2, 1992, Duval was arrested for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>sale of rock cocaine and on December 21, 1992, she was convicted in Manatee County; on February 11, 1995, she was arrested for robbery of a J.C. Penney store and on February 26, 1996, she was convicted<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in Pinellas County; and on July 7, 1995, she was arrested for sale of cocaine and on April 1,1996, she was convicted in Pinellas County. These dates of conviction are confirmed by Duval\u2019s signed plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The PSI and Duval\u2019s prior admissions support the district court\u2019s finding that these convictions arose out of separate criminal episodes. Thus, there was no error in the court\u2019s determination that Duval had three prior violent felony or serious drug convictions for the purposes of the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Duval also contends that the prosecutor failed to conform with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-6\">No person who stands convicted of an offense <em>under this part </em>shall be sentenced to increased punishment by reason of one or more prior convictions, unless before ... entry of a plea of guilty, the United States attorney files an information with the court (and serves a copy of such information on the person or counsel for the person) stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1) (emphasis added). However, Duval was not prosecuted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, which deals with controlled substances. She was prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), which is the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-9\">. Duval\u2019s plea agreement contains a waiver of her right to appeal her sentence except on the grounds that (a) the sentence exceeds the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range, (b) the sentence exceeds the statutory maximum penalty, or (c) the sentence violates the Eighth Amendment. The government concedes that the waiver does not bar her instant appeal, so we proceed to address the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b916-10\">. Duval contends that this conviction was vacated, but the PSI confirms that the sentence \u2014 not the conviction \u2014 was vacated, and Duval was then re-sentenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
