Wayne Johnson, Texas prisoner # 282756, filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application challenging his 2009 disciplinary conviction of possessing contraband. He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of the second motion for a preliminary injunction he filed in conjunction with that application.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-23\">Interlocutory orders denying preliminary injunctions are immediately appeal-able as an exception to the final-judgment rule. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1); <em>Lakedreams v. Taylor, </em>932 F.2d 1103, 1107 (5th Cir.1991). However, during the pendency of Johnson\u2019s appeal, the district court entered a final judgment dismissing Johnson\u2019s underlying habeas claims. Those claims included a request for permanent injunctive relief. The entry of a final judgment regarding permanent injunctive relief renders any order regarding temporary injunctive relief moot. <em>Louisiana World Exposition, Inc. v. Logue, </em>746 F.2d 1033, 1038 (5th Cir.1984). This court lacks jurisdiction to decide moot questions or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>issues that cannot affect the rights of the parties before it. <em>McRae v. Hogan, </em>576 F.2d 615, 617 (5th Cir.1978). Accordingly, Johnson\u2019s appeal, which challenges only the denial of preliminary injunctive relief, is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. Johnson\u2019s incorporated motion to expedite his appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
