He was sentenced as a career offender to a 188-month term of imprisonment and to a four-year period of supervised release. Dean contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the Government breached its plea agreement with him because the probation officer determined his base offense level on the basis of the career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and not under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, as the parties had stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">We review a claim of breach of a plea agreement de novo. <em>United States v. Pizzolato, </em>655 F.3d 403, 409 (5th Cir.2011). Applying general principles of contract law, we must determine whether the Government\u2019s conduct is consistent with the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding of the agreement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">By its terms, the plea agreement did not bind the probation officer or the district court, and Dean was admonished at the rearraignment that the stipulation was not binding on the district court. Dean\u2019s contrary understanding was not reasonable. <em>See </em>id.; <em>see also United States v. Talbert, </em>501 F.3d 449, 453 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201c[T]he United States Probation Office is a branch of the federal judiciary and \u2018an investigatory and supervisory arm\u2019 of the sentencing court.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>United States v. Woods, </em>907 F.2d 1540, 1543-44 (5th Cir.1990). The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal, based on Dean\u2019s appeal waiver, or for summary affirmance or an extension of time to file its brief is DENIED. <em>See United States v. Roberts, </em>624 F.3d 241, 244 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
