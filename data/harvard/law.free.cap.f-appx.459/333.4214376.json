(collectively, \u201cAshbritt\u201d) for breach of contract. The district court, finding J.G.T.\u2019s corporate status suspended at the time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>complaint was filed, granted Ashbritt\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action without prejudice. The district court also awarded attorney\u2019s fees to Ash-britt. J.G.T. now appeals the fee award. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The parties\u2019 contract provided the basis for fee shifting: \u201cIn any dispute, the prevailing part [sic] shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.... \u201d J.G.T. alleged that, because there had been no adjudication on the merits, Ash-britt could not be a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the contract. The district court responded that, under Florida law, adjudication on the merits is not a precondition to prevailing party status, and entered an order granting Ashbritt $58,826.16 in fees and costs. <em>See Prescott v. Anthony, </em>803 So.2d 835, 836 (Fla.2d Dist.Ct.App.2001) (\u201cThe general rule is that when a plaintiff voluntarily dismisses an action, the defendant is the prevailing party.\u201d). On appeal, J.G.T. attempts to distinguish <em>Prescott </em>on the grounds that the dismissal in the instant case was involuntary rather than voluntary. For the following reasons, this distinction does not undermine the district court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Although Ashbritt does not direct us to precedent holding precisely that grant of summary judgment and involuntary dismissal without prejudice results in \u201cprevailing party\u201d status under a contract, Florida case law compels this conclusion. First, the district court\u2019s conclusion is well-settled that adjudication on the merits is not necessary for \u201cprevailing party\u201d status. <em>See, e.g., Alhambra Homeowners Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Asad, </em>943 So.2d 316, 318 (Fla. 4th Dist.Ct.App.2006) (\u201cThe general rule is that when a plaintiff voluntarily dismisses an action, the defendant is the \u2018prevailing party\u2019 within the meaning of statutory or contractual provisions awarding attorney\u2019s-fees to the \u2018prevailing party\u2019 in litigation.\u201d). Second, Florida courts grant \u201cprevailing party\u201d status based on various other types of involuntary dismissals. <em>See Baratta v. Valley Oak Homeowners Ass\u2019n, </em>891 So.2d 1063, 1064-65 (Fla.2d Dist.Ct.App.2004) (dismissal for failure to prosecute); <em>Mardan Kitchen Cabinets, Inc. v. Bruns, </em>312 So.2d 769, 770 (Fla.3d Dist.Ct.App.1975) (dismissal for lack of jurisdiction); <em>Point East Four Condominium Corp., Inc. v. Zevuloni &amp; </em>Assocs., <em>Inc., </em>50 So.3d 687, 688 (Fla. 4th Dist.Ct.App.2010) (dismissal for failure to state a claim); <em>Valcarel v. Chase Bank USA NA, </em>54 So.3d 989, 991 (Fla. 4th Dist.Ct.App.2010) (dismissal for attorney misconduct). Lastly, Florida courts do not distinguish on the basis of voluntariness where fee shifting is statutory. <em>Nudel v. Flagstar Bank, FSB, </em>60 So.3d 1163, 1165 (Fla. 4th Dist.Ct.App.2011) (\u201cFor the purpose of determining a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 under section 57.105(7), we see no reason to distinguish between a voluntary dismissal without prejudice and a court\u2019s involuntary dismissal without prejudice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The district court was correct to award fees to Ashbritt as a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d Its judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
