The substance of their argument is that Da Silva was persecuted in Guinea-Bissau and Argentina, and therefore they contend that they are eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-20\">Where the BIA issues a decision, we review that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision because the BIA issued its own decision and did not expressly adopt the opinion of the IJ. \u201cWe review questions of law <em>de novo, </em>with appropriate deference to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the [INA].\u201d <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2003) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We follow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>BIA\u2019s interpretation of what constitutes a particular social group under the INA unless the interpretation is unreasonable. <em>See Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1196 (11th Cir.2006). An interpretation is unreasonable if it is arbitrary, capricious, or clearly contrary to law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\">Asylum is only available to applicants who prove that they are a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of the INA. <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1006 (11th Cir.2008) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A)). To qualify as a refugee, an alien must show, with specific and credible evidence, past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Persecution is not defined in the INA, but it is \u201can extreme concept,\u201d requiring more than mere harassment. <em>De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1008. In assessing past persecution, we consider all the evidence of mistreatment as a whole, and are \u201crequired to consider the cumulative impact of the mistreatment the petitioners suffered.\u201d <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1258 (11th Cir.2007). Evidence showing that someone is merely a victim of criminal activity does not establish persecution based on a statutorily protected ground. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Mere threats also do not constitute persecution. <em>See Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1237 (11th Cir.2006) (finding that a threatening note and phone calls, without more, were harassment, not persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">A showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257 (citing 8 C.F.R \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)). Even if the applicant fails to demonstrate past persecution, she may still qualify for asylum based upon proof of a well-founded fear of future persecution, which may be demonstrated by a subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable fear of persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257. An applicant can establish a well-founded fear of future persecution by presenting \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution\u201d on account of a protected ground. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Persecution on account of membership in a particular social group means \u201cpersecution that is directed toward an individual who is a member of a group of persons all of whom share a common, immutable characteristic ... [that] is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u201d <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 233 (BIA 1985), <em>overruled on other grounds as recognized by Matter of Mogharrabi, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 439 (BIA 1987). Furthermore, the group must have sufficient social visibility and should not be defined so broadly that it becomes \u201ca catch-all for all groups who might claim persecution.\u201d <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1197. The group must not be so numerous or inchoate as to render it too broad and diverse to be sufficiently particularized. <em>Id. </em>at 1198 (noting the need for a unifying relationship or characteristic to narrow a diverse and disconnected group).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">Concerning Guinea-Bissau, the Petitioners argue that they established their eligibility for asylum based upon persecution Da Silva suffered on account of her membership in two particular social groups: \u201cwomen in Guinea-Bissau\u201d and \u201cfamily.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>Da Silva says that when she was a young girl her adopted brother and his military Mends sexually abused and raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">As an initial matter, the BIA and IJ found Da Silva to be, on the whole, credible. But even if the sexual abuse she suffered in Guinea-Bissau amounted to persecution, the Petitioners nevertheless have failed to show that the abuse was inflicted on account of a protected ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">First, as to the Petitioners\u2019 argument that Da Silva\u2019s persecution was based on her membership in the purported social group \u201cfamily,\u201d the argument was not exhausted before the BIA, and we therefore lack jurisdiction to address it. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (providing that a petitioner must have exhausted all available administrative remedies); <em>see also Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (holding that we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">Second, regarding the Petitioners\u2019 argument that Da Silva\u2019s persecution was because of her membership in the group \u201cwomen in Guinea-Bissau,\u201d we hold that the BIA\u2019s decision in this case is a reasonable application of the principles set forth in <em>Acosta </em>and <em>Castillo-Arias. </em>The BIA determined that \u201cwomen\u201d was too broad to constitute a particular social group. We agree that such a group is too numerous and broadly defined to be considered a \u201csocial group\u201d under the INA. <em>See Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1198. Therefore, the Petitioners have not established past persecution in Guinea-Bissau on account of a membership in a specific group.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">We also agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the Petitioners did not directly demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution in Guinea-Bissau. There is no evidence that anyone from Guinea-Bissau has tried to find Da Silva after she left the country. Although there is evidence that the military and its members periodically abuse their position of power, there is no evidence that the military targets any particular group of persons. Therefore, the Petitioners\u2019 fear is not objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">Concerning Argentina, the Petitioners contend that Da Silva was persecuted based on her race and her membership in the social group \u201cwomen in interracial marriages.\u201d The Petitioners also argue that the BIA erred by not discussing David\u2019s suffering. Lastly, the Petitioners request asylum based on humanitarian concerns, including Da Silva\u2019s HIV-positive status.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">The BIA did not err when it did not discuss how David\u2019s suffering affected his mother\u2019s qualification for asylum. In general, \u201cpersecution, or the fear thereof, must be personally endured by the applicant.\u201d <em>See Yu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">We are not compelled to reverse the findings of the BIA that the Petitioners failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution if returned to Argentina. Even assuming that Da Silva\u2019s troubles occurred on account of a protected ground, the alleged incidents \u2014 viewed cumulatively \u2014 do not rise to the level of persecution. Da Silva was not physically harmed in the majority of instances. And when she was physically injured, substantial evidence supports the conclusion that the injury arose from a personal conflict\u2014 not persecution on account of a protected ground. Although the Petitioners assert that racism and xenophobia are rampant in Argentina, the 2010 State Department\u2019s Human Rights Report does not indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>that black or dark skinned individuals are targeted for persecution. Rather, that report shows that Argentinian law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race or gender, and the country generally enforces these prohibitions. <em>See Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1175 (11th Cir.2008). Additionally, although Da Silva is concerned about returning to Argentina because she is HIV positive, she has not provided evidence that she will be denied access to all medications or that she will be persecuted because of her disease. Considering that all inferences from Petitioners\u2019 evidence are drawn in favor of the BIA, <em>Djonda, </em>514 F.3d at 1175, Petitioners\u2019 fear is not objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The Petitioners have failed to establish their eligibility for asylum from Guinea-Bissau or Argentina, so they have, by extension, failed to satisfy the more stringent burden for withholding of removal. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4. Moreover, Ricardo and David had no derivative right to withholding of removal based on Da Silva\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 862 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Additionally, because the Petitioners failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s finding that they did not qualify for CAT relief, the Petitioners did not exhaust this argument, and we therefore lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny the petition in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">PETITION IS DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
