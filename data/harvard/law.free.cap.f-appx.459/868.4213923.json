Arango-Moreno contends that the Immigration Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which was' affirmed by the BIA, is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Arango-Moreno, a citizen of Colombia, entered the United States without inspection in June 2001. She filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief in April 2002 based on her political opinion. According to the application, she was an active member of Colombia\u2019s conservative party before entering the United States. Because of her membership in that party, she alleged that she was persecuted by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">An asylum officer interviewed Arango-Moreno in early December 2004 and concluded that she was not a credible witness, and the Department of Homeland Security then determined that she was not eligible for asylum. DHS instituted removal proceedings against her. Before the IJ, Aran-go-Moreno conceded removability but applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">The IJ denied her relief, finding that, based on inconsistencies between her application, her in-court testimony, and the documents she submitted, she was not credible. She appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA, which affirmed. Arango-Moreno then timely filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Arango-Moreno contends that the adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence. Because the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). We review for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s factfindings, including an adverse credibility determination, and review <em>de novo </em>its legal conclusions. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817-18 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">To establish a claim for asylum, an applicant must establish \u201cwith specific and credible evidence\u201d that she is a \u201crefugee\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i). A refugee is, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-15\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-16\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). An adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support a denial of asylum. <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-17\">Arango-Moreno did not credibly establish her membership in the Colombian conservative party. She testified before the IJ that she joined the party in 1985, but she submitted a letter from her father that indicated that she joined it in 1991. She also submitted a letter from the Colombian conservative party that said she joined the party in 1994.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-18\">Nor did she credibly establish that she suffered past persecution at the hands of FARC or that she has a well-founded fear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>of persecution if she returns to Colombia. She testified that, on April 15, 2001, she was kidnapped by FARC, the getaway car crashed, and she woke up in the hospital with an injured leg. According to her testimony, she checked out of the hospital one day later. But she told the asylum officer that she was hospitalized for three days after this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">These inconsistencies provide substantial evidence supporting the adverse credibility determination. The BIA did not err in denying her application for asylum. Because Arango-Moreno is unable to meet the lower burden for asylum, she also cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal and CAT relief because those claims for relief are based on the same underlying facts. <em>See Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 891 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b895-11\">. Arango-Moreno argues that the letters from her father and the conservative party were improperly translated and that the proper translations reveal that there was no inconsis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>tency between her in-court testimony and the information presented in the letters. But she did not challenge the translation of the letters before the IJ or the BIA so we cannot consider the alternative translations now. <em>See Sundar v. I.N.S., </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
