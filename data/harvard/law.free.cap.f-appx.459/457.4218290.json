The district court sentenced him, <em>inter alia, </em>to 46-months\u2019 imprisonment, within his advisory Sentencing Guidelines range. Vega challenges only the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-22\">Review is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because Vega\u2019s sentence was within his advisory Guidelines range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>E.g., United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). (And, as he concedes, but presents for possible future review, Vega\u2019s assertion that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply to within-Guidelines sentences under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 because \u00a7 2L1.2 was not based on empirical evidence is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>E.g., United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 232-33 (5th Cir.2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-24\">Vega contends the district court failed to give adequate weight to his cultural assimilation in the United States. The court considered Vega\u2019s cultural-assimilation contentions, but found that a sentence at the bottom of his Guidelines range was appropriate. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant\u201d. <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Vega has not shown sufficient reasons to disturb the presumption of reasonableness given his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Vega also contends the district court failed to consider adequately the time between the instant conviction and his convictions as a teenager. Because he did not raise this point in district court, review is for plain error only. <em>E.g., United States v. Gutierrez, </em>635 F.3d 148, 152 (5th Cir.2011). In any event, \u201cthe staleness of a prior conviction used in the proper calculation of a guidelines-range sentence does not render [it] substantively unreasonable\u201d. <em>Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
