The court revoked the supervised release and sentenced Carter to a 30-months\u2019 term of imprisonment on finding that he had violated the conditions of his release by having sexual intercourse with a 13-year old girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">In <em>United States v.

Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136 (11th Cir.1993), we held that a district court, after imposing sentence, must give the parties an opportunity to object to the court\u2019s ultimate findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the manner in which the sentence is pronounced, and must elicit a full articulation of the grounds upon which any objection is based. The district court failed to elicit Carter\u2019s objections as required by <em>Jones </em>in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Without a statement of Carter\u2019s objections, we cannot afford this appeal meaningful review. The judgment of the district court is accordingly vacated and the ease is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-12\">.
