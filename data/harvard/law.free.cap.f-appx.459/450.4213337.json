In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Sosa raised issues concerning ineffective assistance of counsel and the validity of his guilty plea and sentence. The district court dismissed Sosa\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-22\">To obtain a COA, a petitioner must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). \u201cA petitioner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that jurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). If a district court has rejected a claim on procedural grounds, as in the instant matter, a COA should issue \u201cwhen the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>debatable whether the [application] states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 478, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Section 2255(f) sets forth a one-year time limitation in which a federal prisoner must filed a \u00a7 2255 motion. The limitation period runs from, inter alia, the date that the challenged conviction becomes final. \u00a7 2255(f)(1). In the instant matter, Sosa\u2019s conviction became final on October 17, 2008, when the time to file his direct appeal expired.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A) (2008); Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(2) (2008); <em>United States v. Plascencia, </em>537 F.3d 385, 388-90 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Thus, under \u00a7 2255(f), Sosa had until October 17, 2009, to file a timely \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Plascencia, </em>537 F.3d at 388-90. The seventeenth, however, was a Saturday; thus, the one-year time limitation ended on Monday, October 19. See Fed. R.App. P. 26(a). As the district court determined, Sosa\u2019s certificate of service for his \u00a7 2255 motion, which is in compliance with \u00a7 1746, reflects that the motion was filed, as it was delivered to prison authorities for mailing, on October 19, 2009. <em>See Spotville v. Cain, </em>149 F.3d 374, 376-77 (5th Cir.1998); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746; Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A) (2008); Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(2) (2008). Thus, Sosa\u2019s motion was timely. Additionally, \u201cthe district court pleadings, the record, and the COA application ... are unclear or incomplete\u201d as to whether reasonable jurists could debate whether Sosa has made a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Houser v. Dretke, </em>395 F.3d 560, 562 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">Accordingly, Sosa\u2019s motion for a COA is GRANTED; his motion to proceed IFP is GRANTED; motion to appoint counsel DENIED; the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing the motion as untimely is VACATED and the matter is REMANDED for further proceedings. <em>See id.; Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\">. In 2008, Sosa had ten days excluding weekends and legal holidays to file a timely notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A) (2008); Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(2) (2008). The ten-day time period began on October 3, 2008, ex-eluded October fourth (Saturday), fifth (Sunday), eleventh (Saturday), twelfth (Sunday), and thirteenth (Columbus Day), and concluded on October 17, 2008. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4 (2008); Fed. R.App. P. 26 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
