The district court conducted a preliminary screening and dismissed the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>plaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1). Josey appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Because the complaint was dismissed as frivolous and for failure to state a claim, we review that dismissal <em>de novo. See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). The district court determined that the prosecuting attorneys whom Josey named as defendants were absolutely immune from suit. The court determined that Josey had not alleged a claim of excessive use of force against the state troopers named as defendants, because Josey had not alleged any injury. Although Jo-sey asserts that his constitutional rights were violated, he does not challenge these determinations by the district court. Accordingly, he has abandoned on appeal any challenge to the basis for the dismissal of his complaint. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Further, there is no authority to support Josey\u2019s contention that a dismissal under \u00a7 1915A must be entered within thirty days of the filing of a complaint subject to dismissal thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The dismissal of the complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Josey has had at least two other civil rights complaints dismissed as frivolous and for failure to state a claim, and those dismissals also count as strikes. <em>Josey v. Bell Cnty., Tex., </em>No. 6:03-CV-63 (W.D.Tex. Sept. 29, 2003); <em>Josey v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety, </em>No. 6:03\u2014 CV-39 (W.D. Tex. June 16, 2003). Because Josey has accumulated three strikes, he is now barred from proceeding <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The judgment of dismissal is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
