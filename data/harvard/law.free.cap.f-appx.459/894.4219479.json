After review, we deny Gomez-Betancur\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">The IJ concluded Gomez-Betancur was a member of a particular social group, namely, landowning cattle ranchers. However, the IJ and the BIA determined he did not have a well-founded fear of persecution by the National Liberation Army (ELN) on account of this status. On appeal, Gomez-Betancur contends this determination was error because he has an objective basis for a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his status as a landowning cattle rancher.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">An alien who cannot demonstrate past persecution may establish a well-founded fear of future persecution by proving \u201c(1) a \u2018subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable\u2019 fear of persecution that is (2) on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). An alien\u2019s credible testimony generally establishes that his fear is \u201cgenuine.\u201d <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1007 (11th Cir.2008). An asylum petitioner must also establish a nexus between the feared persecution and the protected ground by presenting \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution on account of\u2019 the statutorily listed factor. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">The BIA and IJ did not err in determining that Gomez-Betancur was ineligible for asylum. While his fear was presumed genuine because the IJ determined that he testified credibly, <em>De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1007, substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s conclusion that there was no indication the ELN could currently identify him or would seek him out. The calls from the ELN stopped in 2007, two years before the hearings. Moreover, his wife, daughters, parents, and brothers had safely remained in the same area of Colombia, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>and to his knowledge, none faced any harm. These factors demonstrate that Gomez-Betancur\u2019s fear was not objectively reasonable, and the record does not compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s finding that he failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1236. Accordingly, we need not address whether relocation was a reasonable option for Gomez-Betancur.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-7\">. Because Gomez-Betancur failed to raise his withholding of removal and CAT claims before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider them. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1249-50 (11th Cir.2006). Moreover, he has also abandoned them on appeal by failing to mention either issue in his initial brief. <em>Lapaix v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1145 (11th Cir.2010). Thus, we consider only his asylum claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b921-8\">.

U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). \"[T]o conclude the BIA\u2019s decision should be reversed, we must find that the record not only supports the conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Ruiz v.
