The District Court dismissed the petition <em>sua sponte, </em>before the respondents had been served, on the ground that the underlying claim should not have been brought as a habeas corpus petition but rather as an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-27\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-28\">On February 16, 2010, 2010 WL 1337739, state prisoners Craig Williams, Ernest Porter, Saharris Rollins, and Ron-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>aid Clark<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a <em>pro se </em>habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, challenging the \u201cillegal confinement of them\u201d by Jeffrey A. Beard, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, and Louis S. Folino, Superintendent of the State Correctional Institution at Greene (SCI-Greene), where all of the prisoners were then confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Each prisoner\u2019s death sentence, but not his conviction, has been vacated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under Pennsylvania\u2019s Post-Conviction Relief Act, Williams\u2019 death sentence was vacated in 2006, and Clark\u2019s death sentence was vacated in 2003. In federal habeas proceedings, Porter\u2019s death sentence was vacated in 2003, and Rollins\u2019 death sentence was vacated in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In their petition, the prisoners alleged that they will remain in the \u201ccondemned to die unit (also known as death row/capital case housing unit),\u201d unless or until they are resentenced to life imprisonment. Conditions of that unit are similar to those of administrative or disciplinary custody, which are more stringent than those for the general prison population. The restrictive conditions include no contact visits, access to the prison law library only every seven to ten days, and then in single cages, and confinement to their cells for 22 hours on weekdays and 24 hours on weekends. The prisoners further alleged that such conditions inhibit their ability to investigate, prepare, and develop relevant mitigation evidence to be presented at their resentencings. The prisoners sought an order requiring their transfer from death row to the general prison population.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">On March 31, 2010, 2010 WL 1292170, after considering the prisoners\u2019 objections thereto, the District Court adopted the Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge and thereby dismissed the petition <em>sua sponte </em>(and before the respondents had been served). (App.1^4.) The District Court found that \u201cthe underlying claim is one properly brought in a civil rights action\u201d and denied a Certificate of Appealability. (App.3-4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The prisoners appealed. We issued a Certificate of Appealability and appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">II. <em>Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Woodall v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>432 F.3d 235, 239 n. 3 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">III. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">The sole issue before us is whether the District Court erred in concluding that the prisoners\u2019 challenge to their confinement on death row, after their death sentences had been vacated, rather than in the general prison population, is not cognizable in a petition for habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-14\">\u201cAlthough both \u00a7 1983 and habeas corpus allow prisoners to challenge unconstitutional conduct by state officers, the two are not coextensive either in purpose or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>effect.\u201d <em>Leamer v. Fauver, </em>288 F.3d 532, 540 (3d Cir.2002). A habeas petition must be used for a challenge to \u201cthe validity of the continued conviction or the fact or length of the sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542. An action under \u00a7 1983 is appropriate for a challenge to \u201ca condition of confinement such that a finding in plaintiffs favor would not alter his sentence or undo his conviction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The prisoners do not challenge the fact or duration of their imprisonment. Instead, they complain of the restrictive conditions of death row and seek to be transferred into the general prison population. As such, the prisoners raise \u201cconditions of confinement\u201d claims that do not lie at the core of habeas and thus are properly brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983. <em>See id. </em>We find, therefore, that the District Court correctly dismissed the prisoners\u2019 habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">IY. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-6\">. Clark was resentenced to life imprisonment on August 16, 2011. As a result, he has been released from his status as a death sentence prisoner and is no longer on \"death row.\u201d Because he could not benefit from the relief sought in this action, his complaint will be dismissed as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b114-15\">. According to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, appeals by Williams, Rollins, and Clark of their convictions were unsuccessful, and Porter's appeal of his conviction is pending before us at Nos. 03-9006 and 03-9007.
