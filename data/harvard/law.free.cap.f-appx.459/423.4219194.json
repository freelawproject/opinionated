We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The district court granted Boh Brothers\u2019 motion for summary judgment because Billiot failed to provide any factual support or expert testimony to support her theory of the case: that vessel negligence occurred because \u201c[i]f the vessel had been able to pull Mr. Billiot immediately out of the water and provide first aid ... Mr. Billiot would not have drowned.\u201d On appeal, Billiot asserts (1) the district court erred in failing to apply the Pennsylvania rule and/or negligence per se rule regarding violations of safety rules, which would have placed the rebuttable presumption of negligence upon Boh Brothers; (2) vessel negligence caused in whole or in part her husband\u2019s injuries; and (3) she provided competent evidence to show a genuine issue of material fact for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Billiot\u2019s first argument lacks merit. The district court acknowledged this argument but rejected it implicitly through its finding that Billiot had not properly shown any genuine issue of fact as to vessel negligence, a threshold requirement of her LWHCA claim. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905 (providing injured longshore workers with a remedy for harms caused by a vessel); <em>Robinson v. Orient Marine Co. Ltd., </em>505 F.3d 364, 365 (5th Cir.2007). With evidence of vessel negligence lacking, the district court did not need to reach this argument. Neither do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">Billiot\u2019s second and third issues on appeal, which are closely related, also lack merit. The district court dismissed Billi-ot\u2019s vessel negligence claim because of her failure to introduce evidence that her husband\u2019s accident indeed involved a vessel. On appeal, Billiot presses evidence of her husband\u2019s physical condition. None of Bil-liot\u2019s arguments on appeal properly target the district court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">We therefore AFFIRM in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-22\">.
