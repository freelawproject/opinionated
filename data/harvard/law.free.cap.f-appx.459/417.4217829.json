According to Hernandez, his guidelines-range sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that the Guidelines that govern illegal reentry offenses produce unreasonable sentences because they are not empirically based and result in double-counting of his criminal history. In addition, the Guidelines fail to account for the benign nature of his offense, which he characterizes as an incomplete international trespass, and fail to consider his personal circumstances or his motive for returning to the United States, which was to earn money. Finally, he argues that the Guidelines create unwarranted sentencing disparity by failing to account for the lack of fast-track programs in certain districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Hernandez\u2019s challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Hernandez\u2019s 51-month sentence was within the guidelines range of 46 to 57 months of imprisonment and therefore is presumed to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">We have rejected the argument that the presumption of reasonableness does not apply because the Guidelines that govern illegal reentry offenses are not empirically based. <em>See id. </em>at 366-67. Also, we have rejected the argument that a sentence is rendered unreasonable because application of the Guidelines results in double-counting of a prior criminal conviction. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 &amp; n. 2 (5th Cir.2009). Hernandez\u2019s arguments that his crime was an incomplete international trespass and that his motive for reentering the country was benign, do not rebut the appellate presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 556-65 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Also, the unavailability of fast-track programs does not render Hernandez\u2019s guidelines-range sentence unreasonable. <em>See Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66. Finally, in Hernandez\u2019s case, the district court\u2019s sentencing decision was based upon an individualized assessment of the facts, including Hernandez\u2019s background, personal characteristics, and his arguments for leniency, and the sentencing determination was made after consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Thus, Hernandez has not demonstrated that his sentence fails to take into account a factor that should receive significant weight, gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). He has therefore failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is DENIED. <em>See United States v. Holy Land Found, for Relief &amp; Dev., </em>445 F.3d 771, 781 (5th Cir.2006). However, because Hernandez has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his below-guidelines sentence, further briefing is unnecessary. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>alternative request for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b443-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
