Duran M\u00edreles contends the sentence, an upward variance from an advisory Guidelines-sentencing range of 15 to 21 months, is \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d and, thus, substantively . unreasonable. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He maintains the district court did not give enough weight to: his advisory Guidelines-sentencing range; his reason for reentry (to be with his pregnant wife); and, the inability of someone with his limited mental capacity to be deterred by a long prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-21\">Where a sentencing ruling is procedurally sound, the \u201csubstantive reasonableness\u201d of the sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). District courts have a duty to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and to determine correctly the applicable Guidelines-sentencing range. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cIn reviewing a non-guidelines sentence for substantive unreasonableness, the court will consider the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Key, </em>599 F.3d 469, 475 (5th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 997, 178 L.Ed.2d 832 (2011). A non-Guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable, and an abuse of discretion, if it: \u201c(1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>fencing factors\u201d. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The district court took Duran M\u00edreles\u2019 above-described contentions into consideration. But, the court stressed Duran M\u00ed-reles\u2019 pattern of recidivism, noting that he had been convicted of illegal reentry in 2002, returned illegally in 2004, was deported again in 2009, and returned illegally again in 2010. The court also noted that, after returning in 2010, Duran M\u00edreles was indicted for possession of 75 pounds of marijuana and possession of a firearm as a felon. And, the court found that Duran M\u00edreles\u2019 prior 27-month sentence had been insufficient to deter him from reentering the country illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">It is not possible, let alone required, that district courts give all of the sentencing factors equal weight. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>633 F.3d 370, 375 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 3006, 180 L.Ed.2d 832 (2011). The district court was correct to have used its \u201cjudgment to weigh the relative importance of each factor in relation to [Duran M\u00edreles]\u201d and did not abuse its discretion by weighing some factors more heavily than others. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
