Plaintiffs claims arose out of an incident in which he became paralyzed when the Defendants used a taser gun to take him into custody while he was standing in a tree. On appeal, the Defendants argue that the district court erred in denying them immunity from Plaintiffs claims because: (1) the force used by the officers was reasonable; (2) the rights violation Plaintiff asserts was not clearly established; (3) several of the Defendants did not personally participate in the discharge of a taser; and (4) official immunity protects the Defendants from Harper\u2019s state law claims. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim under FedR.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Am. United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, </em>480 F.3d 1043, 1056-57 (11th Cir.2007). The complaint is viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and all of the plaintiffs well-pleaded facts are accepted as true. <em>Id. </em>at 1057. Dismissal is not appropriate unless it is plain that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would support the claims in the complaint. <em>Davila v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>326 F.3d 1183, 1185 (11th Cir.2003). However, a district court may properly dismiss a complaint if it rests only on conclusory allegations, unwarranted factual deductions, or legal conclusions masquerading as facts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">The complaint alleges the following facts. After midnight on May 26, 2008, police were called to Harper\u2019s home because of his \u201cintoxicated behavior.\u201d Before the police arrived, Harper fled into the woods behind his house with a rifle. Harper set the rifle down \u201cout of his reach\u201d and climbed up the tree some distance \u201cmore than four feet.\u201d He stood upright in the tree. The Defendants were called in to search for Harper. When they found him in the tree, the Defendants each drew their weapons and, according to Harper, \u201crepeatedly yell[ed]\u201d conflicting instructions to come out of the tree and to show his hands. Harper decided to show his hands, but the Defendants allegedly continued issuing the same conflicting commands.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">At that point, the Defendants agreed to use their taser guns to bring Harper down from the tree. Defendant Gourley attempted to taser Harper, but \u201cbecause of a misfire, Plaintiff did not fall out of the tree.\u201d Defendant Davis then deployed a second taser, causing Harper to fall out of the tree. As a result of the fall, he became a paraplegic.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">Thereafter, Harper filed this lawsuit to recover for his injuries. The Defendants moved to dismiss Harper\u2019s complaint, arguing for qualified immunity from his federal claims, and official immunity from his state claims. The district court denied in large part their motions, and this timely interlocutory appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>First, we are unpersuaded by the Defendants\u2019 claims that the district court erred in denying them qualified immunity from Harper\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim. Qualified immunity offers complete protection for a government official sued in his individual capacity if: (1) the official was \u201cacting within his discretionary authority,\u201d and (2) his conduct did not violate \u201cclearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Vinyard v. Wilson, </em>311 F.3d 1340, 1346 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted); <em>Garczynski v. Bradshaw, </em>573 F.3d 1158, 1166 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cOnce an officer raises the defense of qualified immunity, the plaintiff bears the burden to show that the officer is not entitled to it.\u201d <em>Keating v. City of Miami, </em>598 F.3d 753, 762 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">There is no question that the Defendants were acting within their discretionary authority as law enforcement officers when they carried out their arrest of Harper. The parties dispute, however, whether the Defendants violated a clearly established constitutional right when they tasered Harper.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The Fourth Amendment\u2019s freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures encompasses the right to be free from excessive force during the course of a criminal apprehension. <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 394-95, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989); <em>Mercado v. City of Orlando, </em>407 F.3d 1152, 1156 (11th Cir.2005). We analyze a claim of excessive force under the Fourth Amendment\u2019s \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d standard. <em>Graham, </em>490 U.S. at 388, 109 S.Ct. 1865. In order to determine whether the use of force is \u201cobjectively reasonable,\u201d we carefully balance \u201cthe nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests\u201d against \u201cthe countervailing governmental interests at stake\u201d under the facts of the particular case. <em>Id. </em>at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865 (internal citations and quotations omitted). We measure the quantum of force employed against these factors \u2014 the severity of the crime at issue; whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others; and whether the suspect actively resisted arrest or attempted to evade arrest by flight. <em>Lee v. Ferraro, </em>284 F.3d 1188, 1197-98 (11th Cir.2002). Notably, we consider the officers\u2019 actions \u201cfrom the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than through the lens of hindsight,\u201d <em>Kesinger ex rel. Estate of Kesinger v. Herrington, </em>381 F.3d 1243, 1249 (11th Cir.2004), recognizing that \u201c[t]he calculus- of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments \u2014 in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving \u2014 about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>490 U.S. at 396-97, 109 S.Ct. 1865.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">A right may be \u201cclearly established\u201d in three ways. First, the conduct may be \u201cso bad that case law is not needed to establish that the conduct cannot be lawful.\u201d <em>Vinyard, </em>311 F.3d at 1350. In other words, this kind of case is one of \u201cobvious clarity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, \u201csome broad statements of principle in ease law are not tied to particularized facts and can clearly establish law applicable in the future to different sets of detailed facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351. If a broad statement of legal principle is to \u201cestablish clearly the law applicable to a specific set of facts facing a governmental official, it must do so with obvious clarity to the point that every objectively reasonable government official facing the circumstances would know that the official\u2019s conduct did violate federal law when the official acted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Third, where no broad statements of legal principle are available, a right may be clearly estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>lished in \u201cprecedent that is tied to the facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted). In this situation, \u201ca case that is fairly distinguishable from the circumstance facing a government official cannot clearly establish the law for the circumstances facing that government official.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Because we are reviewing this case at the motion to dismiss stage, we are required to view the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and to accept all of the plaintiffs well-pleaded facts as true. <em>Am. United Life Ins. Co., </em>480 F.3d at 1056-57. With this standard in mind, we conclude that the Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity at this point. As for the first factor of the excessive force test \u2014 the severity of the plaintiffs crime \u2014 we have little basis to assess it, because he did not specify his crime in the complaint, other than to say that the Defendants were called to his home because of his \u201cintoxicated behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Based on this same complaint, however, the remaining factors weigh in Harper\u2019s favor. As for his threat to the safety of the officers, Harper alleges that he was unarmed, he was standing in the tree showing his hands, and was afraid for his life. While the Defendants argue that Harper could have jumped on them from the tree or jumped to retrieve his gun and start shooting at them, it is difficult to construe the allegations in this way, given that he alleges that he was standing with his arms up in the tree and that his rifle was out of reach <em>before </em>he climbed in the tree. There is also no argument at this point that Harper was acting belligerently or posing a threat to anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">As for whether he was resisting arrest, he alleges that at the time of the tasing, he was unarmed, had his hands up in an attempt to comply with the Defendants\u2019 conflicting commands, did not attempt to flee, and was surrounded by the four officers standing at the base of the tree and pointing their guns at him. Although the Defendants contend that their commands were not conflicting and that he was refusing to comply with clear commands, the allegations \u2014 that he could not climb out of the tree without using his hands \u2014 paint a different picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Moreover, the quantum of the force used allegedly was substantial. As Harper alleges, tasers are \u201cdesigned to cause significant, uncontrollable muscle contractions capable of incapacitating even the most focused and aggressive combatants,\u201d and the Defendants knew it would incapacitate him. Harper further alleges that \u201c[i]t was and is clearly obvious at all relevant times that a person using his hands, feet, arms and legs to stand in a tree, who becomes incapacitated by significant, uncontrollable muscle contractions, will likely fall from the tree[,] will lack the ability to protect himself from falls by any natural movements such as putting out his arms to protect himself from the fall and may suffer a broken neck, broken back, death or other very serious injury.\u201d While the Defendants point to case law suggesting that tasers emit a moderate, non-lethal level of force, none of the cases deal with its use on a suspect standing with his hands in the air and at least four feet off the ground in a tree, which clearly exacerbated the risk of serious injury resulting from the application of the taser.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, the Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>dants concede that the extent of injury that Harper suffered \u2014 paraplegia\u2014-weighs in his favor. Further, the Defendants\u2019 claim that the force was justified because they could not complete the arrest without the use of the taser or their firearms is refuted by the allegations here \u2014 that Harper was up in a tree receiving conflicting commands \u2014 which suggest that there were other options, like giving him clear instructions, to effectuate the arrest. In short, based on the allegations that Harper was unarmed, showing his hands, in a tree at least four feet off the ground, the Defendants\u2019 use of the taser, resulting in Harper\u2019s paraplegia, was disproportionate to any threat posed and unreasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Turning to the \u201cclearly established\u201d inquiry, Harper claims that this case is one of \u201cobvious clarity,\u201d such that case law is not needed to demonstrate that the Defendants\u2019 behavior is clearly unlawful. We applied the \u201cobvious clarity\u201d test in <em>Oliver v. Fiorino, </em>586 F.3d 898, 907 (11th Cir.2009), where we asked \u201cwhether it would be clear to every reasonable officer, even in the absence of case law, that the force used ... was excessive under the circumstances.\u201d In <em>Oliver, </em>we found that the plaintiff had met the \u201cobvious clarity\u201d test where the plaintiff was not accused of or suspected of any crime, was not acting belligerently or aggressively, complied with most of the officers\u2019 directions, and made no effort to flee, the officer\u2019s use of the taser at least eight and as many as eleven or twelve times over a two-minute span without attempting to arrest or otherwise subdue the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 908. We concluded that on these facts, the force \u201cwas so plainly unnecessary and disproportionate that no reasonable officer could have thought that this amount of force was legal under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">While <em>Oliver </em>involved a different set of facts, and indeed, was decided <em>after </em>the events underlying Harper\u2019s case, we nevertheless agree with the district court that Harper has met the \u201cobvious clarity\u201d test based on the very limited facts before us. Indeed, accepting the complaint\u2019s facts as true, we conclude that the Defendants\u2019 conduct was unlawful with \u201cobvious clarity\u201d: They shot a suspect with a taser gun, which they allegedly knew would incapacitate him, when the suspect (1) was at least four feet up in a tree with his hands raised, (2) posed no threat to their safety or the safety of others, (3) had no chance, and did not attempt, to flee, and (4) merely put his hands in the air in compliance with the instructions of at least one officer. In determining that the force was obviously and clearly excessive, we emphasize the peculiar facts of this case \u2014 among other things, that a taser was used on a person standing with his hands in the air at least four feet off the ground in a tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">Next, we are unpersuaded that the Defendants are shielded from liability because Defendants Perkins, Courson, and Gourley did not personally participate in the discharge of the taser that incapacitated Harper, and because Defendant Davis did not use the taser on Harper until after Defendant Gourley attempted to use his and it misfired. In <em>Oliver, </em>we found that under the facts alleged in the complaint, both \u201cOfficers Fiorino and Burk violated the Constitution\u201d by applying excessive force, even though it was not alleged that Officer Burk himself had actually fired the taser. 586 F.3d at 903, 907. Although we never explicitly addressed the issue, it is implicit in our holding that there are cir-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>cumstanees in which an officer can be held liable for a constitutional violation arising out of an unlawful tasing, even where that officer did not personally fire a taser gun. This is especially applicable in this case, where Harper\u2019s complaint alleges that the Defendants knew and intended that the use of the taser would incapacitate him, and the \u201cDefendants all concurred through their speech and conduct that they should use Tasers to bring Plaintiff down from the tree.\u201d Moreover, as Defendant Gour-ley acknowledges, a police officer has an obligation to intervene to prevent or stop the use of excessive force when he witnesses it and is a position to intervene. <em>Priester v. City of Riviera Beach, </em>208 F.3d 919, 927 (11th Cir.2000). Thus, because all of the Defendants were together and able to intervene at the time the taser was discharged, they are not shielded from liability at this stage of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Finally, we are unpersuaded by the three Sheriffs Department Defendants that they are entitled to official immunity on Harper\u2019s state law claims. Under Georgia law, public officials are generally entitled to official immunity from suit unless they acted with \u201cactual malice or with actual intent to cause injury\u201d in the performance of their official functions. Ga. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 II, \u00b6 IX(d). \u201c[I]n the context of official immunity, actual malice means a deliberate intention to do a wrongful act [and] [s]uch act may be accomplished with or without ill will and whether or not injury was intended.\u201d <em>Adams v. Hazelwood, </em>271 Ga. 414, 415, 520 S.E.2d 896 (1999). As a corollary, an officer effecting a lawful arrest may not use more force than is \u201creasonably necessary in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Smith v. Holeman, </em>212 Ga.App. 158, 160, 441 S.E.2d 487 (Ga.App.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">We recognize, as the Defendants argue, that we cannot rely on Harper\u2019s legal assertions of actual malice in the complaint. Nevertheless, we believe there are enough factual allegations of actual malice to survive the motion to dismiss. For example, Harper alleges that the Defendants knew, and intended, that their use of the taser on Plaintiff would incapacitate him, and that it was \u201cclearly obvious\u201d that once incapacitated, he likely would fall from the tree, be unable to protect himself, and \u201cmay suffer a broken neck, broken back, death or other very serious injury.\u201d Harper also alleges that he posed no risk to the officers or others and was not evading arrest. We believe that these allegations \u2014 asserting that the Defendants intended to use a taser gun on Harper, with clearly injurious consequences, and without any justification for doing so \u2014 are sufficient to describe a deliberate intention to do a wrongful act. The complaint therefore, at this stage of the case, alleges actual malice under Georgia law. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying the Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss on the basis of qualified and official immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b852-6\">. For example, in <em>Draper v. Reynolds, </em>369 F.3d 1270 (11th Cir.2004), the police used a single taser shock against a \"hostile, belligerent, and uncooperative\u201d suspect who was standing on the ground. <em>Id. </em>at 1278. The taser shock did not cause any serious injury and left the suspect \"coherent\u201d and \"calmed\u201d shortly after the shock. <em>Id. </em>We observed that under the facts of the case, \"[t]he single use of the taser gun may well have prevented a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>physical struggle and serious harm to either [the suspect] or [the officer],\" and, therefore, \"[u]nder the 'totality of the circumstances,\u2019 [the officer\u2019s] use of the taser gun did not constitute excessive force.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
