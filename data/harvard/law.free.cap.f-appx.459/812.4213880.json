After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b839-16\">A. First Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b839-17\">This is Warren\u2019s second appeal of his convictions. In his first appeal, this Court affirmed all of the district court\u2019s challenged rulings except its <em>sua sponte </em>determination at trial that there was probable cause to arrest Warren. We vacated the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>probable cause ruling and remanded \u201csolely for an eviden-tiary hearing as to the motion to suppress with reference to the probable cause for arrest issue.\u201d <em>United States v. Warren, </em>422 Fed.Appx. 811 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-18\">B. Second Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b839-19\">On remand, the district court held the required evidentiary hearing. Special Agent Luis Rosa testified about the circumstances of Warren\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-20\">At the time of Warren\u2019s arrest, the FBI was investigating a drug trafficking organization that was importing cocaine into South Florida. Two days earlier, agents had seized six kilograms of cocaine at the Miami Airport. An FBI confidential source (\u201cCS\u201d) negotiated with Ezequiel Rivera, Defendant Warren\u2019s co-defendant, to sell him the six kilograms of cocaine and arranged to meet codefendant Rivera at a store parking lot to complete the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-21\">Special Agent Rosa was the lead investigator and part of the surveillance team during the controlled buy. Special Agent Rosa had a clear line of sight during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>transaction and made the decision to arrest both Rivera and Defendant Warren.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">According to Special Agent Rosa, he observed a gray Mercedes drive into the parking lot and park four to six feet away from the OS\u2019s Nissan Murano. After the CS got out of the Nissan Murano, co-defendant Rivera got out of the driver\u2019s side of the Mercedes, leaving the driver\u2019s side door open. Through the Nissan Mu-rano\u2019s front windshield, Special Agent Rosa could see the silhouette of a person sitting on the passenger side of the Mercedes. After Rivera exited the Mercedes, Special Agent Rosa saw Rivera look back into the Mercedes and have \u201csome type of ... conversation or an exchange from inside of the [Mercedes].\u201d Rivera then turned around and gave something to the CS and put the six kilograms of \u201csham\u201d cocaine from the CS into the trunk of the Mercedes.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">When asked what facts led him to decide to arrest Defendant Warren (the passenger in the Mercedes), Special Agent Rosa stated that in his experience as a narcotics investigator, when a person is accompanied by another individual to a narcotics deal, the second individual \u201chas some interest in this transaction to be completed\u201d or is \u201cmuscle\u201d used \u201cfor safety because of the risk of these kinds of transactions.\u201d Special Agent Rosa further explained that \u201cthe mere fact that the door stayed open at all time[s] and there [was] some interaction between ... both individuals\u201d led Special Agent Rosa to believe Defendant Warren was involved in the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Special Agent Rosa stated that during the interaction he could tell that Defendant Warren and Rivera were looking at each other. Although Special Agent Rosa could not see \u201cany hand-to-hand activity,\u201d he believed he had observed a \u201c[p]hysical and verbal exchange\u201d and testified that he saw \u201cRivera\u2019s hand reaching inside the car and extracting something from the car,\u201d which he later learned was the money used in the drug transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Special Agent Rosa testified that during the negotiations, the CS posed as a \u201cfacilitator[ ] to bring narcotics outside the airport.\u201d Rivera agreed to pay $8,000 per kilogram, or a total of $18,000 for 6 kilograms of cocaine, paying half ($9,000) up front and the rest later. The street value of the cocaine was $180,000. After the \u201ctakedown,\u201d agents found $8,980 in the OS\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">The district court watched the video surveillance tape of the controlled buy several times and asked Special Agent Rosa to point out the interaction between Rivera and Defendant Warren. After viewing the videotape, the district court stated that it \u201cdid see what appeared to be looking into the vehicle, extracting money from the vehicle, giving it to the CS, and seeing the CS open the door and placing it into the Murano.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">After the hearing, the district court issued an order denying Defendant Warren\u2019s motion to suppress. The district court found, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) \u201cSA Rosa observed co-defendant Rivera looking back into the Mercedes and having a conversation with the occupant, later identified as Defendant Warren\u201d; (2) \u201cRivera was observed receiving a package from Defendant Warren\u201d that Rivera immediately gave to the CS; (3) throughout, the door to the Mercedes remained open; (4) the CS \u201cthen opened the front passenger side door to his vehicle and placed the package inside of his car\u201d; and (5) Rivera and the CS went to the back of the CS\u2019s vehicle, where Rivera picked up the bag of sham cocaine and placed it in the trunk of the Mercedes.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">Based on these findings, the district court concluded that \u201cthe totality of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>circumstances, viewed from the standpoint of ... an objectively reasonable police officer, supports] a finding of probable cause to arrest Defendant Warren.\u201d Emphasizing \u201cthe international posture of the transaction; the large quantity of drugs involved, six (6) kilograms, with a street value of $180,000; and the observed conversation and physical exchange of currency between co-defendant Rivera and Defendant Warren,\u201d the district court concluded that it was unlikely \u201cgiven the facts outlined above, Defendant Warren would have accompanied codefendant Rivera to the B.J.\u2019s parking lot without knowledge of the transaction.\u201d Defendant Warren filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Under the Fourth Amendment, an officer may arrest a suspect without a warrant \u201cif there is probable cause to believe that the suspect has committed or is committing an offense.\u201d <em>Michigan v. DeFillippo, </em>443 U.S. 31, 35, 99 S.Ct. 2627, 2631, 61 L.Ed.2d 343 (1979). \u201cFor probable cause to exist, an arrest must be objectively reasonable based on the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>345 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks omitted). An arrest is objectively reasonable \u201cwhen the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, of which he or she has reasonably trustworthy information, would cause a prudent person to believe, under the circumstances shown, that the suspect has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Probable cause \u201crequires more than suspicion,\u201d but not \u201cconvincing proof, and need not reach the same standard of conclusiveness and probability as the facts necessary to support a conviction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">Presence alone is not sufficient to constitute probable cause, but \u201cpresence and additional factors that would lead a prudent person to believe that an offense has been or is being committed is sufficient.\u201d <em>United States v. Irurzun, </em>631 F.2d 60, 63 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because behavior may seem innocent to the untrained eye, courts must also consider the officer\u2019s observations and experience. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>969 F.2d 999, 1003-04 (11th Cir. 1992).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">Here, the district court did not err in denying Defendant Warren\u2019s motion to suppress based on his allegedly unlawful arrest. According to Special Agent Rosa\u2019s testimony, which was corroborated by the surveillance videotape, codefendant Rivera left the driver\u2019s side door open and interacted with Defendant Warren during the drug deal. This interaction between Rivera and Defendant Warren involved Rivera looking at and speaking to Defendant Warren and then reaching his hand inside the Mercedes and extracting something from it. After this interaction, Special Agent Rosa saw Rivera turn around and hand something to the CS, which the CS then put inside his Nissan Murano. Only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>after this exchange did Rivera obtain the bag of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Defendant Warren argues that the trial evidence contradicts Special Agent Rosa and rendered his testimony \u201cpatently non-credible.\u201d Defendant Warren points to Special Agent John Thomas\u2019s trial testimony that he did not see anything during the controlled buy to indicate Defendant Warren was involved in the transaction. However, Special Agent Thomas did not have the same vantage as Special Agent Rosa during the transaction and was primarily responsible for relaying developments to other members of the surveillance team by radio. Special Agent Rosa, on the other hand, had a clear line of sight and was responsible for making the \u201ctakedown\u201d decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Defendant Warren also relies on co-defendant Rivera\u2019s trial testimony that Defendant Warren handed him the money for the transaction before Rivera got out of the Mercedes. When Defendant Warren actually handed Rivera the money is irrelevant to the probable cause determination. What matters is that Special Agent Rosa observed co-defendant Rivera interact with Defendant Warren during the transaction, and then reach into the Mercedes and appear to take something from Defendant Warren, which Rivera then handed to the CS. Moreover, Special Agent Rosa\u2019s testimony about Rivera\u2019s conduct during the controlled buy was corroborated by the surveillance tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Defendant Warren argues that Special Agent Rosa\u2019s testimony is implausible because the government did not present it at trial. However, the government did not need Special Agent Rosa\u2019s testimony at trial. Probable cause to arrest Warren was not at issue at trial. And, the government already had ample evidence to rebut Defendant Warren\u2019s \u201cmere presence\u201d defense, including Warren\u2019s own post-arrest admission that he was involved; co-defendant Rivera\u2019s testimony as to Defendant Warren\u2019s involvement; and the surveillance tape. As such, Special Agent Rosa\u2019s testimony about the interaction between Defendant Warren and Rivera during the controlled buy was unnecessary. Accordingly, Defendant Warren has not given us a reason to second-guess the district court\u2019s decision to credit Special Agent Rosa\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">Given the facts as found by the district court, we agree that it was reasonable for Special Agent Rosa to believe that Defendant Warren was involved in the drug deal. Special Agent Rosa explained that, in his experience as a narcotics investigator, when a second person accompanies the buyer to a drug deal, the second person often has an interest in the drug deal or is present to ensure the buyer\u2019s safety. As the district court pointed out, the transaction involved a large amount of cocaine, with a street value of $180,000. Based on Special Agent Rosa\u2019s experience, he reasonably inferred that Defendant Warren knowingly accompanied Rivera to the drug deal and handed Rivera the money to complete the transaction. <em>See Maryland v. Pringle, </em>540 U.S. 366, 873, 124 S.Ct. 795, 801, 157 L.Ed.2d 769 (2003) (explaining that passengers in cars are often \u201cengaged in a common enterprise with the driver\u201d and that drug dealing is \u201can enterprise to which a dealer would be unlikely to admit an innocent person with the potential to furnish evidence against him\u201d). We agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>with the district court that Special Agent Rosa had an objectively reasonable belief, based on the totality of the circumstances, that Defendant Warren was not simply an unwitting companion, but a knowing and willing participant in the cocaine transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-6\">. In <em>Bonner v.

In so doing, we construe all the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>Id. </em>We also give \u201cdue weight\u201d to the district court\u2019s finding that an officer is credible and that the officer\u2019s inference drawn from his own experience is reasonable. <em>Ornelas v.

Because there is no basis to disregard Special Agent Rosa's testimony at the evidentiary hearing, we do not address Defendant Warren's argument that,\"[w]hen Rosa's testimony is properly disregarded,\u201d the doctrine of the law of the case precludes considering whether the trial evidence established probable cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
