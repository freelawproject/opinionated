Stat. \u00a7 501.201 <em>et seq., </em>and race discrimination under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. The district court dismissed Ebeh\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. This is Ebeh\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-18\">Ebeh filed a complaint in federal district court alleging that the defendants mishandled his request for workers\u2019 compensation benefits by delaying payments required by a \u201cthree party contract\u201d and \u201cintentionally depriving]\u201d him of \u201centitled income.\u201d As a result of that alleged breach of contract, Ebeh could not pay his rent, was evicted from his home, and lost all of his personal possessions. He asserts that the defendants\u2019 conduct was \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cutterly intolerable in a civilized society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-19\">The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>diction. They argued that all of Ebeh\u2019s claims derived from work-related injuries and noted that Florida\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 440.11, provides the exclusive legal remedy for on-the-job injuries suffered by workers in Florida. The district court agreed and dismissed the complaint. It reasoned that Ebeh\u2019s claims fell within the scope of the Act, which meant that Florida\u2019s circuit courts would lack subject matter jurisdiction over Ebeh\u2019s claims. And where Florida\u2019s state courts lack jurisdiction over an employee\u2019s work-related claims, a federal district court also lacks jurisdiction over those claims and any other claims for damages not available under Florida\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s finding that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Florida\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides the \u201cexclusive\u201d remedy for an employee with a grievance against an employer or the employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 440.11(1), (4). Under that statute, \u201cthe employee relinquishes certain common-law rights with regard to negligence in the workplace and workplace injuries in exchange for strict liability and the rapid recovery of benefits.\u201d <em>Aguilera v. Inservices, Inc., </em>905 So.2d 84, 90 (Fla.2005); <em>see also Cramer v. Florida, </em>117 F.3d 1258, 1262 n. 9 (11th Cir.1997) (noting that the Act \u201cexpressly preempts common law tort remedies for on-the-job injuries suffered by workers in Florida\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">The only exception to the Act\u2019s exclusivity is \u201cintentional tortious conduct.\u201d <em>Aguilera, </em>905 So.2d at 90; <em>see also id. </em>at 91 (stating that Florida\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation \u201csystem does not declare an \u2018open season\u2019 with regard to intentional torts against workers\u201d). An employee with an intentional tort claim against an employer or an employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier may bring suit in Florida circuit court to recover damages. <em>See id. </em>at 92. Otherwise, the circuit court lacks jurisdiction over the employee\u2019s claims. <em>See Old Republic Ins. Co. v. Whitworth, </em>442 So.2d 1078, 1079 (Fla.3rd DCA 1983); <em>see also Sanders v. City of Orlando, </em>997 So.2d 1089, 1093 (Fla.2008) (noting that Florida state courts have \u201cuniformly held ... that [Florida circuit] courts have <em>no </em>subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes involving workers\u2019 compensation issues\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">We have held that where Florida\u2019s circuit courts lack jurisdiction over an employee\u2019s work-related claims because of the Act, a federal district court also lacks jurisdiction to consider those claims and any other claims \u201cfor additional damages over and above the relief that can be obtained\u201d in the state workers\u2019 compensation proceedings. <em>Connolly v. Md. Cas. Co., </em>849 F.2d 525, 528 (11th Cir.1988). Thus, if a plaintiff does not escape the exclusive force of Florida\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act by alleging a viable intentional tort claim, a federal district court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the case. <em>Id. </em>at 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">We agree with the district court that Ebeh\u2019s complaint does not sufficiently allege an intentional tort, so the exclusivity of Florida\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation scheme deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction. Although Ebeh\u2019s complaint uses the proper legal terminology to describe an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, the alleged facts underlying that claim establish nothing more than breach of contract and unreasonably delayed payments. The gravamen of his complaint is that he was a beneficiary of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>\u201cthree party contract\u201d and the defendants \u201cdeprived him of a regular entitled income which caused [him] to be unable to pay his bills and support his family.\u201d Those facts do not support a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, regardless of the legal terminology that Ebeh uses to couch his allegations. \u201c[A] complaint requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Sinaltrainal v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>578 F.3d 1252, 1261 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Connolly, </em>849 F.2d at 526 (\u201c[A] compensation claimant cannot avoid the exclusivity of [Florida\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] and transform a delay in payments into an actionable tort cognizable in the Circuit Court simply by calling that delay outrageous, fraudulent, deceitful, or an intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Because Ebeh\u2019s complaint does not allege sufficient facts to establish a facially plausible intentional tort action, his claims fall within the scope of Florida\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. That statute provides his exclusive remedy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\">. The district court also lacks jurisdiction over Ebeh's 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 claim because there is no legal basis for asserting that claim apart from the alleged violations of Florida's workers' compensation laws, and the remedy for those violations \"cannot rise above the exclusive remedy provided by the Florida statutes.\" <em>Connolly, </em>849 F.2d at 528.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
