The petitioners contend that the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination is not sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>ported by substantial evidence and that the record compels a conclusion that Sonk-eng met the burden of proof necessary to establish eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. According to the petitioners, Sonkeng presented a compelling and well-corroborated account of persecution due to her political activities and membership in the Social Democratic Front (SDF), and the BIA erred in failing to consider all of the corroborating evidence in support of their application.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Generally, we review the decision of the BIA and will only consider the IJ\u2019s underlying decision if it influenced the BIA\u2019s determination. <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 348 (5th Cir.2002). Because the BIA approved of and relied upon the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we may review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Contrary to the petitioners\u2019 contention, the IJ and BIA identified specific and cogent reasons for the adverse credibility determination. Although it is questionable whether Sonkeng\u2019s testimony regarding her arrest history was inconsistent with the statement made in her visa application and whether Sonkeng submitted her most current SDF membership card, the record supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s determination that Sonkeng\u2019s testimony regarding the date she ceased attending school was inconsistent with the statement made in her asylum application. The record also provides that Sonkeng resided in Germany for over four years without seeking asylum protection from the German government, that Sonkeng voluntarily returned to Cameroon for a over a month-long stay in 2002, and that despite her fugitive status, Sonkeng was able to obtain a valid passport and student visa under her legal name, pass through Cameroonian security at the airport, and board a plane to Germany without incident. Although the petitioners presented some corroborating evidence in support of their asylum and withholding of removal claims and provided explanations for the discrepancies, omissions, and implausibilities noted by the IJ and BIA, we do not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ or BIA with respect to factual findings based on credibility determinations. <em>See Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 537 (5th Cir.2009). The record does not compel a determination that Sonkeng was credible, and the totality of the circumstances does not suggest that no reasonable factfinder could have made the adverse credibility ruling. <em>See id. </em>at 538-40 (upholding the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because nothing in the record compelled belief in the applicant\u2019s story). Accordingly, we defer to the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination, and the petitioners\u2019 petition for review is DENIED. Because the petitioners do not challenge the BIA\u2019s dismissal of their claims for relief under the Convention Against Torture and voluntary departure, these issues are waived. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut.
