Brown argues that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) lacked substantial evidence for this decision because the ALJ improperly discounted the testimony of her consultative psychologist, Dr. David Rush.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">The ALJ concluded that Brown is capable of performing light work and of performing her past relevant work as a meter reader. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(e), 1567(b). This conclusion was supported by the treatment notes prepared by Brown\u2019s treating physician and the opinions of two non-examining psychologists who reviewed the available medical evidence and whose determinations were supported by the record. The ALJ also considered and gave \u201csome weight\u201d to the opinion of Dr. Rush, and the ALJ was not required to accord additional weight to Dr. Rush\u2019s opinions because he examined Brown only once. <em>See Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>368 F.3d 1155, 1160 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that opinion of doctor who examined claimant once need not be given great weight). The ALJ\u2019s decision to give only \u201csome weight\u201d to Dr. Rush\u2019s opinions based on a single examination was sufficiently supported by evidence that Brown had made statements about her condition that were inconsistent with Dr. Rush\u2019s testimony, and by the opinions of Brown\u2019s treating physician and the two reviewing psychologists, which contradicted many of Dr. Rush\u2019s opinions. Finally, although the ALJ erroneously found that Brown had not sought treatment for her mental health issues over an eighteen-year period prior to 2007, this error was harmless because the remaining evidence provided a substantial basis for the ALJ\u2019s conclusion. <em>See Diorio v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir.1983) (affirming ALJ decision including harmless factual error).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-10\">.
