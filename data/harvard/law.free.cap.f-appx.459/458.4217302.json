We review the dismissal de novo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-21\">Garcia argues that his allegations establish official conduct that meets the standard of deliberate indifference.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Garcia contends that he filed sick call requests and administrative remedy requests and that all of the defendants were well aware of his eye condition. He states that his condition was also evidenced by his many trips to the hospital and medical procedures performed. He asserts that the prison medical staff was aware of his need for medications, which were prescribed but not provided promptly. He argues that these delays were the fault of prison staff, hindered his recovery, and caused him permanent damage. He complains of the lack of timely treatment, timely dispensing of prescribed medications, and proper diagnosis of his ailment. Garcia also contends that Warden Fox, in his individual capacity, was \u201cmade personally aware of the medical negligence.\u201d But Garcia\u2019s use of the term \u201cnegligence\u201d belies his contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>that his allegations meet the deliberate indifference standard,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which this Circuit has described as an \u201cextremely high standard to meet.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The fact of delay in itself is not sufficient to establish deliberate indifference.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Garcia has not alleged that prison officials \u201c\u2018refused to treat him, ignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The unexplained delays in dispensing medications constitute negligence at most.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The defendants did not ignore or refuse to treat Garcia\u2019s eye condition. According to Garcia\u2019s allegations, he was examined numerous times by several doctors, made multiple trips to the hospital, was prescribed and provided medication, and had two surgeries over the course of seven months. These facts negate a conclusion of deliberate indifference.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Also, regarding Warden Fox in his individual capacity, Garcia\u2019s argument does not refute the district court\u2019s determination that Warden Fox had no personal involvement in his medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"AKm\">The district court did not err in dismissing Garcia\u2019s complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Likewise, Garcia\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous and for failure to state a claim each count as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We caution Garcia that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-15\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b484-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut.
