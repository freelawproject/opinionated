He has also filed a motion for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Smith\u2019s conclusional assertions and barely comprehensible contentions fail to identify error in the district court\u2019s determination that his allegations in the instant proceeding amounted to a complaint regarding lost or damaged mail, which was insufficient to state a cause of action under \u00a7 1983 or the ADA. By failing to provide a coherent argument that addresses the district court\u2019s analysis, Smith has failed to adequately preserve any issue for appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a); <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995). Additionally, Smith\u2019s arguments fail to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing his complaint as frivolous. <em>See Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998). In fact, his contention that a parcel of damaged mail indicates that there is a conspiracy among the defendants to violate his constitutional rights or discriminate on the basis of a disability is fanciful and delusional and, as such, indicates that the district court correctly dismissed the complaint as frivolous. <em>See Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 32-33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Smith\u2019s appeal is devoid of legal points that are arguable on their merits, <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), and therefore it is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2;. Moreover, Smith has not shown the exceptional circumstances necessary to justify the appointment of counsel. <em>See Cooper v. Sheriff, Lubbock County, Tex., </em>929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991). His motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED. Smith is WARNED that any future frivolous pleadings filed by him in this court or in any court subject to the jurisdiction of this court will subject him to sanctions. Smith should review any pending matters to ensure that they are not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; MOTION FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
