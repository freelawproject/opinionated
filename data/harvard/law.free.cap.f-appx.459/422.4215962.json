Raymond then filed this employment action seeking <em>de novo </em>review of the damages awarded by the EEOC. The district court dismissed Raymond\u2019s claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and denied Raymond\u2019s motion for reconsideration. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Raymond\u2019s pro se status and its effects on his ability to litigate this case effectively are not lost on us. The result here, however, follows ineluctably from the law we must apply and not from the sympathy we feel for Raymond\u2019s plight. The district court \u2014 also sympathetic to Raymond\u2019s situation \u2014 took pains to explain to him the consequences of challenging only the EEOC\u2019s damages award in this case. It even went as far as to recommend to Raymond that he simply accept the EEOC\u2019s award to him rather than run the risk of losing that award by unsuccessfully pursuing this lawsuit. Along with that advice, the district court made plain to Raymond that if he chose to challenge only the EEOC\u2019s damages award, the court would lack subject matter jurisdiction over his case. Raymond nevertheless chose to file several documents insisting that his lawsuit was strictly limited to challenging the EEOC\u2019s damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Raymond argues that he did not intend to challenge only the EEOC\u2019s damages award and that, therefore, the district court erred by dismissing his case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. However, as noted above, the record makes clear that Raymond challenged only the EEOC\u2019s damages award. Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court because, as it concluded, we lack jurisdiction to consider Raymond\u2019s claims. <em>Massingill v. Nicholson, </em>496 F.3d 382, 385 (5th Cir.2007). Raymond\u2019s Motion for Appointment of Counsel is also DENIED. <em>Williams v.
