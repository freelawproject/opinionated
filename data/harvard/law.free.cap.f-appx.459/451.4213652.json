Bigelow argues that the district court\u2019s order of restitution to one of the victims was not supported by sufficient evidence. Because Bigelow challenges the district court\u2019s reliance on the presentence report (PSR) to determine the amount of restitution and did not object on this ground in the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Maturin, </em>488 F.3d 657, 659-60 (5th Cir.2007). To show plain error, Bigelow must show a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 660 (citation omitted). If he makes such a showing, \u201cthis court may, in its discretion, grant the defendant relief if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Bigelow presented no argument or evidence in the district court to suggest that the information in the PSR generally or the victim\u2019s statement of loss, from which the PSR derived the restitution amount, were materially untrue or unreliable. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>528 F.3d 423, 425 (5th Cir.2008). Nor does he now explain how the information in the PSR is untrue or inaccurate. <em>See id. </em>In light of these absences, Bigelow has failed to show that the district court erred in adopting the facts contained in the PSR and using them to determine restitution. <em>See id. </em>In any event, whether the victim required and received the therapy for which he requested restitution is a factual issue that was capable of resolution in the district court, and thus cannot constitute plain (clear or obvious) error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Chung, </em>261 F.3d 536, 539 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
