Lezhava\u2019s arguments in support of this contention were rejected by the district court in a well-reasoned opinion. We agree with the district court\u2019s analysis and conclusions. (Order at Dkt. 97 at 1-20 .) No reversible error has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-20\">Lezhava also contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for leave to amend. We conclude that Lezhava has shown no abuse of discretion in denial of the motion for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s order denying the motion. <em>(Id. </em>at 21-27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b838-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
