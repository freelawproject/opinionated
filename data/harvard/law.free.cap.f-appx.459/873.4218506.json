Calzada appeals his sentence of 292 months of imprisonment for conspiring to possess with intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine while onboard a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 70503(a), 70506; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B)(ii), and possessing with intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine while onboard that vessel, <em>id.; </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 70503(a)(1), 70506(a); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Calzada challenges the denial of his request for a downward departure, United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5H1.4 (Nov.2010), and the reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Calzada\u2019s request for a downward departure. We cannot examine a discretionary decision not to depart downward \u201cunless the district court incorrectly believed that it lacked authority to grant the departure,\u201d and the record establishes that the district court \u201cunderstood that it could depart, but chose not to do so.\u201d <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1228 (11th Cir.2006). The district court considered Calzada\u2019s age and physical ailments and determined, because he could \u201cbe adequately cared for in the detention system,\u201d that a downward departure was unwarranted. The record does not establish that the district court failed to understand its authority to depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Calzada to a term of imprisonment at the low end of the advisory guideline range. Calzada, the captain of a Panamanian fishing vessel, attempted to smuggle into the United States 640 kilograms of cocaine that had been concealed in the fish hold of his ship. Calzada testified incredibly at trial that he did not know about the drugs until a member of his crew used a satellite telephone to make arrangements to transfer the drugs and blamed his \u201cmistaken decision\u201d to go to trial on the fact that he \u201cperhaps ... did not understand well what was being translated .... \u201d Calzada complains about the lesser sentence received by Apolinar De La Cruz Yesquen, who served on the ship\u2019s crew and pleaded guilty to the same crimes, but Calzada is not similarly situated to De La Cruz. <em>See United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). Calzada\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">We AFFIRM Calzada\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
