Its objects, as stated in its constitution, are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\"><em>\u201c </em>(1) To stimulate effort to improve the quality of the corn crop and increase the yield of both grain and fodder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">\u201c (2) To develop better methods of culture and disseminate the knowledge of the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">\u201c (3) By meetings and discussions to arouse a deeper interest and develop a more thorough unity of effort in. corn production.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">\u201c (4) To establish ideals for both ear and plant for the different varieties and breeds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Its membership is limited to \u201cpersons <em>actively interested </em>in the improvement of corn and resident in the State of Michigan.\u201d There is held at its annual meeting a corn exhibit at which prizes are offered to its members, and to its members only, for the best exhibit of corn.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">It is obvious from the foregoing statement that the only persons who will be directly benefited by the proposed appropriation are those \u2018\u00a3 actively interested in the improvement of corn.\u201d The authority of the legislature to make such an appropriation was denied by Justice Cooley in his opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Township Board of Salem, </em>20 Mich. 452. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-12\">\u201cBut the discrimination by the State between different: classes of occupations, and the favoring of one at the expense of the rest, whether that one be farming or banking, merchandising or milling, printing or railroading, is not legitimate legislation, and is an invasion of that equality of right and privilege which is \u00e1 maxim in State government. When the door is once opened to it, there is no line at which we can stop and say with confidence that thus far we may go with safety and propriety, but. no further. Every honest employment is honorable; it is beneficial to the public; it deserves encouragement. The more successful we can make it, the more does it generally subserve the public good. But it is not the business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>of the State to make discriminations in favor of one class against another, or in favor of one employment against another. The State can have no favorites. Its business is to protect the industry of all, and to give all the benefit of equal laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-3\">This reasoning was approved by this court in <em>Michigan Sugar Co. </em>v. <em>Auditor </em>General, 124 Mich. 677; and in accordance therewith an act giving. a bounty for the manufacture of beet sugar was adjudged unconstitutional. We think that decision rules this case and that the law under consideration is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">The mandamus is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
