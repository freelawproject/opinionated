This motion was heard before said circuit court and was denied by respondent in this proceeding, who heard and decided said motion. Relator asks for a writ of mandamus commanding respondent to vacate and set aside the order denying said motion, and to enter an order granting the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">It is objected that, the court having retained jurisdiction in denying relator\u2019s motion, mandamus is not the proper remedy. Relator meets this objection by urging that this action of the court is not a final judgment; that certiorari will not lie because the proceeding is according to the course of common law; and that if relator pleads to the information, the right to raise this jurisdictional ques? tion will be waived. If, in this case, as claimed by relator,, pleading to the information will be a waiver of this jurisdictional question \u2014 which we do not decide \u2014 that will be no reason why this, court should grant this writ. The matter of a waiver is always one of choice. This case is controlled by the decisions of this court which hold that mandamus will not issue where other adequate remedy is available. <em>Michigan Mut. Fire-Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wayne Circuit.
