No other commitment ever issued in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">He asks a discharge on habeas corpus upon the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to impose the second sentence and that the commitment was therefore void. The foregoing facts are shown by the return of the recorder to the ancillary writ of certiorari. This return also shows that upon July 25, 1907, the following order was entered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-10\">\u201cAt a session of the recorder's court of the city of Detroit, held in and for said city, at the court-room of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>court, on Thursday the 35th day of July in the year of our Lord 1907.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\u201c Present: Hon.

Acts 1905, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-13\">\u201cSection 1. The court imposing sentence, shall not fix a definite term of imprisonment, but shall fix a minimum term of imprisonment which shall not be less than six months in any case. The maximum penalty provided by law shall be the maximum sentence in all cases except as herein provided and shall be stated by the judge in passing sentence. The judge shall at the time of pronouncing such sentence recommend and state therein what, in his judgment, would be a proper maximum penalty in the case at bar not exceeding the maximum pen; alty provided by law. * * ' *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-14\">\u201cSec. 3. The maximum term of imprisonment shall not exceed the longest term fixed by law for the punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>ment of the offense of which the person sentenced is convicted, and the minimum term of imprisonment fixed by the court shall not exceed one-half of the maximum term of imprisonment fixed by statute. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">\u201cSec. 3. The provisions of this act shall not apply to any person convicted of an offense the only punishment for which prescribed by law is imprisonment in one of the penal institutions named for life: <em>Provided, </em>That in all cases where the maximum sentence, in the discretion of the court, may be for life or any number of years, the court imposing sentence shall fix both the minimum and maximum sentence. The minimum term of imprisonment thus fixed by the court shall not exceed one-half of the maximum term so fixed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The language of the first quotation may be open to the construction that the recommendation as to the maximum period does not limit the period of confinement, while under the last the fixing of a maximum, in a case where the penalty prescribed is imprisonment for life or any number of years, precludes imprisonment beyond the limit of the maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The first sentence did not conform to the law because; the maximum <em>recommended </em>was less than double the minimum <em>fixed, </em>or, as counsel for petitioner would probably prefer to state it, because the minimum <em>fixed </em>was more than half the maximum period <em>recommended. </em>If the language used can be construed as a \u201cfixing\u201d of the maximum period, although in the form of a recommendation, the earlier sentence can be sustained to the extent of at least one-half of the maximum, under a liberal, but, we think, reasonable, construction of the statute, 3 Comp. Laws, \u00a7 11984, or perhaps a resentence permitted under the rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>146 Mich. 264, if the statute should be considered inapplicable. Had his original sentence <em>recommended </em>a maximum of twelve years and a minimum of six, we would think it technical to say that the sentence was void, merely because he <em>recommended </em>instead of <em>fixing </em>the maximum, the effect of which, under section 3, would necessarily be the same, viz., to place a limit upon the term, which might not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>true were section 1 applicable. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the recommendation in the first sentence should be treated as a \u201cfixing,\u201d i. e., a determination of the maximum period for which the petitioner could be confined, and although it bore the form of a recommendation merely, that it cannot be treated as surplusage and therefore a nullity, justifying another sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The prisoner was entitled to have the decision of the judge upon the maximum, and a minimum fixed which should not exceed half of it, not a minimum fixed, and a maximum which should not be less than double the minimum. Such is the language of the statute, Act No. 184, Pub. Acts 1905, \u00a7 3. Section 8 provides that the minimum shall not exceed one-half of the maximum penalty prescribed by law, while section 3 prohibits an excess over one-half of the maximum fixed, i. e., prescribed by the court. By this construction we preserve the harmony between the two provisions, between which there is an evident analogy. The court did determine the maximum penalty, and while we may well believe (especially in view of his subsequent change of sentence) that he did it believing that it was not conclusive upon the governor or pardon board, it must be governed by the same rule that would apply had the maximum fixed been double the minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The statute prescribing the penalty for the offense of which the petitioner was convicted reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">\u201c ( 11483) Sec. 14. If any person shall assault another with intent to commit the crime of murder, every such offender shall be punished by imprisonment in the State prison for life, or any number of years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The first sentence is not in excess of this statute, standing alone, but by fixing the maximum penalty at seven years the court established the lawful extent of the minimum, under the indeterminate act, as effectively as though it had been so fixed in section 11483, as the extent of the penalty for such offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>The minimum prescribed, therefore, was in excess of the lawful penalty. Section 11984 provides that a sentence in excess of the lawful penalty shall not be adjudged altogether void, but shall be <em>valid and effectual </em>to the extent of the lawful penalty. The first sentence was therefore valid as a sentence for a minimum of three and one-half and a maximum of seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The effect of subsequent proceedings. The later proceedings were apparently an attempt by the recorder to vacate a sentence not altogether void, but valid in part, and to substitute another and heavier one for it. We have held that a trial court cannot set aside a valid sentence and impose a new and different one, after the defendant has been remanded to jail to await the execution of the sentence. <em>People </em>v. Meservey, 76 Mich. 223; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>79 Mich. 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">This being a valid sentence for three and one-half years, the most that the court could do, under these decisions, was to correct the record by making it show a minimum of three and one-half years. Instead thereof, he undertook to vacate it and impose another and greater penalty, which he had not lawful authority to do, and that order and the commitment issued upon it were void, and must be so treated. Under the circumstances, we should not discharge the petitioner merely for the want of a valid written commitment, when it appears, by his own showing, that he was remanded, after sentence, to the custody of the jailer, probably by an oral order made in open court that his punishment might be inflicted. It would be proper for the recorder to enter an order nunc pro tunc correcting the sentence of June 30 to conform to this opinion, and to issue as of that or a later date a proper commitment. The relief prayed is denied and the prisoner will be remanded to the custody of the respondent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b456-7\">MoAlvay, C.
