That it is applicable to this case is shown by the cases of <em>Capwell </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>58 Mich. 571, and <em>Pickell </em>v. <em>Coates, </em>147 Mich. 53, both of which were here upon writs of error, a preliminary order for mandamus having been previously denied in the latter case. In <em>City of Flint </em>v. <em>Genesee Circuit Judge, </em>146 Mich. 439, the subject is discussed, the foregoing and other authorities cited and followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">The writ is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
