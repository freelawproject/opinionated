Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 14 December 1999, respondent gave birth to J.E. On 18 October 2002, Mecklenburg County Youth and Family Services (\"YFS\") filed a juvenile petition that alleged J.E. was a neglected and dependent juvenile. A non-secure custody order placed J.E. with her maternal grandmother. YFS presented no evidence in the record to show a guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   (\"GAL\") was appointed to represent J.E. at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 22 October 2002, an initial (7-Day) hearing was conducted and on 29 October 2002 the order from the initial (7-Day) hearing was filed. No GAL was listed as being present at the 7-Day hearing. Although J.E. was returned to respondent's physical custody, the trial court concluded it was in J.E.'s best interest to remain in YFS's legal custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 16 December 2002, an adjudicatory hearing was conducted and the resulting order was filed later that day. The order states the following persons were present at the hearing: (1) respondent's attorney; (2) YFS's attorney; (3) a social worker; (4) an attorney advocate; (5) Sharon McGee (\"McGee\"), as GAL for J.E.; and (6) another YFS employee. Respondent was not present at the adjudicatory hearing. J.E. was adjudicated a neglected and dependent juvenile as to respondent. The trial court ordered J.E. removed from respondent's physical custody and be placed in foster care. The dispositional hearing was calendared for 7 January 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 7 January 2003, a dispositional hearing was conducted and the resulting order was filed later that day. The order indicated the following persons were present at the hearing: (1) respondent; (2) respondent's attorney; (3) YFS's attorney; (4) a social worker; (5) an attorney advocate; (6) McGee and Ondine Denice (\"Denice\") as GALs for J.E.; and (7) J.E.'s grandparents. The order also references a GAL report. No GAL report is included in the record on appeal. The dispositional hearing was continued to 10 February 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The dispositional hearing was conducted on 10 February 2003. The order indicates McGee's presence as GAL for J.E. Respondent was also present. The trial court concluded it was in J.E.'s best interest to remain in foster care. The trial court did not receive or consider a GAL report in making its determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 31 March 2003, a review hearing was conducted. The order states respondent was present and Denice was present as GAL for J.E. The trial court concluded it was in J.E.'s best interest to return to the physical custody of J.E.'s maternal grandmother. Legal custody remained with YFS. The trial court stated it received and considered a GAL report in making its determination. The record on appeal contains no GAL report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On 25 September 2003, a review hearing was conducted and the resulting order was filed on 26 September 2003. The order does not indicate a GAL was present at the hearing. The trial court concluded it was contrary\n   to J.E.'s best interest to return to respondent's home and physical custody of J.E. was to continue with her maternal grandmother. A permanency planning hearing was scheduled for 2 December 2003. No evidence exists in the record that a hearing was conducted on that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On 10 July 2003, respondent gave birth to Q.D. On 12 November 2003, YFS filed a juvenile petition that alleged Q.D. was a neglected and dependent juvenile. A non-secure custody order was also filed that placed Q.D. with his maternal grandmother. No evidence exists in the record that a GAL was appointed to represent Q.D. at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On 17 November 2003, an initial (7-Day) hearing was conducted and the order from the hearing was filed. The order states that the following people were present at the hearing: (1) respondent; (2) respondent's attorney; (3) Q.D.'s father; (4) the father's attorney; (5) GAL administrator, Denice; (6) attorney advocate, Matt McKay (\"McKay\"); (7) YFS social workers; (8) Q.D.'s paternal grandmother; (9) a paternal relative of Q.D.; and (10) a YFS attorney. The trial court ordered that paternity of Q.D. be established with the putative father and that placement of Q.D. was to remain with her maternal grandmother. An adjudicatory hearing was scheduled for 15 January 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On 12 April 2004, the adjudicatory hearing for Q.D. was held and the resulting order was filed later that day. The order does not recite a GAL as being present at the hearing, but states attorney advocate McKay was present. The case was continued to 6 May 2004 after respondent's attorney withdrew.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On 6 May 2004, the trial court conducted both an adjudicatory hearing for Q.D. and a review hearing for J.E. The resulting order was filed on 8 June 2004. The order states Denice was present, as GAL supervisor. The trial court concluded that Q.D. was a neglected and dependent juvenile. Both Q.D. and J.E. were ordered to remain in YFS's legal custody with physical placement with their maternal grandmother. The goal for both children remained reunification with respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On 2 August 2004, a combined permanency planning/review hearing for Q.D. and J.E. was conducted. The order states Jackie Everdt (\"Everdt\") was present as GAL. Respondent was not present, but was represented by an attorney. The permanent plan for J.E. was changed to adoption. The trial court also concluded \"termination of parental rights is in . . . [J.E.'s] best interests[.]\" The permanent plan for Q.D. was changed from reunification with respondent to reunification with his father. A permanent plan review hearing for Q.D. was scheduled for 4 October 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On 23 September 2004, YFS filed a petition to terminate respondent's parental rights to J.E. YFS also petitioned to terminate J.E.'s father's parental rights. On 28 September 2004, an order was filed that appointed Jodi Pugsley (\"Pugsley\") as GAL for both J.E. and Q.D. The order also appointed McKay as attorney advocate for both children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On 4 October 2004, a permanency planning hearing was conducted for Q.D. The order recites that Everdt was present as GAL. The permanent plan for Q.D. was changed from reunification with his father to adoption. The trial court also concluded \"termination of parental rights is in . . . [Q.D.'s] best interests[.]\" The trial court also ordered YFS to file a petition to terminate parental rights to Q.D. On 17 November 2004, YFS filed a petition to terminate respondent's parental rights to Q.D. YFS also petitioned to terminate the parental rights of Q.D.'s father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On 17 December 2004, a review hearing for Q.D. was conducted. The order states Everdt was present as GAL. The trial court reiterated \"termination of parental rights is in . . . [Q.D.'s] best interests[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On 17 November 2005, a hearing was conducted on the petitions to terminate respondent's and the childrens' fathers' parental rights to J.E. and Q.D. On 19 December 2005, the resulting order was filed. The order recites those present at the hearing as: (1) respondent; (2) respondent's attorney; (3) Q.D.'s father's attorney; (4) a GAL for respondent; (5) Mary Guecia (\"Guecia\"), as GAL; (6) McKay, as attorney advocate; (7) a YFS social worker; and (8) YFS's attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As GAL, Guecia did not testify at the termination hearing or present a GAL report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The trial court concluded: (1) respondent and the fathers of J.E. and Q.D. neglected the children; (2) J.E. and Q.D. are dependent juveniles; and (3) J.E. and Q.D.'s best interests would be served by terminating respondent's parental rights and the childrens' fathers' parental rights. J.E.'s and Q.D.'s fathers did not appeal. Respondent appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Respondent argues the trial court erred by: (1) failing to appoint a GAL for J.E. and Q.D.; (2) allowing an unappointed GAL represent J.E. and Q.D. at the termination hearing when there was no evidence that the appointed GAL had been released by the trial court; (3) appointing a GAL to represent J.E. and Q.D. at the termination hearing who had not represented the children from the time their juvenile petitions alleging neglect had been filed; and (4) concluding it was in J.E.'s and Q.D.'s best interests to terminate respondent's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    III. Appointment of a Guardian\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Ad Litem\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In her first three assignments of error, respondent argues the trial court violated N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-601 and \u00a7 7B-1108. Respondent asserts a GAL should have been appointed from the first petition alleging neglect \"investigating and determining the best interest of the child[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-601(a) provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   When in a petition a juvenile is alleged to be abused or neglected, the court\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the juvenile. When a juvenile is alleged to be dependent, the court\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the juvenile . . . . The duties of the guardian ad litem program\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be to make an investigation to determine the facts, the needs of the juvenile, and the available resources within the family and community to meet those needs; to facilitate, when appropriate, the settlement of disputed issues; to offer evidence and examine witnesses at adjudication; to explore options with the court at the dispositional hearing; to conduct follow-up investigations to insure that the orders of the court are being properly executed; to report to the court when the needs of the juvenile are not being met; and to protect and promote the best interests of the juvenile\n   <em>\n    until formally relieved\n   </em>\n   of the responsibility by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This Court addressed similar arguments in\n   <em>\n    In re A.D.L., J.S.L., C.L.L.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8472923\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/169/701/\">\n    169 N.C.App. 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632903\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/612/639/\">\n    612 S.E.2d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    disc. rev. denied,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799365,3803177,3801579,3795021,3799539,3799675\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/359/852/\">\n    359 N.C. 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633934,12633935\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/619/402/\">\n    619 S.E.2d 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) and\n   <em>\n    In re R.A.H.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8437587\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/171/427/\">\n    171 N.C.App. 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633140\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/382/\">\n    614 S.E.2d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    A.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-601(a) (2005) \"[w]hen in a petition a juvenile is alleged to be abused or neglected, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem [\"GAL\"] to represent the juvenile.\" In both J.E.'s and Q.D.'s petitions they were alleged to be neglected. The trial court complied with the statute in this case by stating that \"[t]he petitioner is informed that the [GAL] Program . . . has been appointed guardian of said child[ren] and the attorney advocate for the [GAL] Program has been appointed attorney advocate for the child[ren].\" It is undisputed that the children were represented by a GAL at the termination hearing. The only times in which the record reflects that a GAL was not present on behalf of the children occurred during J.E.'s initial seven-day order on 22 October 2002, his review hearing order on 25 September 2003, and Q.D.'s adjudicatory hearing order on 12 April 2004. Even during those hearings, however, the attorney advocate for the GAL program was present.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-601(a) (attorney advocate shall \"assure protection of the juvenile[s'] legal rights\"). Respondent's parental rights were terminated on 19 December 2005 after a hearing held on 17 November 2005. Thus, the issue before this Court is whether an order terminating parental rights should be affirmed when both children were represented by a GAL at the termination hearing while unrepresented during some hearings not on direct appeal to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   This Court in\n   <em>\n    In re R.A.H.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8437587\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/171/427/\">\n    171 N.C.App. 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633140\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/382/\">\n    614 S.E.2d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), held that prejudice will be presumed where \"a child was not represented by a [GAL] at a critical stage of the termination proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633140\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/382/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633140\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/382/\">\n    at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633140\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/382/\">\n    614 S.E.2d at 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, this Court has also held that when the trial court fails to appoint a GAL in a prior proceeding not on direct appeal, we will not reverse.\n   <em>\n    In re O.C. &amp; O.B.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8437773\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/171/457/#p463\">\n    171 N.C.App. at 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633272\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/615/391/#p396\">\n    615 S.E.2d at 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The rationale behind this rule is clear and, in relevant part, is quoted below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   First, [allowing respondents to allege errors based on prior orders] would create uncertainty and render judicial finality meaningless. Termination orders entered three, five, even ten years after the initial adjudication could be cast aside. Secondly, by necessarily tying the adjudication proceedings and termination of parental rights proceedings together, respondent misapprehends the procedural reality of matters within the jurisdiction of the district court: Motions in the cause and original petitions for termination of parental rights may be sustained\n   <em>\n    irrespective\n   </em>\n   of earlier juvenile court activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633272\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/615/391/#p396\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In short, \"there is no statutory authority for the proposition that the instant order is reversible because of a GAL appointment deficiency that may have occurred years earlier.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633272\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/615/391/#p396\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633272\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/615/391/#p396\">\n    at 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633272\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/615/391/#p396\">\n    615 S.E.2d at 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In the instant case, the hearing in which Q.D. was purportedly unrepresented occurred over a year before the termination hearing, and the hearings in which J.E. was purportedly unrepresented occurred approximately two and three years before the termination hearing. More importantly, the trial court's order should be affirmed because the prior orders in which the children were purportedly unrepresented are not on appeal before this Court and because a GAL represented the children during the entire termination proceeding. Thus, because it cannot be said that the children were unrepresented during a \"critical stage\" of the termination hearing, I would affirm the trial court as to this issue. As such, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Petitioner argues in its brief that respondent's arguments regarding guardian\n    <em>\n     ad litem\n    </em>\n    representation should be deemed abandoned because the assignments of error relating to that issue were not brought forward before the record on appeal was settled. After the record on appeal was filed, respondent moved to add the only additional assignments of error which are argued on this appeal. This motion was granted. Under North Carolina Rule of Appellate Procedure 9(b)(5), any party may make a motion to this Court to \"order additional portions of a trial court record or transcript sent up and added to the record on appeal.\" Petitioner had notice of the Rule 9 motion before its brief was filed with this Court, and as such, could have made a Rule 9 motion to amend the record to add any necessary documents needed to address the issue of guardian ad litem representation. Accordingly, the issue is properly before this Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
