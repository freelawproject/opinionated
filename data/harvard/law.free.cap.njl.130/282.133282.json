The District Court Judge, sitting without a jury, awarded judgment to plaintiff for the damages sustained; and the question posed by defendants, grounded upon the denial of their motions for a nonsuit and a \u201cdirected verdict,\u201d is whether the evidence is conclusive of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence. The inquiry must be resolved in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The agreed state of the case reveals evidence tending to show the following matters of fact: On June 5th, 1942, at about 9 A. M., a trolley car of the defendant corporation, in charge of the co-defendant, Ostroff, and an automobile owned and operated by plaintiff were both proceeding in an easterly direction along Atlantic Avenue, in the City of Atlantic City, the motor car a distance of approximately 15 feet directly behind the trolley car, when the latter vehicle came to a sudden and unexpected halt at a place not established as a \u201cregular stop\u201d and the automobile collided with its rear end, causing the damage for which the award was made. Other vehicles moving in the same direction confined plaintiff\u2019s automobile to the trolley tracks. The trolley car stopped at the Sovereign Avenue intersection, and plaintiff brought his automobile to a standstill behind it. The vehicles were again put in motion in the same relative positions; and, as they approached the Montpelier Avenue intersection, the trolley car \u201cslowed down but did not stop,\u201d and plaintiff did likewise. \u201cAs the trolley car reached the established stop\u201d at the intersection, \u201cit started to increase speed\u201d and proceeded over the intersection at the rate of 15 or 16 miles per hour, the plaintiff doing the same. Plaintiff at this point \u201cturned his head to the right to see if he could enter the next lane of traffic on the right and pass the trolley car,\u201d and \u201cturned his automobile slightly to the right.\u201d When he \u201cagain looked forward the trolley car had come almost to a complete stop,\u201d and the motor vehicle \u201cwas practically on it;\u201d and. although plaintiff \u201cthrew out his clutch and applied his brakes, the collision with the rear end of the trolley car followed immediately.\u201d The latter vehicle \u201chad stopped with its rear end 18 feet east of the easterly end of the safety zone, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>or trolley stop, located west of the west side of Montpelier Avenue, and 10 inches east of the west curbline of\u201d that avenue. The safety zone was delineated by white lines on the street surface. The front of the trolley car was then \u201ceast of the easterly cross-walk of Montpelier Avenue, and the car itself was stopped across this cross-walk.\u201d Plaintiff \u201csaw no signal given of the * * * motorman\u2019s intention to stop.\u201d Evidence was adduced, as binding on Ostroff only, that, after the collision, he stated to plaintiff that he stopped \u201cbecause he saw a fare running for the car and had to pick it up.\u201d An eye-witness testified that the trolley car \u201cslowed down\u201d as it neared the intersection, and then \u201cpicked up speed;\u201d that it \u201cstopped suddenly with its front end beyond the east cross-walk of Montpelier Avenue;\u201d and that \u201cfrom the time the trolley car started to pick up speed until it came to a stop, it traveled about a trolley length.\u201d The trolley car was 46 feet in length.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">We entertain the view that in these circumstances the conduct of plaintiff, appraised by the standard of reasonable care, was at the least subject.to variant inferences, and therefore raised an issue of fact, the resolution of which is final and conclusive by force of <em>R. S. </em>2:32-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Under <em>B. </em>8.39:4-44, a street railway company is empowered to establish certain street intersections or other points as \u201cregular stops,\u201d and in such event \u201cthe near side of the intersection or crossing shall be designated as the established stop,\u201d unless \u201cthe convenience or safety of the public will be better served\u201d at \u201cthe far side;\u201d and <em>section </em>39:4-45 provides that the ears of such a transport \u201cshall not be allowed to obstruct the crosswalks of a street.\u201d It is undisputed that the near side of the particular intersection was an \u201cestablished stop\u201d (this is proved by the photographs showing the safety zone); and plaintiff was warranted in assuming, until he discovered that it was contrary to the fact, that the operator of the trolley car would observe the legislative directions and otherwise exercise reasonable care in the use of the street. The legislative prescription establishes a standard of conduct in the management of trolley cars upon the public highways. <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Phillips Express Co., </em>118 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><em>N. J. L. </em>455; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Public Service Co-ordinated Transport, </em>111 <em>Id. </em>339; <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Snellenburg, </em>96 <em>Id. </em>518; <em>Paulsen </em>v. <em>Klinge, </em>92 <em>Id. </em>99; <em>Winch </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>92 <em>Id. </em>219; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Geiger, </em>100 <em>Id. </em>330. The manifest purpose of the provisions of the Traffic Act is the avoidance of collisions and other hazards incident to the movement of vehicles upon the public streets and highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Considering the fact that the trolley car had passed the established stop, the distance intervening between the two vehicles, and the statutory traffic regulations adverted to, can it fairly be said that plaintiff, in seeking a place in the parallel line of traffic to the right, indisputably did that which men of ordinary prudence would not have done under like circumstances? We think not. Whether defendant\u2019s negligence constituted the sole proximate cause of the collision was a question peculiarly within the province of the trier of the facts. That the automobile was moving in close proximity to the trolley car is not negligence <em>per se. </em>In this class of cases, contributory negligence is almost invariably an issue for the determination of the jury. <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Snellenburg, supra; Jackson </em>v. <em>Geiger, supra; Wallach </em>v. <em>Lightening Electric Co., </em>10 <em>N.
