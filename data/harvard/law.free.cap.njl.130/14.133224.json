The proofs indicate that on Friday, June 27th, 1941, while lifting down a bag of cement weighing 96 pounds, he felt a sudden pain, ceased the work that he was doing, rested awhile, did a little light work until quitting time, walked home, reported for work the next day, which was a Saturday, quit at noon, the regular quitting time, walked to the hospital between one and two o\u2019clock, was examined by Dr. Gordon, the interne, when his turn came and the trouble was diagnosed as \u201cpotential hernia.\u201d He walked home. On Monday he walked to his job, did some light work, sweeping, &amp;c. He stayed at and near his home, but was not confined to bed, until August 7th, when he walked to the hospital, had an operation for inguinal hernia and was later discharged as recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The statute applicable is of course paragraph x of the act of: 1919 <em>(Pamph. L., </em>at <em>p. </em>204), as amended and now paragraph x of <em>B. 8. </em>34:15-12. It is reproduced in full in the opinion of the Court of Errors and Appeals in <em>Prino </em>v. <em>Austin Co., </em>121 <em>N. J. L. </em>518 (at <em>p. </em>519), and need not be repeated here. The present case is not one of the \u201capplication of force directly to the abdominal wall.\u201d The petition makes no such claim: nor does the bill of particulars served in response to demand: nor does the written statement introduced in evidence before the deputy commissioner, marked <em>Exhibit B-l. </em>On the contrary, it reads: \u201cI did not strike the bag against my groin in any way.\u201d These facts are quite sufficient to require the conclusion that there was not a \u201creal traumatic hernia resulting from the application of force to the abdominal wall, either puncturing or tearing the wall;\u201d and that the present case is in the second class, requiring conclusive proof of the \u201cfive points\u201d stated in the statute. As to this phase of the matter, it is sufficient to say that there was not only no such proof that \u201cthe descent of the hernia immediately followed the cause;\u201d but on the contrary, the evidence seems to show satisfactorily that there was no \u201cdescent\u201d for several days after June 27th, when the alleged \u201caccident\u201d occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The judgment of the Common Pleas, and the award of the Bureau, will accordingly be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
