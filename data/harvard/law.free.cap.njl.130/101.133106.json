The District Court resolved the inquiry in the affirmative; and the Pension Commission appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">The facts have been stipulated. Respondent was \u201cdischarged\u201d from his position \u201cfor the reason that on March 23d, 1934,\u201d he was \u201cconvicted of false pretense\u201d in the Court of Quarter Sessions of the County of Essex, and was thereafter, on the ensuing April 6th, \u201cplaced on probation for a period of five years.\u201d He had been employed by the municipality for approximately twenty-seven years. His \u201crecord during- such -emplojunent was good.\u201d Following respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>discharge, the Civil Service Commission \u201cauthorized a hearing\u201d at his request, but it \u201cwas dismissed on November 12th, 1935, for lack of prosecution.\u201d His \u201cdismissal\u201d was \u201capproved\u201d by that body. On December 28th, 1936, respondent \u201crequested a hearing\u201d before the Civil Service Commission \u201crelative to his dismissal.\u201d The application was denied on January 5th, 1937. On November 27th, 1941, the Civil Service Commission, by letter, advised respondent\u2019s attorneys that \u201cthe Commission\u2019s rules and procedure under the law do not automatically bar a person who has been convicted of an offense by the courts, if such a person is an applicant for admission to any examination held under the jurisdiction of the Commission;\u201d and that \u201cThe applications of applicants in Civil Service examinations who may have, at some time, come under the notice of the courts, are given consideration and passed upon by the Commission as individual cases. The Commission seeks always to follow a policy that is equitable and conducive to public interest.\u201d It was stipulated that this letter \u201cshall be received in evidence and shall be regarded * * * as the official interpretation of the Civil Service Commission of\u201d the pertinent rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Eule 26 of the Civil Service Commission provides that the chief examiner and secretary \u201cmay reject the application of any person for admission to tests for a given position or refuse to test any applicant or to certify the name of an eligible from an employment list for any of the following or other good causes: * * * (d) That the applicant has been guilty of a crime or of disgraceful conduct; (e) That the applicant has been dismissed from employment in the public service or in a commercial or other organization for delinquency or misconduct;\u201d and \u201c(h) That the applicant has been previously employed in the classified service and has been removed for cause or did not resign in good standing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The question is one of construction and of legislative intent. <em>R. S. </em>43:13-10 provides that if a municipal employee shall be \u201csuspended, dropped or discharged from his employment after having paid his assessments for a period over one year and his suspension or discharge shall continue for a period longer than two years,\u201d the moneys he shall have paid into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>pension fund shall be returned to him, provided that such refund shall not he made \u201cto an employee suspended or discharged fox causes which bar him from eligibility to reappointment under the civil service rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">This latter clause is in the nature of a proviso; and its design was to deny a refund of contributions to the pension fund made by an employee suspended or discharged for a canse which gave rise to ineligibility under the rules and regulations of the Civil Service Commission. Eespondent is in this category. He was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. Eor this misconduct, he was discharged; and it was within the province of the Civil Service Commission, under the rule adverted to, to classify him as ineligible to \u201creappointment.\u201d The incapacity arose from the conviction of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">It is argued on respondent\u2019s behalf that the cited rule is permissive merely, and that the disqualification contemplated by the statute is such as is founded upon \u201creasons which absolutely, finally, definitely and unequivocally prevent his appointment or reappointment.\u201d It is said that an \u201cautomatic bar\u201d is the legislative concept. We do not entertain this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Eespondent\u2019s offense was such as to deprive him of \u201celigibility to reappointment\u201d under the subsisting civil service rules. It sufficed to sustain his discharge, and, by the same token, it rendered him ineligible to \u201creappointment.\u201d If, by reason of this misbehavior, the Civil Service Commission may lawfully refuse to certify respondent for reappointment, it must needs be on grounds of ineligibility. By the operation of the cited rule, respondent is bereft of the right to certification as qualified for \u201creappointment;\u201d and this is the statutory criterion. If the offense he such as to constitute a valid reason for disqualification, the discharged employee is ineligible to reappointment within the fair intendment of the statute. As respects this particular disability, the pertinent civil service rule is in no sense' arbitrary or unreasonable. One of the fundamental purposes of the pensioning of civil servants is to secure good behavior and the maintenance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>of a reasonable standard of discipline during service. <em>Plunkett </em>v. <em>Pension Commissioners of Hoboken, </em>113 <em>N. J. L. </em>230.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">There is no contention that this statutory provision is not complete in itself, and that it is in essence a delegation of legislative power, rather than the grant of a reasonable discretion in the exercise of a purely administrative function; and we therefore have no occasion to consider that question. The rules and regulations of the Civil Service Commission, adopted pursuant to statutory authoritjr, ordinarily have the force and effect of law if an adequate legislative standard is laid down.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The judgment is accordingly reversed, but without costs; and, since the facts were stipulated in the District Court, final judgment in favor -of appellant may be entered in this court in accordance with the practice. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ocean Castle, </em>59 <em>N. J. L. </em>198; <em>Elwood </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>104 <em>Id. </em>248; <em>affirmed, </em>105 <em>Id. </em>236.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
