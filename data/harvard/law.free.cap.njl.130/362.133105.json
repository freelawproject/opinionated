Erom the memorandum of the Chief Justice, it appears that the record of the hearing before the State Board of Tax Appeals was before him. It has not been submitted to this court. We have only a brief affidavit of prosecutor setting out the purchase price of the property. No other proof is submitted. Comment is made on the testimony of the city\u2019s expert, but this is controverted by respondents\u2019 affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">It has been repeatedly held that the purchase price of the property under review is not conclusive as to its fair market value. <em>City of Plainfield </em>v. <em>State Board of Tax Appeals, </em>126 <em>N. J. L. </em>407. In that case it was said: \u201cThere is at the outset a presumption in favor of the <em>quantum, </em>of the assessment as made by the local authority, and the <em>onus </em>of proving an excessive valuation is upon the landowner. <em>New Jersey Bell Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>City of </em>Newark, 118 <em>N. J. L. </em>490; <em>affirmed, </em>124 <em>Id. </em>451.\u201d See, also, <em>Gannon </em>v. <em>State Board of Tax Appeals, </em>123 <em>Id. </em>450.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Erom the record befoi\u2019e us, we are unable to discern any proof of an assessment in excess of fair value.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">The application is denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
