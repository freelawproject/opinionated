J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aql\">This action to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien terminated in the court below with the entry of a judgment of dismissal, from which the plaintiffs have appealed. Defendant Glick in her answer admits those allegations of the complaint wherein it is set forth that the plaintiffs Harry W. Andrews and Frank Cordano have been transacting business as copartners under the name of \u201cAndrews-Cordano Plumbing Company.\u201d However, by way of affirmative defense it is averred that said partnership had failed to file and publish the certificate required by section 2466 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Civil Code. The interposition of this defense, coupled with a motion to dismiss for the same reason, resulted in the entry of the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention that the trial court could not, in advance of the introduction of evidence, pass upon the question of lav/ thus presented is wholly without merit. The introduction of evidence would not, in any manner, assist in the solution of the problem, for the proposition of law was definitely shaped by the pleadings.  The object of section 2466, <em>supra, </em>is that public notice shall be given and a public record made of the individual members of partnerships with such definiteness and particularity that those dealing with them may at all times know who are the individuals with whom they are dealing or to whom they are giving credit or becoming bound. <em>(Meads etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Lasar, </em>92 Cal. 221, 226 [28 Pac. 935].)</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">It remains but to determine whether, within the meaning of that section, the name \u2018 \u2018 Andrews-Cordano Plumbing Company\u201d is a \u201cfictitious name, or a designation not showing the names of the persons interested as partners.\u201d The name is not, of course, fictitious. <em>(Spreckels </em>v. <em>Grace Darling Hospital Assn., </em>28 Cal. App. 646, 648 [153 Pac. 718].) It has, upon numerous occasions, been held that a name, such as \u201cPendleton &amp; Williams,\u201d is neither fictitious nor one failing to designate the partners. <em>(Pendleton </em>v. <em>Cline, </em>85 Cal. 142, 144 [24 Pac. 659]; <em>Carlock </em>v. <em>Cagnacci, </em>88 Cal. 600, 601 [26 Pac. 597]; <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Crow, </em>88 Cal. 644, 647 [26 Pac. <em>596]; Lamberson </em>v. <em>Bashore, </em>167 Cal. 387, 391 [139 Pac. 817].) In other words, it is definitely settled in this state that the usual form of partnership name consisting merely of the surnames of the partners, joined by or \u201cand,\u201d is not an assumed or fictitious name, or a designation not showing the names of the persons interested as partners. However, the name \u201cAbrams Bros.\u201d has been held not to definitely designate the persons interested as partners. <em>(North </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>135 Cal. 621, 623 [67 Pac. 1037].) It is there declared: \u201c \u2018Abrams Bros.\u2019 cannot be said to be a designation \u2018showing the names of the persons interested as partners. \u2019 The firm name might apply equally to a partnership composed of two or more and might embrace all or only some of the brothers of the name of Abrams.\u201d In our opinion, this quotation is peculiarly per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>tinent to the present ease, for, while it so happens that the name \u201cAndrews-Cordano Plumbing Company\u201d designates the names of all the persons interested as partners, it might equally as well apply to a partnership composed of more than \u25a0 two persons. In other words, this name, in and of itself, does not necessarily inform third persons desirous of transacting business with the partnership of the exact membership thereof. This is borne out by the case of <em>Meads etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Lasar, supra, </em>wherein it appeared that the name \u201cMeads, Seaman &amp; Co.\u201d designated only two of the three members of the firm. This court, in <em>Schwarz &amp; Gottlieb </em>v. <em>Marcuse, </em>175 Cal. 401, 403 [165 Pac. 1016], disapproved the holding in <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Byers, </em>17 Okl. 633 [10 Ann. Cas. 810, 89 Pac. 1114], wherein it was declared that the name \u201cPatterson Furniture Company\u201d definitely disclosed the members of the partnership to be named \u201cPatterson.\u201d In criticising the conclusion there announced, this court stated that \u201cEvidently the learned justice who wrote that opinion overlooked the fact that commonly the title \u2018Patterson Furniture Company\u2019 might indicate a corporation or partnership in which the stockholders or members might or might not be Pattersons.\u201d So it is in the instant case. The name \u201cAndrews-Cordano Plumbing Company\u201d might designate either a corporation or a partnership, the names of the stockholders or members of which need not necessarily appear in its title. We conclude, therefore, that the provisions of section 2466, <em>supra, </em>should have been complied with by the plaintiff partnership, and its failure in this regard is fatal to the maintenance of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Preston, J., Curtis, J., Langdon, J., Shenk, J., Seawell, J., and Richards, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
