The court further found that although no notice of completion or cessation from labor as provided by section 1187 of the Code of Civil Procedure was filed, said labor was duly completed on June 15, 1925; that defendant as a lien claimant at an expense of $1.70 duly perfected and filed for record its claim of lien. Complaint and summons were not served upon defendant Sexton and he made no appearance in the case. Judgment in accordance with said findings was duly entered for plaintiff for said sums of $545.08, $1.70, interest and costs, which sums the sheriff was directed to pay from the proceeds of sale of said real property and it was further adjudged that in case said property should not sell for enough to satisfy the amount in said decree provided, plaintiff have a deficiency judgment for the balance against defendants Benjamin and Helen Fireman.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Said defendants in prosecuting this appeal urge four grounds for reversal of said judgment, to wit: (1) Admission, over objection, of hearsay evidence as to amount and value of said building materials; (2) Lack of evidence that said materials were used in appellants\u2019 building; (3) Failure of the court to find upon an alleged accord and satisfaction;. (4) Error in directing a deficiency judgment against appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The first three contentions we find to be without merit. The only witness for plaintiff was J. D. Murphy, its salesman; nevertheless he testified that he was the very person who solicited the order from defendant Sexton and got the job and that he knew of his own knowledge that goods and materials of the amount and value specified in the itemized statement rendered the buyer, which was made an exhibit in the case, were actually delivered on the job, signed for, and that he was on the job at times and actually saw and knew that they were used in the work. In other words, the testimony of this witness, considered with the other evidence, amply supports the conclusion of the trial court. His position with plaintiff apparently was, and the court believed it to be, such that it was possible for him to speak of his own knowledge, and not through hearsay, as to the various matters which were the subject of his testimony, and that testimony, being believed, was amply sufficient to establish plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>With respect to the alleged accord and satisfaction, defendant Benjamin Fireman testified that on April 16, 1925, Mr. Murphy, plaintiff\u2019s said salesman, came to him and stated that he would he satisfied with a payment of $500 to cover materials for the whole job, all of which had been delivered and that the empty sacks would take care of the small balance; that accordingly defendant gave Mr. Murphy his check for that amount, saying he would not be responsible for any more materials, and received in return a receipt, introduced in evidence, which was partially torn and reads in part: \u201cReceived $500.20 from B. Fireman covering (tear) in full for Plastering materials. ...\u201d He further testified that defendant' Sexton abandoned the job and on several mornings thereafter a truck came and carried away plaster and other materials. Another witness also stated that he had seen materials removed by a truck from the job. In conflict with the above evidence is further testimony of Mr. Murphy to the effect that he received said $500 payment on account and gave therefor a receipt \u201cto date in full\u201d; that the portion torn from said receipt had contained the words \u201cto date\u201d; that some materials were returned to plaintiff by truck because they were unsatisfactory but that they were replaced by other goods suitable to defendants\u2019 need, as shown by credits appearing on the statement of account. Under such conflicting evidence support is found for the decision of the trial court that there was no accord and satisfaction but a finding to this effect was not required. If made it would have been adverse to appellants and its omission was immaterial as the findings made fully determine the cause <em>(Hertel </em>v. <em>Emireck, </em>178 Cal. 534 [174 Pac. 30]; <em>Alberti </em>v. <em>Jubb, </em>204 Cal. 325 [267 Pac. 1085].)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">The contention that the decree errs in directing a deficiency judgment against appellants must be sustained. Said decree, as to any deficiency shown by the sheriff\u2019s return on the sale of the property, constitutes a personal judgment against the owners thereof <em>(Hines </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>126 Cal. 683 [59 Pac. 142]; 17 Cal. Jur., sec. 157, p. 219), and under the pleadings here a personal judgment against said property owners is not justified. A lien claimant who has furnished material at the instance of a contractor is entitled to a personal or deficiency judgment against the contractor but not against the owner, unless the complaint shows the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>existence of a contract, express or implied, between said owner and the claimant <em>(Gibson </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>110 Cal. 243 [42 Pac. 810]; <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Lancaster, </em>72 Cal. App. 148, 150 [236 Pac. 970]; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Security T. &amp; S. Bank, </em>196 Cal. 557, 574 [238 Pac. 673]; 17 Cal. Jur., sec. 156, p. 217). The complaint in this case is predicated solely upon the employment of plaintiff by the contractor, alleging that \u201cwhile so engaged in the plastering of said building . . . defendant Sexton employed plaintiff\u201d to furnish said material and \u201cagreed to pay plaintiff therefor the reasonable value thereof.\u201d There is no allegation in any way indicating the existence of an express or implied contract between plaintiff and defendant owners. The claim of lien likewise alleges that said Sexton was \u201cthe contractor employed by said owners . . . and is the person who employed claimant to furnish materials. ...\u201d Under such pleadings, the evidence as to the subsequent dealings of said owners direct with plaintiff is ineffective as a basis for a deficiency judgment against the owners. The case of <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>is directly in point and determinative of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\">The. portion of said decree providing for said deficiency judgment, which reads: \u201cThat in case said real property should not sell for enough to pay and satisfy said sums in this decree above provided, that plaintiff have a deficiency judgment for the balance against defendants Benjamin and Helen Fireman, his wife,\u201d is hereby stricken out, but as otherwise rendered said decree is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Seawell, J., and Curtis, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
