The cause was tried before the court sitting without a jury. Upon the submission thereof findings of fact and conclusions of law were filed, wherein it .was found by the trial court that the seepage of water from the ditch had occurred, as alleged in plaintiff\u2019s complaint, through the defendant\u2019s negligence, and had resulted in the injuries complained of. From such judgment the defendant has prosecuted this appeal. The sole question presented thereon is as to whether the evidence is sufficient to justify the findings and judgment of the trial court. We have examined the record herein and, without attempting to review in detail the history of the construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>and operation of the defendant\u2019s ditch across the lands of plaintiff, or to state at length the causes from which the seepage of water from said ditch into and upon the lands of plaintiff occurred, with the resulting damage complained of, we are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the findings and conclusions of the trial court upon both counts of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">It follows that the judgment must be affirmed and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Langdon, J., and Shenk, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
