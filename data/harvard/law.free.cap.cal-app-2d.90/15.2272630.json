It appears that the property settlement agreement was executed while the parties were living together but nevertheless provides that thereafter, \u201cthe parties were to live separate and apart.\u201d Appellant contends that, in view of the reconciliation, \u201cthe trial court should have disregarded the Property Settlement Agreement and made an order respecting the real property by division in such manner as would be just.\u201d Appellant argues in that connection that, \u201cwhere the parties make the agreement in contemplation of a separation and thereafter reconcile, and it appears from their conduct that they have apparently intended to annul and forget all things done during the period of their unhappy difference, then said agreement and all things done pursuant thereto ought to be and, according to law, is annulled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Whether the parties intended to terminate the marriage settlement agreement was a question of intent. As to that issue, evidence of the resumption of marital relations, although material, is not necessarily conclusive. <em>(Plante </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>68 Cal.App.2d 582 at 587 [157 P.2d 421].) The effect of evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>dence with regard to such an issue is no different than the effect of evidence relating to other and different issues.  As stated by the court in <em>Mundt </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>35 Cal.App.2d 416 at p. 420 [95 P.2d 966], \u201cTrue, the evidence is uncontradicted but the rule is settled that even in such case \u2018if the inferences fairly deducible therefrom are such that different conclusions might rationally be drawn therefrom by men equally sensible and impartial, the conclusion reached by the jury, or the court sitting as such, should be deemed final and not disturbed on appeal ... In such case the decision of the trial court ... is as conclusive as where the conflict arises directly from the evidence.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The evidence is sufficient to support the findings and the judgment is not in violation of the law in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">York, P. J., and White, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
