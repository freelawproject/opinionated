J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azf\">The present action sought to recover from the defendants, husband and wife, a total sum of $2,-401.24. The first cause of action was based upon the theory of a constructive trust; a second count was for money had and received. Defendants answered by way of a general denial. The trial court found in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $1,000 and entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">It appears from the record that, at the age of 16 years, plaintiff left the Children\u2019s Baptist Home located at Inglewood, California, and for a period of some 16 months resided with a family by the name of Nix at Hermosa Beach. According to the testimony of Mrs. Nix, whose name had become Mrs. Bigger at the time of trial, plaintiff \u201cwas there as a child in the home\u201d; attended school, \u201con occasions helped me with the housework,\u201d but was not working for pay or for a place to live. During this period plaintiff\u2019s sister Faye was living with the defendants\u2019 family and in October, 1943, plaintiff also took up residence at the Locke home. The defendants were not related to the plaintiff in any way. While with the defendants, plaintiff graduated from high school in 1944, and in the fall of that year secured outside employment, continuing to live at the defendants\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">The definite arrangement as to plaintiff\u2019s residence with the defendants, and in reference to plaintiff\u2019s earnings, is a matter concerning which the evidence is in conflict. According to the defendants\u2019 testimony and the theory of appellants\u2019 brief, the plaintiff originally came to the Locke home \u201cas one of the family\u201d; defendants at all times stood <em>in loco parentis </em>to the plaintiff; any money earned by plaintiff and turned over to defendants merely went into a general family fund used for living expenses and the like, resulting in no liability to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">On the other hand, plaintiff testified that \u201cwhen I started to begin to work I wanted definitely to go to school and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>was a definite understanding that as far as I am concerned that the money was to be saved for my schooling.\u201d There was also evidence that some 18 of plaintiff\u2019s wage checks were indorsed over to the defendant Elizabeth Locke, totaling $468.18; that other wage checks in the amount of $1,062.24 were indorsed and cashed by the plaintiff. Plaintiff testified to paying doctor bills and other personal expenses and to purchasing groceries and other necessaries for the family with proceeds of these checks; that the balance remaining was turned over to and retained by Mrs. Locke.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">By way of deposition, plaintiff\u2019s sister Faye, who had also resided at the Locke home, testified, as stated in respondent\u2019s brief, that plaintiff \u201cwas asked to leave defendants\u2019 home because she had refused to hand over her last pay check.\u201d Henry R. Locke admitted that \u201cwhen Alice (plaintiff) left there was a little over $300.00 left in the bank,\u201d but that this was not paid to plaintiff. There was also testimony by Doris (Nix) Bigger to the effect that defendants had stated \u201cthey were helping her (plaintiff) save her money so that she might advance further in her art work.\u201d There was evidence, including Mrs. Bigger\u2019s testimony, that plaintiff performed various household duties in the defendants\u2019 home, and that \u201cshe was usually working in the house\u201d when the witness visited there.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The trial court found that the relation of <em>loco parentis </em>did not exist \u201cafter plaintiff\u2019s graduation from high school,\u201d or at any time; that after graduation plaintiff \u201cturned over to defendants approximately Fifteen Hundred ($1,500.00) Dollars with the agreement that plaintiff would pay for her clothes, dentist and doctor bills, and that plaintiff would continue to work nights, mornings and weekends in the home to pay for her room and board; that plaintiff spent for clothes, dentist and doctor bills approximately Five Hundred ($500.00) Dollars and that defendants are indebted to plaintiff in the sum of One Thousand ($1,000.00).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">It is appellants\u2019 contention that \u201cAll the evidence conclusively shows that plaintiff came into the home of defendants ... to live as a member of defendants\u2019 family like a daughter; that \u201cThe evidence establishes the relationship of loco parentis between plaintiff and defendants. Hence the findings of the lower court are not supported by the evidence.\u201d It is further argued in appellants\u2019 brief that \u201cThe findings of the court on a material issue (the <em>loco parentis </em>relation) are in irreconciliable conflict constituting reversible error\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>and that the findings in respect to the amount turned over to the defendants and the amount due plaintiff, are \u201cnot supported by any evidence nor allegations in plaintiff\u2019s first amended complaint.\u201d It is the theory of the appellants that since the defendants stood in the relation of <em>loco parentis </em>to plaintiff, defendants were entitled to Miss Leckie\u2019s earnings, and therefore that \u201cthe judgment for plaintiff is erroneous under the evidence and the law and should be reversed. \u2019 \u2019 The respondent\u2019s postion is that the record discloses substantial evidence to support the judgment and findings, and that in view of defendants\u2019 express agreement in reference to the use and saving of plaintiff\u2019s wages, plaintiff is entitled to recover the balance found to be due.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">There is no merit in appellants\u2019 contentions. As herein-before indicated, the record presents conflicting evidence, which conflict the trial court has resolved in respondent\u2019s favor. It cannot be doubted, however, that there is substantial evidence, a part of which has already been referred to, in support of the trial court\u2019s findings and judgment. Under such circumstances it is well established that a reviewing court will not interfere with the decision. The above rule here finds application both in respect to the finding that no relation <em>in loco parentis </em>existed between the parties, and to the trial court\u2019s further finding that there was an express contract under which the defendants became indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $1,000. There is no rule of law which would or should prevent such recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The judgment is affirmed..</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">White, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
