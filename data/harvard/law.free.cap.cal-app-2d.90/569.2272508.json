(Stats. 1935, ch. 352, p. 1226, as amended; 3 Deering\u2019s Gen. Laws, Act 8780d.) The trial court determined that \u201cThe services performed by the defendants\u2019 employees in baling hay constituted agricultural labor, and therefore, are excluded from the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act of the State of California. \u2019 \u2019 Judgment was rendered accordingly that plaintiff take nothing by the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The evidence shows without conflict that the defendants, J. V. Giesbrecht and his two sons, were engaged in the enterprise of baling hay, on contract, for various farmers in Merced County during the years from 1938 to 1941, inclusive. They were not employees of any of said farmers. They owned and operated two or three hay-baling outfits. They hired two crews, consisting of five men in each crew. The workmen were paid by the defendants a stipulated sum per ton. The defendants were paid a stipulated contract price per ton for baling the hay. The defendant Frank Giesbrecht testified regarding the basis upon which they conducted their hay-baling operations, and hired their workmen, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-10\">\u201cQ. Now did you hire men as employees in connection with your hay-baling operations? A. Yes. . . . Q. And did you pay them wages? A. Paid them by the ton, it was on a tonnage basis, <em>it was all contract labor.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">No contributions were paid by the defendants during the period of time which is involved in this suit, as required by the Unemployment Insurance Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>The only question on this appeal is whether the finding of the trial court that the hay-haling services performed by the defendants constituted \u201cagricultural labor\u201d is supported by any competent evidence. In other words, we are required to determine whether, under the undisputed facts of this case, the services performed by the defendants in baling hay were exempt from contributions because they constituted \u201cagricultural labor\u201d under section 7 (a) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, or as defined by rule 7.1 adopted by the commission. The last-mentioned rule appears on page 4 of appellant\u2019s opening brief, and is discussed and relied upon by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Rule 7.1 defines \u201cagricultural labor\u201d which is exempt from the provisions of the act to include all services performed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">\u201c(1) By an employee on a farm, in connection with the cultivation of the soil, the raising and harvesting of crops; . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">\u201c (2) By an employee in connection with the drying, processing, packing, packaging, transporting and marketing of materials which are produced on the farm or articles produced from such materials, providing such drying, processing, packing, packaging, transporting, or marketing is carried on as an incident to ordinary farming operations as distinguished from manufacturing or <em>commercial operations.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">\u2018\u2018The services hereinbefore set forth do not constitute agricultural labor <em>unless they are performed by an employee of the owner or tenant of the farm on which the materials in their raw or natural state were produced. Nor do such services constitute agricultural labor if they are carried on as an incident to manufacturing or commercial operations. . . .\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">The preceding rule has been uniformly upheld as a valid delegation of authority and a practical definition of agricultural labor as that term is used in the act in question. <em>(California Employment Com. </em>v. <em>Butte County Rice Growers Assoc., </em>25 Cal.2d 624, 632 [154 P.2d 892]; <em>California Employment Com. </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>67 Cal.App.2d 864, 867 [155 P.2d 702]; <em>California Employment Com. </em>v. <em>Kovacevich, </em>27 Cal.2d 546 [165 P.2d 917].)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">The respondents attempt to distinguish the application of the foregoing cases on the asserted ground that some of the work performed by their employees was performed by \u201ccutting, raking and baling hay\u201d on the farms where it was produced. However, there is no competent evidence in this case that the defendants cut or raked hay as a part of their hay-baling enterprise, or that any of defendants\u2019 workmen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>were <em>employed by the owners or tenants of farm land to cut </em>or rake their hay. The only language upon which the respondents rely in support of their assertion that any portion of said services was performed by \u2018\u2018cutting, raking and baling hay\u201d appears in a statement of Mr. Piester, one of defendants\u2019 hay balers, made in a transcript of evidence of a preassessment hearing held in Merced November 25, 1941, which was offered in evidence by plaintiff for the sole purpose of showing \u2018 \u2018 compliance by the plaintiff with the statutory administrative procedure of enforcing plaintiff\u2019s claim to unpaid contributions to the unemployment insurance fund. The offer was objected to by the defendants, but the objection was overruled and the record was received and marked Exhibit number 5. That record merely shows, on page 11, that the examiner inquired from Mr. Piester to determine how long he worked for the defendants as a hay baler, and if \u201che didn\u2019t work on Case .No. 1 ?\u201d to which he replied \u201cNo.\u201d He was then asked, \u2018\u2018But what did you do?\u201d to which he replied \u201cI went\u2014I run a little\u2014had a little cut down model A tractor, ... to pull a rake. And I was raking grained hay at that time.\u201d He was then asked, \u201cAnd was it an operation which was necessary and concerned with this hay baling operation\u2014part of it?\u201d to which he replied \u201cYes.\u201d Pie was then asked, \u201cIn other words, getting hay ready for the press; is that it?\u201d to which he answered, \u201cYes, all mowed and raked and put up and bagged.\u201d That is the only evidence in this record that any employee of the defendants cut or raked hay incident to the hay-baling operations or otherwise. That statement was not referred to in the evidence adduced at the trial. Neither party suggested at the trial that the cutting or raking of hay was a part of the hay-baling contract or enterprise. It definitely appears defendants hired their workmen and paid them a stipulated sum per ton. One of the defendants testified that they paid them \u201cby the ton, it was on a tonnage basis, it was all contract labor. \u2019 \u2019 Even though that statement is deemed to be competent evidence that the cutting and raking of hay may have been a part of the enterprise of baling hay by contract, which we do not concede, still it clearly appears such workmen were not <em>employees of the owners or tenants of the land </em>upon which the hay was produced, and upon the contrary, that they performed that service solely as defendants\u2019 workmen as a part of their hay-bailing contract. In any event that statement of Piester regarding his incidental raking of hay is not determinative of this appeal. That circumstance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>could not change the undisputed independent nature of the hay-baling enterprise. Even though one of defendants\u2019 workmen, on one occasion, performed some service in cutting or raking hay, which services may be exempt from the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act, it could not render the commercial enterprise of the defendants\u2019 baling of hay under contract wholly agricultural so as to exempt that industry from the provisions of the act. <em>(California Employment Com. </em>v. <em>Kovacevich, supra.) </em>The last cited authority distinguishes between services performed for the growers, under paragraph (1) of rule 7.1 \u201cin connection with the cultivation of the soil, the raising and harvesting of crops, \u2019 \u2019 which are agricultural in nature, from \u201ccommercial operations\u201d as provided by paragraph (2) of that rule. The former services are held to be agricultural labor which are exempt from the act, while the latter are held to be commercial in nature and therefore subject to the act. Quoting with approval from a case cited on page 557, the Supreme Court holds that \u201cAs soon as the fruit is delivered by the growers to the plaintiff for processing, grading, packing, and marketing, then the <em>exemption ceases. </em>\u2019 \u2019 (Italics added.) Applying that rule to the present case, it follows that, as soon as the hay was cut, raked, harvested and delivered to these defendants for baling, under their contract, the exemption from the act ceased, and the subsequent hay-baling operations became subject to contributions under that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">We are impelled to hold that the court erred in determining that defendants\u2019 hay-baling enterprise constitutes agricultural labor, and that it is therefore exempt from the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act. In the Rose case, <em>supra, </em>under almost exactly the same contracts and conditions which exist in this case, we definitely held that the baling of hay by contract, either on or off the farms\u201d where it was produced, constituted commercial operations which were subject to the act in question. That conclusion was approved by the Supreme Court in the Kovacevich case. It is true that the latter case disapproved certain quoted language in the Rose case. Commenting on the essential elements which led this court to decide that Rose was engaged in commercial operations of baling hay which subjected him to the payment of contributions under that act, the Supreme Court said at page 559:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">\u201c. . . However, the actual decision in the Rose ease is entirely in line with the views herein expressed. There the employer was engaged in the business of baling hay on contract for various farmers. Sometimes the hay was baled on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the farms where it was produced, but usually it was hauled to a central location nearby to save the cost and inconvenience of moving the hay-baling equipment. As so conducted, <em>such independent enterprise was distinct from the farmers\u2019 \u2018cultivation of the soil, the raising and harvesting of crops,\u2019 and the hay-baling labor would properly come within subdivision (2) of our rule as services \u2018in connection with the drying, processing, packing, packaging, ... of materials which are produced on the farm.\u2019 Labor so identified would not be agricultural unless \u2018performed by an employee of the owner or tenant of the farm on which the materials . . . were produced.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">\u201cFrom these observations it is clear that hay baling is an admirable example of \u2018the nature of the work, modified by the custom of doing it, \u2019 affecting the category into which the work falls\u2014agricultural or industrial.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The Kovacevich case involved the ownership and operation of a fruit packing plant by the defendant. He owned no farm, orchard or vineyard. He contracted with fruit growers, to purchase their crops on the trees or vines for stipulated prices. He sometimes contracted to irrigate and prune the vines or trees, and to <em>girdle, thin and harvest the crops. </em>The fruit was then hauled to his plant where it was processed and packed for market. The trial court determined that the defendant, having purchased unmatured crops which he cultivated and harvested, was engaged in agricultural labor, regardless of his packing plant operations, and therefore rendered judgment for the defendant. That judgment was reversed on appeal. The trial court was directed to determine the amount of contributions due from \u201cthat part of the services in question classified as \u2018packing house labor\u2019 and \u2018office help,\u2019 and to enter judgment for appellant accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Upon the foregoing authorities we conclude that the defendants in this case are liable for contributions based on all services rendered in the hay-baling enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Adams, P. J., and Peek, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
