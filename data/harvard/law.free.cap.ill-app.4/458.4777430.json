The claim was in the nature of a vendor\u2019s lien, and by the statute, redemption is allowed in case of sale under foreclosure of a vendor\u2019s, lien. In analogy to that statute, we think the same time should have been allowed.</p> <p id=\"b454-12\" pgmap=\"454(10) 455(67)\">It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed by this court that the decree of the court below he so modified that the appellant shall have one year from March the 15th, 1879, in which to pay the said sum of money in the decree of the court below mentioned, and that his equities shall not be barred until after the expiration of said time. In all other respects the decree of the court below is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b455-5\" pgmap=\"455\">Ordered that appellee pay all the costs of this court.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
