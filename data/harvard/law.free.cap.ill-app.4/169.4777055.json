Pending a motion for new trial, defendants were allowed to remit a further sum of $300, and thereupon the court entered judgment for the plaintiffs for $572.85, being the amount of the note, less $300 remitted. Held, error. The so-called remittitur of $300 was a solemn admission that the verdict for the defendants could not be sustained, and the court and defendants could not, without the consent of the plaintiff, agree upon a verdict for less than the amount of his claim.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-8\" pgmap=\"165\">Error to the Circuit Court of Woodford county; the Hon.

Pending a motion by plaintiff for a new trial, they were allowed further to remit the sum of $300, and thereupon the court, after overruling the motion, rendered judgment for the plaintiff for $572.85 damages\u2014being the amount of the note and interest computed, less $300\u2014and for costs.</p> <p id=\"b166-8\" pgmap=\"166(148) 167(70)\">This proceeding was novel, and we think, quite irregular. If the jury found counter claims it was their duty to set-off the one against the other and return their verdict for the party in \"whose favor was the difference, for the amount of that difference. We cannot know what they intended to find, except from their verdict. As returned and recorded, it required, if sustained by the court, a judgment for the defendants, and we know of no way in which it could be preserved and yet made the legal foundation of a judgment for the plaintiff. While the remittitur first entered extinguished the claim of defendants to all damages awarded them, and therefore all that they could remit, the finding might still be sustained, and a judgment rendered thereon in their favor, for costs. But the further remittitur, so-called, and the judgment entered, was a solemn admission, both by defendants and the court, that it could not be sustained. It should, therefore, have been set aside, in order that another jury might pass upon the plaintiff\u2019s whole claim. This was his right. It was not competent for the adverse party and the court, without his consent, to agree upon a verdict for him for any less, and compel his acceptance of a judgment thereon.</p> <p id=\"b167-5\" pgmap=\"167\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b167-6\" pgmap=\"167\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
