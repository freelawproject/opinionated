Statute, 1874, page 780, Secs. 43, 44. The court below should have continued the cause or have compelled the appellees to admit the affidavit in evidence under said Sec. 44 of the statute. The appellant used due diligence, and was entitled to a continuance.</p> <p id=\"b217-9\" pgmap=\"217\">Appellees claim that in accordance with certain rules of the court below, entered of record and adopted by the judges of the ourt, the appellant was in fault in not making his application sooner. In other words, in accordance with such rules, the appellant had not used due diligence in making his application for a continuance.</p> <p id=\"b217-10\" pgmap=\"217\">We have examined the record and bill of exceptions, and we are unable to find any reference or mention of any such rules in the entire record. We cannot know of the existence of such rules without they appear somewhere in the record..</p> <p id=\"b217-11\" pgmap=\"217\">For failure of the Circuit Court to grant a continuance on appellant\u2019s motion, the judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b217-12\" pgmap=\"217\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
