Defendant\u2019s credibility was properly impeached by questions about his prior convictions and prior bad acts, including those similar to the charges being presented to the Grand Jury <em>(see, People v Jones, </em>239 AD2d 234; <em>People v Spulka, </em>226 AD2d 321, <em>lv denied </em>88 NY2d 969; <em>see also, People v Pavao, </em>59 NY2d 282, 292). The Grand Jury was instructed on the limited purpose for which this testimony was received.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">When the People disclosed a police memo book entry that had not been provided during the suppression hearing, the trial court properly exercised its discretion in reopening the suppression hearing \u201conly to the extent necessary to cross-examine the People\u2019s witness as to the contents of the [memo book entry]\u201d <em>(People v Feerick, </em>93 NY2d 433, 452), and properly determined that no further relief was necessary. This was entirely appropriate since the memo book entry dealt with matters which the motion court had described as \u201cnot critical to my determining defendant\u2019s motion.\u201d Concur \u2014 Sullivan, P.
