In this appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred when it denied her motions to strike because the evidence was insufficient to prove that appellant caused injury to another or damage to property in excess of $1,000, as required by Code \u00a7 46.2-894. Finding no error, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">\u201cWhen examining a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party at trial and consider any reasonable inferences from the facts proved.\u201d <em>Viney v. Commonwealth, </em>269 Va. 296, 299, 609 S.E.2d 26, 28 (2005) (citing <em>Zimmerman v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 384, 386, 585 S.E.2d 538, 539 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">So viewed, the evidence indicated that during the early morning hours of May 26, 2009, appellant drove her car on Interstate 64 in Albemarle County. Appellant\u2019s car struck another car from behind. Denise Vargas (Vargas) was a passenger in the car that appellant struck. After it was struck, Vargas\u2019 car spun around a total of nine or ten times. Both cars came to a stop, and appellant unsuccessfully attempted to restart her car. Appellant then exited her car and approached Vargas\u2019 car, walking unsteadily. Appellant asked, \u201c[Wjhat\u2019s going on[?] [Wjhat\u2019s happening[?]\u201d before turning and walking back to her car. As the emergency vehicles approached with their lights and sirens engaged, appellant ran from the scene of the accident into nearby woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Appellant was found later that morning walking on the side of Interstate 64. At that time, appellant gave a written statement to the police in which she stated that she had been to a restaurant the night before and left to drive home. Regarding the accident, appellant stated that she had been looking for her cell phone so she opened her car door for light. She then remembered feeling \u201cjerked [and] hit.\u201d Appellant said that she was \u201cconfused\u201d at the time of the accident and that she felt she needed to call her mother and her friends. Appellant also said that she was \u201csad to [hear] that someone else was hurt [and] my car is in compound [sic], [and] we are all victims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Appellant was subsequently indicted for failure to stop at the scene of an accident in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-894.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">During appellant\u2019s bench trial, Vargas testified that she had pain in her back after the accident. She stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">I have a problem in my neck, as a result of a nervous tic. And because of the stress I could feel terrible pain ... in this part in my back. And then it was very hard and the tic came back very strong for a couple of weeks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">According to Vargas, she had gone to the emergency room after the accident. Regarding her medical treatment, Vargas testified that \u201c[t]he doctors checked me and they told me it was the muscle. The bone was not involved.\u201d Vargas also testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">[t]he impact was so strong I was afraid that something was going to happen to me, maybe that I was going to die. The ... paramedics insisted that I ... should go to the hospital, because I was so nervous that that could cause me of [sic] some concern.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Vargas also testified that she and the other passengers in the vehicle that was struck were frightened but \u201cokay\u201d after the accident. However, she also noted that the other passengers complained of pain. When asked to clarify her testimony that when she said the others were \u201cokay\u201d she meant that no one had died in the accident, Vargas responded, \u201cNo.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>addition, the following exchange occurred between Vargas and defense counsel during cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">Q And you indicated [the accident] was very stressful, scary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">A Yes____ It\u2019s the first time I was so near to being injured or maybe even dying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">Q Right. But you weren\u2019t injured, were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">A No, ... I could have been. Thank the Lord the car was on the other side. And that another truck didn\u2019t come and hit us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">Appellant made a motion to strike at the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief and presented no evidence. Following a continuance, appellant renewed her motion to strike, which the trial court denied. The trial court found appellant guilty of felony hit and run in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-894. The trial court found that Vargas was injured in the accident and that knowledge of that injury could be imputed to appellant. The trial court sentenced appellant to five years\u2019 incarceration, with all but ninety days suspended. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">On appeal, appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motions to strike because the evidence was insufficient to prove that Vargas was injured, as required to sustain a felony conviction under Code \u00a7 46.2-894.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Our analysis is guided by the often-stated principle that the judgment of the trial court shall not be set aside for insufficiency of the evidence unless the judgment \u201cis plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-680. Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">[w]hen considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, a reviewing court does not \u201cask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781 [2789], 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original; citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, we ask only \u201c \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maxwell v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 437, 442, 657 S.E.2d 499, 502 (2008) (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789) (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-6\"><em>Clanton v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 561, 566, 673 S.E.2d 904, 906-07 (2009) <em>(en banc). </em>This deferential standard of review \u201capplies not only to the historical facts themselves, but the inferences from those facts as well.\u201d <em>Crowder v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 658, 663 n. 2, 588 S.E.2d 384, 387 n. 2 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>In contrast, \u201c[t]he construction of a statute is a question of law that we review de novo upon appeal.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 45, 51, 645 S.E.2d 470, 473 (2007) (citing <em>Farrakhan v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 177, 180, 639 S.E.2d 227, 229 (2007); <em>Dowling v. Rowan, </em>270 Va. 510, 519, 621 S.E.2d 397, 401 (2005)). \u201c \u2018[T]he general rule of statutory construction is to infer the legislature\u2019s intent from the plain meaning of the language used.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meeks v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 798, 802, 651 S.E.2d 637, 639 (2007) (quoting <em>Hubbard v. Henrico Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>255 Va. 335, 340, 497 S.E.2d 335, 338 (1998)). \u201c[T]he plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to any curious, narrow, or strained construction.\u201d <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 456, 459, 309 S.E.2d 337, 338 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">To support a felony conviction under Code \u00a7 46.2-894, the Commonwealth must prove, among other things, that the accident caused injury to or the death of another. Code \u00a7 46.2-894. We find no Virginia appellate case law defining the type of injury the victim in a car accident must suffer to sustain a defendant\u2019s felony conviction under Code \u00a7 46.2-894. Additionally, we note that, unlike some other statutes, the legislature did not specify the <em>type </em>of injury that must occur under Code \u00a7 46.2-894 to support a felony conviction. <em>Cf. </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-51 (criminalizing malicious and unlawful wounding when defendants maliciously or unlawfully \u201cshoot, stab, cut, or wound any person or by any means cause him bodily injury\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the term \u201cinjury\u201d is not defined in the statute, we must give the word its \u201cordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Moyer v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 8, 35, 531 S.E.2d 580, 593 (2000) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cinjury,\u201d in part, as \u201c[a]ny harm or damage.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>801 (8th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>ed.2004). Similarly, Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary defines \u201cinjury\u201d as \u201can act that damages or hurts\u201d and \u201churt, damage, or loss sustained.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>644 (11th ed.2005). We recognize that \u201cpenal statutes are to be construed strictly against the [Commonwealth].\u201d <em>Hines v. Commonwealth, </em>59 Va.App. 567, 574, 721 S.E.2d 792, 795 (2012) (alteration in original) (citing <em>Wade v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 117, 122, 116 S.E.2d 99, 103 (I960)). However, the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cinjury\u201d leads to the conclusion that a so-called \u201csoft tissue\u201d injury such as muscle pain or damage constitutes harm, damage, or hurt and is therefore sufficient to prove an injury under Code \u00a7 46.2-894.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">From the evidence in the instant case, the trial court could infer that Vargas\u2019 back muscle was harmed or hurt and therefore that she was injured under Code \u00a7 46.2-894. Vargas testified that she felt a \u201cterrible pain\u201d in her back after the car accident. In addition, she testified that the doctors at the hospital examined her and \u201cand they told [her that her pain] was the muscle.\u201d The trial court could infer from this testimony that the doctors told Vargas her back pain was caused by a muscle injury. This evidence was therefore sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Vargas was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">In addition, the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the car accident caused Vargas\u2019 injury. To support this conclusion, we note that Vargas testified that she felt pain in her back <em>after the accident </em>and that the doctors at the hospital \u201ctold [her that her pain] was the muscle.\u201d Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must on appeal, because Vargas\u2019 pain occurred immediately after the accident and her doctors related her pain to her back muscle, we hold that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>court could infer that the car accident injured Vargas\u2019 back muscle, causing Vargas\u2019 pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument that Vargas\u2019 testimony that no one was injured in the accident shows that the evidence was insufficient to prove an injury, the trial court was entitled to reject Vargas\u2019 testimony on that point while crediting her testimony regarding her back pain and her doctors\u2019 statements. <em>Commonwealth v. McNeal, 282 </em>Va. 16, 22, 710 S.E.2d 733, 736 (2011) (stating that a fact finder can \u201cresolv[e] conflicts in a single witness\u2019 testimony, accepting that part of the testimony it deems credible and rejecting the portion it deems incredible\u201d). Moreover, on appeal, we \u201c \u2018must presume\u2014even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record\u2014that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts [in the evidence] in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harper v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 517, 523, 642 S.E.2d 779, 782 (2007) (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 326, 99 S.Ct. at 2793).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence was sufficient to prove Vargas\u2019 back pain was caused by the car accident at issue in this case. Additionally, under the plain meaning of the word \u201cinjury,\u201d we hold that a soft tissue injury such as muscle pain constitutes an injury within the meaning of Code \u00a7 46.2-894. Therefore, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-13\">. Code \u00a7 46.2-894 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-14\">The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident in which a person is killed or injured or in which an attended vehicle or other attended property is damaged shall immediately stop as close to the scene of the accident as possible without obstructing traffic ... and report his name, address, driver's license number, and vehicle registration number forthwith to the State Police or local law-enforcement agency, to the person struck and injured if such person appears to be capable of understanding and retaining the information, or to the driver or some other occupant of the vehicle collided with or to the custodian of other damaged property. The driver shall also render reasonable assistance to any person injured in such accident, including taking such injured person to a physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>cian, surgeon, or hospital if it is apparent that medical treatment is necessary or is requested by the injured person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">ifc * $ * # &amp;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">Any person convicted of a violation of this section is guilty of (i) a Class 5 felony if the accident results in injury to or the death of any person, or if the accident results in more than $1000 of damage to property or (ii) a Class 1 misdemeanor if the accident results in damage of $1000 or less to property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">Appellant does not argue that the evidence was insufficient to prove that appellant knew or should have known of Vargas\u2019 injury, which is required to support a conviction under Code \u00a7 46.2-894. <em>See Neel v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 389, 395, 641 S.E.2d 775, 777-78 (2007). As a result, we will not address this issue in the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">In addition, because we hold that appellant's felony conviction can be upheld on the basis of Vargas\u2019 injury, we will not address the element of property damage of more than $1,000, the other basis for sustaining a felony conviction under Code \u00a7 46.2-894.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-7\"><em>. This </em>Court, however, <em>has </em>interpreted <em>the </em>general <em>term </em>\"bodily injury\u201d found in Code \u00a7 18.2-51 to include soft tissue and internal injuries. <em>English v.

This determination is consistent with the holding we reach in the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b111-7\">. In further support of this determination, we note that the Virginia Supreme Court has upheld awards of damages for soft tissue injuries such as muscle strains, spasms, and pain in the context of personal injury suits. <em>See Toombs v.
