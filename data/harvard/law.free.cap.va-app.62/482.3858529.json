Snowden (appellant) appeals his conviction of failing to appear in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-128. On appeal, appellant argues that the circuit court \u201cerred when it overruled Appellant\u2019s objection to the entry of all of the Commonwealth\u2019s exhibits in the second trial.\u201d Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b531-15\">On November 22, 2011, Investigator William Lee of the Norfolk Police Department served appellant with a warrant of arrest for grand larceny. On December 6, 2011, appellant signed a recognizance agreeing to appear for his preliminary hearing in the Norfolk General District Court on December 28, 2011, on the grand larceny charge. Appellant did not appear in the general district court on December 28, 2011, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>at some point thereafter, the general district court issued a warrant for appellant\u2019s arrest, citing him for failing to appear in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-128. The Norfolk Circuit Court grand jury indicted appellant on both the grand larceny and failure to appear charges on March 21, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">A bench trial on appellant\u2019s failure to appear charge commenced on May 17, 2012, at which the Commonwealth offered into evidence the warrant for appellant\u2019s arrest on the grand larceny charge. Appellant did not object. Next, the Commonwealth offered a certified copy of the subpoena summoning Investigator William Lee of the Norfolk Police Department to appellant\u2019s December 28, 2011 preliminary hearing. The trial court admitted the subpoena into evidence over appellant\u2019s objection to its authenticity. Appellant argued that the subpoena was not properly authenticated or certified because the subpoena was issued by the general district court but certified by the circuit court clerk. The trial court also admitted a certified copy of the December 6, 2011 recognizance signed by appellant and a certified copy of the warrant for appellant\u2019s arrest for failure to appear at the December 28, 2011 preliminary hearing, over appellant\u2019s same objections to authenticity.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">At the conclusion of the trial, the trial court found appellant guilty of failure to appear. Appellant filed his notice of appeal on September 6, 2012. On September 26, 2012, the trial court entered a sentencing order sentencing appellant to seven months\u2019 incarceration with all seven months suspended. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">On appeal, appellant argues that the trial court erred in admitting the Commonwealth\u2019s exhibits over his objections because Code \u00a7 8.01-889 requires certification by the clerk of the court \u201cwhere preserved to be a true record.\u201d Appellant contends that, because the Commonwealth\u2019s exhibits originated in the general district court, they must have been certified by the general district court clerk, not the circuit court clerk, to be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\u201c \u2018The admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 570, 576, 643 S.E.2d 497, 500 (2007) (quoting <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988)). \u201cAn issue of statutory interpretation presents a pure question of law, which we review de novo on appeal.\u201d <em>Young v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 528, 533, 643 S.E.2d 491, 493 (2007) (citing <em>Conyers v. Martial Arts World of Richmond, Inc., </em>273 Va. 96, 104, 639 S.E.2d 174, 178 (2007)). \u201cWe determine the meaning of certain statutory language from the express words contained in the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 449, 454, 634 S.E.2d 310, 313 (2006); <em>Alger v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 255, 259, 590 S.E.2d 563, 565 (2004); <em>Tucker v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 490, 493, 604 S.E.2d 66, 68 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u201cAs a general rule, no writing may be admitted into evidence unless and until it has been \u201cauthenticated\u201d. . . .\u201d <em>Proctor v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 937, 938, 419 S.E.2d 867, 868 (1992) (quoting Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 180 (3d ed.1988)). \u201cAuthentication is merely the process of showing that a document is genuine and that it is what its proponent claims it to be.\u201d <em>Owens v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 309, 311, 391 S.E.2d 605, 607 (1990) (citing Friend, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 180; Fed.R.Evid. 901).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Code \u00a7 8.01-389(A) provides that \u201c[t]he records of any judicial proceeding and any other official records of any court of this Commonwealth shall be received as prima facie evidence provided that such records are certified by the clerk of the court <em>where preserved </em>to be a true record.... \u201d (Emphasis added). Code \u00a7 8.01-389(F) provides that \u201ccertification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>any record pursuant to this section shall automatically authenticate such record for the purpose of its admission into evidence in any trial, hearing, or proceeding.\u201d Under Code \u00a7 8.01-389, a judicial record may be authenticated by the written certification of the clerk of the court holding the record. <em>Owens, </em>10 Va.App. at 311, 391 S.E.2d at 606-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Appellant argues that \u201cpreserved\u201d means \u201coriginated\u201d and therefore, because the subpoenas and recognizance related to appellant\u2019s grand larceny trial originated in the general district court, the documents must have been certified by the general district court clerk to be properly authenticated and admissible pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-389(A) and (F). The Commonwealth however, argues that the records may be authenticated and certified by the court holding the record. Code \u00a7 16.1-69.55 provides that \u201c[i]n felony cases which are certified to the grand jury, all documents shall be certified to the clerk of the appropriate circuit court----\u201d Thus, following a felony indictment, as in this case, the general district court must have certified its records to the circuit court and at that point, the circuit court became the court where the records \u201care preserved to be a true record.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-389(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">We agree with the Commonwealth\u2019s argument and hold that the records were properly certified by the circuit court clerk. \u201c \u2018[I]n the absence of evidence to the contrary, the court may presume that public officers have properly discharged their official duties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crews v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 115, 119, 442 S.E.2d 407, 409 (1994) (quoting <em>Robertson v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 854, 856-57, 406 S.E.2d 417, 418 (1991)). Therefore, we presume that the records from the general district court were certified to the circuit court as provided by Code \u00a7 16.1-69.55(A)(2) when appellant\u2019s felony charges were certified to the grand jury. Thus, following a felony indictment, the district court certifies its records to the circuit court and the records become a part of the circuit court\u2019s file. At the point when the records were certified to the circuit court, the circuit court became the court where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>records were preserved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the circuit court clerk was the proper authority to certify the records. As a result, the records were properly authenticated under Code \u00a7 8.01-389(A) when the circuit court clerk certified them and admissible as evidence pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-389(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the circuit court did not err in admitting the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-9\">. The codified Virginia Rules of Evidence were not in effect at the time of appellant\u2019s trial and so do not apply. However, Rule 2:901 provides: \"The requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the thing in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b535-7\">. For purposes of Code \u00a7 8.01-389, we hold that \"preserved\u201d means to hold or maintain. Thus, we reject the appellant's argument that \"preserved\u201d means where the records originated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
