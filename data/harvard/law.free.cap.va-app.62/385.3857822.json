On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred 1) by refusing to give his proffered jury instructions I, J, K, and L, which he contends precisely and correctly defined what constituted \u201coperation\u201d and 2) by convicting him of operating under the influence of alcohol based on a finding that he \u201ctook an action in sequence\u201d to activate his motor vehicle when sleeping in the driver\u2019s seat parked in his private driveway with the key in the auxiliary position and only the radio turned on. For the following reasons, this Court affirms appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">On appeal, \u201c \u2018we consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences flowing from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 439, 442, 642 S.E.2d 295, 296 (2007) (en banc) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 666, 672, 594 S.E.2d 595, 598 (2004)). So viewed, the evidence is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">On January 20, 2011, Officer K.E. McBrearty (\u201cMcBrearty\u201d), with the Charlottesville Police Department, received a noise complaint around 3:30 a.m. Pursuant to the complaint, McBrearty arrived at appellant\u2019s home and discovered appellant asleep in the driver\u2019s seat of his Mercedes, which was parked in the driveway with the radio on. McBrearty knocked several times on the window of the vehicle with her flashlight in an attempt to wake appellant up. After appellant awoke, appellant turned the key to turn off the auxiliary power, opened the door, and stepped out of the vehicle. When appellant stepped out of the vehicle, McBrearty smelled a strong odor of alcohol coming from his person and noticed that his eyes were bloodshot and glassy.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">In response to McBrearty\u2019s questions, appellant stated that he had consumed several beers at a pub after which he drove to the \u201cCorner\u201d store to purchase some food. Appellant then drove home, ate the food he had purchased, and consumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>additional alcohol. At 2:30 a.m., appellant went out to his car to listen to the radio and fell asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">McBrearty then asked appellant to perform a series of field sobriety tests. Appellant was unable to successfully complete the walk-and-turn test, the one-legged stand test, and the finger-to-nose test. Appellant, however, successfully completed the alphabet test, and was cooperative with McBrearty. After the preliminary breath test, McBrearty arrested appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">On August 7, 2012, prior to trial, appellant moved the trial court to properly define the words \u201coperate\u201d or \u201coperation\u201d for the jury. Appellant argued that based on the definition of \u201coperation\u201d applied in <em>Enriquez v. Commonwealth, </em>283 Va. 511, 516-17, 722 S.E.2d 252, 255 (2012), he could not be convicted of driving under the influence because his vehicle was located on a private driveway and not on a public highway. The trial court took appellant\u2019s motion under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">On September 4, 2011, appellant filed a supplemental memorandum arguing that he could not be convicted of operating under the influence because he was parked in his private driveway and did not take \u201can action in sequence\u201d to operate his motor vehicle or intend to activate the motive power of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">At trial on September 12, 2012, appellant moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence after the Commonwealth\u2019s casein-chief, which the trial court took under advisement. Appellant then offered the testimony from his housemate, Abigail Wiebe (\u2018Wiebe\u201d). Wiebe testified that she heard appellant return home around 1:45 a.m., and awoke again around 3:30 a.m. to find appellant and two police officers in front of the house. Wiebe stated that the stereo in the living room had a broken volume knob, and confirmed that it was replaced a few months after the incident. A receipt of the repair was admitted into evidence. Kristin Cornwell (\u201cCornwell\u201d), appellant\u2019s neighbor, also testified that she awoke around 3:00 a.m. due to the sound of music, but that she could not determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>source. Cornwell then woke again around 3:30 a.m. to the sound of McBrearty tapping her flashlight on appellant\u2019s car window. She then observed appellant\u2019s interaction with the police officers and his performance of the field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Appellant then testified that he left the pub around 1:30 a.m. after drinking beer and vodka while socializing with coworkers for nearly four hours. Appellant then drove to the Corner store, purchased a sandwich, and drove home. After arriving home around 1:45 a.m., appellant stated that he had several drinks containing vodka, and then went outside to his car around 2:30 a.m. to listen to the radio. At the conclusion of the evidence, appellant renewed his motion to strike the evidence, which the trial court again took under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Prior to jury deliberations, the trial court refused appellant\u2019s proffered jury instructions I, J, K, and L, which stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">[Instruction I:] Operating\u2014Definition</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8M\">Operating means driving a motor vehicle <em>from </em>one place <em>to </em>another; starting the engine; or engaging the machinery of a vehicle which alone or in sequence will activate the motive power of the vehicle without actually putting the vehicle in motion; or manipulating the electrical or mechanical equipment which alone or in sequence will activate the motive power of the vehicle without actually putting the vehicle in motion. Any individual who is in actual physical control of a vehicle on a public roadway is an operator. When the engine is not running in a private driveway, the Commonwealth must prove by direct or circumstantial evidence that the defendant specifically intended to activate the motive power of the vehicle to enter a public roadway while under the influence of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">[Instruction J:] Private Road or Driveway\u2014Definition</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9q\">Private road or driveway means every way in private ownership and used for vehicular travel by the owner and those having express or implied permission from the owner, but not by other persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">[Instruction K:] Operator\u2014Definition</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Operator means every person who drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle on a highway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">[Instruction L:] Highway\u2014Definition</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">Highway means the entire width between the boundary lines of every way or place open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel in the Commonwealth, including the streets and alleys, and, for law-enforcement purposes, the entire width between the boundary lines of all private roads or private streets that have been specifically designated \u201chighways\u201d by an ordinance adopted by the governing body of the county, city, or town in which such private roads or streets are located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The trial court used the Commonwealth\u2019s proffered jury instruction defining operation, which provided the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">Operating a motor vehicle means driving the vehicle from one place to another or starting the engine or manipulating the electrical or mechanical equipment of the vehicle without actually putting the vehicle in motion or engaging the machinery of the vehicle which alone or in sequence will activate the motive power of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">The trial court also gave an \u201celements\u201d instruction, which stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">The defendant is charged with the crime of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements of that crime:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-11\">(1) That the defendant, Justin Sarafin, was operating a motor vehicle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-12\">(2) That at the time he was under the influence of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-13\">If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the above elements of the crime as charged, then you shall find the defendant guilty but you shall not fix the punishment until your verdict has been returned and further evidence has been heard by you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>If you find that the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt any one or more of the elements of the crime, then you shall find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">On September 17, 2012, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motions to strike the evidence. It found that the Supreme Court did not interpret Code \u00a7 18.2-266 in <em>Enriquez </em>to require that an operator be on a public highway in order to be guilty of driving under the influence as the Supreme Court \u201cwas not addressing that question in <em>Enrique[z </em>].\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred 1) by refusing to give his proffered jury instructions I, J, K, and L, which precisely and correctly defined what constituted \u201coperation\u201d and 2) by convicting him of operating under the influence of alcohol based on a finding that he \u201ctook an action in sequence\u201d to activate his motor vehicle when sleeping in the driver\u2019s seat parked in his private driveway with the key in the auxiliary position and only the radio turned on. Both of appellant\u2019s arguments are premised on his assertion that Virginia\u2019s driving under the influence statute, as interpreted in <em>Nelson v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 212, 707 S.E.2d 815 (2011), and <em>Enriquez, </em>288 Va. at 511, 722 S.E.2d at 252, prohibits intoxicated operation of an automobile only on a public highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">A. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">Appellant first argues that the trial court erred by refusing to give his proffered jury instructions I, J, K, and L, which he contends precisely and correctly defined what constituted \u201coperation.\u201d Specifically, appellant argues that the model jury instruction used incorrectly stated the law and that he was not operating a vehicle because he was in his car parked in his private driveway. In addition, appellant asserts that there is no proof that he intended to activate the motive power of the vehicle and drive it because he was not in actual physical control of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>1. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u201cWhen reviewing a trial court\u2019s refusal to give a proffered jury instruction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the proponent of the instruction.\u201d <em>Lawlor v. Commonwealth, </em>285 Va. 187, 228-29, 738 S.E.2d 847, 871 (2013). In reviewing jury instructions on appeal, \u201c[w]e review jury instructions \u2018to see that the law has been clearly stated and that the instructions cover all issues which the evidence fairly raises.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 738 S.E.2d at 870 (quoting <em>Cooper v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 377, 381, 673 S.E.2d 185, 187 (2009)). \u201cThis is a mixed question of law and fact. It is error to give an instruction that incorrectly states the law; \u2018whether a jury instruction accurately states the relevant law is a question of law that we review de novo.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Orthopedic &amp; Sports Physical Therapy </em>Assocs., <em>Inc. v. Summit Group Props., LLC, </em>283 Va. 777, 782, 724 S.E.2d 718, 721 (2012)). \u201cA trial court has a duty when instructing the jury to define each element of the relevant offense. . . . [A]s noted above, what the elements are is a question of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229, 738 S.E.2d at 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\u201c \u2018[J]ury instructions are proper only if supported by the evidence,\u2019 and more than a scintilla of evidence is required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 738 S.E.2d at 870-71 (quoting <em>Orbe v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 390, 398, 519 S.E.2d 808, 813 (1999)). In addition, \u201c \u2018[w]hen granted instructions fully and fairly cover a principle of law, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in refusing another instruction relating to the same legal principle.\u2019\u201d <em>Ngomondjami v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 310, 316, 678 S.E.2d 281, 284 (2009) (quoting <em>Gaines v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 562, 568, 574 S.E.2d 775, 778 (2003) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">2. Code \u00a7 18.2-266</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">In the present case, appellant argues that the trial court incorrectly denied his jury instructions defining \u201coperating,\u201d \u201cprivate road or driveway,\u201d \u201coperator,\u201d and \u201chighway,\u201d which were accurate statements of the law, in contrast to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>model jury instruction defining \u201coperation,\u201d which he contends was vague, confusing, and no longer an accurate statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In addressing appellant\u2019s argument, we must determine what is proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-266. \u201c \u2018[A]n issue of statutory interpretation is a pure question of law which we review de novo.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, 58 </em>VaApp. 35, 48, 707 S.E.2d 17, 24 (2011) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Evans v. Evans, </em>280 Va. 76, 82, 695 S.E.2d 173, 176 (2010)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">\u201cWhen the language of a statute is unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language. Furthermore, we must give effect to the legislature\u2019s intention as expressed by the language used unless a literal interpretation of the language would result in a manifest absurdity. If a statute is subject to more than one interpretation, we must apply the interpretation that will carry out the legislative intent behind the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 48-49, 707 S.E.2d at 24 (quoting <em>Evans, </em>280 Va. at 82, 695 S.E.2d at 176). \u201cAccordingly, \u2018[t]he plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is to be preferred over any curious, narrow, or strained construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>Evans, </em>280 Va. at 82, 695 S.E.2d at 176). \u201c Where the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crislip v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 66, 71-72, 554 S.E.2d 96, 98 (2001) (quoting <em>Dominion Trust Co. v. Kenbridge Constr., </em>248 Va. 393, 396, 448 S.E.2d 659, 660 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Furthermore, \u201c[i]n interpreting a statute, \u2018the Code of Virginia constitutes a single body of law, and other sections can be looked to where the same phraseology is employed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moyer v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 8, 35, 531 S.E.2d 580, 593 (2000) (en banc) (quoting <em>Hart v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 77, 79, 441 S.E.2d 706, 707 (1994)). In addition, \u201c \u2018when one statute speaks to a subject in a general way and another deals with a part of the same subject in a more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>specific manner, the two should be harmonized, if possible, and where they conflict, the latter prevails.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daniels v. Warden of the Red Onion State Prison, </em>266 Va. 399, 402-03, 588 S.E.2d 382, 384 (2003) (quoting <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 1, 22-23, 419 S.E.2d 606, 618 (1992)). Yet, \u201cwhen the General Assembly has used specific language in one instance, but omits that language or uses different language when addressing a similar subject elsewhere in the Code, we must presume that the difference in the choice of language was intentional.\u201d <em>Zinone v. Lee\u2019s Crossing Homeowners Ass\u2019n, </em>282 Va. 330, 337, 714 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-266 provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD\">[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to drive or operate any motor vehicle, engine or train (i) while such person has a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or more by weight by volume or 0.08 grams or more per 210 liters of breath as indicated by a chemical test administered as provided in this article, (ii) while such person is under the influence of alcohol, (iii) while such person is under the influence of any narcotic drug or any other self-administered intoxicant or drug of whatsoever nature, or any combination of such drugs, to a degree which impairs his ability to drive or operate any motor vehicle, engine or train safely, (iv) while such person is under the combined influence of alcohol and any drug or drugs to a degree which impairs his ability to drive or operate any motor vehicle, engine or train safely, or (v) while such person has a blood concentration of any of the following substances at a level that is equal to or greater than: (a) 0.02 milligrams of cocaine per liter of blood, (b) 0.1 milligrams of methamphetamine per liter of blood, (c) 0.01 milligrams of phencyclidine per liter of blood, or (d) 0.1 milligrams of 3, 4-methylenedi-oxymethamphetamine per liter of blood. A charge alleging a violation of this section shall support a conviction under clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">For the purposes of this article, the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d includes mopeds, while operated on the public highways of this Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>In 1961, the Supreme Court noted in interpreting a county ordinance similar to Code \u00a7 18.2-266 that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\">[i]t has been generally held that an ordinance or statute which provides that no person shall drive or operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants, and is silent as to the place where the offense may be committed, does not require as an element of the offense that the driving or operating shall be on a public highway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\"><em>Valentine v. Brunswick Cnty., </em>202 Va. 696, 698, 119 S.E.2d 486, 487 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Three years later, the Supreme Court addressed the driving under the influence statute and analyzed the word \u201coperate\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.1-54, now codified as Code \u00a7 18.2-266, in <em>Gallagher v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 666, 139 S.E.2d 37 (1964). The Supreme Court noted at the outset that the term \u201coperate\u201d was not defined in Code \u00a7 18.1-54, but that it was defined in Code \u00a7 46.1-1(17), now codified in Code \u00a7 46.2-100. That statute defined \u201coperator,\u201d in part, as \u201c \u00a3[e]very person who drives or is <em>in actual physical control </em>of a motor vehicle.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 668, 139 S.E.2d at 39 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court then held that \u201cthe word \u2018operate\u2019 in \u00a7 18.1-54 is not limited to moving the vehicle from one place to another, but includes the acts of the defendant in this case in operating the mechanism of his automobile in the manner and for the purpose described above.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 670, 139 S.E.2d at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">In 1971, the Supreme Court again addressed the issue of whether a defendant, who was parked on a public highway with the motor running and in gear and who was \u201cslumped\u201d over the steering wheel, was \u201coperating\u201d a motor vehicle pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.1-54. <em>Nicolls v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 257, 259, 184 S.E.2d 9, 11 (1971). It noted that in <em>Gallagher, </em>it had \u201capproved [the Code \u00a7 46.1-1(17) \u2018operator\u2019] definition for the purpose of determining whether one \u2018operates\u2019 a motor vehicle within the meaning of [Code] \u00a7 18.1-54.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on the definition in <em>Gallagher, </em>the Supreme Court affirmed Nieolls\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>In <em>Williams v. City of Petersburg, </em>216 Va. 297, 217 S.E.2d 893 (1975), the Supreme Court reiterated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuJ\">\u201c[operating\u201d not only includes the process of moving the vehicle from one place to another, but also includes starting the engine, or manipulating the mechanical or electrical equipment of the vehicle without actually putting the car in motion.

Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 351, 353, 477 S.E.2d 301, 302 (1996). \u201cOther than for the operation of a moped, the statute does not specify that the driving or operating that it criminalizes must occur on a public highway, and [this Court] decline[s] the invitation to construe the statute to impose that requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, this Court noted, in contravention to the preceding cases,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that \u201c \u2018Code \u00a7 18.2-266 is not a highway regulation and cannot be construed as part of the general codification of the State motor vehicle laws.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353, 477 S.E.2d at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">In <em>Mitchell v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 27, 492 S.E.2d 839 (1997), this Court again addressed whether an individual could be convicted under Code \u00a7 18.2-266 when operating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>vehicle on privately owned property. Relying on <em>Gray, </em>this Court held \u201cthat public ownership of the property upon which the vehicle is driven or operated is not an element the Commonwealth must prove in a prosecution for driving in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35, 492 S.E.2d at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Three years later, citing <em>Valentine, </em>this Court again held that a county ordinance, similar to Code \u00a7 18.2-266, did not require that the driving or operating occur on a public highway. <em>Reynolds v. City of Va. Beach, </em>31 Va.App. 629, 630-31, 525 S.E.2d 65, 66 (2000). In making this determination, this Court noted that the cases appellant relied upon did not support appellant\u2019s position \u201cas they discuss[ed] the requirement that the person charged with the offense be the \u2018operator\u2019 of the vehicle,\u201d and they \u201creferred] to Code \u00a7 46.2-100 which defines operator as one \u2018who ... \u2019 (i) drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle on a highway,\u201d which definition was inapplicable in <em>Reynolds </em>as it is \u201cexpressly applicable only to Title 46.2 and do[es] not control Title 18.2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631, 525 S.E.2d at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In 2009 in <em>Ngomondjami, </em>this Court analyzed whether the defendant, who was found unconscious in the driver\u2019s seat of a car with its engine running in a school parking lot, could be convicted of operating a motor vehicle without proof that he intended to put the vehicle in motion. <em>Ngomondjami, </em>54 Va.App. at 314-17, 678 S.E.2d at 283-85. We held \u201cit was not necessary that the jury find [the defendant] acted \u2018with the purpose of putting [a car] in motion\u2019 to find he \u2018operated\u2019 a car within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-266.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318, 678 S.E.2d at 285. In reaching this determination, this Court noted that \u201c[a]n \u2018operator\u2019 of a car is defined as any person \u2018who either [ ] drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317, 678 S.E.2d at 284 (quoting Code \u00a7 46.2-100). We also noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">\u201c[operating\u201d a car within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 \u201cnot only includes the process of moving the vehicle from one place to another, but also includes <em>starting the engine, or manipulating the mechanical or electrical equipment of the vehicle without actually putting the car in motion. It </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number><em>means engaging the machinery of the vehicle which alone, or in sequence, will activate the motive power of the vehicle.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Stevenson v. City of Falls Church, </em>243 Va. 434, 438, 416 S.E.2d 435, 438 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Two years later, the Supreme Court held in <em>Nelson </em>that Nelson\u2019s actions of placing the key in the ignition while parked on a cul-de-sac in a residential area and turning it to the \u201con or accessory position\u201d to activate the radio \u201cconstituted \u2018manipulating the ... electrical equipment of the vehicle.\u2019 \u201d 281 Va. at 219, 707 S.E.2d at 818.

In <em>Enriquez, </em>the Supreme Court analyzed when a person is \u201coperating a motor vehicle as a matter of law\u201d and held that \u201cthe statutory definition of \u2018operator\u2019 [in Code \u00a7 46.2-100] is controlling and that any individual who is in actual physical control of a vehicle is an \u2018operator.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515-16, 722 S.E.2d at 255. In reaching its determination, the Supreme Court adopted the rationale of the dissenting opinion in <em>Stevenson, </em>which had been decided by a vote of four to three, and cited the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>\u201cOrdinary experience tells us that one in a drunken stupor in the driver\u2019s seat of a vehicle is likely to arouse abruptly, engage the motive power of the vehicle, and roar away imperiling the lives of innocent citizens. This sequence of events easily can occur where, as here, a drunk is sitting behind the steering wheel of a motor vehicle alone, with the key already in the ignition. From a mechanical standpoint, the vehicle is capable of being immediately placed in motion to become a menace to the public, and to its drunken operator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\"><em>Enriquez, </em>283 Va. at 516, 722 S.E.2d at 255 (quoting <em>Stevenson, </em>243 Va. at 439-40, 416 S.E.2d at 438-39 (Compton, J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The Supreme Court then held that \u201cin discerning whether an intoxicated person seated behind the steering wheel of a motor vehicle on a public roadway with the key inserted into the ignition switch of the vehicle is in actual physical control of the vehicle, the position of the key in the ignition switch is not determinative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court concluded by \u201cestablish[ing] the rule that when an intoxicated person is seated behind the steering wheel of a motor vehicle on a public highway and the key is in the ignition switch, he is in actual physical control of the vehicle and, therefore, is guilty of operating the vehicle under the influence of alcohol within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-266.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 517, 722 S.E.2d at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, the Supreme Court did not add the requirement that a vehicle be on a public roadway to the elements of the offense in Code \u00a7 18.2-266 in <em>Enriquez. </em>Rather, the references to being \u201con a public roadway\u201d and Code \u00a7 46.2-100 were merely <em>dictum </em>as the issue in <em>Enriquez </em>was \u201cthe proper considerations in determining whether a person is operating a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515, 722 S.E.2d at 255; <em>see Simon v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 194, 201, 708 S.E.2d 245, 248-49 (2011) (defining <em>dictum </em>as language that is unnecessary to the disposition of a case and therefore cannot serve as binding precedent). This conclusion is bolstered by the myriad of Supreme Court and Court of Appeals cases cited above that unequivocally hold Code \u00a7 18.2-266 does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>require that the driving or operating of the motor vehicle occur on a public highway.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Enriquez, </em>the Supreme Court neither mentioned nor overruled its decision in <em>Valentine, </em>where it held that when a driving under the influence statute is \u201csilent as to the place where the offense may be committed,\u201d there is no requirement that the offense occur \u201con a public highway.\u201d <em>Valentine, </em>202 Va. at 698, 119 S.E.2d at 487. In addition, the Supreme Court\u2019s use of the terminology \u201con a highway\u201d in <em>Enriquez </em>was merely a recitation of the facts in that case as Enriquez was located on a highway when he was operating the vehicle. Thus, the additional language of \u201con a public highway\u201d is non-binding <em>dictum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Moreover, the general provisions defining \u201coperator\u201d in Code \u00a7 46.2-100 do not prevail over the specific provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. <em>See Daniels, </em>266 Va. at 402, 588 S.E.2d at 384 (\u201c \u2018[W]hen one statute speaks to a subject in a general way and another deals with a part of the same subject in a more specific manner, the two should be harmonized, if possible, and where they conflict, the latter prevails.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 1, 22-23, 419 S.E.2d 606, 618 (1992))). Furthermore, the legislature could have included \u201con a public highway\u201d language in Code \u00a7 18.2-266 as it did in Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 (implied consent statute) and Code \u00a7 18.2-323.1 (consuming an alcoholic beverage while driving). <em>Mitchell, </em>26 Va.App. at 34, 492 S.E.2d at 842 (\u201cUnlike Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, which applies only when a person operates a motor vehicle on a highway, Code \u00a7 18.2-266 is generally silent as to the place where the offense may be committed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The legislature, however, chose not to do so, and this Court should presume that this choice was intentional. <em>See Zinone, </em>282 Va. at 337, 714 S.E.2d at 925 (\u201c[W]hen the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Assembly has used specific language in one instance, but omits that language or uses different language when addressing a similar subject elsewhere in the Code, we must presume that the difference in the choice of language was intentional.\u201d). This presumption is further supported by the introductory language of Code \u00a7 46.2-100, which provides that the definition of \u201coperator\u201d is intended \u201cfor the purposes of [Title 46.2].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">In the present case, the trial court properly refused appellant\u2019s proffered jury instructions as they were not an accurate statement of the law. Nothing in the plain language of the statute requires that a motor vehicle other than a moped be located on a public highway in order to constitute a violation of the statute proscribing operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. Nor does the statute require that an individual intends to drive the vehicle. In addition, case law establishes that being on a public highway is not a required element of Code \u00a7 18.2-266.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Appellant\u2019s proffered \u201coperating\u201d instruction improperly stated that \u201c[a]ny individual who is in actual physical control of a vehicle on a public roadway is an operator.\u201d It went even further and incorrectly stated, in contravention to this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ngomondjami, </em>54 Va.App. at 317-18, 678 S.E.2d at 285, that \u201c[w]hen the engine is not running in a private driveway, the Commonwealth must prove by direct or circumstantial evidence that the defendant specifically intended to activate the motive power of the vehicle to enter a public roadway while under the influence of alcohol.\u201d Appellant\u2019s \u201coperator\u201d instruction also improperly stated that \u201c[o]perator means every person who drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle on a highway.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant appellant\u2019s proffered jury instructions as they inaccurately stated the law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Furthermore, appellant\u2019s argument that the given instruction was vague and confusing is inaccurate. The instruction accurately stated the law, as set forth above, and gave appropriate examples of how an individual operates a motor vehicle for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err because the \u201coperation\u201d instruction was accurate and was not vague and confusing.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Appellant next contends that the trial court erred by convicting him of operating under the influence of alcohol in finding that he \u201ctook an action in sequence\u201d to activate his motor vehicle when sleeping in the driver\u2019s seat parked in his private driveway with the key in the auxiliary position and only the radio turned on. Appellant, however, bases this argument on his assertion that he cannot be convicted of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-266 because he was parked on a private driveway and not on a public roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">In a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cwe \u2018presume the judgment of the trial court to be correct,\u2019 and \u2018will not set it aside unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 96, 99, 570 S.E.2d 875, 876-77 (2002) (quoting <em>Broom v. Broom, </em>15 Va.App. 497, 504, 425 S.E.2d 90, 94 (1992); <em>Dodge v. Dodge, </em>2 Va.App. 238, 242, 343 S.E.2d 363, 365 (1986)). The reviewing court, under this standard, asks whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">2. Code \u00a7 18.2-266</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-266 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to drive or operate any motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>vehicle ... while such person is under the influence of alcohol....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">As noted above, \u201cpublic ownership of the property upon which the vehicle is driven or operated is not an element the Commonwealth must prove in a prosecution for driving [or operating] in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Mitchell, </em>26 Va.App. at 35-36, 492 S.E.2d at 843. In addition, \u201cwhen an intoxicated person is seated behind the steering wheel of a motor vehicle ... and the key is in the ignition switch, he is in actual physical control of the vehicle, and therefore, is guilty of operating the vehicle while under the influence of alcohol within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-266.\u201d <em>Enriquez, </em>283 Va. at 517, 722 S.E.2d at 255. \u201cIn discerning whether an intoxicated person seated behind the steering wheel of a motor vehicle ... with the key inserted into the ignition switch of the vehicle is in actual physical control of the vehicle, the position of the key in the ignition switch is not determinative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516, 722 S.E.2d at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The evidence at trial established beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was seated behind the steering wheel of his motor vehicle, that he was intoxicated, and that the key was in the ignition switch of the vehicle in the auxiliary position. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in holding the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Based on the foregoing, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s proffered jury instructions I, J, K, and L, and in finding the evidence was sufficient to convict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>appellant of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.
