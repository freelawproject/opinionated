The Commonwealth relied upon a prior Maryland conviction for assault with the intent to maim under Maryland Code Art. 27, \u00a7 386 (1952, 1982 Repl. Vol.), to prove the predicate violent felony offense required by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. On appeal, appellant maintains the evidence was insufficient to support his firearm conviction because the Maryland conviction is not substantially similar to the Virginia offense proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-51. He also asserts the trial court erred by admitting evidence of his entire criminal history rather than limiting the evidence to only those records establishing a prior violent felony conviction. Finding no error in the trial court\u2019s decision, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">In assessing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, \u201c \u2018we review the evidence in the light most favor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>able to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)). However, the determination regarding whether appellant\u2019s assault with intent to maim conviction is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the offense proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-51, is a question of law, and we review the trial court\u2019s judgment on this question <em>de novo. See Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 608, 611, 674 S.E.2d 541, 542 (2009) (citing <em>Colbert v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 390, 394, 624 S.E.2d 108, 110 (2006); <em>Rollins v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 73, 79, 554 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Appellant was charged with violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Pursuant to subsection (A) of that statute, appellant was subject to a mandatory minimum term of five years if he was found to have possessed a firearm after having been convicted of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as defined by Code \u00a7 17.1-805. Under Code \u00a7 17.1-805(0, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51 is a violent felony. As required by Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1(B),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Commonwealth could rely on appellant\u2019s Maryland conviction as proof of a prior violent felony only if the Maryland offense was \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to a violent felony in Virginia. The trial court concluded that the provision of the Maryland statute under which appellant was convicted was substantially similar to the offense proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-51, and found appellant guilty of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because his Maryland conviction for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>assault with intent to maim is not substantially similar to the offense in Code \u00a7 18.2-51. Appellant was convicted in 1985 of assault with intent to maim in violation of Maryland Code Art. 27, \u00a7 386 (1952, 1982 Repl. Vol.). At that time, the statute provided in pertinent part as follows<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">If any person shall ... assault ... any person, with intent to maim, disfigure or disable such person, or with intent to prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of any party for any offense for which the said party may be legally apprehended or detained, every such offender ... shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, be punished by confinement in the penitentiary for a period not less than eighteen months nor more than ten years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">By comparison, Code \u00a7 18.2-51 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">If any person maliciously shoot, stab, cut, or wound any person or by any means cause him bodily injury, with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill, he shall, except where it is otherwise provided, be guilty of a Class 3 felony. If such act be done unlawfully but not maliciously, with the intent aforesaid, the offender shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">In deciding whether the Virginia and Maryland offenses are \u201csubstantially similar,\u201d \u201c \u2018we look to the elements of the two [offenses] rather than to the offender\u2019s conduct.\u2019\u201d <em>Dean v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va.App. 209, 215, 734 S.E.2d 673, 676 (2012) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Ayers, </em>17 Va.App. 401, 402, 437 S.E.2d 580, 581 (1993)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018Only that prohibition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the other state\u2019s law under which the [defendant] was convicted must substantially conform.\u2019 \u201d <em>West v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 350, 353, 416 S.E.2d 50, 51 (1992) (quoting <em>Cox v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 328, 331, 411 S.E.2d 444, 446 (1991)). As we recently observed, \u201c[k]ey to our analysis ... is the established principle that a crime in another state is not \u2018substantially similar\u2019 to the most closely corresponding crime under Virginia law if the other state\u2019s law \u2018permits convictions for acts which could not be the basis for convictions under [the Virginia law at issue].\u2019 \u201d <em>Dean, </em>61 Va.App. at 215, 734 S.E.2d at 676 (quoting <em>Cox, </em>13 Va.App. at 330-31, 329, 411 S.E.2d at 446, 445) (citation omitted). In <em>Cox</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\">the record of appellant\u2019s convictions ... indicate[d] only that he was convicted under a state statute and a city ordinance. This description permitted] us to conclude only that the appellant committed the offense while operating a motor vehicle. <em>It [did] not specify the specific provision of the ordinance he violated.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-5\"><em>Cox, </em>13 Va.App. at 331, 411 S.E.2d at 446 (emphasis added). Accordingly, in <em>Cox </em>we were \u201ccompelled\u201d to examine the entire West Virginia ordinance to ascertain whether it permitted convictions not permitted under the comparable Virginia statute. <em>See Honaker v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 682, 684, 454 S.E.2d 29, 30 (1995) (explaining Cox).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Here, by contrast, the record of appellant\u2019s conviction includes a reference to the specific provisions of the Maryland statute he violated. <em>Accord id. </em>at 685, 454 S.E.2d at 31 (substantial similarity found where \u201crecord disclose[d] the specific prohibition of the West Virginia law\u2014driving and operating a motor vehicle upon a public highway in West Virginia while under the influence of alcohol\u2014under which Honaker was convicted\u201d). As appellant\u2019s conviction record expressly states he was convicted of assault with the intent to maim, we are not compelled to examine the Maryland statute in its entirety to determine whether it permits convictions not encompassed by the Virginia statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Thus, in undertaking our analysis, we need not consider the intent provisions of the Maryland statute which appellant asserts distinguish it from Code \u00a7 18.2-51, i.e. the \u201cintent to prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of any party for any offense for which the said party may be legally apprehended or detained.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based upon the record before us, the provisions of the Maryland statute under which appellant was convicted included the intent to maim. As a result, the provision under which appellant was convicted in Maryland criminalized the same behavior as Code \u00a7 18.2-51. <em>Cf Dean, </em>61 Va.App. at 222, 734 S.E.2d at 680 (Maryland robbery offense was not substantially similar to robbery in Virginia because, \u201cbased on a comparison of the elements of the crimes in these two states, appellant could have been convicted in Maryland of behavior which would not have been a crime in Virginia.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Accordingly, we hold that the trial judge did not err in finding that the \u201cprohibition\u201d of Maryland law under which appellant was convicted substantially conformed to Code \u00a7 18.2-51, and, therefore, appellant\u2019s Maryland conviction could be used as a predicate offense to establish he had a prior violent felony conviction in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"> Appellant also contends that the trial court erred by admitting documents pertaining to his entire criminal history in Maryland, as opposed to limiting the evidence to those records establishing a prior violent felony conviction. We review a trial court\u2019s decision regarding the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>Juniper v. Commonwealth, </em>271 Va. 362, 412, 626 S.E.2d 383, 415 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Appellant argues that the admission of his entire criminal file was error because it included \u201cirrelevant and extremely prejudicial material\u201d that was \u201clikely a driving force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>in the Court\u2019s finding that [he] was previously convicted of a violent felony.\u201d However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">\u201c[a] judge, unlike a juror, is uniquely suited by training, experience and judicial discipline to disregard potentially prejudicial comments and to separate, during the mental process of adjudication, the admissible from the inadmissible, even though he has heard both.\u201d <em>Eckhart v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 213, 216, 279 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1981). Consequently, we presume that a trial judge disregards prejudicial or inadmissible evidence. . . . \u201c[T]his presumption will control in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\"><em>Cole v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 113, 116, 428 S.E.2d 303, 305 (1993) (citation omitted) (quoting <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 892, 902, 421 S.E.2d 455, 462 (1992) <em>(en banc)). </em>This is particularly true where \u201cthe trial court\u2019s statements clearly establish its awareness of this responsibility.\u201d <em>Beck v. Commonwealth, </em>253 Va. 373, 385, 484 S.E.2d 898, 906 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">In countering this presumption, appellant cites the trial judge\u2019s comments during the hearing on his motion to set aside the verdict. During the hearing, the trial judge read the following excerpt from the Maryland documents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">Petitioner Terry Lang Dillsworth after conviction by an Allegheny County jury was sentenced to consecutive terms for assault with intent to maim, disfigure, or disable and 3rd degree sexual assault. At the trial the victim testified that when Dillsworth attacked her he said he was going to \u201crip out her vagina.\u201d [S]he further said \u201cHe put his hand inside me and threatened to pull and tear at me.\u201d Next Dills-worth threatened to rip out the victim\u2019s throat. He placed two or three fingers down her throat and choked her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">While the trial judge read this passage from the Maryland record, he also consistently stated that his decision finding the Maryland statute in substantial conformity to the offense proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-51 was based upon his comparison of the two states\u2019 laws. At the same hearing in which the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>judge referred to the victim\u2019s testimony, he explained his ruling at trial as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">But I am saying this [the statute] is in the disjunctive. If any person shall lawfully shoot at any person or shall in any manner unlawfully and maliciously attempt or shall unlawfully and maliciously stab or wound or cut any person with the intent to maim or disfigure. Now that is the operative provision I found. So as a practical matter this statute, as I read it, has three acts that are potentially covering. So you are right on that point. But as I understood it from parsing the record the last time it was under the shall unlawfully and maliciously stab, cut, or wound any person or shall assault or beat any person with the intent to maim, disfigure, or disable such person. <em>That is the operative provision that I found was like our malicious or unlawful wounding statute.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Assuming, without deciding, however, that the trial judge erred by considering the victim\u2019s testimony in the Maryland record, such error was harmless. \u201cAn error is harmless \u2018[i]f, when all is said and done, the conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but slight effect \u2014 \u2019\u201d <em>Burnette v. Commonwealth, </em>60 Va.App. 462, 481 n. 4, 729 S.E.2d 740, 749 n. 4 (2012) (quoting <em>Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 253, 260, 546 S.E.2d 728, 731-32 (2001)). Here, once the Commonwealth proved appellant possessed a firearm after having been convicted of a violent felony, the trial judge had no discretion in sentencing because appellant was subject to a mandatory five-year sentence under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Accordingly, the trial court did not commit reversible error by admitting the Maryland records. For all of the aforesaid reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-8\">. Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1(B) provides that ''[p]rior convictions shall include convictions under the laws of any state or of the United States for any offense substantially similar to those listed under 'act of violence' if such offense would be a felony if committed in the Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-9\">. In 1996 the Maryland General Assembly repealed this statute and other assault provisions in Article 27, and replaced them with \u00a7\u00a7 12, 12A, and 12A-1. These provisions were subsequently repealed in 2002, and replaced by new sections in Title 3 of the Criminal Law Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b145-10\">. Appellant argues the trial court erred by relying on his conduct \"in lieu of examining the actual text of the statutes to determine whether they were substantially similar,\u201d but he does not raise this specific issue in his assignment of error. Rather, the assignment of error is limited to the question of whether the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction because it failed to prove his Maryland conviction was \"substantially similar\u201d to a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b147-7\">. As appellant argues only that the intent requirements in the Maryland statute distinguish it from Code \u00a7 18.2-51, we do not address whether the elements of the offenses are substantially different in any other respect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b149-8\">. In addition, when the trial judge began his review of appellant\u2019s criminal records from Maryland, he indicated he would consider only those records establishing a prior violent felony substantially similar to one in Virginia. He stated, \"I only need to find one. And I will say this, I am only going to find one. After I find one, that is it. I mean this is like everything else is cumulative.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
