Hedleston appeals the denial of his claim for disability retirement benefits by the Virginia Retirement System. He contends the circuit court erred in ruling that the denial by VRS was supported by substantial evidence. We affirm the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">We view the evidence in the light most favorable to VRS, the prevailing party below. <em>See R.G. Moore Bldg. Corp. v. Mullins, </em>10 Va.App. 211, 212, 390 S.E.2d 788, 788 (1990). Appellant joined VRS in 2007 when he was employed as a secondary school teacher. In 2006, prior to becoming a member of the VRS, he had suffered a stroke. Appellant applied for disability retirement benefits in May 2010. The Medical Board recommended denial of appellant\u2019s application pursuant to Code \u00a7 51.1-156(E). It found that \u201cclearly [appellant\u2019s] alleged disabling conditions predated\u201d his entry into the VRS. It further found that \u201c[d]ue to his short tenure, one cannot say with certainty that [the conditions] have worsened since his entry into the VRS,\u201d and noted that the \u201cresidual findings\u201d related to the stroke were \u201cmild in nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">The Medical Board pointed out that appellant\u2019s employer had provided information that appellant had \u201csome performance issues\u201d after the first ninety days of his employment that included the lack of daily lesson plans, unorganized activities, and the failure to maintain a grade book. The board concluded \u201cthere is no documentation of any sudden and/or recent deterioration in function\u201d and it did \u201cnot find [appellant] to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>incapacitated for the further performance of his duties or that his incapacity will be permanent in nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">VRS denied disability retirement benefits, and appellant appealed. The Medical Board conducted a first appeal review. It reviewed the additional medical evidence provided in the psychology report of Dr. Michael Fielding. The board noted that this report indicated appellant had difficulties with short term memory. However, it stated appellant was diagnosed with anxiety and depression which \u201ccould clearly influence [his] function with short term memory.\u201d The board found that the records did not \u201csupport whether [appellant\u2019s inabilities [we]re due to an organic basis versus a functional basis.\u201d It concluded \u201csignificant objective documentation of progressive disability on both reviews has not been provided\u201d and again recommended denial of benefits. It also found appellant was not incapacitated for further performance of his duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">VRS again denied disability retirement benefits, and appellant appealed. An independent fact finder conducted an informal fact finding proceeding. At that hearing, only appellant testified. Appellant asserted his short term memory lapses formed the basis of his occupational incapacity as a high school teacher. He described his symptoms, various medical diagnoses, and how his medical condition affected him. He summarized medical reports and psychological evaluations. He testified concerning medical treatment he had received from 2001 through August 2011. Dr. Fielding\u2019s psychological report and other medical records were made part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The Medical Board had a transcript of the testimony from the hearing when it conducted a third review of the application. Again it recommended the denial of benefits, stating: \u201c[t]he applicant alleges cognitive dysfunction due to a stroke in 2006 however, clearly absent is any medical documentation of deterioration over time\u201d and \u201c[f]rom a medical standpoint, there is no documentable medical basis for the applicant\u2019s difficulties as a teacher.\u201d The board found the low scores in \u201cworking memory\u201d could be explained by other conditions such as ongoing anxiety and depression \u201cwhich [are] treatable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>eondition[s].\u201d The board did not find appellant \u201cto be incapacitated for the further performance of his duties or that his incapacity will be permanent in nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The VRS Board requested the fact finder to render a decision after receiving the reports from the Medical Board. The fact finder found that appellant had not presented corroborative evidence of his asserted incapacity. The fact finder noted that although Dr. Fielding\u2019s psychological evaluation reinforced appellant\u2019s claims of a short term memory loss, \u201cthat report also describe[d] impressive cognitive attributes.\u201d The fact finder stated the report contained \u201ca very mixed bag of cognitive abilities and challenges, some well above average and some below.\u201d He noted that Dr. Fielding characterized appellant\u2019s short term memory loss as \u201cextremely low within the average range,\u201d and found appellant\u2019s testimony was \u201carticulate and indicative of a highly intelligent, highly functioning person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The fact finder found \u201cthere is simply insufficient corroborative evidence in the record to overturn the conclusion of the Medical Board.\u201d He concluded that appellant was not incapacitated for the further performance of duty, his impairments were not likely to be permanent, and his disabling health problems did not worsen substantially after he became a member of the VRS. He ruled appellant had not satisfied the requirements of Code \u00a7 51.1-156(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">VRS notified appellant of its final decision to deny disability retirement benefits. Appellant appealed to the circuit court. The circuit court issued a letter opinion in which it found there was substantial evidence in the record to support the final decision of the VRS. The circuit court noted \u201cthe primary condition appellant relies on, memory loss, can be viewed on the record as not medically supported for incapacity, permanency, and substantially worsened.\u201d The circuit court held that appellant had not satisfied the requirements for disability retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Upon judicial review of agency action in accordance with the Administrative Process Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.2-4000 <em>et seq., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>appellant bears the burden \u201cto designate and demonstrate an error of law subject to review.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-4027. In this case, the issue is \u201cthe substantiality of the evidentiary support for findings of fact.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-4027(iv).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">When the decision on review is to be made on the agency record, the duty of the court with respect to issues of fact shall be limited to ascertaining whether there was substantial evidence in the agency record upon which the agency as the trier of the facts could reasonably find them to be as it did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Code \u00a7 2.2-4027. \u201cCases subject to the standard of review outlined in Code \u00a7 [2.2-4027] cannot be considered a trial de novo since the factual issues on appeal are controlled solely by the agency record.\u201d <em>School Bd. of Cnty. of York v. Nicely, </em>12 Va.App. 1051, 1062, 408 S.E.2d 545, 551 (1991). \u201cTherefore, ... the circuit court\u2019s role in an appeal from an agency decision is equivalent to an appellate court\u2019s role in an appeal from a trial court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">\u201cThe \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 standard ... is designed to give great stability and finality to the fact-findings of an administrative agency. The phrase \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 refers to \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia Real Estate Comm\u2019n v. Bias, </em>226 Va. 264, 269, 308 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1983) (quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 217, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). \u201c[T]he court may reject the agency\u2019s findings of fact \u2018only if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would <em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting B. Mezines, <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 51.01 (1981) (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\"> \u201cA reviewing court \u2018must review the facts in the light most favorable to sustaining the [agency\u2019s] action,\u2019 and \u2018take due account of the presumption of official regularity, the experience and specialized competence of the agency, and the purposes of the basic law under which the agency has acted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 263, 369 S.E.2d 1, 18-19 (1988) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Code \u00a7 51.1-156 states VRS disability retirement requirements. Code \u00a7 51.1-156(E) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">After a medical examination of the member [of the Virginia Retirement System] or after reviewing pertinent medical records, the Medical Board shall certify that (i) the member is and has been continuously since the effective date of retirement if prior to filing of the notification, mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty, (ii) the incapacity is likely to be permanent, and (iii) the member should be retired. A member shall not be retired for disability for any condition which existed at the time of becoming a member unless medical evidence, convincing to the Board, supports the fact that the preexisting condition has worsened substantially.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Upon our review of the entire agency record, we conclude that the circuit court did not err in finding that the decision by VRS to deny appellant disability retirement was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The Medical Board is \u201ca neutral evaluatory mechanism for the Retirement System to gather and analyze medical opinions and reports.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Virginia Ret. Sys., </em>30 Va.App. 104, 112, 515 S.E.2d 784, 788 (1999). \u201cBy statute, the medical board is empowered to review reports of medical examinations, to investigate health and medical statements submitted in connection with disability applications, and to report its conclusions and recommendations to VRS. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 51.1-124.23(B).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111, 515 S.E.2d at 788. On three separate occasions, the Medical Board examined appellant\u2019s case, including his medical reports and records, and his testimony. After each review, the board recommended denial because appellant had not shown he was physically or mentally incapacitated for further performance of duty. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 51.1\u2014156(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The independent fact finder received the recommendations of the Medical Board, reviewed the medical records and testimony of appellant and also was not persuaded that the evidence presented by appellant satisfied the requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Code \u00a7 51.1-156(E). \u201cThe credibility of the witnesses and the weight accorded the evidence are matters solely for the fact finder who has the opportunity to see and hear that evidence as it is presented.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 133, 138, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995). VRS upheld this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The circuit court had no authority under the Administrative Process Act \u201cto reweigh the facts in the agency\u2019s evidentiary record.\u201d <em>Boone v. Harrison, </em>52 Va.App. 53, 61-62, 660 S.E.2d 704, 708 (2008). \u201cWe have also observed that \u2018the deference that we give to the [agency\u2019s] fact-finding on medical questions is based upon the \u201cunwisdom of an attempt by ... [courts] uninitiated into the mysteries to choose between conflicting expert medical opinions.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>30 Va.App. at 111, 515 S.E.2d at 788 (quoting <em>Stancill v. Ford Motor Co., </em>15 Va.App. 54, 58, 421 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">We hold that the record before VRS contained \u201csubstantial evidence ... upon which the agency as the trier of the facts could reasonably find them to be as it did.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-4027. The medical evidence presented by appellant did not compel the conclusion that appellant was incapacitated for the further performance of duty, the incapacity was likely to be permanent and, if he suffered from a pre-existing condition, it substantially worsened since he became a member of VRS. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 51.1-156(E). A \u201creasonable mind\u201d could find that the evidence in this record did not prove appellant\u2019s condition met the requirements of Code \u00a7 51.1-156(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the denial of disability benefits to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
