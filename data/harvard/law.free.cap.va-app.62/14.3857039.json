On appeal, Ingram claims the circuit court should have impanelled a jury to decide his case and, in any event, should not have authorized a course of treatment that violated his basic beliefs. We find Ingram\u2019s sufficiency argument moot and reject his jury trial argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In 1995, Ingram was found not guilty of malicious wounding by reason of insanity. Since that time, he has been a patient in state psychiatric facilities. Doctors have diagnosed Ingram with various psychiatric conditions (bipolar type schizoaffective disorder, narcissistic and antisocial personality disorder, and polysubstance dependence), as well as several medical conditions (hyperthyroidism, acid reflux, gastroid reflux, vitamin D deficiency, a hiatal hernia, and a benign prostate hypertrophy).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">In 2009, Ingram\u2019s treating psychiatrist filed a petition seeking court-ordered treatment pursuant to Code \u00a7 37.2-1101. The general district court issued an order requiring treatment for 180 days. After the circuit court affirmed the ruling in a <em>de novo </em>hearing, Ingram appealed to us, claiming the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to justify the order. Because the 180-day order had expired before the appeal was heard, we dismissed the case as moot. <em>Ingram v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 2436-09-3, 2010 WL 2482315, 2010 Va.App. Lexis 254 (June 22, 2010) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">In 2012, Ingram\u2019s treating psychiatrist again petitioned for court-ordered treatment of Ingram. The general district court granted the petition and Ingram again appealed, seeking a <em>de novo </em>hearing in circuit court. This time, Ingram demanded that the case be decided by a jury. The circuit court denied the request for a jury, conducted an evidentiary hearing, and granted the petition for court-ordered treatment. The circuit court\u2019s 180-day order expired under its own terms on January 19, 2013\u2014shortly before the matter was heard by us. The Commonwealth made a motion seeking to dismiss the appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">A. Mootness\u2014Expired 180-Day Order</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">We first address whether this case is moot, now that the most recent 180-day treatment order has expired under its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>own ternas. The circuit court entered the order pursuant to Code \u00a7 37.2-1101(A), which authorizes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">treatment for a mental or physical disorder on behalf of an adult person, in accordance with this section, if [the judge or special justice] finds upon clear and convincing evidence that (i) the person is either incapable of making an informed decision on his own behalf or is incapable of communicating such a decision due to a physical or mental disorder and (ii) the proposed treatment is in the best interest of the person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG\"><em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 37.2-1101(G) (listing additional necessary findings). The statute directs the court not to issue a treatment order if it \u201cis proven by a preponderance of the evidence to be contrary to the person\u2019s religious beliefs or basic values or to specific preferences stated by the person before becoming incapable of making an informed decision, unless the treatment is necessary to prevent death or a serious irreversible condition.\u201d Code \u00a7 37.2-1101(G)(4). The duration of such orders may vary, but one authorizing the \u201c[a]dministration of antipsychotic medication\u201d cannot exceed 180 days. Code \u00a7 37.2-1102(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">On appeal, Ingram challenges the treatment order on two grounds: First, he claims he had a constitutional and statutory right to a jury trial. Second, he contends the circuit court should have concluded that his \u201creligious beliefs or basic values,\u201d Code \u00a7 37.2-1101(G)(4), forbade the recommended treatment. The Commonwealth argues that both issues are moot now that the circuit court order has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We accept the first premise of the Commonwealth\u2019s argument. A case becomes moot \u201cwhen the issues presented are no longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d <em>Chafin v. Chafin, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 133 S.Ct. 1017, 1018, 185 L.Ed.2d 1 (2013) (quoting <em>Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 133 S.Ct. 721, 726, 184 L.Ed.2d 553 (2013)); <em>see also Daily Press, Inc. v. Commonwealth, </em>285 Va. 447, 452, 739 S.E.2d 636, 639-40 (2013). \u201cNo matter how vehemently the parties continue to dispute the lawfulness of the conduct that precipitated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>lawsuit, the case is moot if the dispute is no longer embedded in any actual controversy about the plaintiffs\u2019 particular legal rights.\u201d <em>Already, LLC, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 133 S.Ct. at 727 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u201c \u2018Advisory opinions represent an attenuate exercise of judicial power,\u2019 <em>Va. State Police v. Elliott, </em>48 Va.App. 551, 553, 633 S.E.2d 203, 204 (2006), one which we traditionally avoid in all but the most extenuating circumstances.\u201d <em>Pilson v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 442, 446, 663 S.E.2d 562, 564 (2008). Like many courts, however, we acknowledge \u201cthere may be narrow circumstances in which a court may decide a case despite the absence of an actual, ongoing dispute\u2014like when the underlying controversy is one capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>Elliott, </em>48 Va.App. at 554, 633 S.E.2d at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">This exception to mootness should be used \u201csparingly\u201d and usually only in cases that are \u201cshort-lived by nature.\u201d <em>Daily Press, Inc., 285 </em>Va. at 452, 739 S.E.2d at 639. Such \u201cexceptional situations\u201d typically involve \u201cdisputes of abbreviated duration where the party seeking review can make a reasonable showing that he will again be subjected to the alleged illegality.\u201d <em>Elliott, </em>48 Va.App. at 554, 633 S.E.2d at 204-05 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Compare United States v. Juvenile Male, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 2860, 2865, 180 L.Ed.2d 811 (2011) (refusing to apply the capable-of-repetition doctrine where 21-year-old defendant \u201cwill never again be subject to . . . juvenile supervision\u201d), <em>with Turner v. Rogers, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 2507, 2515, 180 L.Ed.2d 452 (2011) (applying the capable-of-repetition doctrine where \u201cthere is a more than reasonable likelihood that [defendant] will again be subjected to the same action\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Only part of Ingram\u2019s appeal passes this exacting standard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His first argument claims a right to a jury trial. Declared legally insane nearly twenty years ago, Ingram will likely be the subject of future treatment petitions. Each one could introduce exactly the same jury issue. The issue presents a question of law wholly unaffected by the specific facts surrounding any given petition. And the issue would arise, as it already has, in a short-lived proceeding challenging a judicial order that could easily expire before it is reviewed on appeal. <em>Accord Washington v. Harper, </em>494 U.S. 210, 219, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 1035, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990) (holding it \u201clikely\u201d that a state psychiatric center would \u201cseek to administer antipsychotic medications\u201d to an inmate). Given these unusual circumstances, we believe the jury trial issue presents an \u201cexceptional\u201d situation that is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>Elliott, </em>48 Va.App. at 554, 633 S.E.2d at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">The same cannot be said for Ingram\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the now-expired order. In the circuit court, Ingram testified the treatment violated his \u201cpersonal beliefs\u201d and \u201cbasic values\u201d protected by Code \u00a7 37.2-1101(G)(4). Appellant\u2019s Br. at 15. Ingram said he had \u201cfallen away\u201d from his former religious views (which he had professed in his earlier case) and now plays in a \u201crock band\u201d that, he explained, is \u201csort of like a religion to me.\u201d App. at 77. As his counsel conceded on appeal, the facts of this case are quite different from those in Ingram\u2019s earlier appeal. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Oral Argument Audio at 5:55 to 6:01. And the facts are likely \u201cgoing to change\u201d if the circuit court enters future treatment orders. <em>Id. </em>at 2:31 to 2:33.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Given the indeterminate nature of the facts underlying Ingram\u2019s sufficiency argument, we have no confidence that a later appeal would present an analogous fact pattern justifying a ruling on the now-expired treatment order. Although a sufficiency argument of some kind may be capable of repetition in a later appeal, it likely will not be on the same grounds as those asserted in the present appeal. For this reason, it would be imprudent for us to address the sufficiency issue under the capable-of-repetition, yet-evading-review doctrine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">B. Jury Trial Right</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Code \u00a7 37.2-1101(A) empowers a \u201ccircuit court or district court judge or special justice\u201d to issue involuntary treatment orders. Subsection G requires \u201cthe court\u201d to make specific findings prior to issuing the order. Subsection H makes clear that \u201cthe court\u201d should determine the scope of the treatment covered by the order. Code \u00a7 37.2-1102 similarly authorizes \u201cthe court\u201d to order certain actions under specific conditions. The statutory scheme assigns the decisionmaking duties entirely to the court and makes no allowance for jury trials on any issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">For two reasons, Ingram claims he nonetheless had the right to a jury in the circuit court: (i) Code \u00a7 37.2-1101\u2019s bench trial procedure violates federal and state constitutional law guarantees of a right to a jury trial, and (ii) Code \u00a7 8.01-336(D) provides a statutory right to have a jury decide a plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>in equity. We find neither ground supports Ingram\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">(i) Federal <em>&amp; </em>State Constitutional Rights to a Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d Ingram correctly claims his right to object to involuntary treatment implicates a liberty interest and thus entitled him to procedural due process. <em>See Sell v. United States, </em>539 U.S. 166, 178-79, 123 S.Ct. 2174, 2183, 156 L.Ed.2d 197 (2003) (discussing <em>Riggins v. Nevada, </em>504 U.S. 127, 134, 112 S.Ct. 1810, 1814, 118 L.Ed.2d 479 (1992); <em>Harper, </em>494 U.S. at 221, 110 S.Ct. at 1036).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Although due process provides a battery of predeprivation procedural safeguards, it does not uniformly include\u2014either expressly or implicitly\u2014a right to trial by jury. <em>See McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, </em>403 U.S. 528, 545, 91 S.Ct. 1976, 1986, 29 L.Ed.2d 647 (1971) (\u201c[T]rial by jury in the juvenile court\u2019s adjudicative stage is not a constitutional requirement\u201d of due process.); <em>see also United States v. Sahhar, </em>917 F.2d 1197, 1207 (9th Cir.1990) <em>(\u201cMcKeiver </em>held that trial by jury is neither a necessary element of the fundamental fairness guaranteed by the due process clause, nor an essential component of accurate factfinding.\u201d); <em>United States v. Hill, </em>538 F.2d 1072, 1075 (4th Cir.1976). To be sure, procedural due process does not even require \u201ca judicial decisionmaker\u201d to authorize \u201cinvoluntary treatment.\u201d <em>Harper, </em>494 U.S. at 228, 110 S.Ct. at 1040. Thus, neither the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment nor its analogue in the Virginia Constitution<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> guarantees Ingram the right to a jury trial in an involuntary treatment proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees a jury trial in \u201call criminal prosecutions.\u201d It tracks Article Ill\u2019s command that the \u201ctrial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury.\u201d U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2. Despite its literal scope, the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to a jury does not apply to criminal offenses presumed to be petty because they could not result in more than six months incarceration. <em>See Lewis v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 322, 326, 116 S.Ct. 2163, 2166, 135 L.Ed.2d 590 (1996); <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 159, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 1452, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968). The constitutional right to a jury does not apply in Ingram\u2019s case because his was not a criminal proceeding and, even if it were, it could not have resulted in more than six months of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees a right to a jury trial in \u201csuits at common law\u201d where more than twenty dollars is in dispute. This provision of the Federal Bill of Rights, however, has never been applied to state courts. <em>See McDonald v. Chicago, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, - n. 13, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 3035 n. 13, 177 L.Ed.2d 894 (2010); <em>Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis R. Co. v. Bombolis, </em>241 U.S. 211, 217, 36 S.Ct. 595, 596, 60 L.Ed. 961 (1916). Thus, the only constitutional right to a civil jury in Virginia courts arises, if at all, under Article I, \u00a7 11 of the Virginia Constitution. <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-336(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The right to a jury trial under the Virginia Constitution does not apply \u201cto those proceedings in which there was no right to jury trial when the Constitution was adopted.\u201d <em>Stanardsville Volunteer Fire Co. v. Berry, </em>229 Va. 578, 583, 331 S.E.2d 466, 469 (1985) (citing <em>Bowman v. Va. State Entomologist, </em>128 Va. 351, 372, 105 S.E. 141, 148 (1920)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Put another way, the \u201cconstitutional right to a civil jury is as extensive as the common law right in 1776.\u201d W. Hamilton Bryson, <em>Virginia Civil Procedure </em>431 (3d ed.1997) (footnote omitted). \u201cSince the constitutional guarantee of jury trial in civil cases attaches only to common law actions as they existed in 1776, statutes creating a new cause of action need not provide for trial by jury.\u201d 1 A.E. Dick Howard, <em>Commentaries on the Constitution of Virginia </em>247-48 (1974) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The involuntary treatment petition filed against Ingram pursuant to Code \u00a7 37.2-1101 bears none of the characteristics of what we think of as a traditional common law proceeding. <em>See Chauffeurs, Teamsters and Helpers, Local No. 391 v. Terry, </em>494 U.S. 558, 570, 110 S.Ct. 1339, 1347, 108 L.Ed.2d 519 (1990) (\u201cGenerally, an action for money damages was \u2018the traditional form of relief offered in the courts of law.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Curtis v. Loether, </em>415 U.S. 189, 196, 94 S.Ct. 1005, 1009, 39 L.Ed.2d 260 (1974))); Dan B. Dobbs, <em>Remedies </em>\u00a7 1.1, at 3 (1973) (\u201cThe damages remedy was a legal remedy, and the injunction and most other coercive remedies were equitable.\u201d). The petition does not seek compensatory or punitive damages, attempt to adjust the rights and liabilities of antagonistic litigants, or request retrospective relief of any kind. A petition under Code \u00a7 37.2-1101, therefore, looks nothing like the classical common law cause of action for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">That said, in the common law\u2014as in most everything else\u2014 appearances can be deceiving. Though wholly unrelated to claims for monetary damages, the ancient common law writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>\u201cde idiota inquirendo </em>\u201d authorized juries to \u201cinquire whether a man be an idiot or not\u201d and, if so, to transfer \u201cthe profits of his lands and the custody of his person\u201d to the king or his designee. 1 William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Law of England </em>*303. A similar writ could be issued against a <em>\u201cnon compos mentis,\u201d </em>described in the common law as a mere \u201clunatic\u201d who \u201cby disease, grief, or other accident, hath lost the use of his reason\u201d yet still has \u201clucid intervals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *304.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">These common law writs, however, have little in common with a Code \u00a7 37.2-1101 proceeding. Code \u00a7 37.2-1101 appears to be a novelty of statutory law, seeking only to administer medical treatment (albeit involuntarily) to an individual suffering from a serious mental or physical disorder.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Unlike the common law writs, Code \u00a7 37.2-1101 does not attempt to affect the property rights of a patient or place him indeterminately in the custody of the state. Instead, Code \u00a7 37.2-1101 represents a uniquely modern application of the <em>parens patriae </em>duty of the state to protect those \u201cincapable of making an informed decision\u201d by attempting to ameliorate their illnesses in a manner consistent with the needs of society balanced with the deeply held religious or basic values of the individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">For us to conclude that Code \u00a7 37.2-1101 unconstitutionally deprived Ingram of his common law right to a jury, we would need far better analogies than these two writs. As has been have often said, Virginia courts \u201cmust resolve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u2018any reasonable doubt regarding a statute\u2019s constitutionality in favor of its validity.\u2019\u201d <em>Montgomery Cnty. v. Va. Dep\u2019t of Rail and Pub. Transp., </em>282 Va. 422, 435, 719 S.E.2d 294, 300 (2011) (citation omitted). The presumption of constitutionality is \u201cone of the strongest known to the law.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Cnty. of Henrico, </em>42 Va.App. 495, 507, 592 S.E.2d 768, 774 (2004) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted). \u201cTo doubt is to affirm.\u201d <em>Laurels of Bon Air v. Med. Facilities, </em>51 Va.App. 583, 597-98, 659 S.E.2d 561, 569 (2008) (citation omitted). Given the absence of any persuasive showing of a common law antecedent to Code \u00a7 37.2-1101, we hold the circuit court did not violate Article I, \u00a7 11 of the Virginia Constitution by refusing to impanel a jury to decide Ingram\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">(ii) Statutory Right to a Jury\u2014Plea in Equity</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Ingram next turns to Code \u00a7 8.01-336(D), claiming the statute entitled him to have a jury decide the narrow issue of whether the evidence proved by a preponderance that the recommended treatment was contrary to his \u201creligious beliefs or basic values or to specific preferences stated by the person before becoming incapable of making an informed decision,\u201d as described in Code \u00a7 37.2-1101(G)(4). Titled \u201cTrial by jury of plea in equity,\u201d subsection D of Code \u00a7 8.01-336 provides: \u201cIn any action in which a plea has been filed to an equitable claim, and the allegations of such plea are denied by the plaintiff, either party may have the issue tried by jury.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Though we question whether an involuntary treatment petition under Code \u00a7 37.2-1101 is truly an \u201cequitable claim\u201d under Code \u00a7 8.01-336, we need not reach that issue because we find the plea-in-equity procedure inapplicable to this case. A plea in equity is a discrete form of defensive pleading that does not directly address the merits of a complaint. Instead, the plea raises \u201ca single state of facts or circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>(usually not disclosed or disclosed only in part by the record) which, if proven, constitutes an absolute defense to the claim.\u201d <em>Nelms v.
