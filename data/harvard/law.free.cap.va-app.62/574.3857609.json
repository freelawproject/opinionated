Appellant essentially contends the evidence was insufficient for conviction, because that evidence did not show she had been notified that her license was suspended and thus invalid. We agree and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">On the night of July 22, 2012, Officer Marcelo Carvajal stopped the vehicle appellant was driving because her headlights were not illuminated. When the officer asked appellant for her driver\u2019s license, she said she had left it at home. At the scene, when Carvajal \u201cran\u201d appellant\u2019s driving record, he learned that her license had been suspended. She was given a summons alleging a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-301, driving on a suspended license, which is penalized as a Class 1 misdemean- or. The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) record, which the Commonwealth admitted at trial, showed that appellant had been issued a driver\u2019s license on September 9, 2011 with an expiration date of September 10, 2013 and that her license was administratively suspended on July 15, 2012 for not completing a \u201cclinic interview.\u201d A copy of the order requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>appellant to attend the clinic interview was sent to appellant by the DMV by certified mail, but the letter was returned \u201cunclaimed\u201d on May 10, 2012. With regard to the license suspension, appellant\u2019s driving record also indicated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"As2\">SUSPENSION ISSUED: 04/16/2012 DI CLINIC REQUIREMENT EFFECTIVE: 07/15/2012 ACTION: CLINIC INTERVIEW NOTIFIED: 06/15/2012 BY DI REMINDER LTR ORDER DELIVERY DATE: 05/10/2012 ORDER RTRN-UNCLAIMED</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The Commonwealth did not present any additional evidence to establish that appellant was aware that the DMV had suspended her driver\u2019s license.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At trial, without objection, the Commonwealth amended the summons to charge a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-300.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Code \u00a7 46.2-300 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">No person, except those expressly exempted in \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-303 through 46.2-308, shall drive any motor vehicle on any highway in the Commonwealth until such person has applied for a driver\u2019s license, as provided in this article, satisfactorily passed the examination required by \u00a7 46.2-325, and obtained a driver\u2019s license, nor unless the license is valid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-10\">A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. A second or subsequent violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-11\">Upon conviction under this section, the court may suspend the person\u2019s privilege to drive for a period not to exceed 90 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>A Class 2 misdemeanor carries a punishment of up to 6 months in jail and a fine of $1000, either or both. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-ll(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Patently, Code \u00a7 46.2-300 contains no language specifically requiring the Commonwealth to prove a driver\u2019s knowledge of his license status for a conviction under that statute. By contrast, Code \u00a7 46.2-301, which prohibits driving on a suspended or revoked license, specifically references a requirement of notice for conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In <em>Edenton v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 413, 316 S.E.2d 736 (1984), the Supreme Court of Virginia considered whether then Code \u00a7 46.1-349, the statutory predecessor to Code 46.2-300, was a lesser-included offense of driving after having been declared a habitual offender. The Court observed that \u201c[t]he gravamen of the misdemeanor [conviction under Code \u00a7 46.1-349]\u2014the crucial element\u2014is the act of operating a motor vehicle by a driver who has not obtained a valid operator\u2019s license by making a lawful application and passing the required examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417, 316 S.E.2d at 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">In <em>Bibb v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 249, 249-50, 183 S.E.2d 732, 733 (1971), in a prosecution for driving on a suspended license under former Code \u00a7 46.1-350, a notice of the Division of Motor Vehicles order of suspension was sent to the defendant at the last known address supplied by him or on file at the Division, but it was returned marked \u201cMoved, left no address.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction on appeal, concluding that because the \u201cevidence expressly shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>that [the defendant] did not receive the notice mailed to him ... the evidence does not show that [the defendant] knew his license had been suspended....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250, 183 S.E.2d at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">In <em>Plummer v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 13, 14, 408 S.E.2d 765, 765 (1991), we addressed the sufficiency of the Commonwealth\u2019s proof of notice in a prosecution for driving on a suspended operator\u2019s license in violation of former Code \u00a7 46.1-350.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This Court rhetorically asked the dispositive question here involved: \u201cWhat then makes the suspension [of a driver\u2019s license] become effective?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, 408 S.E.2d at 766. In response, this Court stated: <em>\u201cBibb </em>holds that a suspension is not effective when the order is entered but rather when the party charged has been given notice of its entry.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">While <em>Plummer </em>addressed a suspended operator\u2019s license under Code \u00a7 46.1-350 (now Code \u00a7 46.2-301), not a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-300, the basis of appellant\u2019s violating the latter statute was a suspension of the former Code \u00a7 46.1-301. Nevertheless, our inquiry is whether appellant\u2019s operator\u2019s license was validly suspended. We concluded it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Here, the evidence, appellant\u2019s DMV record, recites the notice sent to her was \u201cunclaimed.\u201d A license is not suspended until notice of that status is received by the holder. Accordingly, the evidence did not prove that appellant had notice that her driver\u2019s license was suspended. When the predicate for invalidity under Code \u00a7 46.2-300 is a suspended license, the Commonwealth must prove the defendant received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>notice of the suspension.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because no such proof was offered in this ease, we reverse appellant\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-12\">. The Commonwealth did not argue, either at trial or on appeal, that the DMV record established that appellant had actual notice her license was suspended. Rather, the Commonwealth's consistent argument throughout this case has been that notice is not required for a conviction under Code \u00a7 46.2-300. Thus, for purposes of this appeal we will assume that the Commonwealth did not establish that appellant had actual notice of the suspension of her driver\u2019s license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\">. Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B) states in pertinent part: \"A clerk\u2019s notice of suspension of license for failure to pay fines or costs given in accordance with \u00a7 46.2-395 shall be sufficient notice for the purpose of maintaining a conviction under this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\">. At the time <em>Bibb </em>was decided, the language of Code \u00a7 46.1-350 contained no specific reference to a notice requirement for conviction. See Code \u00a7 46.1-350 (1967 Repl.Vol. &amp; 1970 Cum.Supp.). However, the applicable statutory scheme in <em>Bibb, </em>\"Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.1-350,-423.1, and -441.2, ... provided for notice of the administrative revocation proceeding....\u201d <em>Reed v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 467, 472, 424 S.E.2d 718, 721 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">. At the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest for the driving offense in <em>Plummer, </em>August 5, 1989, Code \u00a7 46.1-350, containing no reference to notice, remained in effect. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.1-350 (1986 Repl.Vol. &amp; 1988 Cum.Supp.). Effective October 1, 1989, the General Assembly repealed Code \u00a7 46.1-1 through Code \u00a7 46.1-570 and enacted Title 46.2 of the Code of Virginia, pertaining to motor vehicles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b627-17\">. We need not, and thus do not, address the elements of proof necessary for a conviction under Code \u00a7 46.2-300 in cases where license invalidity is predicated on some ground other than a suspension. \"An appellate court decides cases on the best and narrowest ground available.\u201d <em>Podracky v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 130, 134, 662 S.E.2d 81, 84 (2008) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b627-18\">. We note that Code \u00a7 46.2-104 requires that \"[t]he operator of any motor vehicle ... on the highways in the Commonwealth[ ] shall have in his possession ... his driver\u2019s license\u201d and that the failure to do so constitutes a traffic infraction requiring a court appearance. This statute thus provides the opportunity for the operator to receive actual notice of the status of his license.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
