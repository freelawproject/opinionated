Griffin (\u201cMrs. Griffin\u201d) appeals the order of the Circuit Court of Sussex County (\u201ccircuit court\u201d) denying her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>request for entry of a qualified domestic relations order (\u201cQDRO\u201d), which she pursues so that a certain term of her prior divorce decree might be enforced. For the following reasons, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">\u201cWhen reviewing a [circuit] court\u2019s decision on appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003). However, the facts relevant to the resolution of this appeal are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">David L. Griffin (\u201cMr. Griffin\u201d) and Mrs. Griffin were married on March 20, 1987 and had two children, James J. Griffin, III, born on October 25, 1987, and Gloria D. Griffin, born on July 6, 1992. The parties were divorced by a final decree of divorce entered in the circuit court on August 12, 1998. The final decree of divorce (\u201cfinal decree\u201d) incorporated the Separation and Property Settlement Agreement (hereinafter, \u201cPSA\u201d or \u201cAgreement\u201d) entered into by the parties on August 30, 1996. The Agreement term that is the subject of this appeal reads: \u201cThe parties agree to name the children of the marriage as co-beneficiaries under all 401K Plans and other such plans which would be distributed upon the death of either party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">At the time of his death, Mr. Griffin was employed by Dominion Virginia Power (\u201cDominion\u201d). At Dominion, he qualified for retirement benefits and he elected a 401(k) plan, known as Dominion\u2019s Salaried Savings Plan (\u201cSalaried Savings Plan\u201d or \u201cPlan\u201d), which is governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d). The Salaried Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan designed to encourage retirement savings. Dominion\u2019s contributions to the plan depend on the participant\u2019s contributions and years of service. There is no actuarial analysis to determine the participant\u2019s benefits, and the participant\u2019s life expectancy is not a consideration in the Salaried Savings Plan. Under the Salaried Savings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Plan, the surviving spouse is the beneficiary upon the participant\u2019s death unless she has consented to another beneficiary. The Salaried Savings Plan documents also provide that \u201cif you are divorced, benefit payments from the Pension Plan or Savings Plan may be made to your former spouse, your child, or other dependent only in response to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO).\u201d The Dominion Plan Administrator testified that the Salaried Savings Plan is not a survivor annuity and it is strictly payable to the designated beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">In 2002, Mr. Griffin had named his children as his beneficiaries. However, Mr. Griffin married Kimberly Cowser-Griffin (\u201cCowser-Griffin\u201d) in 2007, and in 2008 Mr. Griffin named Cowser-Griffin as his beneficiary for most of his funds, including the Salaried Savings Plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He named his children only as contingent beneficiaries on the Salaried Savings Plan. Shortly after his marriage to Cowser-Griffin, Mr. Griffin was diagnosed with renal cell cancer. He died on May 26, 2012. He had not retired from Dominion. No party had applied for a QDRO or notified the Dominion Plan Administrator of an alternate payee for the Salaried Savings Plan. In October 2012, Mrs. Griffin sent a draft QDRO to Dominion. Dominion\u2019s Plan Administrator responded that the proposed domestic relations order (\u201cDRO\u201d) would not be treated as a QDRO in light of <em>Board of Trustees of the Indiana State Council of Plasterers &amp; Cement Masons Pension Fund v. Steffens, </em>Case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>No. 4:12CV513 JCH, 2012 WL 5207499 (E.D.Mo.2012), a case concerning a domestic relations order entered after the plan participant\u2019s death. However, Dominion continued an administrative hold on Mr. Griffin\u2019s Salaried Savings Plan benefits pending the outcome of the litigation concerning the proper beneficiary under the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The circuit court ruled that it had jurisdiction to reinstate the parties\u2019 divorce case upon the docket \u201cfor such purposes as may be necessary to grant full relief to all parties,\u201d citing Code \u00a7 20-121.1, and that Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K) grants the circuit court continuing authority and jurisdiction \u201cto make any additional orders necessary to effectuate and enforce any order entered pursuant to [equitable distribution].\u201d The circuit court clarified that if it were to enter the QDRO it would not be modifying the final decree\u2019s incorporation of the property settlement agreement, \u201cbut rather would effectuate and enforce such an order by entry of a QDRO.\u201d However, the circuit court denied Mrs. Griffin\u2019s request to enter a proposed QDRO, finding that \u201cunder controlling federal law, without a preexisting QDRO, Mr. Griffin\u2019s retirement benefits in the Dominion Salaried Savings Plan vested entirely in the designated beneficiary and surviving spouse, [Cowser-Griffin], once the plan participant passed away.\u201d The circuit court found that under federal case law,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">at the time of retirement or preretirement death the former spouse must have perfected a QDRO at the time the benefits became payable, or that in order to effect a postmortem qualification of the domestic relations order (\u201cDRO\u201d) as a QDRO, there must have been a DRO awarding the interest in the pension plan and substantially complying with ERISA\u2019s QDRO specificity requirements at the time the benefits became payable. Alternatively, Ms. Sandra Griffin could have put the plan on notice of her children\u2019s interest in the benefits. Ms. Griffin failed to perfect a QDRO prior to Mr. Griffin\u2019s passing, and the final decree of divorce and the PSA do not qualify as a QDRO. Further, there is no evidence in the record that any notice of the children\u2019s potential claim under the PSA was ever provided to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>Plan at any time before the plan participant\u2019s death. Thus, Defendant\u2019s Motion for Entry of the [QDRO] is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVm\">Mrs. Griffin timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Mrs. Griffin\u2019s assignment of error is that \u201c[t]he trial court erred in ruling that the court could not properly enter a qualified domestic relations order under the circumstances of the case.\u201d \u201cWe review the [circuit] court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d Navas v. Navas, </em>43 Va.App. 484, 487, 599 S.E.2d 479, 480 (2004) (quoting <em>Sink v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 655, 658, 507 S.E.2d 670, 671 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">The disbursement of Mr. Griffin\u2019s Salaried Savings Plan falls under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>as stated in the Salaried Savings Plan documents and because it is an \u201cemployee pension benefit plan\u201d as defined in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(2). An \u201cemployee pension benefit plan\u201d or \u201cpension plan\u201d includes a plan maintained by an employer that provides retirement income to employees or deferred income for employees regardless of the method of calculating the benefits under the plan or the method of distributing benefits from the plan. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The principal goal of ERISA is to provide \u201ca set of standard procedures to guide processing of claims and disbursement of benefits.\u201d <em>Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, </em>532 U.S. 141, 148, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 1328, 149 L.Ed.2d 264 (2001). 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a) provides that the Act \u201cshall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.\u201d The legislative intent behind ERISA was to establish a uniform administrative scheme governing employee benefit plans to prevent the employer from being subject to differing regulatory requirements in differing states. <em>Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, </em>482 U.S. 1, 9, 107 S.Ct. 2211, 2216, 96 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987). The United States Supreme Court has \u201cnot hesitated to enforce ERISA\u2019s pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>emption provision where state law created the prospect that an employer\u2019s administrative scheme would be subject to conflicting requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 107 S.Ct. at 2216.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">\n<em>A. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055 Does Not Apply to the Salaried Savings Plan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Congress enacted the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (\u201cREA\u201d) which \u201cenlarged ERISA\u2019s protection of surviving spouses in significant respects.\u201d <em>Boggs v. Boggs, </em>520 U.S. 833, 843, 117 S.Ct. 1754, 1761, 138 L.Ed.2d 45 (1997). The enlarged protections in REA are codified in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055. Pursuant to the statutory language, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055 applies to,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-7\">(A) any defined benefit plan,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-8\">(B) any individual account plan which is subject to the funding standards of section 302 [29 USCS \u00a7 1082], and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-9\">(C) any participant under any other individual account plan<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> unless\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-10\">(i) such plan provides that the participant\u2019s non-forfeitable accrued benefit (reduced by any security interest held by the plan by reason of a loan outstanding to such participant) is payable in full, on the death of the participant, to the participant\u2019s surviving spouse (or, if there is no surviving spouse or the surviving spouse consents in the manner required under subsection (c)(2), to a designated beneficiary),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>(ii) such participant does not elect the payment of benefits in the form of a life annuity, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-4\">(iii) with respect to such participant, such plan is not a direct or indirect transferee (in a transfer after December 31, 1984) of a plan which is described in subparagraph (A) or (B) or to which this clause applied with respect to the participant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055(b)(1) (footnotes added). While \u00a7 1055 governs most pension plans with surviving spouse benefits, it provides an exception for some individual account plans. Mr. Griffin\u2019s estate concedes that the Dominion Salaried Savings Plan is one such plan excepted by the statutory language. Mr. Griffin\u2019s estate, however, relies on language from <em>Boggs </em>stating that <em>all </em>pension plans are governed by \u00a7 1055, and thus, he argues that despite the statutory exception, the Salaried Savings Plan is nevertheless regulated by \u00a7 1055.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqG\">Congress\u2019 concern for surviving spouses is also evident from the expansive coverage of \u00a7 1055, as amended by REA. Section 1055\u2019s requirements, as a general matter, apply to all \u201cindividual account plans\u201d and \u201cdefined benefit plans.\u201d \u00a7 1055(b)(1). The terms are defined, for \u00a7 1055 purposes, so that all pension plans fall within those two categories. See \u00a7 1002(35). Wfiiile some individual account plans escape \u00a7 1055\u2019s surviving spouse annuity requirements under certain conditions, Congress still protects the interests of the surviving spouse by requiring those plans to pay the spouse the nonforfeitable accrued benefits, reduced by certain security interests, in a lump-sum payment. \u00a7 1055(b)(1)(C).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq1\"><em>Boggs, </em>520 U.S. at 843,117 S.Ct. at 1761-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">First, we note that the above quoted language from <em>Boggs </em>is dicta and we note that, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Griffin\u2019s estate, the <em>Boggs </em>Court\u2019s choice of words actually is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>that \u00a7 1055 applies <em>\u201cas a general matter </em>... to all \u2018individual account plans\u2019 and \u2018defined benefit plans.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, we do not read <em>Boggs </em>as a judicial revision of the statutory language designed to eliminate exceptions created by Congress. In <em>Boggs, </em>the pension plan at issue in the above quoted analysis was a \u201cqualified joint and survivor annuity mandated by ERISA\u201d in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055(a) and (d)(1), <em>id. </em>at 842, 117 S.Ct. at 1761, and not an individual account plan as is the case here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the Supreme Court was <em>not </em>faced with deciding whether a particular individual account plan fell within the statutory exception to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055, as provided in \u00a7 1055(b)(1)(C), the Court\u2019s interpretation that \u00a7 1055 applies to all individual account plans is dicta and not binding precedent. <em>See Camreta v. Greene, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 2020, 2045, 179 L.Ed.2d 1118 (2011) (dicta remarks do not establish law or qualify as binding precedent).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The fact that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055(b)(1)(C) requires excepted plans to pay a surviving spouse the participant\u2019s nonforfeitable accrued benefits in a lump-sum payment does not mean that the other provisions of \u00a7 1055 apply to those plans. While \u00a7 1055(b)(1)(C) does require excepted plans to pay a surviving spouse the participant\u2019s nonforfeitable accrued benefits in a lump-sum payment, this requirement is one of three to be met for an individual account plan to be <em>excepted </em>from \u00a7 1055; it would be illogical to conclude that \u00a7 1055 applies to an individual account plan excepted by the language of the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Additionally, the fact that the Salaried Savings Plan requires spousal consent in the same manner as provided in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055(c)(2) does not mean that \u00a7 1055 applies to the Plan. In fact, the statute itself contemplates that excepted plans may require spousal consent \u201cin the manner required under subsection (c)(2).\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055(b)(l)(C)(i). Accordingly, while an ERISA governed plan may require consent in the manner provided in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055(c)(2), it may escape \u00a7 1055 application. Such is the case here where the Salaried Savings Plan requires spousal consent in the manner provided in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055(c)(2). The Salaried Savings Plan meets \u00a7 1055\u2019s requirements for excepted plans because (1) the Plan provides that the participant\u2019s benefits are payable in full to the surviving spouse upon the participant\u2019s death, (2) Mr. Griffin did not elect to receive benefits in the form of a life annuity, and (3) there is no evidence or allegations that the Salaried Savings Plan is a transferee of a previous plan. Moreover, as stated <em>supra, </em>Mr. Griffin\u2019s estate concedes that the Salaried Savings Plan is excepted from \u00a7 1055 application. Therefore, the Plan is not subject to the regulations that apply to joint and survivor annuities and pre-retirement survivor annuities pursuant to \u00a7 1055, nor does the case law interpreting the \u00a7 1055 annuity regulations apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">\n<em>B. ERISA Allows for Assignment or Alienation of Plan Benefits Pursuant to a QDRO</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Turning to Mrs. Griffin\u2019s proposed QDRO, we must determine whether it meets the statutory requirements for a QDRO, and if it does, it is not pre-empted. <em>Boggs, </em>520 U.S. at 848, 117 S.Ct. at 1764. In other words, enforceability of Mrs. Griffin\u2019s interest \u201cultimately depends on whether a state court order is qualified under ERISA.\u201d <em>Langston v. Wilson McShane Corp., </em>828 N.W.2d 109, 116 (Minn.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">ERISA generally obligates administrators to manage ERISA plans \u201cin accordance with the documents and instruments governing them.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(D). \u201cAt a more specific level, the Act requires covered pension benefit plans to \u2018provide that benefits ... under the plan may not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>assigned or alienated,\u2019 [29 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1056(d)(1), but this bar does not apply to qualified domestic relations orders (QDROs), [29 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1056(d)(3).\u201d <em>Kennedy v. Plan Adm\u2019r for DuPont Sav. &amp; Inv. Plan, </em>555 U.S. 285, 288, 129 S.Ct. 865, 868, 172 L.Ed.2d 662 (2009). \u201cThe QDRO provision is an exception not only to ERISA\u2019s rule against assignment of plan benefits but also to ERISA\u2019s broad preemption of state law.\u201d <em>Trs. of the Dirs. Guild v. Tise, </em>234 F.3d 415, 420 (9th Cir.2000) (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(7)). 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(A) provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abk\">Paragraph (1) [stating benefits may not be assigned or alienated] shall apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a domestic relations order, except that paragraph (1) shall not apply if the order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order. <em>Each pension plan shall provide for the payment of benefits in accordance with the applicable requirements of any qualified domestic relations order.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The Dominion Salaried Savings Plan provides under the heading \u201cDeath Benefits, Your Beneficiary\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">If you die while employed by Dominion, the entire value of your account is distributed to your beneficiary, including the value of all Company Matching contributions that automatically become vested upon your death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">Federal law requires that, <em>if you are married when you die, </em>your spouse must receive the distribution unless she or he approved your choice of another (or an additional) beneficiary before your death. Your spouse must agree to your choice of that beneficiary by signing the spousal consent portion of a Beneficiary Authorization Form obtained from ACS. The form must have been completed, signed, notarized, and returned to ACS before your death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">However, the Salaried Savings Plan document includes the 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(A) requirement by stating: \u201cif you are divorced, benefit payments from the Pension Plan or Savings Plan may be made to your former spouse, your child, or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>dependent only in response to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The term \u201cdomestic relations order\u201d is defined as \u201cany judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement) which\u2014(I) relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant, and (II) is made pursuant to a State domestic relations law....\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii).

The QDRO is the Tool by which State Courts Can Enforce Marital Property Settlements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">The Griffin PSA was incorporated into the final decree of divorce, and its terms should be enforced by the circuit court. The Code of Virginia provides for reinstatement of divorce suits to allow parties to obtain full relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-9\">In any suit which has been stricken from the docket, and in which complete relief has not been obtained, upon the motion or application of either party to the original proceedings, the same shall be reinstated upon the docket for such purposes as may be necessary to grant full relief to all parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Code \u00a7 20-121.1. \u201c[M]arital property settlements entered into by competent parties upon valid consideration for lawful purposes are favored in the law and such will be enforced unless their illegality is clear and certain.\u201d <em>Derby v.

More generally, \u201cwhen a contract has been made, and either party refuses to perform the agreement, equity enforces the performance of the contract specifically, by compelling the refractory party to fulfill his engagement according to its terms.\u201d <em>Dunsmore v. Lyle, </em>87 Va. 391, 392, 12 S.E. 610, 611 (1891). Thus, as the legality of the PSA incorporated into the final decree is uncontested, the circuit court is responsible for enforcing its terms under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The parties agreed in the PSA to \u201cname the children of the marriage as co-beneficiaries under all 401 (k) plans and other such plans which would be distributed upon the death of either party.\u201d Although Mr. Griffin initially named his children as beneficiaries, he later changed the designated beneficiary on the Salaried Savings Plan to Cowser-Griffin and named the children only as contingent beneficiaries. Thus, Mr. Griffin clearly breached the terms of the PSA by naming Cowser-Griffin as the beneficiary to his Salaried Savings Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">When a party breaches the terms of a property settlement agreement by failing to name beneficiaries on ERISA-governed accounts in accordance with the agreement, the only way for the circuit court to enforce the agreement is to issue a QDRO. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3); <em>Kennedy, </em>555 U.S. at 288, 129 S.Ct. at 868 (ERISA prohibits assignment or alienation of benefits governed by the plan except in the case of a QDRO). \u201cThe QDRO provisions of ERISA do not suggest that a former spouse has no interest in the plans until she obtains a QDRO, they merely prevent her from enforcing her interest until the QDRO is obtained.\u201d <em>Gendreau v. Gendreau, </em>122 F.3d 815, 819 (9th Cir.1997). A spouse\u2019s \u201cinterest in the pension plans (or, at a minimum, her right to obtain a QDRO which would in turn give her an interest in the plans) was established under state law at the time of the divorce decree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818. \u201cState family law can ... create enforceable interests in the proceeds of an ERISA plan, so long as those interests are articulated in accord with the QDRO provision\u2019s requirements.\u201d <em>Tise, </em>234 F.3d at 420; <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number><em>Turner v. Turner, </em>47 Va.App. 76, 79, 622 S.E.2d 263, 265 (2005) (this Court agreed with wife that the \u201cQDRO simply was an administrative mechanism to effectuate the intent and purpose of the final decree\u2019s award\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">\n<em>D. A DRO May Be Revised to Meet the QDRO Requirements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">While the PSA and final decree in this case do not meet the requirements of a QDRO, under state law a circuit court may make additional orders necessary to effectuate and enforce an order of the court. The circuit court has the authority to modify an order intended to affect or divide deferred compensation plans or retirement benefits for the purpose of establishing the order as a QDRO \u201cor to revise or conform its terms so as to effectuate the expressed intent of the order.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4). Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4) \u201c \u2018permits the court to revise its orders to comply with language required by federal law to effectuate the intended pension award, but not to substantively change the pension award itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Craig v. Craig, </em>59 Va.App. 527, 539, 721 S.E.2d 24, 30 (2012) (quoting <em>Irwin v. Irwin, </em>47 Va.App. 287, 297 n. 8, 623 S.E.2d 438, 443 n. 8 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Further, in the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Congress makes clear that a QDRO will not fail solely because the order is issued after, or revises, another domestic relations order; nor will it fail solely because of the time at which it is issued. Pub.L. No. 109-280, \u00a7 1001, 120 Stat. 780, 1001 (2006) . Congress mandated that the Secretary of Labor issue regulations under ERISA to this end:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-9\">Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall issue regulations under section 206(d)(3) of the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 and section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which clarify that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-10\">(1) <em>a domestic relations order otherwise meeting the requirements to be qualified domestic relations order ... </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number><em>shall not fail to be treated as a qualified domestic relations order solely </em>because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-5\">(A) <em>the order is issued after, or revises, another domestic relations order or qualified domestic relations order; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-6\">(B) of the time at which it is issued[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, both the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and the Code of Virginia permit revisions to a DRO, as long as the revisions do not substantively change the award itself, in order to produce a QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">In this case, it does not matter that the final decree and PSA were not QDROs because it is permissible under both federal and state law that an order issued after and revising these domestic relations orders can become a QDRO. Further, the proposed QDRO did not make any substantive changes to the benefits agreed upon in the final decree and PSA, the substantive portion of which is: \u201cThe parties agree to name the children of the marriage as co-beneficiaries under all 401K Plans and other such plans which would be distributed upon the death of either party.\u201d The proposed QDRO provides \u201cThe Alternate Payees [James J. Griffin, III, and Gloria D. Griffin] shall be entitled to One Hundred Percent (100%) of the Member\u2019s vested account under the Plan to be divided equally between them, fifty percent (50%) each.\u201d The crux of both of these provisions is equal distribution of death benefits from the 401(k) Salaried Savings Plan to the children. While the DROs did not meet the specificity requirements of a QDRO, the purpose of the proposed QDRO is to meet these specificity requirements, as permitted by the federal and state laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">\n<em>E. The Proposed QDRO Meets ERISA\u2019s Specificity Requirements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">The proposed QDRO meets the specificity requirements found in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3). The proposed QDRO includes the information required by \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(C): (1) the names and mailing addresses of Mr. Griffin, the plan participant, and his children, the alternate payees, (2) the percentage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>of benefits each alternate payee should be paid, fifty-percent each, (3) the number of payments to which the order applies, single cash sums or \u201csuch other form of distribution as may be elected by the Alternate Payees under the terms of the Plan,\u201d and (4) the plan to which the order applies, the interest of Mr. Griffin in the Dominion Salaried Savings Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">In accordance with 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(D)\u00ae, the proposed QDRO does not require the Salaried Savings Plan to provide a type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the Plan. The proposed QDRO seeks one hundred percent of the benefits vested in Mr. Griffin\u2019s Salaried Savings Plan in the form of a single cash sum or other distribution as the children may elect under the Plan. This is consistent with the Salaried Savings Plan which provides, \u201cIf you die while employed by Dominion, the entire value of your account is distributed to your beneficiary, including the value of all Company matching contributions that automatically become vested upon your death,\u201d and \u201cNon-spousal Beneficiaries must elect to receive the balance of your Account in an immediate lump sum payment or in annual payments totaling the balance of your Account that conclude within five (5) years after the date of your death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The fact that the proposed QDRO names beneficiaries other than Cowser-Griffin does not change the form of benefit. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(E)(i)(III) provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-7\">A domestic relations order shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(D)\u00ae ] solely because such order requires that payment of benefits be made to an alternate payee ... in any form in which such benefits may be paid under the plan to the participant (other than in the form of a joint and survivor annuity with respect to the alternate payee and his or her subsequent spouse).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Here, the Salaried Savings Plan is not a joint and survivor annuity, but rather a defined contribution plan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>29 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(34). Also, the Plan allowed Mr. Griffin to receive the entire balance of his account at any time after his retirement. Thus, the request in the proposed QDRO for the children, and not Cowser-Griffin, to receive payment of the benefits, in lump sum or other option available to them under the Plan, does not run afoul of the requirement that the QDRO only require a form of benefit already provided by the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The regulations issued by the Department of Labor pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 in the form of illustrative examples, apply to this case,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Examples 1 and 4 of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2530.206(d) specifically support the conclusion that the proposed QDRO in this case conforms to the \u201ctype or form of benefit\u201d requirement of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)\u00ae. In 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2530.206(d)(2)(ex. 1) the \u201cParticipant and Spouse divorce, and their divorce decree provides that the parties will prepare a [DRO] assigning 50 percent of Participant\u2019s benefits under a 401(k) plan to Spouse to be paid in monthly installments over a 10-year period.\u201d Participant then dies while actively employed. <em>Id. </em>\u201cA [DRO] consistent with the divorce decree is subsequently submitted to the 401(k) plan; however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>the plan does not provide for 10-year installment payments of the type described in the order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The example provides that \u201cthe order does not fail to be treated as a QDRO solely because it is issued after the death of Participant, but the order would fail to be a QDRO ... because the order requires the plan to provide a type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the plan.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The example provided in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2530.206(d)(2)(ex. 4) is also applicable to this case: Participant retires and begins receiving benefit payments in the form of a straight life annuity based on the life of participant, and spouse waived her surviving spousal rights. Participant then divorces spouse after the annuity start date and presents the plan with a DRO \u201cthat eliminates the straight life annuity based on Participant\u2019s life and provides for Spouse, as alternate payee, to receive all future benefits in the form of a straight life annuity based on the life of Spouse. The plan does not allow reannuitization with a new annuity starting date.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">[T]he order does not fail to be a QDRO solely because it is issued after the annuity starting date, but the order would fail to be a QDRO ... because the order requires the plan to provide a type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the plan. However, the order would not fail to be a QDRO ... if instead it were to require all of Participant\u2019s future payments under the plan to be paid instead to Spouse, as an alternate payee (so that payments that would otherwise be paid to the Participant during the Participant\u2019s lifetime are instead to be made to the Spouse during the Participant\u2019s lifetime).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">In this case, the relevant benefit is the funds in a 401(k) payable in a lump sum, which is essentially what the proposed QDRO requests to be paid to the children. The proposed QDRO does not call for a change in the type or form of benefit such as payment over a term not offered by the Plan or a reannuitization not allowed under the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>The proposed QDRO also meets the last two requirements in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(D). It does not call for the Plan to provide increased benefits determined on actuarial values, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(D)(ii), as Mr. Griffin\u2019s Salaried Savings Plan benefits were not based on actuarial calculations, but only the sum of his contributions, Dominion\u2019s matching contributions, and the investment earnings on those contributions. Further, the proposed QDRO does not require the payment of benefits to an alternate payee which are required to be paid to another alternate payee pursuant to a previously entered QDRO, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(D)(iii), as there is no previously entered QDRO in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">\n<em>F. The Timing of the Proposed QDRO Does Not Cause it to Fail</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The fact that the proposed QDRO was not entered before the circuit court or to the Plan until after Mr. Griffin\u2019s death does not cause it to fail. As previously mentioned, in the Pension Protection Act of 2006 Congress ordered the Secretary of Labor to enter regulations clarifying that a DRO shall not fail to be treated as a QDRO solely because of the time at which it issued. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2530.206(c) gives examples illustrating how a DRO shall not fail to be treated as a QDRO solely because of the time at which it is issued. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2530.206(c)(2)(ex. 1) provides that a QDRO does not fail to be treated as a QDRO solely because it is issued after the death of the participant who died while actively employed and the order was subsequently submitted to the plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az6\">Example (1). Orders issued after death. Participant and Spouse divorce, and the administrator of Participant\u2019s plan receives a domestic relations order, but the administrator finds the order deficient and determines that it is not a QDRO. Shortly thereafter, Participant dies while actively employed. A second domestic relations order correcting the defects in the first order is subsequently submitted to the plan. The second order does not fail to be treated as a QDRO solely because it is issued after the death of the Participant. The result would be the same even if no order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>had been issued before the Participant\u2019s death, in other words, the order issued after death were the only order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYX\">Thus, in the present case, the proposed QDRO should not fail solely because it was not entered prior to Mr. Griffin\u2019s death, and the fact that the Plan was not on notice of an alternate payee is of no consequence according to the last sentence of the instruction example in the applicable federal regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">\n<em>G. The Plan Benefits Did Not Vest in CowserGriffin upon Mr. Griffin\u2019s Death</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The circuit court concluded that \u201cunder controlling federal law\u201d Mr. Griffin\u2019s retirement benefits in the Salaried Savings Plan vested entirely in Cowser-Griffin at the moment of Mr. Griffin\u2019s death. However, federal law does not dictate that the benefits vested in Cowser-Griffin at Mr. Griffin\u2019s death; rather, ERISA generally obligates administrators to manage ERISA plans \u201cin accordance with the documents and instruments governing them.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(D). In this case, the Salaried Savings Plan documents only refer to \u201cvesting\u201d in terms of benefits vesting in the participant\u2019s account. The Salaried Savings Plan does not address the vesting of benefits in a spouse or other beneficiary, but rather defines vesting as the participant\u2019s \u201cnon-forfeitable right to part or all of the value of [his] account.\u201d The Plan states that the participant is \u201calways vested in the value of [his] employee Pre-tax, After-tax, and Rollover contributions and the investment earnings on those contributions,\u201d and is vested in company matching contributions and their earnings after three years of service. While the Plan requires spousal consent for a participant to designate a beneficiary other than his current spouse as the recipient of the funds vested in the participant\u2019s account, it also provides that a QDRO may assign the participant\u2019s Salaried Savings Plan benefits to a former spouse, child, or other dependent.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Moreover, ERISA contemplates situations where a benefit becomes payable, but a court or the plan administrator takes months to determine if a DRO qualifies as a QDRO. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(H) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>(i) During any period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations order is being determined (by the plan administrator, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise), the plan administrator shall separately account for the amounts (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the \u201csegregated amounts\u201d) which would have been payable to the alternate payee during such period if the order had been determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-5\">(ii) If within the 18-month period described in clause (v) the order (or modification thereof) is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order, the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person or persons entitled thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-6\">$$$$$$</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-7\">(iv) Any determination that an order is a qualified domestic relations order which is made after the close of the 18-month period described in clause (v) shall be applied prospectively only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Thus, a proposed QDRO does not automatically fail solely because a benefit has become payable and the correct beneficiary or beneficiaries are not yet determined. This statute provides for the situation of this case where a QDRO would be presented to the plan administrator after benefits become payable and the proper beneficiary is not yet determined or may have to be re-determined; this runs contrary to the circuit court\u2019s finding that benefits automatically vest in the surviving spouse where there is no preexisting QDRO.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court in <em>Tise </em>likewise interpreted 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(H): \u201cthe statute necessarily permits an alternate payee who has obtained a state law DRO before the plan participant\u2019s retirement, death, or other benefit-triggering event to perfect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>DRO into a QDRO thereafter (subject to the 18-month period after which any previously-due benefits are payable to the original beneficiary).\u201d <em>Tise, </em>234 F.3d at 422-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\"><em>Hopkins v. AT &amp; T Global Information Solutions Co., </em>105 F.3d 153 (4th Cir.1997), is the case Mr. Griffin\u2019s estate relies on as the \u201ckeystone case on the issue of vested rights for surviving spouses.\u201d <em>Hopkins </em>is easily distinguishable from the present case because of the form of benefit at issue in the case. In <em>Hopkins, </em>husband retired and began receiving pension benefits in the form of a qualified joint and survivor annuity, where he received a fixed income for his life (\u201cpension benefits\u201d), and if his spouse at retirement survived him, she would receive 50% of that fixed income for the remainder of her life (\u201csurviving spouse benefits\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 154-55. Also, if husband died prior to retirement, pension benefits would be paid to his spouse as preretirement survivor annuity. <em>Id. </em>at 155 n. 1. Husband\u2019s former spouse sought judgment to collect alimony against husband\u2019s pension benefits and against his current spouse\u2019s (also his spouse at retirement) surviving spouse benefits. The state court granted two judgment orders, one against the pension benefits and one against the surviving spouse benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 155. AT &amp; T conceded that the order concerning the pension benefits was a QDRO, but argued that \u201cbecause the Surviving Spouse Benefits had already vested in [the current spouse], the Surviving Spouse Order is not a QDRO.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The Fourth Circuit noted that the question of whether a participant\u2019s current' spouse has a vested interest in the surviving spouse benefits is a question of first impression on the federal courts and pointed out that ERISA does not explicitly state when a current spouse\u2019s interest in the surviving spouse benefits vests. <em>Id. </em>at 156. \u201cHowever, after carefully reviewing the overall framework of ERISA, especially the provisions governing joint and survivor annuities, we conclude that the Surviving Spouse Benefits vest in the participant\u2019s current spouse on the date the participant retires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Hopkins </em>court relied on the strict regulations that specifically apply to joint and survivor annuities and the accompany<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>ing surviving spouse benefits set forth in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055 as support for its holding that the participant\u2019s spouse at the time of retirement has a vested interest in the surviving spouse benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 156-57. The court also noted that because the disbursement of the plan benefits is \u201cbased on actuarial computations, the plan administrator must know the life expectancy of the person receiving the Surviving Spouse Benefits to determine the participant\u2019s monthly Pension Benefits. As a result, the plan administrator needs to know, on the day the participant retires, to whom the Surviving Spouse Benefits is payable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157 n. 7. Additionally, the court noted that a former spouse could obtain an interest in the participant\u2019s pension benefits by obtaining a QDRO at any time, as the former spouse did. <em>Id. </em>at 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">As the surviving spouse benefits in <em>Hopkins </em>were a product of a joint and survivor annuity regulated by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055, <em>Hopkins </em>is not persuasive on the subject of vesting as Mr. Griffin\u2019s estate suggests because the Salaried Savings Plan is exempted from \u00a7 1055 application. Further, unlike the plan in <em>Hopkins, </em>Mr. Griffin\u2019s Salaried Savings Plan benefits do not depend on actuarial calculations of the life of Mr. Griffin or Cowser-Griffin, or provide defined retirement benefits to Cowser-Griffin for the span of her life as predicted at Mr. Griffin\u2019s death or retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Mr. Griffin\u2019s estate also relies on <em>Carmona v. Carmona, </em>544 F.3d 988 (9th Cir.2008), to support his argument that Mr. Griffin\u2019s benefits vested in Cowser-Griffin on the date of his death. However, like <em>Hopkins, </em>the benefits at issue in <em>Carmona </em>are qualified joint survivor annuity benefits. The court concluded, \u201conce a participant retires, the spouse at the time becomes the \u2018surviving spouse\u2019 entitled to the QJSA benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1002. \u201cERISA\u2019s surviving spouse benefits established in section 1055 were created in part \u2018to ensure a stream of income to surviving spouses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Boggs, </em>520 U.S. at 843, 117 S.Ct. at 1761). Once again, the Salaried Savings Plan benefits at issue in this case do not qualify as surviving spouse annuity benefits established in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <em>Hamilton v. Washington State Plumbing &amp; Pipefitting Industry Pension Plan, </em>433 F.3d 1091 (9th Cir.2006), has also distinguished treatment of surviving spouse benefits regulated by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055 from a participant\u2019s pension benefits upon his retirement or death. The court found that the rights of a surviving spouse to a preretirement survivor annuity, governed by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055, are available only to a surviving spouse or a former spouse properly designated, but not available to children as alternate payees pursuant to a QDRO. <em>Id. </em>at 1101. However, the court noted that \u201cdesignating children in a QDRO as alternate payees under a pension plan can provide a myriad of potential benefits to the children, depending on their ages, the date of the participant\u2019s disability, retirement, or death, and the participant\u2019s marital status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court distinguished the effectiveness of a QDRO entered against surviving spouse annuities regulated by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055 and other pension benefits that are not \u00a7 1055 surviving spouse annuities.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The <em>Tise </em>court also drew a distinction between a participant\u2019s pension benefits, which were at issue before the court, and surviving spouse benefits pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A47\">Whether a QDRO issued after a plan participant\u2019s retirement may affect the distribution of surviving spouse benefits pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055 implicates statutory provisions and policy considerations other than those here applicable. <em>See [Hopkins, </em>105 F.3d at 156-57]; <em>Rivers v.

We therefore leave to a ease concerning \u00a7 1055 the determination whether, as <em>Hopkins </em>and <em>Rivers </em>determined, the plan participant\u2019s retirement cuts off a putative alternate payee\u2019s right to obtain an enforceable QDRO substituting the alternate payee for the surviving spouse with regard to statutory surviving spouse benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apg\"><em>Tise, </em>234 F.3d at 422 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">In the Commonwealth, it is well established that \u201c \u2018property rights and interests [become] vested in the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>when they [agree] upon them, set them forth in a valid separation agreement, and [have] them incorporated into their final divorce decree.\u2019 \u201d <em>Irwin, </em>47 Va.App. at 294, 623 S.E.2d at 441 (quoting <em>Himes v.

CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Mrs. Griffin\u2019s proposed QDRO meets the specific requirements of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3). The Salaried Savings Plan escapes application of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055, and the benefits did not vest in Cowser-Griffin at Mr. Griffin\u2019s death. Therefore, we reverse and remand with direction to the circuit court to enter the proposed QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-6\">. Mr. Griffin also had a special retirement account that was included as part of his Dominion Power Pension Plan. The special retirement account goes to the named beneficiary if the participant dies before retirement. Mr. Griffin named Cowser-Griffin as the beneficiary of the special retirement account.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">In Mrs. Griffin's original motion before the circuit court, she stated that both the Salaried Savings Plan and the special retirement account under his Pension Fund are both subject to a QDRO and the focus of her motion. However, the proposed QDRO only names the Salaried Savings Plan, and not the Dominion Power Pension Plan or special retirement account that Mrs. Griffin mentions in her original motion and her brief. The circuit court only addressed the Dominion Salaried Savings Plan, and Mrs. Griffin did not note any specific objection stating that the circuit court failed to address additional plans or funds. Therefore, we only address the Dominion Salaried Savings Plan as it was the only plan addressed in the proposed QDRO.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b795-11\">.

Moreover, the concession made by Mr. Griffin\u2019s estate was not that the Salaried Savings Plan was exempt from the federal act and therefore was alienable under state law. Rather, Mr. Griffin\u2019s estate was asserting that since the benefit is payable to the surviving spouse, in a lump sum, the statutory safeguards relating to annuities are not applicable and the surviving spouse is protected in the absence of a QDRO or spousal consent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Being excepted from \u00a7 1055 does not mean that the benefit is exempted from the policy or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>provisions of ERISA. <em>Boggs, </em>520 U.S. at 843, 117 S.Ct. at 1761.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Mr. Griffin was employed by Dominion Virginia Power at the time of his divorce and until his death on May 26, 2012. Griffin was obligated, by the terms of the Griffin DRO, to name his two children as co-beneficiaries under any 401(k) and other similar plans. As part of his employment benefits, he participated in a pension plan, the Dominion Power Pension Plan, and a 401(k) type of plan, the Dominion Salaried Savings Plan. Griffin, however, did not comply with the terms of the Griffin DRO by naming his children as co-beneficiaries of any retirement benefits. Rather, when he remarried after his divorce from appellant, he named his new wife, Kimberly Cowser-Griffin (\u201cCowser-Griffin\u201d), as the primary beneficiary and named his children as contingent beneficiaries. In the trial court, appellant requested a QDRO to enforce the terms of the Griffin DRO as applied to the Dominion Salaried Savings Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">As an employee benefit plan, the Plan is governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) and Dominion\u2019s plan documents.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Dominion\u2019s plan documents provide the specific payout method employed by the Plan Administrator to distribute benefits, requiring that the surviving spouse receive the funds unless written spousal consent is obtained prior to retirement or death. The Plan Administrator may deviate from this payout method only in response to a QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Fourteen years after the Griffin DRO was entered and approximately three months after Griffin\u2019s death, appellant filed a motion in the trial court seeking to reinstate the prior divorce proceedings and enter the proposed Griffin QDRO, preserving the beneficiary status for her children under the Plan. Prior to this motion, neither appellant nor her children had notified the Dominion Plan Administrator of any alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>interest in the benefits outlined in the Griffin DRO. Additionally, Cowser-Griffin did not provide spousal consent for any change in beneficiaries prior to Griffin\u2019s death. On May 6, 2018, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion, holding that the Plan\u2019s retirement benefits vested entirely in CowserGriffin as the designated beneficiary and surviving spouse under the Plan at Griffin\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">\u201cIn determining whether the trial court made an error of law, \u2018we review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u2019 \u201d Rollins v.

Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 193, 503 S.E.2d 233, 236 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred by denying her motion for entry of a qualified domestic relations order seeking to reinstate her children\u2019s beneficiary status as required under the Griffin DRO. Specifically, she asserts that her children\u2019s rights vested when the trial court entered the Griffin DRO; thus, the entry of a posthumous QDRO would enforce rights that vested prior to Griffin\u2019s death. In support of her assertion, she argues that because ERISA stipulates no deadline for a QDRO\u2019s entry after a plan participant\u2019s death, ERISA impliedly authorizes posthumous QDROs. She also states that the entry of a posthumous QDRO would not impair the Plan\u2019s administration because the Plan benefits are distributed in a lump sum to the beneficiaries, as opposed to an annuity payment. Alternatively, she argues that this Court should characterize the Griffin DRO as a QDRO and enter it <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to the date of the trial court\u2019s entry of the Griffin DRO. Cowser-Griffin intervened on behalf of the Estate of David Griffin and argues that her rights to the benefits vested upon Griffin\u2019s death because she was the surviving spouse and did not consent to any assignment of benefits. Accordingly, she asserts that the entry of a posthumous QDRO would divest her right as the surviving spouse. She also argues that this Court should not consider the Griffin DRO to be a QDRO and enter it <em>nunc pro tunc </em>because of its failure to conform to statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>ERISA\u2019s purpose is \u201cto ensure the proper administration of pension and welfare plans, both during the years of the employee\u2019s active service and in his or her retirement years.\u201d <em>Boggs, </em>520 U.S. at 889, 117 S.Ct. at 1759. To effectuate this administration, ERISA implemented a preemption mandate, \u201csuperseding] any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan\u201d governed by ERISA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a) (2006). Although ERISA requires that \u201cbenefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1), the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (\u201cREA\u201d), Pub.L. 98-397, 98 Stat. 1426, amended ERISA to allow designation of a beneficiary other than the surviving spouse in two narrow circumstances: first, pursuant to a QDRO, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(A), and second, through spousal consent, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055(c)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">A DRO is defined as \u201cany judgment, decree, or order (including approval of property settlement agreement) which ... relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii)(I). Conversely, a DRO is deemed to be a \u201cqualified\u201d DRO when it \u201ccreates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee\u2019s rights to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan,\u201d and it meets certain substantive and specificity requirements. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)\u00ae.

In accordance with these guidelines, the plan documents in this case require that the surviving spouse receives the distribution unless spousal consent to a change in the beneficiary designation is obtained prior to death.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The central inquiry in this case is whether the beneficiary rights to the Plan vested at the trial court\u2019s entry of the Griffin DRO or when the benefits became payable upon Griffin\u2019s death. Indeed, vesting is the threshold question to whether a posthumous QDRO would be appropriate in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>case because if in fact Cowser-Griffin\u2019s rights vested at Griffin\u2019s death, then a posthumous QDRO would divest her of the benefits to which she was entitled. Although the vesting point of surviving spouse\u2019s benefits under ERISA is a case of first impression for this Court, this Court should follow the long line of precedent, including the Fourth Circuit and ERISA\u2019s own provisions, which provide that a surviving spouse\u2019s benefits are vested at the time of the participant\u2019s death. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055(c)(l)(A)(i), (7)(B); <em>Hopkins v.

Under Virginia law, rights vest at the entry of the final divorce decree; while under ERISA, rights vest at the plan participant\u2019s retirement or death. <em>Compare Himes v. Himes, </em>12 Va.App. 966, 970, 407 S.E.2d 694, 697 (1991) (holding that it is well established that \u201cproperty rights and interests [become] vested in the parties when they [agree] upon them, set them forth in a valid separation agreement, and [have] them incorporated into their final divorce decree\u201d), <em>with </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055(c)(l)(A)(i), (7)(B) (requiring that a plan participant can only change beneficiary designations via spousal consent during the period between when the participant attains age 35 and when the participant dies); <em>Hopkins, </em>105 F.3d at 156-57 (interpreting \u00a7 1055 and concluding that the limited time period to change beneficiaries under ERISA permanently set the vesting date at either the retirement or death of the plan participant), <em>and </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1) and (d)(3) (prohibiting alienation of benefits except through a QDRO). Notably, appellant recognizes this fundamental dichotomy between Virginia law and ERISA by stating that \u201cthe facts in the present case and the plan\u2019s requirement to pay benefits upon the participant\u2019s death to the surviving spouse create a clear contest between the rights created in the state court versus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>the rights granted under the [P]lan.\u201d Indeed, appellant\u2019s argument hinges on the conclusion that \u201c[b]ecause the children\u2019s rights in the retirement plan vested well before Mrs. CowserGriffin had any arguable claim to the plan, this case should be decided in favor of the children.\u201d In my view, no convincing argument has been provided as to why this Court should apply Virginia\u2019s vesting rule when faced with ERISA\u2019s contrary vesting rule and its preemption mandate requiring invalidation of any conflicting state law. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a). Importantly, the Supreme Court of Virginia has recognized that \u201cERISA preempts enforcement of any state law or contractual provision that \u2018relates to\u2019 an ERISA employee benefit plan and conflicts with an ERISA provision.\u201d <em>Brown v. Brown by Beacham, </em>244 Va. 319, 325, 422 S.E.2d 375, 379 (1992) (finding that ERISA allowed a notarized signature to constitute spousal consent).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">In <em>Boggs, </em>the United States Supreme Court recognized that ERISA may at times conflict with jurisprudence typically reserved to the states, but nevertheless, insofar as such state law conflicts with ERISA, the federal law prevails. <em>Boggs, </em>520 U.S. at 841, 117 S.Ct. at 1760-61 (\u201cWe can begin, and in this case end, the analysis by simply asking if state law conflicts with the provisions of ERISA or operates to frustrate its objects. We hold that there is a conflict, which suffices to resolve the case.\u201d). Although the United States Supreme Court recognized the historic \u201ccentral\u201d role of state courts in regulating domestic relations matters, <em>id. </em>at 840, 117 S.Ct. at 1760, the Court by no means granted state courts exclusivity, but rather, invalidated the state court\u2019s law simply on the basis of its conflict with ERISA, <em>id. </em>at 841, 117 S.Ct. at 1760-61. ERISA attempts to promote the efficient distribution of benefits and protect the interests and rights of participants and beneficiaries. <em>Cf. Boggs, </em>520 U.S. at 844-46, 117 S.Ct. at 1762-63. If ERISA could not preempt state law, then \u201cstates [would be] free to change ERISA\u2019s structure and balance,\u201d and the goals of ERISA would be thwarted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Neither federal nor state law supports the entry of a posthumous QDRO to divest a surviving spouse\u2019s vested rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>to benefits.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Rather, the direct opposite assertion\u2014that a surviving spouse\u2019s vested rights may not be divested by a posthumous QDRO\u2014finds support in both federal and state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The Fourth Circuit considered the question of vesting in <em>Hopkins, </em>holding that a surviving spouse\u2019s rights vested at the plan participant\u2019s retirement and could not be divested by a post-retirement QDRO. 105 F.3d at 157. In the only reported Virginia case to deal with this issue, a Virginia circuit court applied <em>Hopkins </em>\u2019 rationale, held that a surviving spouse\u2019s rights vested at the plan participant\u2019s death, and refused to divest the surviving spouse\u2019s vested rights in favor of an ex-wife\u2019s alleged rights under a DRO. <em>Riley v. Riley, </em>No. 132690, 1998 WL 972328, at *3-5 (Va.Cir.Ct Aug. 14, 1998). Other federal circuits and state courts have followed this same line of analysis, refusing to divest the vested rights of a surviving spouse when faced with a post-retirement or posthumous QDRO and the plan had no notice of the proposed QDRO before the participant\u2019s death or retirement. <em>E.g., Carmona v. Carmona, </em>544 F.3d 988, 993 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201c[A] state DRO may not create an enforceable interest in surviving spouse benefits to an alternate payee after a participant\u2019s retirement, because ordinarily at retirement the surviving spouse\u2019s interest irrevocably vests.\u201d); <em>Rivers v.

Accordingly, the vested rights of Cowser-Griffin cannot be divested through a posthumous QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Similarly, the vesting issue cannot be dodged by finding that the Griffin DRO was a QDRO and entering it <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to an earlier date before Griffin\u2019s death.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The majority has correctly observed that the DRO lacked the requisite specificity to be deemed a QDRO. This Court cannot consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>Griffin DRO to be a QDRO because the Griffin DRO fails the specificity requirements of a QDRO because it does not list the percentage distribution of benefits between the children, the number of payments, or each plan to which it applies. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(C). Strict compliance with the substantive and specificity requirements is required in order for a DRO to qualify as a QDRO, regardless of whether these deviations may result in inequitable results. <em>Hawkins v. C.I.R., </em>86 F.3d 982, 992 (10th Cir.1996) (holding that \u201cto accept anything less than what [the specificity requirements mandate] would contravene the Supreme Court\u2019s frequent admonition that courts must not read language out of a statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">A DRO may be qualified only when it clearly specifies the plans to which it applies and the amounts and timing of the payments to be received by each beneficiary. <em>See Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Bigelow, </em>283 F.3d 436 (2d Cir.2002) (finding that a DRO could be qualified when it clearly specified each plan to which it applied by identifying the plan as the \u201cGeneral Electric insurance plan which consists of group life insurance, disability death and insurance\u201d); <em>Stewart v. Thorpe Holding Co. Profit Sharing Plan, </em>207 F.3d 1143, 1152 (9th Cir.2000) (finding that a DRO could be qualified when it specified that the beneficiary was \u201cto receive \u2018one-half of the community interest\u2019 \u201d in the plan); <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Marsh, </em>119 F.3d 415, 422 (6th Cir.1997) (finding that DRO could be qualified because it stipulated the percentage distribution to the beneficiaries as two-thirds of the plan). Courts require that the specificity requirements be met with particularity. <em>See Hamilton v. Wash. State Plumbing &amp; Pipefitting Indus. Pension Plan, </em>433 F.3d 1091, 1096-97 (9th Cir.2006) (finding that a DRO failed the specificity requirements for a QDRO because it \u201cdoes not require any action by the Plans, does not assign death benefits to the Children, and does not specify when the payments begin or the amount, calculation, or form of the payments\u201d);<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Bd. of Trs. of Plumbers &amp; Pipefitters </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number><em>Nat\u2019l Pension Fund v. Saxon, </em>470 F.Supp.2d 605, 609 n. 5 (E.D.Va.) (finding that a DRO requiring a husband to \u201ckeep the Wife listed as a beneficiary on the plan\u201d was \u201cextremely vague\u201d and could not be considered a QDRO), <em>ajfd in part, vacated in part, </em>251 Fed.Appx. 155 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">The Griffin DRO fails the specificity requirements because it does not list the amount to be paid to the beneficiaries, the number of payments or durational period, nor the specific plans to which it applies. Rather, the Griffin DRO is an amorphous requirement that the parties agree to \u201cname the children of the marriage as co-beneficiaries under all 401K plans and other such plans which would be distributed upon the death of either party.\u201d The lack of specificity is fatal to the Griffin DRO. This Court cannot relax the specificity requirements because to do so would defy Congress\u2019s clear requirement that a DRO becomes qualified <em>\u201conly if </em>such order clearly specifies\u201d certain requirements. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(C). Indeed, the specificity requirements were enacted to protect the Plan Administrator\u2019s ability to efficiently distribute plan benefits. <em>Hawkins, </em>86 F.3d at 992-93. The Griffin DRO provides no such ease of distribution because it fails to include the amount payable to each child, when the money is to be paid, nor even the specific plans it applies to.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">In this ease state law conflicts with the provisions of ERISA. The federal protection afforded to the surviving spouse should prevail because neither a QDRO nor spousal consent have been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b815-4\">. The majority maintains that the <em>Boggs </em>decision dealt only with an annuity benefit, but the issues in that case, like the one before us, also covered a \"lump-sum distribution from the [Employer] Savings Plan for Salaried Employees----\" <em>Id. </em>at 836, 117 S.Ct. at 1758. Specifically, in analyzing the employee savings plan sums at issue, the <em>Boggs </em>Court noted, \"While some individual account plans escape \u00a7 1055\u2019s surviving spouse annuity requirements under certain conditions, Congress still protects the interests of the surviving spouse by requiring those plans to pay the spouse the nonforfeitable accrued benefits....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843, 117 S.Ct. at 1761-62.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b815-7\">.

Thus, the Salaried Savings Plan requires distribution to a surviving spouse unless a completed, signed and notarized consent is returned to the plan administrator before the plan participant\u2019s death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\">. All parties concede that the Plan is an employment benefit plan or \"pension plan\u201d governed by ERISA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b818-6\">. Additionally, \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(H)(i) states that a DRO may be determined a QDRO by \"a court of competent jurisdiction.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b819-12\">. A spouse properly waives his or her surviving spouse beneficiary designation <em>only when </em>\"the spouse of the participant consents in writing to such election, such election designates a beneficiary (or form of benefits) which may not be changed without spousal consent ..., and the spouse's consent acknowledges the effect of such election and is witnessed by a plan representative or a notary public.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b820-6\">. The majority suggests that the Plan meets this exception requirement of \u00a7 1055 as an individual account plan because the Plan distributes via a lump sum rather than an annuity payment. Subsection 1055(b)(l)(C)(i), however, requires not only a lump sum payout, but also specifically requires spousal consent to designate a non-spouse beneficiary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\">. Under the subheading \"Death Benefits,\u201d the plan documents stipulate,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-8\">Federal law requires that, <em>if you are married when you die, </em>your spouse must receive the distribution unless she or he approved your choice of another (or an additional) beneficiary before your death. Your spouse must agree to your choice of that beneficiary by signing the spousal consent portion of a Beneficiary Authorization form obtained from ACS. The form must have been completed, signed, notarized, and returned to ACS before your death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">(Emphasis in original). Additionally, the plan documents only permit the Plan Administrator to pay distributions deviating from this designation \"in response to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b821-6\">. <em>Hopkins </em>was followed in an unreported Virginia circuit court decision, holding that the surviving spouse's rights vested at the plan participant\u2019s death and that these rights could not be divested by the competing claim of an ex-wife\u2019s through a prior DRO. <em>Riley v. Riley, </em>No. 132690, 1998 WL 972328, at *3-5 (Va.Cir.Ct. Aug. 14, 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b823-6\">. Although 29 C.F.R. 2530.206(c)(2) provides examples for when a posthumous QDRO may be entered after the plan participant\u2019s death, none of the examples involve a competing vested claim to the benefits. Indeed, the examples include no situation in which there is a competing claim to the benefits. Accordingly, these examples do not address the crucial threshold question in this case of vesting and provide no basis for allowing alienation of a benefit vested in the surviving spouse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b824-6\">. <em>See also Singleton v. Singleton, </em>290 F.Supp.2d 767, 772 (W.D.Ky. 2003) (refusing to divest a current spouse's rights when the plan participant retired because \u201d[t]he requirements for disenfranchising a current spouse are strictly applied for good and valid reasons\u201d); <em>Stahl v. Exxon Corp., </em>212 F.Supp.2d 657, 669-70 (S.D.Tex.2002) (citing the majority of circuits that a surviving spouse's rights vest upon the plan participant\u2019s death and refusing to divest the surviving spouse's rights through a posthumous QDRO).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b824-7\">. The Dominion Plan Administrator has already rejected the proposed Griffin QDRO on the grounds that it would \"requir[e] payment of a portion of the surviving spouse's survivor benefits to another person,\u201d thus violating the substantive requirements of a QDRO which provide that the QDRO cannot pay benefits not otherwise available under the Plan. Indeed, if the trial court were to enter the proposed Griffin QDRO, the parties would be faced with the Plan Administrator's standing decision to reject the proposed Griffin QDRO and would need to seek review the Plan Administrator\u2019s decision for error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b824-8\">. The trial court could not enter the proposed Griffin QDRO <em>nunc pro tunc </em>(as opposed to the Griffin DRO) because this action would implicate the threshold question of vesting discussed <em>supra. </em>As appellee correctly points out, the exclusion of the posthumous QDRO is not simply a matter of timing, but is contingent on the issue of vesting. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s only remaining remedy would be for this Court to determine the Griffin DRO to be a QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">I respectfully disagree with the majority's suggestion that we need to determine whether the proposed QDRO meets the statutory requirements. The issue is whether the existing terms of the DRO satisfied the statutory requirement for a QDRO to defeat the vested surviving spouse's claim to the benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b825-6\">. The Ninth Circuit additionally held that besides specificity, in order for a QDRO to divest a surviving spouse of her rights, the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>QDRO had to assign rights to a former spouse, rather than to children. <em>Id. </em>at 1104. This specific approach has not been adopted in the Fourth Circuit nor in Virginia courts, and is an unnecessary complication of the specificity requirements and interpretation of \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(C)(i)-(iv). This Court need not reach this rationale because the Griffin DRO is not valid as a QDRO because it fails the specificity requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
