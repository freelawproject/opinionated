On appeal, Jeffers claims the trial court erred by not suppressing incriminating evidence obtained pursuant to a search warrant. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">In February 2011, investigators with the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force (ICAC) learned that child pornography had been posted on the Internet by a computer using a particular IP address. Pursuant to a subpoena to the electronic service provider, ICAC investigators discovered that the IP address was registered to Isla Loxley at 106 Barricks Mill Road, Topping, Virginia. Deputies from the Middlesex County Sheriffs Office, an affiliate member of ICAC, went to that address to observe the layout of the property for purposes of preparing an affidavit for a search warrant. They observed a trailer and a small barn on the property. They also noticed a vehicle registered to Jeffers, a felon previously convicted of possessing child pornography. The officers then prepared a highly detailed affidavit seeking a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">A magistrate issued a search warrant directing the officers to search for evidence of child pornography on the property. Titled \u201cSEARCH WARRANT\u2014COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA In re/V Isla Loxley,\u201d the warrant specifically identified both of the buildings (the trailer and the barn) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>located at 106 Barricks Mill Road. The warrant authorized the following search:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\">The residence of Isla Loxley. Located at 106 Barricks Mill Rd. Topping, Va 23189. It is a single wide trailer type dwelling. The home is white in color with brown trim, brown shutters, and a brown screened in porch. Located on the curtilage is a <em>brown bam in front of the home. </em>The address is posted on the property and this is to include <em>all persons, </em>vehicles, <em>or outbuildings </em>located within the curtilage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">App. at 83 (emphasis added). Officers arrived at 106 Barricks Mill Road to execute the warrant. The street address, marked by a single mailbox, identified the entire property\u2014 including both the trailer and the barn. The officers first went to the trailer and spoke with one of its residents, who told the officers that Jeffers lived in the barn.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Jeffers was detained by officers when he appeared at the door of the barn. An officer quickly performed a protective sweep of the barn to determine the existence of any threats. The officer then came out of the barn to talk to Jeffers. Jeffers said he received Internet service in the barn from \u201ca physical wire that goes to the computer ... from the trailer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165. Loxley confirmed this with another officer on the scene. Jeffers also stated that \u201che had a porn addiction and an attraction to adolescents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The officers thereafter searched the trailer and the barn pursuant to the warrant. The search confirmed that a computer router inside the trailer supplied Internet access to the barn and that a computer in the barn contained child pornography. In the trial court, Jeffers pled guilty after the trial court denied his motion to suppress the incriminating evidence found during the search. The trial court accepted Jeffers\u2019s guilty pleas conditioned on his right to appeal the adverse ruling on his suppression motion. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-254.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">On appeal, Jeffers presents a limited argument. He does not challenge the validity of the search warrant or the magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>trate\u2019s determination of probable cause. Jeffers concedes \u201cthe warrant was valid when it was obtained. It was valid based on the information provided by the officers to the magistrate and, quite frankly, any reasonable officer would have believed the warrant was valid.\u201d Oral Argument Audio at 19:08 to 19:18. Nor does Jeffers challenge the legality of the protective sweep of the barn. <em>Id. </em>at 5:58 to 6:05. Instead, Jeffers argues that the officers misinterpreted the scope of the warrant to include the barn. Under his reasoning, once the officers discovered that Jeffers lived in the barn, they could not search the barn because it was no longer within the scope of the warrant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The Fourth Amendment requires search warrants to \u201cparticularly describ[e] the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d Police officers executing a particularized search warrant need not read its scope either narrowly or broadly, only reasonably. <em>See United States v. Aljabari, </em>626 F.3d 940, 947 (7th Cir.2010) (acknowledging \u201can executing officer must interpret a warrant\u2019s terms reasonably, but the officer need not give them the narrowest possible reasonable interpretation\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>McClendon v. Story Cnty. Sheriff\u2019s Office, </em>403 F.3d 510, 517 (8th Cir.2005) (noting \u201c[t]he concept of a \u2018narrow construction\u2019 is a convention of legal jurisprudence and would be an unworkable demand to place upon law enforcement\u201d); <em>United States v. Gorman, </em>104 F.3d 272, 274 (9th Cir.1996) (applying \u201can objective test: would a reasonable officer have interpreted the warrant to permit the search at issue\u201d); <em>United States v. Traylor, </em>656 F.2d 1326, 1331 (9th Cir.1981) (noting that narrowly interpreting the terms of a search warrant \u201cwould be reading it in a \u2018hypertechnical\u2019 manner\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Federbush, </em>625 F.2d 246, 251 (9th Cir.1980))).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Rather, the officers\u2019 interpretation must simply be \u201cconsistent with a reasonable effort to ascertain and identify the place intended to be searched,\u201d <em>Maryland v. Garrison, </em>480 U.S. 79, 88, 107 S.Ct. 1013, 1019, 94 L.Ed.2d 72 (1987), bearing in mind that \u201cmany situations which confront officers in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>course of executing their duties are more or less ambiguous,\u201d and thus \u201croom must be allowed for some mistakes on their part.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87 n. 11, 107 S.Ct. at 1018 n. 11 (quoting <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 176, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1311, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949)). To be excusable, of course, mistakes made by officers in the execution of warrants \u201cmust be those of reasonable men, acting on facts leading sensibly to their conclusions of probability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Brinegar, </em>338 U.S. at 176, 69 S.Ct. at 1311). Even so, \u201c[r]easonableness does not, by definition, entail perfection.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, 588 </em>F.3d 218, 227 (4th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Patterson, </em>278 F.3d 315, 318 (4th Cir.2002) (relying on principle that \u201cthe touchstone of the Fourth Amendment inquiry is \u2018sufficient probability, not certainty\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Garrison, </em>480 U.S. at 87, 107 S.Ct. at 1018)).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In this case, Jeffers contends the search warrant was based on the mistaken assumption that no one resided in Loxley\u2019s barn. He then argues that the executing officers, upon learning of their mistake, unreasonably searched the barn anyway. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11, 12. Because we find fault with Jeffers\u2019s first premise, we cannot accept his conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u201cSearch warrants are not directed at persons; they authorize the search of \u2018[places]\u2019 and the seizure of things.\u201d <em>Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, </em>436 U.S. 547, 555, 98 S.Ct. 1970, 1976, 56 L.Ed.2d 525 (1978) (alteration in original). Indeed, \u201c[t]he critical element in a reasonable search is not that the <em>owner </em>of the property is suspected of crime but that there is reasonable cause to believe that the specific <em>things </em>to be searched for and seized are located on the property to which entry is sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 556, 98 S.Ct. at 1976-77 (emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord Mays v. City of Dayton, </em>134 F.3d 809, 814 (6th Cir.1998) (\u201cThe specificity required by the Fourth Amendment is <em>not </em>as to the person against whom the evidence is to be used but rather as to the place to be searched and the thing to be seized.\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Here, the search warrant identified various items \u201ctending to ... give evidence ... of child pornography,\u201d App. at 83, as the \u201cspecific things to be searched for and seized,\u201d <em>Zurcher, </em>436 U.S. at 556 n. 11, 98 S.Ct. at 1977 n. 11, and named \u201c106 Barricks Mill Rd.,\u201d App. at 83, as the \u201cproperty to which entry is sought,\u201d <em>Zurcher, </em>436 U.S. at 556, 98 S.Ct. at 1977. Thus, the scope of the search was \u201cdefined by the object of the search and the places in which there is probable cause to believe that it may be found.\u201d <em>Garrison, </em>480 U.S. at 84, 107 S.Ct. at 1016 (quoting <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 824, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 2172, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982)). Police had traced child pornography to this address, but did \u201cnot know in which of the [buddings] the illegal transactions [were] taking place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88 n. 13, 107 S.Ct. at 1019 n. 13 (noting this situation presents \u201cquite different issues\u201d from the case where it becomes evident \u201cthat a valid warrant describes too broadly the premises to be searched\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The search warrant did not state that the barn could be searched <em>only </em>if no one resided in it. The warrant identified the trailer as Loxley\u2019s residence, and then specifically identified the barn without mentioning whether anyone lived in it. The officers were not required to assume that the magistrate assumed the barn was unoccupied. Such a piling of one assumption upon another can hardly be squared with the straightforward reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Nichols, </em>344 F.3d 793, 798 (8th Cir.2003) (approving search of \u201crear garage\u201d identified in warrant even though officers discovered it was being rented out by the home owner as a \u201cseparate apartment\u201d). In short, the officers properly searched the barn because the warrant directed them to search the barn.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Finally, we acknowledge\u2014but find unpersuasive\u2014 Jeffers\u2019s assertion that the warrant\u2019s phrase \u201cwithin the curtilage\u201d excluded by definition any structure on the property that was not used exclusively by Loxley. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 16, 17. It may well be, at least in principle, that the term \u201ccurtilage\u201d would not implicitly expand the scope of a warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>to an <em>unspecified </em>outbuilding occupied by persons other than those living in the principal residence. <em>See, e.g., Merrick v. State, </em>338 So.2d 77, 78 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1976) (holding the phrase \u201chouse ... and the curtilage thereof\u2019 did not include a separate cottage not mentioned in the warrant). But neither precedent nor common sense requires police officers to refuse to execute a facially valid warrant\u2014expressly directing them to search a <em>specific </em>outbuilding\u2014simply because they discover that someone may be living in it. The implied limitations of the curtilage concept, whatever they may be, cannot rewrite a warrant that specifically identifies an outbuilding and commands that it be searched. There is, after all, \u201cno inherent reason why a single warrant cannot be based upon information showing probable cause as to buildings with different occupants.\u201d 2 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 4.5(c), at 747 (5th ed.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">These principles hold true in this case. The magistrate issued a warrant based upon a highly detailed affidavit linking child pornography to a unique IP address. The IP address led to a specific property located at 106 Barricks Mill Road, Topping, Virginia. It was entirely reasonable for the magistrate to order a search of all physical structures and \u201call persons\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at that address. App. at 83. For purposes of the search, it mattered not who posted the child pornography onto the Internet\u2014only that someone did. Neither the text of the warrant nor the context of the underlying investigation limited the search to <em>unoccupied </em>outbuildings. It would not have mattered at all, therefore, if the magistrate had known the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>barn was occupied by Jeffers. To be sure, had the magistrate known Jeffers lived in the barn, there can be no doubt he still would have included the barn in the warrant, given that Jeffers had been previously convicted of possessing child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The trial court did not err in refusing to suppress the evidence obtained by the officers pursuant to the search warrant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We thus affirm Jeffers\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-6\">. To the extent the warrant authorized searching persons, it did not limit its scope to Loxley, the resident of the trailer. The warrant authorized the search of \"all persons\u201d on the searchable property. App. at 83. Jeffers does not contest this aspect of the warrant's scope. And for good reason: \"So long as there is good reason to suspect or believe that anyone present at the anticipated scene will probably be a participant, presence becomes the descriptive fact satisfying the aim of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Felton v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 43, 48 n. 7, 690 S.E.2d 318, 321 n. 7 (2010) (citation omitted), <em>aff'd by unpublished order, </em>No. 100756 (Va. Apr. 21, 2011); <em>see also Morton v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 946, 948, 951, 434 S.E.2d 890, 892, 893 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-17\">.
