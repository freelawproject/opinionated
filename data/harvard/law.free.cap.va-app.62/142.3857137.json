At trial, Ferrell sought to admit into evidence an acquittal order from a separate case against the alleged principal in the first degree. The trial court held the order inadmissible as a matter of law. We agree and affirm Ferrell\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">In May 2010, Ferrell attended a party on the shores of Lake Anna. While there, Ferrell argued with William Luck, one of the hosts of the party. Ferrell was asked twice to leave the party, but he refused to go. Ferrell then announced he was going to call his brother and was overheard to repeatedly say, \u201cclick, click, boom.\u201d App. at 137. After the phone call, Ferrell left the party and met up with his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">Approximately 30 to 45 minutes after Ferrell left, he and his brother returned to the party in a dark blue sedan. Luck approached the vehicle to see who was inside. Multiple gunshots came from the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle, striking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Luck two times. Luck heard someone yell out of the car window, \u201cWho\u2019s the bitch now?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175. One of the witnesses saw Ferrell in the vehicle before it drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Later, police investigators collected six .40 caliber shell casings at the scene of the shooting. The investigators also found the dark blue sedan at Ferrell\u2019s family home and discovered a similar .40 caliber shell casing in the back seat of the vehicle. Forensic analysis showed that all seven shell casings were \u201cfired in the same firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">A grand jury indicted Ferrell and his brother for malicious wounding of Luck and for use of a firearm during a felony. At the brothers\u2019 request, the trial court ordered separate trials. The trial of Ferrell\u2019s brother occurred first and resulted in a jury verdict of not guilty. Ferrell\u2019s trial came six months later and resulted in a jury verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">At Ferrell\u2019s trial, the Commonwealth accused him of being a principal in the second degree. Ferrell argued he could not be found guilty as a principal in the second degree because his brother, the alleged principal in the first degree, had been acquitted by a different jury. Ferrell sought to admit into evidence his brother\u2019s acquittal order to prove this point. The trial court held an acquittal order was no more admissible than a conviction order. Ferrell\u2019s guilt or innocence, the court reasoned, had to be determined by the evidence at Ferrell\u2019s trial and decided by Ferrell\u2019s jury, not determined by the evidence at his brother\u2019s trial and decided by his brother\u2019s jury. The trial court, therefore, refused to admit the acquittal order into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">We begin by noting what we are not called upon to decide. Ferrell does not contend the evidence (with or without his brother\u2019s acquittal order) was factually insufficient to prove he acted as a principal in the second degree. Instead, Ferrell argues only that the trial court erred by refusing to admit into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>evidence his brother\u2019s acquittal order. For several reasons, we find this argument unpersuasive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">As early as 1776, \u201cthe common law of England\u201d was \u201cconsidered as in full force\u201d in Virginia, \u201cuntil the same shall be altered by the legislative power of this colony.\u201d 9 <em>Statutes at Large of Virginia </em>127 (W. Hening ed.1821) (republishing the Ordinances of Convention, May 1776). Virginia still recognizes by statute that the \u201ccommon law of England, insofar as it is not repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall continue in full force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except as altered by the General Assembly.\u201d Code \u00a7 1-200; <em>see Satterwhite v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 557, 560, 695 S.E.2d 555, 556-57 (2010). To be sure, \u201c[t]his principle is older than the Commonwealth itself.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 435, 443-44, 710 S.E.2d 518, 522 (2011) (citing W. Hamilton Bryson, <em>Virginia Civil Procedure </em>47 (3d ed.1997) (tracing Virginia\u2019s adoption of the common law to the royal instructions to the Virginia Company, which planted the colony at Jamestown)).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In felony cases, English common law historically segregated parties to felonies into one of four distinct categories:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">\u2022 principals in the first degree who actually perpetrated the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">\u2022 principals in the second degree, present at the scene of the crime, who aided or abetted its commission;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">\u2022 accessories before the fact, not present at the scene of the crime, who aided or abetted its commission; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">\u2022 accessories after the fact who rendered assistance after the crime was complete.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>4 William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England </em>*34-35 (1753).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Virginia courts have recognized these distinctions, for various purposes, since our earliest days. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Posey, </em>8 Va. (4 Call.) 109, 116-17 (1787) (distinguishing between \u201cthe accessory\u201d and \u201cthe principal\u201d regarding the benefit of clergy); <em>see also Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 131, 156-58, 688 S.E.2d 220, 234-35 (2010) (explaining the relationship between first-degree and second-degree principals); <em>Rasnick v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 356, 358-59 (1823) (analyzing the difference between principals, accessories, and \u201cprincipals in the second degree\u201d); <em>Wade v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 689, 693-95, 696 S.E.2d 258, 259-61 (2010) (discussing the distinction between principals and accessories at common law in the context of misdemeanors).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">These distinctions were relevant to determine interlocking criminal liability. Under English common law, \u201can accessory could not be convicted without the prior conviction of the principal offender.\u201d <em>Standefer v. United States, </em>447 U.S. 10, 15, 100 S.Ct. 1999, 2003, 64 L.Ed.2d 689 (1980) (citing 1 Sir Matthew Hale, <em>Pleas of the Crown </em>623-24 (1800)). But this \u201cprocedural bar applied only to the prosecution of <em>accessories </em>in felony cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15-16, 100 S.Ct. at 2004 (emphasis added). It did not apply to accused felons prosecuted as principals in the second degree. Under common law, \u201ca principal in the second degree could be convicted notwithstanding the prior acquittal of the first-degree principal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, 100 S.Ct. at 2004 (citing <em>King v. Taylor &amp; Shaw, </em>1 Leach. 360, 168 Eng. Rep. 283 (1785); <em>Queen v. Wallis, </em>1 Salk. 334, 91 Eng. Rep. 294 (K.B. 1703)); <em>see also </em>Hale, <em>supra, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>437 (explaining that principals in the second degree may be \u201carraigned, and receive their judgment\u201d even if the first-degree principal \u201cneither appears, nor be outlawed\u201d); Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 13.1(d)(3), at 333 (2d ed.2003) (noting that, at common law, \u201cthe principal in the second degree could be convicted notwithstanding the prior acquittal of the principal in the first degree\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Courts applying these common law principles have held the \u201cacquittal inures solely\u201d to the benefit of the accused principal in the first degree and does \u201cnot affect the question of the guilt or innocence\u201d of principals in the second degree. <em>State v. Phillips, </em>24 Mo. 475, 482 (1857). The guilt of a principal in the second degree should \u201cbe determined uninfluenced by the verdict rendered for or against any other party to the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, when \u201ca principal in the first degree and a principal in the second degree in the same offense have separate trials, the judgment against one, whether of conviction or of acquittal, has no bearing upon a judgment against the other.\u201d <em>State v. Peel, </em>111 So.2d 728, 735 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1959); <em>see also People v. Kief, </em>126 N.Y. 661, 27 N.E. 556, 557-58 (1891) (holding it \u201cquite immaterial\u201d whether another principal had \u201cbeen acquitted or not\u201d because \u201cat most it would only prove that being tried first, for some reason, [the first-degree principal] escaped conviction at the jury\u2019s hands\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Like many other states, Virginia has followed these common-law principles except where they have been superseded by statute. For example, in <em>Mitchell v. Commonwealth, </em>74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 845 (1880), a defendant was found guilty of murder as \u201ca principal in the second degree,\u201d even though it was conceded that those alleged to be principals in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>degree had earlier been acquitted. <em>Id. </em>at 870. <em>Mitchell </em>held that the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence \u201ccannot be affected by the result which has taken place\u201d in the other defendants\u2019 cases. <em>Id. </em>Although there may have been \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d in the <em>other </em>trials, <em>Mitchell </em>explained, \u201cthere was sufficient\u201d evidence in <em>that </em>trial to prove the defendant\u2019s culpability as a principal in the second degree. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Ferrell contends an earlier case, <em>Maybush v. Commonwealth, </em>70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 857 (1878), casts doubt on Virginia\u2019s commitment to these common law principles. We think just the opposite. <em>Maybush </em>held that a defendant\u2019s prior conviction for suborning perjury could not stand if the perjurer himself was later acquitted. <em>Maybush, </em>however, treated suborning perjury as \u201caccessorial in its nature,\u201d even though it was arguably \u201can offense separate and distinct\u201d from perjury. <em>Mundy v. Commonwealth, </em>161 Va. 1049, 1061, 171 S.E. 691, 695 (1933) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When the General Assembly later codified suborning perjury as a freestanding crime, the \u201cformer rule requiring prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>conviction of a principal before an accessory ha[d] no application.\u201d <em>Mundy, </em>161 Va. at 1061-62, 171 S.E. at 695 (citing former Code \u00a7 4494 (1930), now codified as Code \u00a7 18.2-136).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Years later, the General Assembly expressly superseded the English common law rule governing accessories by providing that an \u201caccessory, either before or after the fact, may, whether the principal felon be convicted or not, or be amenable to justice or not, be indicted, tried, convicted and punished .... \u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-21. The treatment of accessories, for preclusion purposes, now parallels the common law rule traditionally applicable only to principals in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The historic common law rule governing principals in the second degree stands on the same footing as the modern doctrine of collateral estoppel. The United States Supreme Court faced just this situation in <em>Standefer. </em>There, like here, a jury found a defendant guilty of being a principal in the second degree after a different jury had acquitted the alleged principal in the first degree. <em>Standefer </em>held that collateral estoppel did not apply in this context for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">To begin with, the state cannot appeal an acquittal\u2014thus permitting juries \u201cto acquit out of compassion or compromise or because of \u2018their assumption of a power which they had no right to exercise, but to which they were disposed through lenity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Standefer, </em>447 U.S. at 22, 100 S.Ct. at 2007 (citation omitted). \u201cCentral to this holding was a recognition that juries may return inconsistent verdicts based on compassion or the exercise of lenity.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>701 F.2d 1095, 1104 (4th Cir.1983). This reality undermines the equitable basis of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">In addition, the \u201capplication of nonmutual estoppel in criminal cases is also complicated by the existence of rules of evidence and exclusion unique to our criminal law.\u201d <em>Standefer, </em>447 U.S. at 23, 100 S.Ct. at 2008. It is, after all,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABt\">frequently true in criminal cases that evidence inadmissible against one defendant is admissible against another. The exclusionary rule, for example, may bar the Government from introducing evidence against one defendant because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>that evidence was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights. And the suppression of that evidence may result in an acquittal. The same evidence, however, may be admissible against other parties to the crime \u201cwhose rights were [not] violated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 23-24, 100 S.Ct. at 2008 (citation omitted); <em>see also Waters v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 636, 643, 600 S.E.2d 918, 921 (2004) (\u201cIt is well settled that a judgment of acquittal or conviction does not operate as <em>res judicata </em>in the prosecution of another defendant, even though the same transaction is involved.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Kief, </em>27 N.E. at 557-58 (holding that evidence of an \u201cacquittal would not prove this defendant\u2019s innocence of the charge in the indictment\u201d because \u201c[a]t most it would only prove that being tried first, for some reason, she escaped conviction at the jury\u2019s hands\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In short, under established common law principles, the order acquitting Ferrell\u2019s brother had no legal relevance to Ferrell\u2019s guilt or innocence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The differing results in the separate trials could have been the result of lenity by the jury toward the brother, a different retelling of facts by key witnesses,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> dissimilar strategic decisions of counsel, disparate evidentiary rulings, divergent arguments of counsel, or, for that matter, an honest disagreement between the two juries about the persuasive force of the totality of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>There being no estoppel bar to the juries reaching different conclusions (so long as the guilty verdict rests on sufficient evidence), it would be wholly inappropriate for one jury to receive the advisory opinion of the other on the ultimate issue in the case. As the trial court succinctly put it, the evidence of an acquittal of the principal in the first degree is no more relevant than the evidence of a conviction. The guilt or innocence of the principal in the second degree must rise or fall entirely on the evidence presented at his own trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Finding no error in the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude from evidence the acquittal order entered in the trial of Ferrell\u2019s brother, we affirm Ferrell\u2019s convictions for malicious wounding and use of a firearm during the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-11\">. Ferrell's petition for appeal initially raised a sufficiency challenge, but he did not include it as an assignment of error in his opening brief on appeal. We thus assume he \u201cmade an affirmative, strategic decision to abandon those issues\u201d and hold he thereby \u201cwaived\u201d this challenge \"as a basis for reversing his convictions.\u201d <em>Andrews v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 231, 253, 699 S.E.2d 237, 249 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\">. In contrast, \"all parties to a misdemeanor, whatever their roles, were principals\u201d under the common law. <em>Standefer v. United States, </em>447 U.S. 10, 15, 100 S.Ct. 1999, 2003, 64 L.Ed.2d 689 (1980); <em>see also Wade v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 689, 693, 696 S.E.2d 258, 260 (2010) (\"[A]t common law, in misdemeanors, there are no accessories, all concerned being principals.\u201d (citation omitted)); Blackstone, <em>supra, </em>at *36 (\"[T]he law ... does not descend to distinguish the different shades of guilt in petty misdemeanors.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\">. The only arguable exception to this principle appears to be limited to a charge of treason as a principal in the second degree. <em>See </em>Hale, <em>supra, </em>at 612-13 (\u201c[T|hose who did actually commit the very fact of treason, should be first-tried before those that are principals in the second degree, because otherwise ... the principals in the second degree might be convicted, and yet the principals in the first degree may be acquitted, which would be absurd.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\">. At trial, Ferrell\u2019s counsel understood <em>Maybush </em>this way, but apparently either thought Ferrell was prosecuted as a mere \"accessory\u201d instead of a principal in the second degree or mistakenly believed an accessory under common law was no different from a principal in the second degree. App. at 201-03, 214. It was an understandable mistake, however, given that principals in the second degree were \"formerly called accessories at the fact\u201d by some jurists. <em>Mundy, </em>161 Va. at 1061, 171 S.E. at 695 (citation omitted); <em>see also Rasnick, </em>4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) at 358-59 (explaining that \"persons present aiding and abetting\u201d were previously \"considered only as an accessory to the fact,\u201d but \"are now taken as principals\u201d); <em>Matters of the Crown Happening at Salop, </em>1 Plowden 97, 99-100, 75 Eng. Rep. 152, 157-58 (1761) (\u201d[T]he Law anciently was, that those who were present and abetting were not Principals, but Accessaries [sic]....

Boyce, <em>Criminal Law </em>722 (3d ed.1982) (\"At a relatively early time the party who was originally considered an accessory at the fact, ceased to be classed in the accessorial group and was labeled a principal. To distinguish him from the actual perpetrator of the crime he was called a principal in the second degree.\u201d (footnote omitted)). In any event, the trial court correctly framed the issue as whether the acquittal of the \"principal in the first degree essentially bars conviction of the principal in the second degree[.]\u201d App. at 213.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\">. <em>See, e.g., State v.

The Commonwealth points out that the record in Ferrell\u2019s case does not include a complete transcript of one of the key witnesses, and thus, we cannot be sure she testified at Ferrell\u2019s trial exactly as she did in his brother\u2019s trial. We appreciate the point but need not address it in any detail. Even if her testimony were exactly the same in both trials, the acquittal order in the trial of Ferrell\u2019s brother would still be legally irrelevant in Ferrell's trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
