BEALES, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b764-16\">Bruce M. Mayer (father) appeals the trial court\u2019s order directing him to pay continuing child support to Linda CorsoMayer (mother) under Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C). Father argues that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to award continuing child support to mother, that mother lacked standing to petition for continuing child support, and that the evidence did not support a finding that continuing child sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>port was warranted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Father also challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to order father to pay 75% of mother\u2019s fees and costs (including her attorneys\u2019 fees, deposition costs, and filing fees) that arose from continuing child support litigation. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order directing the payment of continuing child support to mother. However, we reverse and vacate the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">\u201cOn appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to [mother], the party prevailing below,\u201d <em>Chretien v. Chretien, </em>53 Va.App. 200, 202, 670 S.E.2d 45, 46 (2008), and we grant to mother \u201call reasonable inferences fairly deducible\u201d from the evidence, <em>Anderson v. Anderson, </em>29 Va.App. 673, 678, 514 S.E.2d 369, 372 (1999). The parties married in 1981 and were divorced by a final decree that the trial court entered on September 24, 2010. The parties\u2019 youngest child (daughter) was born on January 8,1994 and, therefore, daughter was still a minor child when the parties divorced. Mother was granted sole custody of daughter. It is undisputed that daughter has been diagnosed with several conditions and disorders. Dr. Elena Flagg, an expert in rheumatology, diagnosed daughter with fibromyalgia, which Dr. Flagg testified is a chronic syndrome that is \u201ccharacterized by widespread pain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>along the muscles.\u201d Dr. Alfonso Lopez-Condona, an expert in childhood psychiatry, testified that he diagnosed daughter with \u201cTourette\u2019s disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, mood disorder NOS [not otherwise specified], and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Pursuant to the final divorce decree, which incorporated the parties\u2019 property settlement agreement, father was ordered to pay $900 in monthly child support for daughter until daughter \u201creaches the age of 18 years unless she is (i) a full-time high school student, (ii) not self-supporting, and (iii) living in the home of the party seeking or receiving child support until the child reaches the age of 19 or graduates from high school, whichever first occurs.\u201d This provision of the final decree simply recites a portion of Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C). Language reflecting a different portion of Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C) that is pertinent to this appeal also appears in the parties\u2019 final divorce decree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">On May 10, 2012, mother filed a petition in the trial court seeking the payment of continuing child support by father.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Father moved to dismiss mother\u2019s petition, contending that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider mother\u2019s petition and that mother lacked standing to petition for continuing child support. Essentially, father asserted that mother\u2019s May 10, 2012 petition for continuing child support was untimely filed. Father alleged that daughter had already turned the age of 18 on January 8, 2012 and had also earned her general equivalency degree (GED) on April 19, 2012 before mother filed her petition. Thus, father contended that his responsibility to pay child support under the final divorce decree had already ended when mother filed the May 10, 2012 petition for continuing child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In support of father\u2019s motion to dismiss, father\u2019s counsel asserted at the January 25, 2013 evidentiary hearing in the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">So I would propose to you that no further obligation was in effect starting the 1st of May of 2012. However, [mother] didn\u2019t advise the father that [daughter] had completed high school at that point in time so he kept on making payments. The mother, however, would have had to petition the Court for a continuation of child support before [daughter] turned 18 if she had wanted to have a continuation of child support. That is when the Court had statutory authority to order a continuation of child support, during the minority of the child. And so our position is that even if you use the April 2012 GED date, the mother was too late when she filed her petition in May of 2012.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">However, the trial court denied father\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition\u2014finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C) \u201cas set forth by the General Assembly intended for cases like this where ... the Court can revisit [child support] and make an award accordingly if it finds that those necessitous circumstances exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>At the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Flagg (who was received as <em>mother\u2019s </em>expert in rheumatology) testified that daughter\u2019s fibromyalgia causes her great pain, especially when it \u201cflares up\u201d due to stress, infection, physical activity, and prolonged periods of sitting or standing. Dr. Flagg added that the combination of the many medications that daughter has been prescribed can cause fatigue, dizziness, and disorientation. Dr. Flagg opined that, considering the symptoms of daughter\u2019s fibromyalgia and how they interact with daughter\u2019s psychiatric disorders, it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d for daughter to hold a full-time or even part-time job and to live independently. In Dr. Flagg\u2019s opinion, daughter currently could not be expected to \u201cmaintain an apartment,\u201d \u201cmaintain bills,\u201d \u201ccook for herself,\u201d or supply some essentials of her own \u201cself care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Dr. Lopez (who was received as <em>father\u2019s </em>expert in childhood psychiatry) testified that he has prescribed medications for most of daughter\u2019s psychiatric disorders. According to Dr. Lopez, daughter\u2019s Tourette\u2019s disorder in particular causes daughter \u201cto have these vocal tics\u201d that tend to increase in magnitude when she is under stress. Dr. Lopez testified that he had observed a recent \u201cexacerbation of the tics\u201d from daughter. Dr. Lopez further testified that daughter was jumping up and down, moving her hands erratically, and screaming during an appointment about two weeks before the evidentiary hearing. In Dr. Lopez\u2019s opinion, daughter could perform standard activities of daily living (such as taking a shower, brushing her hair, and dressing herself) and also could hold a job\u2014\u201cwith help and support.\u201d However, Dr. Lopez acknowledged that living on her own and obtaining full-time employment would be stressors for daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Other than babysitting five hours per week, daughter\u2019s testimony revealed almost no employment history.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>fled that she worked for three days as a ride operator at Busch Gardens\u2014but had to quit that job because she could not stand for an eight-hour shift due to her fibromyalgia and her employer would not permit her to sit on a stool. According to daughter\u2019s testimony, the pain caused by her fibromyalgia limits her ability to perform many activities, which is further limited by her other disorders. Daughter testified that she has difficulty cleaning the house and also has difficulty unloading the dishwasher because the tics caused by her Tourette\u2019s disorder cause her to drop dishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Daughter acknowledged that she had earned her GED, obtained a driver\u2019s license, and enrolled at a local community college. In her first semester at the community college, she dropped out of one class, failed another, and passed the remaining class (testifying that she received an \u201cA\u201d in that class because the instructor permitted her to do extra credit work). Due to her disorders, daughter testified that she had great difficulty sitting through class sessions and that she was not even able to record lectures because her obsessive compulsive disorder caused her to move the recording device constantly. Daughter testified that she often drove herself to class during her first semester at the community college, but that she needed mother to drive her home on at least three occasions due to anxiety or a flare-up of her Tourette\u2019s disorder. Daughter\u2019s second semester began three weeks before the evidentiary hearing in the trial court, and daughter testified that she no longer drove herself to class (but was instead driven there by her boyfriend) because of worsened pain attributable to fibromyalgia and a worsening of her tics caused by stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Mother testified that she is daughter\u2019s sole caretaker and that father does not provide any in-person support for the care of daughter. Daughter and mother both referenced an episode that occurred about a year or two before the evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>hearing, when daughter suffered severe tics while with father at a movie theater. On direct examination, mother testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqm\">It was more than a tic. It almost looked like a grand mal seizure. I mean, her tics were out of control. They had to let everybody out of the theater. They had to have management come in. And Bruce said, \u201cYou need to come in here and help me. I can\u2019t do this on my own.\u201d And he and I physically carried her out and put her in the car. He didn\u2019t say a word to me and just left the scene.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">When asked on cross-examination whether she had observed other tics of a similar level of severity from daughter at other times, mother testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">Yes. Last summer in the backyard she was throwing furniture, patio furniture around. And she was ... throwing things in my room and rolling around the floor, and rolled off the bed as a matter of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Furthermore, both daughter and mother testified that daughter\u2019s psychiatric conditions have caused her to harm herself. Daughter testified, \u201cAbout two years ago I actually had to be put in the hospital because I was punching myself in the head.\u201d Daughter also testified that she had previously \u201ccut myself,\u201d adding, \u201cI still have the scars on my arms.\u201d Mother testified that daughter \u201cwas put in the hospital two years ago for cutting, banging her head against concrete walls.\u201d Mother also testified that daughter still causes \u201cself injury\u201d by \u201cgrab[bing] her arm like in a real tight position and pinch[ing] it\u201d and apparently hitting her head with her hand in a manner that mother demonstrated to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Without objection by father\u2019s counsel, mother opined that daughter cannot live by herself and is unable to care for herself. Mother testified that daughter cannot be relied on to clean herself, to cook, to shop for provisions adequately, to take herself to her doctor\u2019s appointments, to handle her finances and manage money, and to have adequate \u201cschooling [and] organizational skills.\u201d Although mother acknowledged on cross-examination that daughter can do some of these things at times, mother also testified that \u201ceverything waxes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>and wanes.\u201d Mother explained that daughter\u2019s conditions lead to much unpredictability of how well daughter can care for herself from one month to the next.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, the trial court found that an order of continuing child support was appropriate because the required elements of Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C) had been satisfied. The trial court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">[S]he wants to be independent, but the Court finds that she\u2019s not able to support herself independently based upon the overall testimony. She wants to do things, but she has issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The trial court emphasized that it based its finding on \u201cthe totality of the conditions that [daughter] has,\u201d also noting that \u201cany one of these standing alone would not in and of itself\u2019 constitute a severe and permanent disability for purposes of Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C). Furthermore, in addition to ordering continuing child support, the trial court also directed father to pay 75% of mother\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and related costs\u2014adopting the closing argument of mother\u2019s counsel on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">A. Order of Continuing Child Support</p>\n<p id=\"AFo\">Father appeals the trial court\u2019s finding that continuing child support for daughter was authorized by Code \u00a7 20-124.2(0. That statute states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-10\">The court may order that support be paid for any child of the parties. The court shall also order that support will continue to be paid for any child over the age of 18 who is (i) a full-time high school student, (ii) not self-supporting, and (iii) living in the home of the party seeking or receiving child support until such child reaches the age of 19 or graduates from high school, whichever first occurs. <em>The court may also order the continuation of support for any child over the age of 18 who is (i) severely and permanently mentally or physically disabled, (ii) unable to live independently and support himself, and (iii) resides in the home of the parent seeking or receiving child support.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C) (emphasis added); <em>see Crabtree v.

Trial Court\u2019s Subject Matter Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"A6O\">\u201cThe term jurisdiction is \u2018a word of many, too many, meanings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v.

The term jurisdiction embraces several concepts including <em>subject matter jurisdiction, which is the authority granted through constitution or statute to adjudicate a class of cases or controversies; </em>territorial jurisdiction, that is, authority over persons, things, or occurrences located in a defined geographic area; notice jurisdiction, or effective notice to a party or if the proceeding is <em>in rem </em>seizure of a res; and \u2018the other conditions of fact must exist which are demanded by the unwritten or statute law as the prerequisites of the authority of the court to proceed to judgment or decree.\u2019 <em>Farant Inv.

Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 203, 228, 661 S.E.2d 415, 426 (2008)). A challenge to a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>question of law that is reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>Glasser &amp; Glasser, PLC v.

Whether mother actually satisfied the evidentiary elements of Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C) with respect to daughter is a different question entirely\u2014one that simply does not implicate the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate <em>the class of case </em>at issue here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Porter, </em>276 Va. at 228, 661 S.E.2d at 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">2.

Thus, father contends that his responsibility to pay child support for daughter had ceased by the time mother filed her petition for continuing child support in the trial court because daughter was no longer a minor child but instead was an \u201cemancipated adult.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">We must first consider, of course, the plain language of Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C) because \u201cwe are bound by the plain meaning\u201d of that statute and must \u201capply the statute as written.\u201d <em>1924 Leonard Rd., L.L.C. v.

Code \u00a7 20-124.2(0 expressly states that the trial court \u201cmay also order the continuation of support for <em>any child over the age of 18\u201d </em>provided that certain evidentiary elements are satisfied. (Emphasis added). Thus, a \u201cchild\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-124.2(0 may be \u201cover the age of 18\u201d years.

Forer, </em>265 Va. 483, 490, 578 S.E.2d 792, 796 (2003) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In this case, it is undisputed that mother was awarded sole custody of daughter in the final divorce decree and that daughter continued to reside with mother, who was responsible for daughter\u2019s care. Furthermore, as father\u2019s counsel indicated at the evidentiary hearing, mother was still receiving child support from father when mother filed her petition for continuing child support on May 10, 2012. Mother filed this petition in order to continue to exercise her \u201c \u2018right to act as a conduit for the payments of support to the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nkopchieu v.

Johnson, </em>7 Va.App. 614, 622, 376 S.E.2d 787, 791 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">If the mother of a child who <em>may </em>have a severe and permanent disability (that prevents the child from living independently and supporting herself) cannot seek continuing support on behalf of the child, then who <em>would </em>have standing to do so? To hold that the answer to this question is nobody (as father urges us to conclude, given his argument that daughter is an \u201cemancipated adult\u201d) would require this Court to contradict the plain language of Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C)\u2014which this Court cannot and should not do. Even though daughter had already turned the age of 18 (and had already received her GED) when mother filed the petition for continuing child support, the plain language of Code \u00a7 20~124.2(C) permitted daughter still to be recognized as a \u201cchild over the age of 18\u201d as long as the evidentiary elements of the statute were satisfied. Certainly, mother had a \u201csufficient interest in the subject matter of the case\u201d to confer upon her standing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>raise the petition for continuing child support. <em>Cupp v.

Furthermore, given that we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to mother (as the party prevailing below), we also must \u201cdiscard the evidence of [father] which conflicts, either directly or inferentially, with the evidence presented by [mother] at trial.\u201d <em>Petry v. Petry, 41 </em>Va.App. 782, 785-86, 589 S.E.2d 458, 460 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">In the trial court, mother assumed the burden as the moving party of satisfying the elements for an order of continuing child support under Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C). <em>Germek v. Germek, </em>34 Va.App. 1, 8, 537 S.E.2d 596, 600 (2000). On appeal, father concedes that daughter resides with mother. Father also does not dispute that daughter has permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>physical and mental disabilities\u2014given the testimony of both Dr. Flagg and Dr. Lopez that the conditions they have diagnosed for daughter are chronic and recurring. Thus, our review is limited to the remaining elements set forth in Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C)\u2014i.e., whether daughter is \u201cseverely\u201d mentally or physically disabled, and is \u201cunable to live independently and support\u201d herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">When applying the elements of Code \u00a7 20-124.2(0, courts must give the words of this statute their common, ordinary, and accepted meaning. <em>Germek, </em>34 Va.App. at 8, 537 S.E.2d at 600. The word \u201csevere\u201d is commonly defined, in pertinent part, as \u201cinflicting physical discomfort or hardship,\u201d \u201cinflicting pain or distress,\u201d and \u201cof a great degree or an undesirable or harmful extent.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2081 (1981). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to mother, as we must since she was the prevailing party below, the trial court\u2019s finding that daughter is severely mentally or physically disabled was not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680. As the trial court found, daughter has been diagnosed with both a painful physical condition and several psychological conditions that cause very erratic and sometimes self-destructive behavior. Weighing the evidence, the trial court noted reasonably that any one of daughter\u2019s many conditions, <em>standing alone, </em>might not cause a severe and permanent disability\u2014but found that <em>the totality </em>of these conditions caused a severe disability. This finding was supported by credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Clearly, Dr. Flagg described daughter\u2019s fibromyalgia as very painful and a condition that limits what she can do, and this expert testimony was corroborated by daughter\u2019s own account of her difficulties doing basic activities such as lifting her arms or standing for periods of time. The trial court found that daughter\u2019s fibromyalgia must also be viewed in conjunction with the many psychological disorders that Dr. Lopez described\u2014which, <em>inter alia, </em>can cause very noticeable and disruptive tics, significant anxiety, lapses in concentration, and self-destructive behavior. The trial court, acting as fact-finder, was entitled to give significant weight to mother\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>testimony that daughter\u2019s tics can be so severe that mother once observed what looked to her like a grand mal seizure. Thus, sufficient evidence in the record, viewed in its totality, supports the trial court\u2019s finding that- daughter is severely mentally or physically disabled for purposes of Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">In <em>Germek, </em>34 Va.App. at 8, 537 S.E.2d at 600, this Court held that \u201can award of continuing support under [Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C) ] requires a finding that the statutory elements are causally linked, i.e., that the child\u2019s severe and permanent disability renders her unable to live independently and support herself.\u201d The trial court here made a finding of the necessary causal connection during its thorough bench ruling, and this finding was supported by evidence in the record on appeal. Specifically, the trial court credited and gave significant weight to Dr. Flagg\u2019s testimony that it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d for daughter to hold a job and live independently\u2014 finding based on this testimony that daughter clearly \u201ccan\u2019t hold a regular job\u201d and \u201c[a]s a matter of fact she can\u2019t even hold a partial job.\u201d The testimony of daughter\u2019s own mother and sole caretaker also supports the trial court\u2019s finding on this point. Mother testified, without objection, that daughter simply could not live alone and could not keep a job at the time of the evidentiary hearing due to daughter\u2019s many conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Father argues that the trial court should have accepted the testimony of Dr. Lopez\u2014father\u2019s own expert witness\u2014that daughter could hold a full-time job provided she received \u201chelp and support.\u201d However, to the extent that Dr. Lopez\u2019s opinion conflicted with Dr. Flagg\u2019s opinion, the trial court was entitled to accept Dr. Flagg\u2019s testimony and accord Dr. Lopez\u2019s testimony less weight. On appeal, this Court does not assess the credibility of the witnesses or reweigh the evidence. <em>See Street v. Street, </em>25 Va.App. 380, 387, 488 S.E.2d 665, 668 (1997) (en banc). Furthermore, we disagree with father\u2019s reliance on our decision in <em>Germek </em>and his view that daughter\u2019s enrollment at a local community college contradicts the testimony that she cannot work. In <em>Germek, </em>the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>daughter <em>\u201cchose </em>to attend college full-time, and any inability to work more than seven hours per week arose from her decision to attend college <em>rather </em>than her physical disability.\u201d <em>Germek, </em>34 Va.App. at 12, 537 S.E.2d at 602 (emphasis added). The trial judge in <em>Germek </em>even found that the daughter was able to obtain gainful employment. <em>Id. </em>By contrast, the trial court here found that daughter enrolled at the community college because \u201cshe want[s] to achieve\u201d and also found that daughter \u201creally wants to get from under her mother if she could\u201d and she has an \u201cultimate purpose of trying to be self sufficient\u201d and \u201cbe independent\u201d\u2014but ultimately concluded that \u201cshe\u2019s not able to support herself independently based upon the overall testimony.\u201d Accordingly, <em>Germek </em>is readily distinguishable based on its very different facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">We also observe that, while the first prong of Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C) requires a permanent (and severe) disability, the plain language of the statute does <em>not </em>require a showing that the child over the age of 18 is <em>permanently </em>\u201cunable to live independently and support\u201d herself, the second prong of the statute. Thus, the trial court was only required under Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C) to assess the circumstances affecting the second prong of the statute as they existed at the time of the evidentiary hearing\u2014not prospectively. Based on the plain language of Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C), and in light of the deferential standard of review on appeal, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s decision to order continuing child support payments from father was plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">B. Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Finally, father argues that the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to mother was unreasonable and was not supported by the record. An award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs \u201cis a matter for the trial court\u2019s sound discretion after considering the circumstances and equities of the entire case.\u201d <em>Artis v. Artis, </em>4 Va.App. 132, 138, 354 S.E.2d 812, 815 (1987); <em>see Joynes v. Payne, </em>36 Va.App. 401, 429, 551 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>10, 24 (2001) (\u201cThe key to a proper award of counsel fees is reasonableness under all the circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">In this case, the trial court issued its bench ruling in which it found that payment of continuing child support was appropriate under Code \u00a7 20-124.2(0\u2014and then summarily directed father to pay 75% of the attorney\u2019s fees and related costs that mother incurred while pursuing her continuing child support claim. The trial court never identified any basis for the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to mother. It simply explained, \u201cThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be broken down.\u201d The trial court noted that it decided to \u201cadopt the arguments of [mother\u2019s counsel] in her closing argument to the Court as reasons for the Court\u2019s decision as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">We have carefully reviewed the transcript of the closing argument presented by mother\u2019s counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The thrust of the argument presented by mother\u2019s counsel was that father should have simply agreed to settle the matter instead of exercising his right to defend against mother\u2019s claim through the date of the evidentiary hearing. Assuming that mother would prevail on her claim for continued child support under Code \u00a7 20-124.2(0, mother\u2019s counsel asserted during closing argument that mother also should be compensated for the attorney\u2019s fees and related costs that mother incurred while pursuing her own claim. In short, mother\u2019s counsel advanced what amounted to a \u201closer pays\u201d rationale for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. <em>See Servicios Comerciales Andinos, S.A. v. GE Del Caribe, </em>145 F.3d 463, 481 n. 9 (1st Cir.1998) (\u201c[A] \u2018loser pays\u2019 rule could be conceived of as adding an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the recovery provided by the underlying cause of action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>However, Virginia law consistently adheres to the \u201cAmerican rule,\u201d which holds that, \u201cordinarily, attorneys\u2019 fees are not recoverable by a prevailing litigant in the absence of a specific contractual or statutory provision to the contrary.\u201d <em>Lannon v. Lee Conner Realty Corp., </em>238 Va. 590, 594, 385 S.E.2d 380, 383 (1989); <em>see also Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home v. W. Va. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Res., </em>532 U.S. 598, 602, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 1839, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001) (\u201cIn the United States, parties are ordinarily required to bear their own attorney\u2019s fees\u2014the prevailing party is not entitled to collect from the loser.\u201d); <em>Jeroski v. Fed. Mine Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>697 F.3d 651, 654 (7th Cir.2012) (explaining that the \u201cAmerican rule\u201d is \u201cdistinct from England\u2019s \u2018loser pays\u2019 rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">\u201cIn Virginia, Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79(b) and [former] 20-99(5)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provide the statutory basis for the broad discretionary authority circuit courts have to award attorney\u2019s fees and other costs as the equities of a divorce case and its ancillary proceedings may require.\u201d <em>Tyszcenko v. Donatelli, </em>53 Va.App. 209, 222, 670 S.E.2d 49, 56 (2008). \u201cThis discretionary authority also extends to related post-divorce proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Significantly, however, <em>\u201cthere is no prevailing-party entitlement </em>to fees under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79(b) and [former] 20-99(5).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223, 670 S.E.2d at 57 (emphasis added). \u201cInstead, the trial court, in the exercise of its discretion, may award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to \u2018either party as equity and justice may require.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting what is currently Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>\u00a7 20-99(6)). Therefore, after considering \u201cthe circumstances of the parties\u201d and \u201cthe equities of the entire case,\u201d a trial court may exercise its discretion and issue an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs that is reasonable \u201cunder all of the circumstances revealed by the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks, alterations, and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to mother, as we must since she was the prevailing party below, the record does not reflect that the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to mother was premised on any of the circumstances authorizing an award under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79(b) and 20-99(6) or the case law interpreting those statutes. Neither the trial court nor mother\u2019s counsel referenced any specific circumstances of the parties or equities of the entire case that justified an assessment of attorney\u2019s fees and costs against father. The record merely reflects (1) that mother brought a petition for continuing child support against father and (2) that father simply answered the petition and contested mother\u2019s claim in the trial court. Furthermore, there is no evidence that father\u2014in his defense against mother\u2019s claim\u2014 delayed the litigation or otherwise frustrated the course of the proceedings. <em>See, e.g., Northcutt v. Northcutt, </em>39 Va.App. 192, 200-01, 571 S.E.2d 912, 916 (2002) (affirming an award of attorney\u2019s fees where the trial judge found, \u201cI\u2019m fed up with this case and the delays that have been occasioned so unnecessarily, and some of the delays ... have created a decrease in [the] value of the property of the marriage. This has been horrible.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">According to the Supreme Court, one of the ways in which an abuse of discretion can occur arises \u201c \u2018when an irrelevant or improper factor is considered and given significant weight\u2019 \u201d by the trial court. <em>Lawlor v. Commonwealth, </em>285 Va. 187, 213, 738 S.E.2d 847, 861 (2013) (quoting <em>Landrum v. Chippenham &amp; Johnston-Willis Hosps., Inc., </em>282 Va. 346, 352, 717 S.E.2d 134, 137 (2011)). An abuse of discretion of this variety occurred here. The trial court\u2019s decision to assess attorney\u2019s fees and costs against father, based on the insufficient grounds argued by mother\u2019s counsel and adopted by the trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>amounted to the type of \u201closer pays\u201d rationale that has long been generally rejected in Virginia. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs must be reversed because it was not reasonable \u201cunder all of the circumstances revealed by the record.\u201d <em>McGinnis v. McGinnis, </em>1 Va.App. 272, 277, 388 S.E.2d 159, 162 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider mother\u2019s claim for continuing child support under Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C)\u2014which mother clearly had standing to raise. Furthermore, credible evidence in the record supports the trial court\u2019s order directing father to pay continuing child support to mother on daughter\u2019s behalf. However, there is not an adequate basis in the record for the trial court to assess attorney\u2019s fees and costs against father. Accordingly, while we affirm the trial court\u2019s continuing child support order, we reverse and vacate its decision to direct father to pay 75% of mother\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the circuit court arising from the continuing child support litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed and vacated in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b765-7\">. In addition, father argues that the trial judge should have recused himself because he previously \"presided over the contentious divorce of the parties\u201d and that the trial judge then \"was completely biased and unfair\u201d at the evidentiary hearing on mother\u2019s petition for continuing child support. However, Rule 5A:18 bars appellate consideration of these arguments because they were not preserved in the trial court. <em>See Ohree v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 299, 308, 494 S.E.2d 484, 488 (1998). Father never moved the trial judge to recuse himself from considering the continuing child support matter. Furthermore, father never objected on the basis of judicial bias at the evidentiary hearing on the continuing child support matter or in the written objections to the trial court\u2019s final order directing father to pay continuing child support for his daughter. Moreover, father \u201cdoes not argue that we should invoke the 'good cause\u2019 or 'ends of justice' exceptions to Rule 5A:18, and we decline to do so <em>sua sponte.\" Hampton Inn &amp; Selective Ins. Co. of America </em>v. <em>King, 58 </em>Va.App. 286, 301, 708 S.E.2d 450, 457 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\">. Specifically, the final decree includes language from Code \u00a7 20-124.2(C) stating that the trial court \u201cmay also order the continuation of support for any child over the age of 18 who is (i) severely and permanently mentally or physically disabled, (ii) unable to live independently and support himself, and (iii) resides in the home of the parent seeking or receiving child support.\u201d The trial court's authority to order child support under this statutory provision arose from the Code and was not dependent on the terms of the parties' property settlement agreement. Indeed, it is well established that \u201cthe parties may not, by agreement, prevent the court from exercising its power to change, modify, or enforce its decree concerning the custody and maintenance of minor children.\u201d <em>Shoup v.
