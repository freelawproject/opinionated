On appeal, Winslow argues for the first time that the trial court\u2019s acceptance of his guilty plea violated Rule 3A:8(c)(2)\u2019s requirement that the plea agreement \u201cbe reduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>to writing\u201d and signed by the parties. We affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Midway through his jury trial, Winslow asked the trial court for a brief recess for the purpose of negotiating a possible plea agreement. The court agreed to do so, and the parties reached an oral agreement calling for guilty pleas to both charges, accompanied by stipulated sentences. In open court, the parties recited into the record the specific terms and conditions of the agreement. The trial court conducted an extensive colloquy with Winslow to confirm that he understood the agreement and had entered into it freely, knowingly, and voluntarily. The court then accepted the plea agreement, entered final judgment, and imposed the agreed-upon sentences. A court reporter was present during the entire proceeding and transcribed verbatim the plea agreement of the parties and the colloquy with the trial court. At no point in the trial court proceedings did Winslow object to his convictions on the ground that the trial court accepted his plea agreement in violation of Rule 3A:8(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">On appeal, Winslow argues that his plea agreement violated Rule 3A:8(c)(2), which requires that plea agreements \u201cbe reduced to writing\u201d and signed by the parties. This violation, Winslow reasons, rendered his conviction order \u201cvoid <em>ab initio </em>\u201d\u2014thus relieving him of his obligation to raise the issue in the trial court. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 17. Even if the violation does not rise to that magnitude, Winslow contends that the ends-of-justice exception to Rule 5A:18 should permit him to make his objection to his plea agreement for the first time on appeal. We disagree with both assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">A. Void <em>Ab Initio </em>vs. Voidable</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">In this case, as in most, whether an alleged error by a trial court renders its order void <em>ab initio </em>or merely voidable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>turns on the distinction \u201cbetween a court lacking jurisdiction to act upon a matter and the court, while properly having jurisdiction, nonetheless erring in its judgment.\u201d <em>Kelley v. Stamos, </em>285 Va. 68, 75, 787 S.E.2d 218, 221-22 (2013).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An order void <em>ab initio </em>is \u201cwithout effect from the moment it came into existence,\u201d <em>id., </em>and can be attacked \u201cby all persons, anywhere, at any time, or in any manner,\u201d <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 690, 704, 667 S.E.2d 787, 794 (2008) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting <em>Singh v. Mooney, </em>261 Va. 48, 51-52, 541 S.E.2d 549, 551 (2001)). Deeming an order void <em>ab initio </em>effectively sidelines procedural default principles, including Rule 5A:18\u2019s requirement that arguments on appeal seeking to overturn a trial court order must first be presented and ruled upon by the trial court. <em>See, e.g., Gheorghiu v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 678, 689, 701 S.E.2d 407, 414 (2010) (describing \u201ca conviction based on a void sentence\u201d as one of the \u201climited circumstances\u201d in which the ends-of-justice exception is applied); <em>Gordon v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va.App. 682, 685-86, 739 S.E.2d 276, 278 (2013) (applying the ends-of-justice exception to an order that was void <em>ab initio).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">A violation of Rule 3A:8(c)(2) procedures does not undermine the trial court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction. A trial court\u2019s power to hear a criminal case comes not from the Rules of Court but from the Virginia Constitution and the Acts of Assembly.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judicial power, after all, derives from \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>sovereign authority which organizes the court,\u201d <em>Thacker v. Hubard, </em>122 Va. 379, 386, 94 S.E. 929, 930 (1918) (quoting <em>Cooper v. Reynolds, </em>10 Wall. 308, 77 U.S. 308, 316, 19 L.Ed. 931 (1870)), not from the court itself. Rule 3A:8(c)(2) merely imposes procedural requirements on the trial court\u2019s acceptance of a guilty plea. <em>See Hairston v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 941, 945, 434 S.E.2d 350, 353 (1993), <em>cited with approval in Morrissey v. Va. State Bar, </em>248 Va. 334, 341, 448 S.E.2d 615, 619 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In other words, the formalities required by Rule 3A:8(c)(2) have nothing to do with the judicial <em>power </em>of the court, only the proper exercise of the power it already possesses. <em>See United States v. Timmreck, </em>441 U.S. 780, 783, 99 S.Ct. 2085, 2087, 60 L.Ed.2d 634 (1979) (holding a violation of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, governing guilty pleas, \u201cis neither constitutional nor jurisdictional\u201d); <em>see also Gardner v. Warden, </em>222 Va. 491, 493 n. *, 281 S.E .2d 876, 877 n. * (1981) (stating that Rule 3A:11, which was renumbered as Rule 3A:8 in 1984, \u201cis substantially equivalent to Fed.R.Crim.P. II\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThis distinction guards against the <em>faux </em>elevation of a court\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements for exercising its authority to the same level of gravity as a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>De Avies v. De Avies, </em>42 Va.App. 342, 345-46, 592 S. E.2d 351, 352 (2004) <em>(en banc) </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn this sense, a trial court has \u2018jurisdiction to err\u2019 just as an appellate court has jurisdiction to correct such errors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346, 592 S.E.2d at 352 (quoting <em>Parrish v. Jessee, </em>250 Va. 514, 521, 464 S.E.2d 141, 146 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>In short, even if the trial court violated Rule 3A:8(c)(2) by accepting Winslow\u2019s plea agreement without the required formalities, that error would not render the conviction order void <em>ab initio. </em>It might render the order voidable on direct appeal, but only if Winslow complied with the procedural default principles applicable to appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">B. Rule 5A:18\u2014Ends of Justice</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Winslow concedes he did not challenge in the trial court either his plea agreement or the conviction order based upon it. That should not matter, he contends, because the alleged violation of Rule 3A:8(c)(2) was serious enough to trigger the ends-of-justice exception to Rule 5A:18.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The ends-of-justice doctrine is \u201ca narrow exception that should be used sparingly.\u201d <em>Alford v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 706, 710, 696 S.E.2d 266, 268 (2010) (quoting <em>Brittle v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 505, 512, 680 S.E.2d 335, 339 (2009)). \u201cIt is never enough for the defendant to merely assert a winning argument on the merits\u2014for if that were enough procedural default \u2018would never apply, except when it does not matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Delaney v. Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 64, 69, 683 S.E.2d 834, 836 (2009)). Taken to its logical conclusion, such an approach would mean that only losing arguments could be waived and \u201cevery issue would be subject to appellate review regardless of whether the issue was properly preserved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Brittle, </em>54 Va.App. at 513, 680 S.E.2d at 339).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">To prevent the exception from swallowing the rule, Virginia courts applying the ends-of-justice exception require a defendant to present not only a winning argument on appeal but also one demonstrating that the trial court\u2019s error results in a \u201cgrave injustice\u201d or a wholly inexcusable \u201cdenial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>essential rights.\u201d <em>Brittle, </em>54 Va.App. at 513, 680 S.E.2d at 339 (internal quotation marks omitted). In criminal cases, this usually requires a showing that the defendant was \u201cconvicted for conduct that was not a criminal offense or the record must affirmatively prove that an element of the offense did not occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Winslow\u2019s arguments in this case fall far short of meeting this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">To begin with, we are not at all confident that the court reporter\u2019s verbatim transcription of the terms of the plea agreement violated Rule 3A:8(c)(2)\u2019s requirement that the agreement \u201cbe reduced to writing.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We need not decide the point, however. The only clear violation of Rule 3A:8(c) appears to be the absence of signatures, a point Winslow mentions only briefly. And neither of these irregularities, considered together or separately, demonstrates that Winslow was convicted of a non-existent crime. Nor do they suggest, much less affirmatively prove, his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">To be sure, Winslow does not claim that the transcript inaccurately recorded the terms of his plea agreement, that his conviction order in any way deviated from the agreement, or that his plea was involuntary or even ill-advised. His position on appeal, therefore, could not survive the general admonition that \u201c[ejrrors, defects, irregularities or variances that do not affect substantive rights\u201d\u2014even when properly preserved for appellate review\u2014\u201cshall not constitute reversible error.\u201d Rule 3A:2(a). <em>See generally Ray v. Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 647, 651 n. 2, 688 S.E.2d 879, 881 n. 2 (2010); <em>Kirby v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 691, 698-99, 653 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>S.E.2d 600, 603-04 (2007). All the more, his assertion of error could not constitute the kind of grave, inexcusable injustice contemplated by the ends-of-justice exception to Rule 5A:18.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Because Winslow did not assert in the trial court that Rule 3A:8(c)(2) precluded the court from accepting his plea agreement and issuing a conviction order based upon it, he cannot raise this assertion for the first time on appeal. The conviction order was not void <em>ab initio, </em>and the ends-of-justice exception does not excuse Winslow\u2019s procedural default.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-5\">. Judicial orders can also be declared void <em>ab initio </em>for reasons other than lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Kelley, </em>285 Va. at 75-78, 737 S.E.2d at 221-23; <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 690, 704, 667 S.E.2d 787, 793-94 (2008) <em>(en </em>banc).
