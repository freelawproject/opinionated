Appellant contends that the blood test results were inadmissible at his DUI trial \u201cbecause the evidence did not support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Commonwealth\u2019s compliance with Virginia Code Section 18.2-268.2(B).\u201d We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the blood test results, and, accordingly, for the following reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction for driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">We consider the evidence on appeal \u201c in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must since it was the prevailing party\u2019 \u201d in the trial court. <em>Beasley v. Commonwealth, </em>60 Va.App. 381, 391, 728 S.E.2d 499, 504 (2012) (quoting <em>Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 296, 330, 601 S.E.2d 555, 574 (2004)). In this case, Officer Amanda Kay Hesson (Officer Hesson) of the Waynesboro Police Department stopped appellant\u2019s vehicle after she observed appellant drive in a very erratic manner and almost collide with another vehicle. At trial, Officer Hesson testified that appellant\u2019s eyes were watery and glassy, that appellant had a difficult time keeping his eyes open, and that appellant had to use his car to steady himself once he stepped out of it. Officer Hesson further testified that she asked appellant on two separate occasions to produce his license and registration. Each time, however, appellant handed Officer Hesson his vehicle inspection slip instead.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Officer Hesson asked appellant if he had been drinking, appellant did not respond.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pertinent to this appeal, Officer Hesson testified that she did not smell alcohol on appellant\u2019s breath or person.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">During her encounter with appellant, Officer Hesson asked appellant on three separate occasions if he would perform a field sobriety test. Each time, appellant refused. Officer Hesson ultimately arrested appellant for DUI. The arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>report that Officer Hesson completed regarding her arrest of appellant stated that appellant was arrested for \u201cDUI-Drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">At the police station, appellant was \u201cunsteady\u201d on his feet, and he needed the assistance of another officer to walk to the back of the station. Officer Hesson did not offer appellant a breath test at the police station, even though breath testing equipment was available. Officer Hesson\u2019s testimony did not address whether appellant was physically incapable of taking a breath test. Officer Hesson did, however, offer appellant a blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">On direct examination at trial, Officer Hesson explained why she offered appellant a blood test, rather than a breath test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ2\">Q: Did\u2014did you smell an odor of alcohol about him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">A: No, sir, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">Q: Okay. At that point, were you\u2014did you suspect he was driving under the influence of alcohol?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">A: I knew he was ... I suspected he was driving under the influence of something. But I could not be sure it was alcoholic, because I did not smell alcohol on him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amz\">Q: And for that reason, you offered him the\u2014...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">A: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-11\">Q: ... the blood test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-12\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">After appellant initially refused the blood test, and after Officer Hesson explained to appellant his rights, appellant ultimately agreed to take the blood test, the results of which revealed that appellant\u2019s blood alcohol content was 0.16% by weight by volume. Even though the sticker that the blood-draw technician affixed to the vial of blood read, in relevant part, \u201cCertificate Of Blood Withdrawal For Alcohol/Drug Determination\u201d the lab tested the blood only for alcohol\u2014and not for any other drugs. Thus, appellant was not tested for any other drugs, even though Officer Hesson believed at the time of the arrest that appellant was under the influence of substances other than (or perhaps in addition to) alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>At trial, after Officer Hesson testified, appellant moved to exclude the results of the blood test from the evidence. Appellant argued that the taking of the blood test was impermissible under Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 because the equipment necessary for performing a breath test was available and there was no indication that appellant was physically unable to take the breath test. In response, the prosecutor argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">What [Officer Hesson] indicated was that he looked to be impaired, but she couldn\u2019t relate it to alcohol. She suspected that he was on some other\u2014some other substance. And the blood alcohol breath test is not going to determine whether or not if he was high on some other drug or a prescription or anything like that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion, admitted the blood test results into evidence, and found appellant guilty of DUI, upon consideration of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\u2022 II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Appellant\u2019s assignment of error challenges the admission of the blood test results.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">\u201cEvidence is admissible if it is both relevant and material,\u201d and it is inadmissible if it fails to satisfy these criteria. <em>Evans-Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 188, 196, 198, 361 S.E.2d 436, 441, 442 (1987). \u201cEvidence is relevant if it has any logical tendency, however slight, to establish a fact at issue in the case.\u201d <em>Ragland v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va. App. 913, 918, 434 S.E.2d 675, 678 (1993). \u201cEvidence is material if it relates to a matter properly at issue.\u201d <em>Evans-Smith, </em>5 Va.App. at 196, 361 S.E.2d at 441.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-10\"><em>Wood v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 286, 304, 701 S.E.2d 810, 818-19 (2010). \u201cIt is well settled that \u2018 \u201c[t]he admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, 701 S.E.2d at 818 (quoting <em>James v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 746, 753, 446 S.E.2d 900, 904 (1994)). To the extent that this appeal presents a question of statutory interpretation, this Court will review the statute <em>de novo. See, e.g., Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>61 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Va.App. 542, 548, 738 S.E.2d 525, 528 (2013) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">A. The Implied Consent Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\"> \u201cThe right to operate a motor vehicle on the highways\u201d of Virginia is not an \u201cunrestrained right, but a privilege which is subject to reasonable regulation under the police power of the State in the interest of public safety and welfare.\u201d <em>Walton v. Roanoke, </em>204 Va. 678, 683, 133 S.E.2d 315, 318 (1963) (citations omitted). \u201cBy operating a motor vehicle on the highways of the Commonwealth,\u201d a motorist \u201cconsent\u00eds], as a condition of that operation, to have tests made to determine\u201d if that person is intoxicated. <em>Cash v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 46, 52, 466 S.E.2d 736, 739 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Subsection A of Virginia\u2019s implied consent statutory provision, Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">Any person, whether licensed by Virginia or not, who operates a motor vehicle upon a highway, as defined in \u00a7 46.2-100, in the Commonwealth shall be deemed thereby, as a condition of such operation, to have consented to have samples of his blood, breath, or both blood and breath taken for a chemical test to determine the alcohol, drug, or both alcohol and drug content of his blood, if he is arrested for violation of \u00a7 18.2-266, 18.2-266.1, or subsection B of \u00a7 18.2-272 or of a similar ordinance within three hours of the alleged offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(A) precedes two additional subsections that discuss breath testing and blood testing. As an initial matter, the implied consent statute as it is presently enacted does not permit the arrestee to \u201celect\u201d whether to submit to a breath test or a blood test. <em>Brown-Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 232, 236, 656 S.E.2d 422, 424 (2008). Moreover, the implied consent statute \u201cdoes not impose any obligation upon the police officer to offer a breath test,\u201d id.\u2014or any chemical testing at all. <em>See Oliver v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 20, 24, 577 S.E.2d 514, 516 (2003) (explaining that \u201c[t]est results from a breath or blood test are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>not necessary or required to prove driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Subsection B of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, which includes language that applies when a person is arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">Any person so arrested for a violation of clause (i) or (ii) of \u00a7 18.2-266 or both, \u00a7 18.2-266.1 or subsection B of \u00a7 18.2-272 or of a similar ordinance shall submit to a breath test. If the breath test is unavailable or the person is physically unable to submit to the breath test, a blood test shall be given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The offenses referenced in Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(B) all involve the consumption of alcohol.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the plain language of subsection B is triggered when a person has been arrested for an alcohol-related DUI offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">By contrast, subsection C of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 has language that applies when a person is arrested for driving under the influence of drugs or substances <em>other than </em>alcohol or <em>a combination </em>of drugs and alcohol. That subsection states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\"><em>Any person, after having been arrested for a violation of clause (Hi), (iv), or (v) of \u00a7 18.2-266 or \u00a7 18.2-266.1 or subsection B of \u00a7 18.2-272 or of a similar ordinance, may be required to submit to a blood test to determine the drug or both drug and alcohol content of his blood. </em>When a person, after having been arrested for a violation of \u00a7 18.2-266(i) or (ii) or both, submits to a breath test in accordance with subsection B or refuses to take or is incapable of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>taking such a breath test, he may be required to submit to tests to determine the drug or both drug and alcohol content of his blood if the law-enforcement officer has reasonable cause to believe the person was driving under the influence of any drug or combination of drugs, or the combined influence of alcohol and drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(0) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Given the facts of this case on appeal, we focus on the first sentence of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(0). Unlike Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(B), the first sentence of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(0) is triggered by arrests for DUI offenses that do not necessarily involve the consumption of alcohol <em>alone.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, the plain language of the first sentence of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(0) is applicable when a person is arrested for a DUI offense that involves the use of drugs or substances other than alcohol or a combination of drugs and alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">B. Appellant\u2019s Incorrect Premise</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\u201cOnce the legislature has acted, the role of the judiciary \u2018is the narrow one of determining what [the legislature] meant by the words it used in the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chapman v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 725, 732, 697 S.E.2d 20, 24 (2010) (quoting <em>Dionne v. Southeast Foam Converting &amp; Packaging, Inc., </em>240 Va. 297, 304, 397 S.E.2d 110, 114 (1990)). In this case, we disagree with appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in admitting the blood test results into evidence. Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is incorrectly premised on his contention that the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(B) apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>to this set of facts. However, subsection B of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 simply does not and cannot apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u201c \u2018When the language in a statute is clear and unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language.\u2019\u201d <em>Brown-Fitzgerald, </em>51 Va.App. at 236, 656 S.E.2d at 424 (quoting <em>Cummings v. Fulghum, </em>261 Va. 73, 77, 540 S.E.2d 494, 496 (2001)). As explained above, Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(B) applies when the suspect has been arrested for an alcohol-related DUI offense that does not involve other drugs or intoxicants. Here, however, Officer Hesson testified at trial that she did not smell alcohol on appellant. Officer Hesson believed that appellant was driving under the influence of <em>something, </em>but she <em>could not be sure it was an alcoholic substance </em>because she could not detect the odor of alcohol. Instead, the record establishes that Officer Hesson believed that the ingestion of a drug or drugs (or perhaps a combination of drugs and alcohol) caused appellant\u2019s readily apparent intoxication. To that end, Officer Hesson prepared and filed an arrest report indicating that appellant was arrested for <em>\u201cDUI\u2014Drugs.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Simply put, because Officer Hesson arrested appellant based on her belief that drugs other than (or perhaps in addition to) alcohol caused appellant\u2019s readily apparent intoxication, Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(B) does not apply to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Instead, the first sentence of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(C) applies. That statutory language plainly applies when a person is arrested for drug-related DUI offenses, and the record establishes that Officer Hesson arrested appellant for a drug-related DUI offense. On this record, Officer Hesson\u2019s decision to offer a blood test was entirely appropriate. <em>See Lamay v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 461, 471, 513 S.E.2d 411, 416 (1999) (noting that a blood test is applicable for \u201ca violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266(iii) or (iv),\u201d which involve intoxication due to drugs or drugs and alcohol in combination).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">We disagree with appellant\u2019s argument that Officer Hesson was required, as a matter of law, to offer appellant a breath test before requesting that he take a blood test. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Imposing such a requirement would contradict the plain language of the implied consent statute and would violate all common sense. A breath test is inherently incapable of showing that an individual is under the influence of drugs\u2014 only of alcohol. As the prosecutor actually pointed out at trial, a breath test will not detect whether a person has been driving under the influence of some other type of intoxicating drug or substance. Courts are not permitted to interpret any statute, such as Virginia\u2019s implied consent statute, in a way that \u201c \u2018would render the statute strained, ambiguous, illogical, and in contravention of the legislature\u2019s clear intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Saunders v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 139, 145, 692 S.E.2d 252, 255 (2010) (quoting <em>Broadnax v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 808, 814-15, 485 S.E.2d 666, 668-69 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Here, Officer Hesson believed that appellant was under the influence of something <em>other than </em>(or perhaps in addition to) alcohol. Her testimony makes clear that she decided to offer appellant a blood test because she could not detect the odor of alcohol on or near him. In light of the officer\u2019s observations, a breath test certainly was not required, given that, by its very nature, a breath test is designed to measure only the amount of alcohol in a person\u2019s blood at the time of the test. <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 419, 422, 404 S.E.2d 78, 80 (1991). On this record, Officer Hesson obviously was permitted to offer a blood test, which appellant was deemed to have consented to take under the provisions of the implied consent statute when he operated a motor vehicle on Virginia\u2019s highways. Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(A); <em>see also Cash, </em>251 Va. at 52, 466 S.E.2d at 739. When an officer, as here, arrests a driver for a DUI offense that involves drugs or substances other than (or even in addition to) alcohol, the officer may require the driver to submit to a blood test to determine the driver\u2019s level of intoxication.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">The record establishes that appellant was arrested for a drug-related DUI offense based on the officer\u2019s observations and the lack of any odor of alcohol on or near appellant. Given this situation, the officer\u2019s decision to offer appellant a blood test was appropriate under the plain language of the implied consent statute, and the officer was not required to offer a breath test. On this record, therefore, the trial court properly admitted appellant\u2019s blood test results. Accordingly, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction for DUI under Code \u00a7 18.2-266.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-12\">.

Code \u00a7 18.2-272(B) applies when a person whose privilege to drive has been restricted, suspended, or revoked operates a motor vehicle with \"a blood alcohol content of 0.02 percent or more.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b544-9\">.

Code \u00a7 18.2\u2014266(iii) applies when a person is \"under the influence of any narcotic drug or any other self-administered intoxicant or drug of whatsoever nature, or any combination of such drugs, to a degree which impairs [the] ability\u201d to operate a motor vehicle safely.
