Appellant argues that the side-switching doctrine barred Dr. Hollings from testifying as an expert witness for the Commonwealth because appellant had a prior confidential relationship with, and because of this relationship disclosed confidential or privileged information to, Dr. Hollings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Assuming without deciding that the side-switching doctrine applies in this case, we find that appellant failed to prove that he disclosed confidential or privileged information to Dr. Hollings. Appellant also contends that Dr. Hollings was precluded by statute from testifying for the Commonwealth. We find that appellant waived this argument. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to allow Dr. Hollings to testify for the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">On the morning of January 3, 2008, Jeanette Chappelle, appellant\u2019s wife, was pulling out of her driveway with her son, daughter, and grandchild in the ear. Appellant maneuvered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>his truck to block Jeanette\u2019s path, preventing her from exiting the driveway. He then brandished a firearm to force Jeanette, their two children, and their grandchild back inside the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Law enforcement officers arrived at Jeanette\u2019s home shortly thereafter. The officers initiated contact with appellant, who refused to exit the premises and informed the officers that he had hostages. A four-hour standoff ensued. Eventually, Jeanette and the children were able to escape. A SWAT team then entered the house and arrested appellant. Appellant was later indicted on four charges of abduction, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-47(A),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and four charges of the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Following appellant\u2019s arrest, the trial court appointed Dr. Evan Nelson to assess appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial and to evaluate his sanity at the time of the offense. Dr. Nelson interviewed appellant and concluded that he was competent to stand trial. Dr. Nelson also found that appellant was depressed at the time of the crimes but that he was not insane.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Shortly thereafter, the trial court appointed a second clinical psychologist, Dr. Hollings, to assess the appellant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense. Dr. Hollings interviewed appellant on two occasions, and based on those interviews, she then concluded that appellant was insane at the time of the offense. Dr. Hollings affirmed her findings in a written report, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>pursuant to statute was disclosed to the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nearly two years later, after receiving additional information, including appellant\u2019s medical and psychiatric reports, Dr. Hollings revised her findings and concluded that appellant was not insane at the time of the offense. It is unclear from the record whether Dr. Hollings prepared a revised written report, but it is apparent that the Commonwealth was aware that Dr. Hollings revised her conclusion and asked her to testify at trial about her revised findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Prompted by Dr. Hollings\u2019 revised conclusion, appellant filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude Dr. Hollings from testifying for the Commonwealth. Appellant argued that the side-switching doctrine barred Dr. Hollings from testifying for the Commonwealth. According to appellant, the side-switching doctrine bars an expert witness from testifying when the party seeking disqualification of the expert proves that it was objectively reasonable to believe a confidential relationship existed between the party seeking disqualification and the expert, and the party seeking disqualification disclosed confidential or privileged information to the expert. <em>See Turner v. Thiel, </em>262 Va. 597, 601, 553 S.E.2d 765, 768 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that both prongs of the side-switching doctrine were met. He asserted that he had worked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>closely with and relied upon Dr. Hollings while preparing his case. While appellant\u2019s attorney could not state \u201cchapter and verse\u201d what they discussed, he asserted that \u201cit was the kind of conversation a lawyer ... would have with their expert,\u201d including discussions about trial strategy and, therefore, Dr. Hollings should be disqualified from testifying for the Commonwealth. Finally, appellant acknowledged that Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(E), which required appellant to provide Dr. Hollings\u2019 report to the Commonwealth, created some tension with his side-switching argument, but argued that because Dr. Hollings\u2019 involvement in the case went beyond the mere information contained in her report, it was objectively reasonable to believe his relationship with Dr. Hollings was confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The Commonwealth opposed appellant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>and argued that the side-switching doctrine has been applied exclusively in civil cases. Moreover, the Commonwealth argued that the side-switching doctrine applied to retained experts only and not court-appointed experts, as occurred in this case. Finally, according to the Commonwealth, even if the side-switching doctrine applied to criminal cases, it was not objectively reasonable for appellant to believe that he formed a confidential relationship with Dr. Hollings when Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(E) required appellant, if he was going to present an insanity defense, to disclose Dr. Hollings\u2019 report to the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>and Dr. Hollings testified for the Commonwealth. During her testimony, Dr. Hollings stated that when she was appointed by the trial court, she received limited information with which to conduct an evaluation of appellant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense. This differed from Dr. Hollings\u2019 normal practice of reviewing information about the individual, such as prior medical and psychiatric reports. Dr. Hollings testified that prior to interviewing appellant she received only a brief description of appellant\u2019s offense and no information concerning appellant\u2019s prior medical or psychiatric history. Dr. Hollings did, however, admit to interviewing appellant on two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>occasions, during which she explained to appellant the limits of confidentiality pertaining to their conversations. After completing both interviews, Dr. Hollings then opined that appellant was paranoid and delusional, and she concluded that appellant was insane at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Dr. Hollings later revised her conclusion. Approximately two years after Dr. Hollings first interviewed appellant, appellant\u2019s counsel provided Dr. Hollings with appellant\u2019s medical and psychiatric records. After reviewing that information and interviewing appellant\u2019s wife, Jeanette, Dr. Hollings reconsidered her prior findings. She concluded that appellant suffered from major depression disorder without psychosis but that he was not insane at the time of his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">During cross-examination, appellant questioned Dr. Hollings about the information that led her to revise her opinion. Dr. Hollings explained that the information was created prior to her first interview with appellant but that it was not provided to her at that time. She admitted, however, that she had not attempted to interview or speak with appellant\u2019s wife before her initial evaluation of appellant. Dr. Hollings concluded her testimony by clarifying that neither party asked her to reevaluate her initial evaluation, but rather, on her own initiative, she reviewed the new information and revised her opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">At the close of the case, the jury returned guilty verdicts on three counts of abduction and three counts of using a firearm in the commission of a felony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court later sentenced appellant to a total of seventeen years\u2019 imprisonment, with no time suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred by allowing Dr. Hollings to testify for the Commonwealth because Dr. Hollings was barred from testifying by the side-switching doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Turner, </em>262 Va. 597, 553 S.E.2d 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">In <em>Turner, </em>the Court adopted the following two-part test to use when a party seeks to disqualify an opposing party\u2019s expert witness because the expert had been previously retained by the party seeking disqualification: \u201cWas it objectively reasonable for the [party seeking disqualification] to conclude that a confidential relationship existed between that party and the expert; and did the [the party seeking disqualification] disclose any confidential or privileged information to the expert witness?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601, 553 S.E.2d at 768. \u201cThe party seeking disqualification bears the burden of proving both prongs of the two-part test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602, 553 S.E.2d at 768. Accordingly, this Court\u2019s inquiry relates to the determination of the existence of two separate components; a component establishing a confidential relationship between the party and the expert <em>and </em>facts and circumstances proving an actual disclosure of information to the expert from the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">While the Supreme Court identified the two-part test as \u201cthe appropriate test\u201d to apply when a party seeks disqualification of an expert witness, <em>id., </em>it did not address extending the side-switching doctrine to criminal cases. Nor has this Court held that the side-switching doctrine applies in a criminal context. Nevertheless, assuming without deciding that the side-switching doctrine applies in criminal cases, we find that appellant did not meet his burden <em>of </em>proving an actual disclosure of confidential or privileged information to Dr. Hollings.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">As the party seeking disqualification, appellant bore the burden of offering sufficient evidence that he disclosed confidential information to Dr. Hollings. <em>Id. </em>(requiring party moving for disqualification to show actual disclosure of confidential information). Confidential information includes,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\u201cdiscussion of: a party\u2019s strategies in litigation, the kinds of experts that the retaining party expected to employ, a party\u2019s views of the strengths and weaknesses of each side\u2019s case, the role of each of the litigant\u2019s expert witnesses to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>hired, anticipated defenses, counsel\u2019s theory of the case, and counsel\u2019s mental impressions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\"><em>Kitt v. Crosby, </em>277 Va. 396, 407, 672 S.E.2d 851, 858 (2009) (quoting <em>Turner, </em>262 Va. at 603, 553 S.E.2d at 768). At trial, appellant\u2019s counsel asserted that he had \u201ccandid discussions\u201d with Dr. Hollings of the type a trial lawyer would have with his expert, including discussions regarding \u201ctrial approaches\u201d and the strength of \u201c[Dr. Hollings\u2019] opinion that [appellant] was insane and what ... areas [of the case] needed to be buttressed.\u201d But appellant did not introduce evidence substantiating this claim and the simple assertion that his attorney disclosed some non-specific confidential information to Dr. Hollings does not meet his burden of proof. <em>See Jiron-Garcia v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 638, 651, 633 S.E.2d 744, 750 (2006) (stating that the Court \u201c \u2018may act only upon facts contained in the record,\u2019 and not upon unsupported statements of counsel\u201d (quoting <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 630, 635, 432 S.E.2d 2, 6 (1993))).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In some instances it may indeed prove difficult to show an actual disclosure of confidential information when the exchange of information occurred orally (rather than in writing), as here. <em>Cf. Turner, </em>262 Va. at 603, 553 S.E.2d at 768 (\u201cUpon our <em>in camera </em>review of the letter ... plaintiffs counsel forwarded to [the expert witness], we conclude that the letter contained confidential information because plaintiffs counsel revealed his mental impressions and trial strategies to [the expert witness].\u201d). But at a very minimum, appellant had the opportunity at trial to question Dr. Hollings about what, if any, confidential information she received from appellant, and he chose not to do so. <em>See Kitt, 277 </em>Va. at 407, 672 S.E.2d at 858 (upholding the trial court\u2019s finding that counsel disclosed confidential information where the expert witness testified at trial that \u201che had conversations with [defendant] and [defendant\u2019s] counsel about [his] findings and opinions as they related to [defendant\u2019s]\u201d ability to show ownership of the disputed property at issue in the lawsuit). While Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(E) makes clear that the information disclosed by appellant to Dr. Hollings was to be deemed protected by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>lawyer-client privilege, at least until appellant chose to pursue an insanity defense, it was appellant\u2019s burden under the side-switching doctrine to prove, or particularize, the actual disclosure of confidential information to Dr. Hollings, which he failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Accordingly, assuming without deciding that the side-switching doctrine applies in this case, we hold that the trial court did not err in permitting Dr. Hollings to testify because appellant did not meet his burden of proof on the actual disclosure prong of the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In addition to his side-switching argument, appellant also argues that the trial court erred because allowing Dr. Hollings to testify violated the statutory scheme governing appellant\u2019s defense of insanity. Appellant argues that \u201c[t]he system enacted by Code [\u00a7\u00a7 19.2-168, -168.1, -169.5] requires the appointment of one expert for the defense and one expert for the prosecution.\u201d Appellant further asserts that a defendant\u2019s relationship with his appointed expert is confidential and that \u201cthe defendant and the defense attorney are free to discuss trial tactics with their respective expert\u201d without fear that \u201ctheir expert will ever be used against them.\u201d Accordingly, appellant contends that the trial court erred in permitting Dr. Hollings to testify for the Commonwealth. This argument is barred by Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Rule 5A:18 states, in part, that \u201c[n]o ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless an objection was stated with reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling____\u201d The purpose of the rule \u201cis to advise the trial judge of the action complained of so that the court can consider the issue intelligently and, if necessary, take corrective action to avoid unnecessary appeals, reversals, and mistrials.\u201d <em>Head v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 163, 167, 348 S.E.2d 423, 426 (1986). Applying Rule 5A:18, we have consistently held that we \u201cwill not consider an argument on appeal which was not presented to the trial court.\u201d <em>Ohree v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 299, 308, 494 S.E.2d 484, 488 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Here, appellant did not raise before the trial court the argument he now presents on appeal. Appellant filed with the trial court a written motion <em>in limine </em>arguing that Dr. Hollings was precluded from testifying based exclusively on the side-switching doctrine. Similarly, appellant\u2019s argument at the hearing on his motion <em>in limine </em>addressed only the side-switching doctrine. The only reference appellant made at trial to the relevant statutory provisions occurred when he acknowledged the tension between his side-switching argument and Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(E), which required appellant to disclose Dr. Hollings\u2019 report to the Commonwealth. Appellant did not argue before the trial court that Dr. Hollings was precluded by statute from testifying for the Commonwealth. Because the trial court was not provided an opportunity to consider this issue, Rule 5A:18 bars our consideration of it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">For these reasons, we find that the trial court did not err in allowing Dr. Hollings to testify for the Commonwealth. Appellant\u2019s convictions are therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-11\">.
