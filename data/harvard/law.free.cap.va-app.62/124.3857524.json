For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Appellant was the legal custodian of his nieces, K.C. and H.C., ages ten and eleven, who lived with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Police investigation revealed that appellant had befriended Z.L., a sixteen-year-old minor, on Facebook and the two began \u201cchatting\u201d online for approximately three weeks. Appellant admitted that he and Z.L. devised a plan in which Z.L. would sneak out of his home late at night and appellant would pick him up.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">On August 9, 2012, police arrested appellant and charged him with contributing to the delinquency of a minor and taking indecent liberties with a minor. After his arrest, appellant admitted to the police and a social services worker that he and Z.L. would drink alcohol during their meetings, that he and Z.L. engaged in oral sex, that he took pictures of Z.L.\u2019s exposed penis and showing appellant touching the penis, and that the pictures revealed appellant performing oral sex on Z.L. Appellant stated he spent time with Z.L. approximately four times over the past three weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Upon appellant\u2019s arrest, he was incarcerated and held without bond until released. Based on this incarceration, the Department of Social Services (DSS) obtained an emergency removal order and placed K.C. and H.C. in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>There was no evidence appellant sexually or physically abused K.C. or H.C., nor did appellant\u2019s sexual acts occur with the children present.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Prior to the hearing on whether the children were abused and neglected, the trial court <em>nolle prosequied </em>the charges against appellant, although the investigation continued. The trial court found the two nieces were abused and neglected under Code \u00a7 16.1-228(4) and (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Appellant challenges the trial court\u2019s finding that the two children were abused and neglected under Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014 228(4), and (5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, his contention under subparagraph (4) is twofold: First, he argues that since he was not convicted of sexually abusing Z.L., he did not commit any sexual act. Next, he contends that because Z.L. was not a child under his care, nor was the act done in the presence of his nieces, he did not violate the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>The standard of review concerning Code \u00a7 16.1-228(4) is one of statutory interpretation since the essence of his argument is that the trial court erred in interpreting \u201ca child\u201d as \u201cany child,\u201d as opposed to the child of the parent or guardian.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">\u201c\u2018Statutory construction is a question of law which we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Servs. v. Cook, </em>276 Va. 465, 480, 666 S.E.2d 361, 368 (2008) (quoting <em>Parker v. Warren, </em>273 Va. 20, 23, 639 S.E.2d 179, 181 (2007)). In accordance with well-established principles, we will \u201c \u2018apply the plain language of a statute unless the terms are ambiguous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id </em>(quoting <em>Boynton v. Kilgore, </em>271 Va. 220, 227, 623 S.E.2d 922, 926 (2006)). \u201c \u2018[T]he primary objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Amerson, </em>281 Va. 414, 418, 706 S.E.2d 879, 882 (2011); <em>see also B.P. v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 735, 739, 568 S.E.2d 412, 413 (2002) (\u201cWe will not place a construction upon a statute which leads to an absurd result or one plainly contrary to the expressed intent of the General Assembly....\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-5\"><em>Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va.App. 279, 284-85, 734 S.E.2d 708, 710 (2012). Legislative intent is ascertained \u201c \u2018by giving to all the words used their plain meaning, and construing all statutes <em>in pari materia </em>in such manner as to reconcile, if possible, any discordant feature which may exist, and make the body of the laws harmonious and just in their operation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>59 Va.App. 496, 500, 720 S.E.2d 157, 159-60 (2012) (quoting <em>Lucy v. Cnty. of Albemarle, </em>258 Va. 118, 129-30, 516 S.E.2d 480, 485 (1999)). Furthermore, \u201c \u2018[w]e ... presume that the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Seabolt v. Cnty. of Albemarle, </em>283 Va. 717, 720, 724 S.E.2d 715, 717 (2012) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Addison v. Jurgelsky, </em>281 Va. 205, 208, 704 S.E.2d 402, 404 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>We first address appellant\u2019s contention that he does not violate the statute unless he is convicted of committing a sexual act. He claims that merely committing a sexual act is not sufficient. Appellant does not contend that he did not commit the sexual offenses against Z.L. In fact, he admitted to those sexual crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u201cCommit\u201d and \u201cconvicted\u201d are two distinct concepts. Commit is defined as \u201cdo; perform.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>457 (1993). It is obvious the legislature chose the word \u201ccommit\u201d and not \u201cconvict.\u201d Surely, the legislature can distinguish between these two terms. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 9.1-901 (requiring every person convicted of certain sexual offenses to register under the Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry Act); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-310.2 (requiring every person convicted of a felony to submit to DNA testing).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">We conclude that the language of Code \u00a7 16.1-228(4) is unambiguous. The plain language requires only that the individual commit the offense, i.e., that he performed the act, not that he be convicted of it. It is uncontested that appellant took indecent liberties with Z.L. in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Relying on decisions such as <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), which explain the significance of the presumption of innocence that is afforded to a defendant in a criminal trial, appellant cites to the presumption of innocence to support his argument that one must be convicted of the sexual offense to satisfy subparagraph (4). This argument fails for several reasons. First, an abuse and neglect proceeding is civil in nature and the presumption of innocence is inapplicable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, a criminal conviction re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>quires proof beyond a reasonable doubt. By contrast, the lesser \u201cpreponderance of the evidence standard is an appropriate standard for an abuse and neglect proceeding which may lead to temporary placement of the child.\u201d <em>Wright v. Arlington Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>9 Va.App. 411, 414, 388 S.E.2d 477, 479 (1990). Here, appellant does not contend that he did not commit the sexual offenses against Z.L. In fact, he admitted to those sexual crimes. By admitting to the sexual contact, appellant provided the trial court with sufficient evidence to find that he engaged in sexual activity with the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Appellant points to the memorandum opinion <em>Davenport v. Davenport, </em>No. 1517-93-2, 1995 WL 40245, 1995 Va.App. LEXIS 75 (Va.Ct.App. Jan. 31, 1995), to support his position that he must be convicted of the sexual act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Davenport, </em>a custody case, does not support appellant\u2019s contention. The Court in <em>Davenport, </em>as here, acknowledged that the criminal charges against the father had been <em>nolle prosequied </em>in an earlier proceeding. However, the <em>Davenport </em>Court rejected the mother\u2019s testimony about the father\u2019s behavior and therefore found there was no abuse by the father. The issue in <em>Davenport </em>was the mother\u2019s credibility, not whether Davenport was convicted of the offense. That is not the case here, where appellant admitted to committing the sexual acts. Therefore, we do not find <em>Davenport </em>persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Next, appellant challenges the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201ca child\u201d in subparagraph (4), contending the victim of such abuse must be a child under his care. He argues that his nieces cannot be abused or neglected for acts committed upon another child. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Appellant cites <em>Nguyen v. Fairfax County Dept. of Family Services, </em>No. 0938-04-4, 2004 WL 2157987, 2004 Va.App. LEXIS 465 (Va.Ct.App. Sept. 28, 2004), a memorandum decision of this Court, to support his argument that \u201ca child\u201d means \u201cthe child\u201d in appellant\u2019s custody. Footnote 2 in <em>Nguyen </em>states that for a child to be \u201cabused or neglected\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 16.1-228(4), the child\u2019s parent, or person responsible for the child, must have committed, or allowed to have been committed, an unlawful sexual act upon the child. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-228(4). In <em>Nguyen, </em>it is uncontroverted that the victims were children of the mother whose parental rights were terminated. Thus, <em>Nguyen </em>sheds no light on the issue before us. As stated earlier, memorandum opinions have no precedential value. Thus, we are free to ignore footnote 2 in <em>Nguyen. </em>We find <em>Nguyen </em>unpersuasive for the reasons stated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Appellant contends that Code \u00a7 16.1-228(4) requires a \u201chousehold connection between the sexual acts and the child.\u201d We find this argument unpersuasive. He cites <em>Farrell v. Warren Dept. of Soc. Services, </em>59 Va.App. 375, 719 S.E.2d 329 (2012), a termination case, wherein we reviewed Code \u00a7 16.1-118(1) which defined an \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d as a child</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY\">[w]hose parents or other person responsible for his care creates or inflicts, threatens to create or inflict, or allows to be created or inflicted upon such child a physical or mental injury by other than accidental means, or creates a substantial risk of death, disfigurement or impairment of bodily or mental functions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">59 Va.App. at 416, 719 S.E.2d at 349. We concluded the children were in danger of death, or disfigurement because of an unsafe environment. <em>Farrell </em>did not involve the sexual abuse of a different child.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The article \u201ca\u201d is defined online as, \u201cNot any particular or certain one of a class or group: a man; a chemical; a house,\u201d http://dictionary.reference.eom/a (last visited May 1, 2013), or \u201cused as a function word before most singular nouns ... when the individual in question is undetermined, undefined or unspecified.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at 1. Thus, these definitions lead us to conclude that the reference to \u201ca child\u201d means not any particular child, nor any one of a class or group, such as the parent or custodian\u2019s child. <em>See also Phelps v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 139, 142, 654 S.E.2d 926, 927 (2008) (interpreting the word \u201ca\u201d as \u201cThe ordinary meaning of the word \u2018a\u2019 means \u2018any\u2019 or \u2018each\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at 1)). Further, a review of the entire statute supports this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Code \u00a7 16.1-228(1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) all restrict the subject of the abuse to child in the custody of a parent or guardian.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Clearly, the legislative intent of these subparagraphs is to define \u201cabuse and neglect\u201d in terms of some danger to the children in the care of their parent or guardian. But such is not the case in subparagraph (4) which states \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d means <em>any </em>child whose parents or other person responsible for his care commits or allows to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>committed any sexual act upon a child in violation of the law. There is no language restricting the use of the article \u201ca\u201d to a particular or certain class of children, as do the other subparagraphs. <em>See Kelso v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 30, 38, 698 S.E.2d 263, 266 (2010) (\u201c[W]e must presume that the General Assembly understood basic rules of grammar when drafting the statute.\u201d). Because the General Assembly \u201cuse[d] two different terms in the same act,\u201d we presume \u201cthose terms ... mean two different things.\u201d <em>Greenberg v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 594, 601, 499 S.E.2d 266, 270 (1998). Had the General Assembly wished to restrict the definition of an \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d to only those who were actual victims of sexual abuse by their parents or guardians, it could have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Appellant\u2019s interpretation of this subparagraph would lead to an absurd result allowing a sexual predator to maintain custody of his children or wards while abusing other children. Common logic would dictate that a person who sexually abused any child is a threat to the well-being of the children in his care or custody. Appellant\u2019s contention, if accepted, would require authorities to stand by and wait for those children to be sexually abused. It would be an unacceptable outcome for children to be socialized by a sexual predator.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">We conclude that \u201ca child\u201d refers to \u201cany child\u201d and is not limited to the child in a parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s custody or care.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Having found K.C. and H.C. were abused and neglected under Code \u00a7 16.1-228(4), we need not address whether the evidence was sufficient to meet the requirements of Code \u00a7 16.1-228(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">We conclude that the trial court did not err in finding that K.C. and H.C. were abused and neglected by appellant pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-228(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\">.

When a trial court\u2019s judgment is made on alternative grounds, we need only consider whether any one of the alternatives is sufficient to sustain the judgment of the trial court and, if we so find, need not address the other grounds. <em>See Fields v. Dinwiddie County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>46 Va.App. 1, 8, 614 S.E.2d 656, 659 (2005) (termination of parental rights upheld under one subsection of Code \u00a7 16.1-283 forecloses the need to consider termination under alternative subsections); <em>see also, Luginbyhl v.
