HUMPHREYS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">Larwan Badru Bonner (\u201cBonner\u201d) appeals his conviction in the Circuit Court of Brunswick County (\u201ctrial court\u201d) for altering the serial number of a firearm in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2\u2014311.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal to a three-judge panel of this Court, Bonner argued that the trial \u201ccourt erred in denying [his] motion to strike the [Code] \u00a7 18.2-311.1 charge involving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>absence of a serial number due to improper venue.\u201d A divided panel of this Court reversed the conviction based on a failure by the Commonwealth to establish that the Circuit Court of Brunswick County was a proper venue for his trial on this offense. <em>Bonner v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va.App. 247, 734 S.E.2d 692 (2012). The Commonwealth, by the Attorney General of Virginia, filed a petition requesting a rehearing <em>en banc. </em>This Court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition, staying the execution of the judgment of the panel opinion. <em>Bonner v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va.App. 430, 737 S.E.2d 46 (2013). Upon further review, we find that the Commonwealth failed to establish that venue for the trial of this offense was proper in Brunswick County, and so we reverse the conviction of altering the serial number of a firearm and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The facts relevant to this appeal are as follows. On October 29, 2009, Bonner made a threatening phone call to Erica Seay (\u201cSeay\u201d). At the time, Seay was in a house that is located in Brunswick County. Seay contacted the police and, together, they set up a meeting between Seay and Bonner at the Circle D,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which is also located in Brunswick County.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Meanwhile, Bonner met with Brian Wyatt (\u201cWyatt\u201d) and Wyatt\u2019s girlfriend, Diane Branzelle (\u201cBranzelle\u201d), at Wyatt\u2019s house.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Together, they drove to Bonner\u2019s house, which is located in Dinwiddie County, and then to the Circle D where they waited to meet Seay. The police arrived and arrested Bonner in the parking lot of the Circle D, and, incident to the arrest, they recovered the handgun that is at issue in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ease. At that time, the serial number of the handgun had already been filed down.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The evidence related to the handgun in this record is scant. There was no testimony as to who had filed down the serial number, when it was obliterated, or where the removal was done. Instead, the record reveals only that Seay had seen Bonner with the handgun previously on September 18 at his home in Dinwiddie. However, Seay was unable to state whether the handgun had the serial number removed at that point or not. Additionally, Branzelle testified that she noticed the gun wedged between the passenger seat and the center console of the car while they were waiting at the Circle D on the night of the arrest. Branzelle testified that she was familiar with the gun, as she had seen it previously in Bonner\u2019s father\u2019s truck, and it did not have a serial number on it at that point. However, the record before us does not establish the date on which she had seen the gun previously, what jurisdiction she was in on that occasion, or who owned the handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">A basic principle of law is that a civil or criminal action should be decided by a court in the locality where the civil dispute or criminal offense occurred and where a jury to resolve the issue may be drawn. This bedrock common law principle is expressed in the concept of venue and has long been recognized in Virginia. <em>See Richardson v. Commonwealth, </em>80 Va. 124 (1885).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">In a criminal prosecution, it is the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to establish venue. <em>Pollard v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 723, 725, 261 S.E.2d 328, 330 (1980). \u201cProof of venue \u2018is not a part of the crime.\u2019 Thus, the prosecution need not \u2018prove where the crime occurred beyond a reasonable doubt, since venue is not a substantive element of a crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morris v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 459, 469, 658 S.E.2d 708, 712-13 (2008) (quoting <em>Randall v. Commonwealth, </em>183 Va. 182, 187, 31 S.E.2d 571, 573 (1944); <em>United States v. Griley, </em>814 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>967, 973 (4th Cir.1987)). Instead, to establish venue the Commonwealth need only \u201cproduce evidence sufficient to give rise to a \u2018strong presumption\u2019 that the offense was committed within the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d <em>Cheng v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 36, 393 S.E.2d 599, 604 (1990). \u201cThe Commonwealth may prove venue by either direct or circumstantial evidence. In either case, the evidence must be sufficient to present a \u2018strong presumption that the offense was committed within the jurisdiction of the Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 709, 711, 419 S.E.2d 285, 287 (1992) (quoting <em>Pollard, </em>220 Va. at 725, 261 S.E.2d at 330).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">On appeal, an appellate court\u2019s responsibility when reviewing an issue of venue is \u201cto determine \u2018whether the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is sufficient to support the [trial court\u2019s] venue findings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Foster-Zahid v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 430, 442, 477 S.E.2d 759, 765 (1996) (quoting <em>Cheng, </em>240 Va. at 36, 393 S.E.2d at 604). Furthermore, \u201c[w]e consider whether the Commonwealth proved venue when viewing the evidence \u2018in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 185, 190, 708 S.E.2d 241, 243 (2011) (quoting <em>Cheng, </em>240 Va. at 36, 393 S.E.2d at 604).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Before we can determine whether the Commonwealth met its burden in establishing a strong presumption that the offense was committed in the jurisdiction of the trial court, we must establish in the abstract where a proper venue is for the offense of altering the serial number of a firearm. Generally, the General Assembly has provided that venue in the Commonwealth \u201cshall be had in the county or city in which the offense was committed.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-244. In other words, venue for a criminal prosecution will generally be proper wherever any element of the offense occurs. However, for certain specific offenses, the legislature has seen fit to allow for venue in other jurisdictions in which it may not ordinarily lie. <em>See e.g. </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-83, 18.2-115, 18.2-118, 18.2-178, 18.2-186, 18.2-326, 18.2-359, 18.2-362. In the absence of such a provision, Code \u00a7 19.2-244 dictates the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>venue for an offense. Such is the case here. \u201cApplication of this statute requires a determination of where a specific crime was \u2018committed.\u2019 This determination is straightforward when the crime is a discrete act.\u201d <em>Kelso v. Commonwealth, </em>282 Va. 134, 137, 710 S.E.2d 470, 472 (2011). However, when a crime constitutes a continuing offense, venue may be proper in more than one jurisdiction. <em>See Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 319, 324, 563 S.E.2d 406, 409 (2002).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">\u201cA continuing offense is a continuous, unlawfiil act or series of acts set on foot by a single impulse and operated by an unintermittent force, however long a time it may occupy. Where such an act or series of acts runs through several jurisdictions, the offense is committed and cognizable in each.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Midstate Horticultural Company, </em>306 U.S. 161, 166, 59 S.Ct. 412, 414, 83 L.Ed. 563 (1939)).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The offense of altering the serial number of a firearm is set forth under Code \u00a7 18.2-311.1, which states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">[a]ny person, ... who ... intentionally removes, defaces, alters, changes, destroys or obliterates in any manner or way or who ... causes to be removed, defaced, altered, changed, destroyed or obliterated in any manner or way the name of the ... or serial number ... on any pistol ... shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">By the plain language of the statute, it is clear that this offense constitutes a discrete act. The statute requires only that a person intentionally remove, deface, alter, change, destroy, or obliterate the serial number of the pistol in order for the elements of the offense to be completed. Once any of these goals has been achieved, the crime is complete. In other words, the statute does <em>not </em>contain \u201c\u2018a continuous, unlawful act or series of acts set on foot by a single impulse and operated by an unintermittent force.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas, </em>38 Va. App. at 324, 563 S.E.2d at 409 (quoting <em>Midstate Horticultural Company, </em>306 U.S. at 166, 59 S.Ct. at 414).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">In contrast, courts in the Commonwealth have consistently held that larceny is a continuing offense. <em>See Gheorghiu v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 678, 685, 701 S.E.2d 407, 411 (2010). This is \u201cbased on the common law legal fiction that each time the stolen goods are taken into a new jurisdiction, there is an illegal asportation and a new crime is committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in prosecutions for the offense of larceny, venue is proper in any jurisdiction in which the stolen goods are taken because one of the required elements of larceny, the asportation of the stolen property from its original location, is ongoing. Likewise, conspiracy constitutes a continuing offense, and therefore \u201cvenue is proper in any city or county where an act in furtherance of the conspiracy took place, as well as the place where the conspiracy was entered into.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 73, 80-81, 390 S.E.2d 386, 390 (1990). However, altering the serial number of a firearm is not analogous to these offenses. There is no element of this offense involving conduct that is ongoing in nature or conduct that in and of itself constitutes a new offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Even so, the Commonwealth argues that, \u201cdepending on the nature of a particular crime, there may be a distinction between the locus of criminal conduct and where its effect occurs. For purposes of venue, these offenses can be considered \u2018continuing\u2019 or \u2018transitory.\u2019 \u201d As in the case of altering the serial number of a firearm, the Commonwealth reasons that the effect of the crime would be felt anywhere the firearm is located, as the harm the statute intends to prevent is the inability to trace the firearm. In support of this argument, the Commonwealth cites to <em>Kelso, </em>in which the Supreme Court recognized \u201cvenue is proper in the jurisdiction where the direct and immediate result of an illegal act occurred, even if the illegal act causing the injury occurred in another jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Kelso, </em>282 Va. at 138, 710 S.E.2d at 473, and to <em>Gregory v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 89, 360 S.E.2d 858 (1987), in which this Court reasoned that \u201c[i]t has long been a commonplace of criminal liability that a person may be charged in the place where the evil results, though he is beyond the jurisdiction when he starts the train of events of which the evil is the fruit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94, 360 S.E.2d at 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>However, the Supreme Court in <em>Kelso </em>did not expand the scope of venue in the manner suggested by the Commonwealth. The Attorney General\u2019s argument ignores the context of the holding in which those statements were made. In <em>Kelso, </em>the charge was causing a juvenile to assist in the distribution of marijuana in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-255(A)(ii). As the Supreme Court noted, \u201cone of the acts which must occur for conviction is distribution of the contraband by the juvenile to a third party. Under these circumstances, the place where that act occurred is an appropriate venue for prosecution.\u201d <em>Kelso, </em>282 Va. at 138, 710 S.E.2d at 473. Thus, under the holding in <em>Kelso, </em>venue is proper where one of the elements of the offense occurred. Similarly, the offense charged in <em>Gregory </em>was one of those discussed above that involved an offense for which the General Assembly specifically provided for venue in a place other than where venue would ordinarily lie.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Indeed, the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that venue lies wherever some evil traceable to a crime occurs, if followed to its logical conclusion would result in the complete frustration of the general venue statute. Therefore, it is apparent that the General Assembly clearly does not share the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of existing law. Under the Commonwealth\u2019s theory, there would be no need for the legislature to include special venue statutes in the offenses that currently include such provisions. The offense of making threats to bomb a building under Code \u00a7 18.2-83 is illustrative. This statute criminalizes \u201c[a]ny person ... who makes and communicates to another by any means any threat to bomb, burn, destroy or in any manner damage any place of assembly, building or other structure, or any means of transportation.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-83(A). The statute goes on to state that \u201c[a] violation of this section may be prosecuted either in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>jurisdiction from which the communication was made or in the jurisdiction where the communication was received.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-83(B). This offense, like the alteration of a firearm, is a discrete act. However, the effect of the act is clearly felt where the threat is received. Thus, under the Commonwealth\u2019s theory, there would be no need for the legislature to specifically provide that the offense may be prosecuted where the threat was received. However, that is exactly what the legislature saw fit to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Having concluded that Code \u00a7 18.2-311.1 is a discrete rather than a continuing offense, we now turn to the issue of whether venue was proper in this case. That is, based on the evidence in the record before us, did the trial court err in finding that the Commonwealth established a strong presumption that the removal, defacement, alteration, change, destruction or obliteration of the serial number occurred in Brunswick County. In this case, we hold that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">It is clear from the record that Bonner did not file down the serial number while he was waiting at the Circle D in Brunswick County on the night in question. Both Seay and Branzelle testified that they had seen Bonner with the gun on different occasions prior to the night of his arrest. Seay was able to place the gun with Bonner at his residence in Dinwiddie County prior to the evening in question, and Branzelle testified that the handgun\u2019s serial number had already been removed prior to the arrest, although the date and location of that occurrence are not part of the record. However, there was no testimony that Bonner was the one who filed down the serial number, let alone where that discrete act occurred. While the Commonwealth need only prove a strong presumption of venue, as opposed to the much more stringent \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt standard\u201d necessary for conviction, there is still insufficient evidence in the record to sustain even this standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, we find that the trial court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>finding that the Commonwealth established that venue for the trial of this offense was proper in Brunswick County.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The Commonwealth argues that this is an absurd result and points to our oft-cited canon of statutory construction that \u201c \u2018the plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is to be preferred over any curious, narrow, or strained construction, and a statute should never be construed in a way that leads to absurd results.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis v. County of Fairfax, </em>282 Va. 23, 28, 710 S.E.2d 466, 468 (2011) (quoting <em>Meeks v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 798, 802, 651 S.E.2d 637, 639 (2007)). Our interpretation of the venue statute is based on its plain language. While this may create difficulty in some cases in establishing venue for this offense, difficulty is not absurdity. The legislature could have easily created a special venue provision for this offense establishing venue wherever the firearm is located, or simply criminalized the possession of a firearm that has an altered serial number. However, that is not what the legislature has done, and thus, our holding is faithful to the canon of statutory construction cited by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">For aforementioned reasons, we hold today that the trial court erred in finding venue proper for Bonner\u2019s charge of altering the serial number of a firearm. Therefore, we reverse Bonner\u2019s conviction of that offense, and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings, including trial in a proper venue if the Commonwealth be so advised.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-15\">. Bonner was also convicted of using threatening language over the phone in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-427 and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2; however, those convictions are not before the Court in the instant appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\">. The record is replete with references to the Circle D and \"Davis\u2019s Truck Stop\u201d or the \"Davis Truck Stop.\u201d Apparently, \"Davis's Truck Stop\u201d or the \"Davis Truck Stop\u201d replaced the Circle D, but as it is clear that they are the same location, this opinion will reference the location simply as the Circle D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b257-9\">.

A more accurate construction of <em>Kelso </em>and <em>Gregory, </em>is that the \u201cevil\u201d caused by the criminal actions in those cases occurred where either an element of the offense occurred or where the General Assembly made specific provision for venue to exist. The record in this case supports neither situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\">.
