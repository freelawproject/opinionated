Rideout, III (appellant) entered pleas under <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970) (\u201cAlford pleas\u201d) to twenty counts of possession of child pornography in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence supporting these convictions because appellant claims that the police breached his reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his personal computer\u2014files from which appellant had displayed to the public through peer-to-peer, file-sharing software. We hold that the trial court did not err when it denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, and, accordingly, for the following reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s twenty convictions for possession of child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">We consider the evidence on appeal \u201c \u2018in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as we must since it was the prevailing party\u2019 \u201d in the trial court. <em>Beasley v. Commonwealth, </em>60 Va.App. 381, 391, 728 S.E.2d 499, 504 (2012) (quoting <em>Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 296, 330, 601 S.E.2d 555, 574 (2004)). In this case, Sergeant Stephen Anders of the Bedford County Sheriffs Office (assigned to the Southern Virginia Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force) conducted an authorized, remote undercover investigation into the online sexual exploitation of children on the internet. On August 29, 2011, a certain internet protocol (IP) address of 174.66.3.142 caught his attention. Sergeant Anders suspected that this IP address was involved in the collection and sharing of child pornography. On September 1, 2011, through a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>program called \u201cShareaza LE,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sergeant Anders was able to connect to, and begin downloading, a known file of child pornography from IP address of 174.66.3.142. On September 2, 2011, and on September 4, 2011, Sergeant Anders again was able to connect to the IP address of 174.66.3.142 and begin to download child pornography files.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Sergeant Anders also obtained and submitted an administrative subpoena to Cox Communications, the owner of the IP address at issue. In response to that administrative subpoena, Cox Communications informed Sergeant Anders that the IP address had been issued to Marvin Rideout of New Kent, Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">On December 15, 2011, after verifying that \u201cMarvin Ride-out\u201d was, in fact, the suspect detected by Special Agent Anders, Detective J. McLaughlin, III, of the New Kent County Sheriffs Office, obtained a search warrant for appellant\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Detective McLaughlin executed the search warrant at appellant\u2019s residence on the following morning. When Detective McLaughlin explained to appellant why he was there, appellant put his head down and said, \u201cI have been waiting for y\u2019all to come.\u201d Sergeant Anders then analyzed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>various electronic items seized from appellant\u2019s home, finding many images and movies depicting child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Appellant filed a pre-trial motion to suppress the three files of child pornography giving rise to the search warrant (i.e., the files that Sergeant Anders was able to access on September 1, 2, and 4 of 2011), as well as all of the files found as a result of execution of the search warrant. At the suppression hearing, appellant testified that he had downloaded a software program called \u201cShareaza\u201d somewhere between two and three years prior to the suppression hearing. Shareaza is, according to appellant\u2019s expert Eric Myer, designed to facilitate the sharing of files\u2014\u201cit wants to share.\u201d As Sergeant Anders also explained, with respect to peer-to-peer sharing programs like Shareaza, \u201cthe whole purpose is for everybody to share.\u201d Appellant had previously used a peer-to-peer file sharing program called Limewire for several years prior to downloading Shareaza, so he had several years of experience with peer-to-peer software. Appellant explained that, when he initially downloaded the Shareaza software, he had applied settings that he thought would prevent others from being able to access files on his computer. According to the theory advanced by appellant at the suppression hearing, despite selecting settings on Shareaza to prevent sharing, however, when appellant changed the location of the downloads from the default destination, he inadvertently activated the sharing of that folder without receiving any notification that he was actually sharing files.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, appellant claimed at the suppression hearing that he had been using the Shareaza software under the mistaken impression that he had set up Shareaza in a way that would prevent other users from gaining access to any files on his computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">At the time of the suppression hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel and the Commonwealth stipulated to certain facts, including: (1) that any efforts appellant made to block access to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>computer were ineffective when Sergeant Anders was able to obtain the three child pornography files from appellant\u2019s computer, and (2) that law enforcement \u201cdid not \u2018hack\u2019 or otherwise use nefarious means\u201d to gain access to appellant\u2019s computer, but did so only through a modified version of Shareaza (that was designed to prevent the police from sharing child pornography with others). Appellant argued that he nonetheless had a reasonable expectation of privacy relating to the contents of his personal computer, including the files depicting child pornography, because he contended that he had applied settings to Shareaza that he thought would prevent others from accessing those files on his own computer. In overruling appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-5\">The Court makes the following findings: ... The Court finds that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy when he installed a software program on his computer which has the primary purpose to share information among other computer users. Number two, that the police did not act in an improper manner to obtain information from the defendant\u2019s computer. And therefore the motion to suppress is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Appellant thereafter entered <em>Alford </em>pleas to twenty charges of possessing child pornography, and reserved the right to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u201c[t]he burden is on the defendant to show that the denial of his suppression motion, when the evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was reversible error.\u201d <em>McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 483, 490, 545 S.E.2d 541, 545 (2001) (citing <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980); <em>Weathers v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 652, 658, 529 S.E.2d 847, 850 (2000)). On appeal, we review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards such as whether a defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>permit him to raise a Fourth Amendment challenge to a search.\u201d <em>Sharpe v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 448, 454, 605 S.E.2d 346, 349 (2004) (citing <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>168 F.3d 1222, 1225 (10th Cir.1999)). Furthermore, we are \u201cbound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) (en banc) (quoting <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">A. Whether Appellant Established An Expectation op Privacy</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-7\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no [wjarrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath of affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">\u201cSince <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), the touchstone of [Fourth] Amendment analysis has been the question whether a person has a \u2018constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oliver v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 177, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 1740-41, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984) (quoting <em>Katz, </em>389 U.S. at 360, 88 S.Ct. at 516 (Harlan, J., concurring)). Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-9\">in order to claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment, a defendant must demonstrate that he personally has an expectation of privacy in the place searched, and that his expectation is reasonable; i.e., one that has \u201ca source outside of the Fourth Amendment, either by reference to concepts of real or personal property law or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number><em>Minnesota v. Carter, </em>525 U.S. 83, 88, 119 S.Ct. 469, 472, 142 L.Ed.2d 373 (1998) (quoting <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 143-44 n. 12, 99 S.Ct. 421, 430 n. 12, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978)); <em>see also Smith v. Maryland, </em>442 U.S. 735, 740-41, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 2580-81, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979) (adopting Justice Harlan\u2019s two-prong reasonable expectation of privacy test from his concurrence in <em>Katz, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, which first looks at the person\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy and then considers whether that view is objectively reasonable).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant contends that, given his claim that he disabled the sharing features of Shareaza, he then retained a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his computer and in the files located on his computer that could otherwise be shared via Shareaza.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">In <em>Smith, </em>442 U.S. at 740, 99 S.Ct. at 2580, the United States Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-5\">Consistently with <em>Katz, </em>this Court uniformly has held that the application of the Fourth Amendment depends on whether the person invoking its protection can claim a \u201cjustifiable,\u201d a \u201creasonable,\u201d or a \u201clegitimate expectation of privacy\u201d that has been invaded by government action. [ (Citations omitted).] This inquiry, as Mr. Justice Harlan aptly noted in his <em>Katz </em>concurrence, normally embraces two discrete questions. The first is whether the individual, by his conduct, has \u201cexhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy,\u201d 389 U.S., at 361 [88 S.Ct. at 516]\u2014whether, in the words of the <em>Katz </em>majority, the individual has shown that \u201che seeks to preserve [something] as private.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 351 [88 S.Ct. at 511]. The second question is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>individual\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy is \u201cone that society is prepared to recognize as \u2018reasonable,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 361 [88 S.Ct. at 516]\u2014whether, in the words of the <em>Katz </em>majority, the individual\u2019s expectation, viewed objectively, is \u201cjustifiable\u201d under the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 353 [88 S.Ct. at 512]. [ (Footnote and citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Thus, an individual can claim Fourth Amendment protection under this test only if (1) the individual has a subjective expectation of privacy <em>and </em>(2) the individual has an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy that is justifiable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Even though appellant testified that he was under the impression that he had disabled the sharing feature on Shareaza, the record establishes that appellant actually said to Detective McLaughlin, \u201cI have been waiting for y\u2019all to come.\u201d Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must since it prevailed below, this statement in itself strongly suggests that appellant knew or at least suspected that files from his computer were able to be shared. Indeed, a rational trier of fact assessing the testimony at the suppression hearing could infer from this statement that appellant was aware that he was not the only individual with access to those files due to his installation of the Shareaza program. Certainly, the trial court was not obligated to believe appellant\u2019s self-serving testimony that he believed that he had safeguarded his files containing child pornography from being shared on Shareaza\u2014which, of course, is peer-to-peer software actually <em>designed for the sharing </em>of files over the internet. <em>See Marable v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 505, 509-10, 500 S.E.2d 233, 235 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Here, the trial court expressly found that appellant lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy \u201cwhen he installed a software program on his computer which has the primary purpose to share information among other computer users.\u201d We, like the trial court, find several federal appellate court decisions to be applicable and instructive on this point. \u201c \u2018Although as a general matter an individual has an objectively reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>expectation of privacy in his personal computer, we fail to see how this expectation can survive [appellant\u2019s] decision to install and use file-sharing software, thereby opening his computer to anyone else with the same freely available program.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States, v. Stults, </em>575 F.3d 834, 843 (8th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Ganoe, </em>538 F.3d 1117, 1127 (9th Cir.2008)). Thus, by simply installing file-sharing software onto his computer, appellant has \u201c \u2018failed to demonstrate an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to accept as reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Appellant\u2019s installation of Shareaza presents a situation that is analogous to a person who hands over the keys to his house to a number of friends. That person should not be surprised when some of those friends simply come inside his house without knocking on the door. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Appellant contends, however, that his claimed attempt to apply settings to Shareaza to prevent others from accessing his files depicting child pornography creates an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in those computer files. However, the decision in <em>United States v. Borowy, </em>595 F.3d 1045, 1047 (9th Cir.2010), is highly persuasive on the facts here. In <em>Borowy, </em>the defendant claimed that he had attempted to engage the feature in his version of peer-to-peer file-sharing software that would prevent others from downloading and viewing his files. However, that feature was not actually engaged, and an FBI agent was able to access incriminating files from the defendant\u2019s computer. <em>Id. </em>Concluding that the defendant\u2019s \u201csubjective intention not to share his files did not create an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the face of such widespread public access,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1048, the appellate court affirmed the lower court\u2019s decision to deny the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>Id. </em>at 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Applying the logic in <em>Borowy </em>to this case, therefore, even assuming without deciding that appellant actually had the subjective intention to prevent others from accessing his files, appellant still did <em>not </em>have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in those files, given his decision to install the Shareaza file-sharing program on his computer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>Indeed, appellant installed software on his computer that is specifically designed to share files from one\u2019s own computer with other users of that software. By installing the Shareaza peer-to-peer file sharing software on his computer, appellant assumed the risk that other users of Shareaza\u2014including the police\u2014could readily access those incriminating files that could be shared through Shareaza.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">B. The Exclusionary Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">During oral argument before this Court, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that suppression of the evidence would still be appropriate because it was a police officer who accessed the child pornography files shared from appellant\u2019s computer. However, this case is not one where the suppression of evidence would even serve any of the rationales underlying the purpose of the exclusionary rule. The United States Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-7\">First, the exclusionary rule is not an individual right and applies only where it \u201c \u2018result[s] in appreciable deterrence.\u2019 \u201d We have repeatedly rejected the argument that exclusion is a necessary consequence of a Fourth Amendment violation. Instead we have focused on the efficacy of the rule in deterring Fourth Amendment violations in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-8\">In addition, the benefits of deterrence must outweigh the costs. \u201cWe have never suggested that the exclusionary rule must apply in every circumstance in which it might provide marginal deterrence.\u201d \u201c[T]o the extent that application of the exclusionary rule could provide some incremental deterrent, that possible benefit must be weighed against [its] substantial social costs.\u201d The principal cost of applying the rule is, of course, letting guilty and possibly dangerous defendants go free\u2014something that \u201coffends basic concepts of the criminal justice system.\u201d \u201c[T]he rule\u2019s costly toll upon truth-seeking and law enforcement objectives presents a high obstacle for those urging [its] application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-9\"><em>Herring v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 135, 141, 129 S.Ct. 695, 700-01, 172 L.Ed.2d 496 (2009) (citations omitted); <em>see Hudson v. Michigan, </em>547 U.S. 586, 591, 126 S.Ct. 2159, 2163-64, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>165 L.Ed.2d 56 (2006); <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>60 Va.App. 427, 435-36, 728 S.E.2d 521, 525-26 (2012). <em>See also Davis v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2419, 2426-28, 180 L.Ed.2d 285 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Furthermore, binding case law plainly states, \u201c \u2018The deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule necessarily assumes that the police have engaged in willful, or at the very least negligent, conduct which has deprived the defendant of some right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Knight v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va.App. 297, 311, 734 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2012) (quoting <em>Michigan v. Tucker, </em>417 U.S. 433, 447, 94 S.Ct. 2357, 2365, 41 L.Ed.2d 182 (1974)); <em>see Herring, </em>555 U.S. at 144, 129 S.Ct. at 702 (\u201cAs laid out in our cases, the exclusionary rule serves to deter deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent conduct, or in some circumstances recurring or systemic negligence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">In this case, the police clearly did not engage in any conduct that ought to be deterred through the application of the exclusionary rule. Indeed, as the trial court here correctly found, \u201cthe police did not act in an improper manner to obtain information from the defendant\u2019s computer.\u201d The parties even <em>stipulated </em>that the police \u201cdid not \u2018hack\u2019 or otherwise use nefarious means to gain access to the defendant\u2019s computer, but did so through a modified version of the software that the defendant had downloaded and was using.\u201d Sergeant Anders specifically stated in his affidavit in support of a search warrant of appellant\u2019s residence that the law enforcement version of Shareaza that he had used in his investigation had been modified in a manner so that it \u201celiminate[ed] any potential <em>private intrusion </em>on the suspect IP\u2019s computer or files.\u201d (Emphasis added). Therefore, in other words, the record establishes that, when Sergeant Anders accessed and viewed the child pornography files on appellant\u2019s computer, he did not do so by taking any action that a member of <em>the public </em>could not also have taken in accessing and viewing those files. In this respect, the law enforcement version of Shareaza that Sergeant Anders used was like the version of Shareaza that any member of the public could use, in that it could access any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>files that another Shareaza user had made publicly available\u2014 intentionally or inadvertently\u2014for sharing.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Simply put, by downloading Shareaza, a program <em>designed to facilitate the sharing of files, </em>appellant opened his shared files to any other person\u2014law enforcement or otherwise. Sergeant Anders viewed appellant\u2019s incriminating files (like anyone else using Shareaza could do), and then the police properly obtained and executed a search warrant at appellant\u2019s home, where more incriminating evidence was discovered. On this record, contrary to appellant\u2019s argument on appeal, appellant certainly was not entitled to the suppression of evidence under the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The record establishes that appellant installed file\u2014sharing software onto his computer\u2014the very purpose of which is to share files with other users of the same software. Even though appellant claimed to be under the impression that he had applied settings that would prevent others from accessing his computer files, law enforcement\u2014through a means available to any member of the public\u2014was nonetheless able to access appellant\u2019s files depicting child pornography. In addition, the record establishes that appellant was not surprised when police officers arrived at his residence, remarking that he had even \u201cbeen waiting for y\u2019all [the police] to come.\u201d Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must since it was the prevailing party below, the circumstances here do not establish a reasonable expectation of privacy by appellant in the contents of the incriminating files that appellant actually shared via the Shareaza software\u2014and certainly do not require exclusion of the child pornography seized from appellant\u2019s computer. The trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress that evidence, and, accordingly, we affirm appellant\u2019s twenty convictions for possession of child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-9\">. Appellant had been charged with twenty additional counts of possession of child pornography, one count of distribution of child pornography, and two counts of distribution of child pornography (second or subsequent violation). As part of the conditional plea agreement, the Commonwealth disposed of those remaining charges by <em>nolle prosequi.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b831-7\">. Shareaza is a peer-to-peer sharing program that allows users to trade electronic files, including music, photographic, and video files. Shareaza LE is the law enforcement version of Shareaza which, according to Sergeant Anders, differs from the regular Shareaza in that it does not permit law enforcement to share flies with other users.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b831-8\">. Sergeant Anders prepared an affidavit in support of the application for a search warrant in which he provided the issuing magistrate with an extensive description of peer-to-peer (P2P) software and how computer files are shared and accessed using that software. Sergeant Anders explained, \u201cWhen the P2P software is installed on a computer, the user is directed to specify a 'shared' folder.
