On appeal, appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting this conviction, which arose from appellant\u2019s continued and unauthorized use after May 24, 2011 of a vehicle that she rented from Triangle Rental Car (Triangle). For the following reasons, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">\u201cOn appeal, we consider \u2018the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must since it was the prevailing party\u2019 in the trial court.\u201d <em>Landeck v. Commonwealth, </em>59 Va.App. 744, 748, 722 S.E.2d 643, 645 (2012) (quoting <em>Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 296, 330, 601 S.E.2d 555, 574 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">On May 2, 2011, appellant rented a vehicle from a Triangle branch office located in the City of Chesapeake. It is undisputed that appellant initially rented the vehicle for a one-day period\u2014i.e., the vehicle was originally due back to Triangle on May 3, 2011\u2014and that the rental contract was then verbally extended during telephone conversations that occurred between appellant and Triangle rental agents. The record does not disclose precisely how many extensions were arranged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>over the telephone, although it is clear that the rental period had at one point been extended to May 15, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">On May 17, 2011, Bryan Black, Triangle\u2019s branch manager, sent a certified demand letter to the address appellant had provided to the Triangle rental agent when the rental contract was originally executed on May 2, 2011. Black\u2019s certified demand letter to appellant stated that the vehicle had not been returned by May 15, 2011, which Black indicated was \u201cthe return date required in your rental agreement,\u201d and it instructed appellant to return the vehicle within five days of receipt of the certified letter. Although appellant never actually read the contents of the May 17, 2011 demand letter, she did call Triangle after seeing the corresponding certified mail slip that the postal worker had left her. Black testified at trial that the deadline for appellant to return the rental vehicle was again extended over the telephone after the May 17, 2011 certified demand letter was issued to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Black testified that, according to Triangle\u2019s file, this extension of time that appellant arranged over the telephone with a Triangle rental agent \u201ctook us up to May 24th\u201d\u2014and that Triangle\u2019s file indicated that there were no further extensions of time after May 24, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Furthermore, Black testified that Triangle\u2019s file contained a document that had a portion of a notation that a Triangle rental agent had entered in Triangle\u2019s computer pertaining to a May 23, 2011 telephone conversation with appellant. This particular document was not offered or admitted into the evidence at appellant\u2019s trial, but Black read the partial notation from the witness stand without objection. Black testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As\">[Triangle\u2019s computer] system only shows the first little block of it, but it says, <em>\u201cCustomer says someone will </em>\u201d\u2014so typically when we see that, the rest of it normally is an extension or return or something like that. It\u2019s something about the conclusion of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">(Emphasis added). Thus, according to Black, the notation from the May 23, 2011 telephone conversation between appellant and the Triangle rental agent indicated that appellant (or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u201csomeone\u201d acting on appellant\u2019s behalf) would take some action\u2014either by extending the rental contract or by returning the rental vehicle to Triangle.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">However, Black testified that appellant did not return the vehicle or communicate with Triangle in any way following that telephone conversation for more than two weeks. Moreover, while the record indicates that Triangle received four credit card payments and four cash payments from appellant, Black indicated during his testimony that no payments were received at any point after the May 23, 2011 telephone conversation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">On May 26, 2011, Black sent appellant a second certified demand letter to the same address that appellant had provided when the rental contract was executed on May 2, 2011. Black wrote in the May 26, 2011 demand letter that the vehicle \u201cwas not returned on or before May 24, 2011[,] the return date required in your rental agreement, and still has not been returned as of the date of this letter.\u201d As with the earlier certified demand letter, appellant was instructed in the May 26, 2011 demand letter to return the vehicle within five days of the receipt of the letter. However, Black testified that he received the certified return receipt, bearing the notation \u201cunable to find,\u201d two days later. The vehicle was not returned to the Triangle branch, and no further payments were received. Given that appellant had not communicated with Triangle in any way since the May 23, 2011 telephone conversation, Black testified that he reported to the police that the vehicle had been stolen and swore out a warrant for appellant\u2019s arrest on June 7, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">One day later, on June 8, 2011, a man came to the Triangle branch office while Black was present. Black testified that the man said that he wanted to pay for appellant\u2019s rental vehicle. The man did not have the rental vehicle with him. Black told the man that the vehicle had been reported stolen, that he could not extend the rental contract any further, and that the vehicle needed to be returned at that time. Black testified that the man \u201cmade a few phone calls here and there, back and forth, to different people\u201d and that a second man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>arrived at the Triangle branch a short time later with the rental vehicle. Black also testified that appellant spoke with him in person at some point after the rental vehicle had been returned,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claiming that she had asked \u201cthe first gentleman ... to come up and extend the rental\u201d at the Triangle branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Testifying in her own defense, appellant claimed that she believed that Triangle had agreed to extend the contract beyond May 24, 2011\u2014although she admitted that she had no documentation or telephone call reference number supporting this assertion. She also testified that, because she could not come to the Triangle branch during its business hours due to her work schedule, she gave money to her then-boyfriend (whom she identified at trial only as \u201cTerrance\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>understanding that he would go to the Triangle branch to pay for her continued use of the rental vehicle. Appellant testified that she was unaware that payments were not being made to Triangle, that she never received notice of the May 26, 2011 certified demand letter, and that she believed \u201ceverything was fine\u201d until she learned that the car had been reported as being stolen and that a warrant had been issued for her arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Rejecting the assertion by appellant\u2019s counsel that appellant lacked fraudulent intent, the trial court convicted appellant under Code \u00a7 18.2-117, explaining that \u201cthe Commonwealth has met its burden as to the requirements and the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">When considering the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, \u201ca reviewing court does not \u2018ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crowder v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 658, 663, 588 S.E.2d 384, 387 (2003) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). \u201cViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must since it was the prevailing party in the trial court,\u201d <em>Riner, </em>268 Va. at 330, 601 S.E.2d at 574, \u201c[w]e must instead ask whether <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,\u2019\u201d <em>Crowder, </em>41 Va.App. at 663, 588 S.E.2d at 387 (quoting <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 257, 584 S.E.2d 444, 447 (2003) <em>(en banc)). See also Maxwell v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 437, 442, 657 S.E.2d 499, 502 (2008). \u201cThis familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>A. The Appropriate Intent Element Under Code \u00a7 18.2-117</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Appellant\u2019s assignment of error alleges that the trial court erred in finding her guilty under Code \u00a7 18.2-117<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cbecause the evidence was insufficient to prove that [appellant] <em>had the intent to never return the vehicle, </em>but rather had thought that the rental [vehicle] had been paid for.\u201d (Emphasis added). On brief, the Attorney General contends that appellant\u2019s assignment of error is based on an incorrect premise\u2014to the extent that it asserts that the evidence failed to prove that she \u201chad the intent to never return the vehicle.\u201d We agree with the Attorney General\u2019s contention, given that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ketchum v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 258, 403 S.E.2d 382 (1991), is controlling on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In <em>Ketchum, </em>this Court expressly held that \u201cproof of intent to permanently deprive the owner of his or her property is not required to sustain a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-117.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, 403 S.E.2d at 383; <em>see also Evans v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 292, 297, 308 S.E.2d 126, 129 (1983) (holding that the intent to permanently deprive the owner of his or her property is not an element of embezzlement under Code \u00a7 18.2-111). Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Maye v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 48, 189 S.E.2d 350 (1972), this Court explained in <em>Ketchum </em>that \u201cCode \u00a7 18.2-117 does not codify the common law crime of larceny but rather creates a statutory offense for failing to return the property in accordance with the terms of the [rental] agreement.\u201d <em>Ketchum, </em>12 Va.App. at 262, 403 S.E.2d at 384; <em>see also Commonwealth v. Hensley, </em>7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Va.App. 468, 471, 375 S.E.2d 182, 183 (1988) (same). \u201c[Because Code \u00a7 18.2-117 is a statutory, not a common law crime,\u201d proof of the defendant\u2019s intent to permanently deprive the owner of the bailed property (or proof of the defendant\u2019s intent \u201cto never return\u201d the bailed property) simply is not a required element under that statute. <em>Ketchum, </em>12 Va.App. at 262, 403 S.E.2d at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In fact, the plain language of Code \u00a7 18.2-117 does not reflect that this offense requires <em>any </em>intent at all on the defendant\u2019s part. <em>See United States v. Parker, </em>522 F.2d 801, 803 (4th Cir.1975) (\u201cNowhere in that statute, however, is there an explicit requirement of criminal intent.\u201d); <em>see also Ketchum, </em>12 Va.App. at 262, 403 S.E.2d at 384 (explaining that the text of Code \u00a7 18.2-117 \u201cimposes an absolute duty on [the defendant] to return the rental car to its owner at the time and place stipulated by the rental agreement\u201d). \u201cHowever, the Supreme Court has held that Code \u00a7 18.2-117 implicitly requires proof of an element of <em>mens rea </em>or <em>scienter, </em>even though the requirement does not appear in the statute.\u201d <em>Molash v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 243, 246, 348 S.E.2d 868, 870 (1986). In prior decisions interpreting and applying Code \u00a7 18.2-117, this Court has observed that \u201c[t]he necessity of proving <em>fraudulent </em>intent\u201d has been \u201cmade clear\u201d by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original); <em>see also Ketchum, </em>12 Va.App. at 262, 403 S.E.2d at 384 (holding that \u201c[i]t was not error for the trial court to instruct as to fraudulent intent\u201d at a trial where the defendant was prosecuted under Code \u00a7 18.2-117).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>On brief, the Attorney General does not dispute that a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-117 \u201cimplicitly requires fraudulent intent\u201d under binding case law interpreting that statute. Accordingly, we now address appellant\u2019s argument that the evidence failed to prove the required fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">B. Fraudulent Intent Proven Here</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">A person acts with fraudulent intent when that person acts \u201cwith an evil intent, or with the specific intent to deceive or trick.\u201d <em>Burrell v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 72, 86, 646 S.E.2d 35, 42 (2007). Such intent \u201cmay, and often must, be inferred from the facts and circumstances in a particular case,\u201d <em>Ridley v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 834, 836, 252 S.E.2d 313, 314 (1979), including \u201cthe conduct and representations of the defendant,\u201d <em>Norman v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 518, 519, 346 S.E.2d 44, 45 (1986). The question of intent typically rests with the finder of fact. <em>Nobles v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 548, 551, 238 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u201cThe Commonwealth always has the burden of proving the culpable state of mind, \u2018and this burden never shifts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walshaw v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 103, 118, 603 S.E.2d 633, 640 (2004) (quoting <em>Hodge v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 338, 342, 228 S.E.2d 692, 695 (1976)). However, \u201cthe Due Process Clause does not prohibit the use of a permissive inference as a procedural device that shifts to a defendant the burden of producing some evidence contesting a fact that may otherwise be inferred, provided that the prosecution retains the ultimate burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Dobson v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 71, 74-75, 531 S.E.2d 569, 571 (2000). Consistent with these principles, Code \u00a7 18.2-117 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\"><em>The failure to return </em>to the bailor such animal, aircraft, vehicle, boat or vessel, <em>within five days </em>from the time the bailee has agreed in writing to return the same shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of larceny by such bailee of such animal, aircraft, vehicle, boat or vessel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>(Emphasis added). Therefore, this Court held in <em>Ketchum, </em>12 Va.App. at 262, 403 S.E.2d at 384, \u201cFailure to abide by the terms of the written agreement within five days of the due date creates a <em>prima facie </em>case of fraudulent intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In this case, appellant does not dispute that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established the permissive inference of fraudulent intent afforded under Code \u00a7 18.2-117 based on her failure to return the vehicle within five days of May 24, 2011.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, she contends that her testimony at trial served to rebut the <em>\u201cprima facie </em>evidence\u201d established under that statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At trial, appellant claimed that she believed that she and the Triangle branch had an arrangement that she could continue using the rental vehicle as long as she paid for the vehicle. She also claimed that she had given money to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>then-boyfriend for the purpose of paying Triangle for the continued use of the rental vehicle. She testified that she thought that her then-boyfriend was actually paying Triangle with this money and that she was entitled to keep using the vehicle after May 24, 2011.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">While appellant acknowledges that the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth (as the prevailing party below), appellant argues on brief that her testimony at trial \u201cshould be taken as accurate since the logical flow of the [Commonwealth\u2019s] evidence does not contradict [or] discredit her statements.\u201d However, appellant essentially asks this Court to substitute its own judgment for that of the factfinder\u2014which an appellate court simply should not and cannot do. <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 94, 105, 688 S.E.2d 168, 175 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Under settled principles, \u201c[t]he fact finder, who has the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses, has the sole responsibility to determine their credibility, the weight to be given their testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Taylor, </em>256 Va. 514, 518, 506 S.E.2d 312, 314 (1998). Furthermore, \u201c[i]n its role of judging witness credibility, the fact finder is entitled to disbelieve the self-serving testimony of the accused and to conclude that the accused is lying to conceal h[er] guilt.\u201d <em>Marable v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 505, 509-10, 500 S.E.2d 233, 235 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In <em>Sullivan v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 672, 701 S.E.2d 61 (2010), the Supreme Court addressed the deference that is appropriately reserved for the factfinder, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Appellate courts defer to the findings of fact made by a jury or a trial judge at a bench trial if there is evidence to support them and will not set a judgment aside unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong. Code \u00a7 8.01-680. That deference applies not only to findings of fact, but <em>also to any reasonable and justified inferences the fact-finder may have drawn from the facts proved.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 676, 701 S.E.2d at 63-64 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In this case, while there is no dispute that appellant\u2019s rental contract was verbally extended during telephone conversations that occurred between appellant and Triangle rental agents prior to May 24, 2011, the evidence established that these extensions were not open-ended or unconditional. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must since it was the prevailing party below, this course of conduct between appellant and Triangle required appellant to <em>communicate </em>with Triangle to arrange for a later return date\u2014and, of course, to pay Triangle for her continued use of the rental vehicle. Thus, the trial court certainly was not required to accept appellant\u2019s testimony that she believed that Triangle permitted her just \u201cto keep the car\u201d after May 24, 2011\u2014without actually talking to a Triangle rental agent on the telephone and obtaining further extensions of the rental contract (as she had done prior to May 24, 2011). In other words, contrary to the assertion made in appellant\u2019s assignment of error, the trial court was not required to find that appellant \u201chad thought that the rental [vehicle] had been paid for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In support of this conclusion, a rational factfinder could reasonably infer appellant\u2019s intent from the evidence of how differently appellant communicated with Triangle through May 23, 2011\u2014as opposed to after that date. We observe from the record several instances of communication between appellant and Triangle from May 2, 2011 (when the vehicle was rented) until May 23, 2011 (when appellant\u2019s last telephone conversation with a Triangle rental agent occurred). During that period of time, appellant rented the vehicle, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>arranged with Triangle for at least two extensions of the rental period (first to May 15, 2011 and then to May 24, 2011), and made several credit card and cash payments for the vehicle. By contrast, from May 24, 2011 (when the vehicle was ultimately required to be returned) until June 8, 2011 (when the vehicle was finally returned), the record reflects only radio silence. During that period of time, the record indicates that appellant never contacted Triangle at all. In addition, the second certified demand letter was returned to Triangle because appellant was unable to be found. Furthermore, no payments for the rental vehicle were received by Triangle.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Thus, the trial court was able to infer that appellant\u2019s complete lack of <em>any </em>communication with Triangle between May 24, 2011 and June 8, 2011 was consistent with the permissive inference of appellant\u2019s fraudulent intent\u2014which was already established by appellant\u2019s failure to return the vehicle within five days of its final due date to be returned of May 24, 2011. <em>See Ketchum, </em>12 Va.App. at 262, 403 S.E.2d at 384. Therefore, on this record, a rational factfinder could conclude that appellant failed to return bailed property, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-117.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Appellant does not contest that the Commonwealth established <em>\u201cprima facie </em>evidence\u201d in this case under Code \u00a7 18.2-117, given that she did not return the rental vehicle within five days of May 24, 2011. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth (as we must since it prevailed below), a rational factfinder could conclude that appellant failed to rebut the permissive inference of fraudulent intent that is afforded under that statute. A rational factfinder could also conclude that the Commonwealth satisfied its ultimate burden of proving appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction for failing to return bailed property under Code \u00a7 18.2-117.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-6\">. The evidence admitted at trial included the final invoice that Black prepared when the vehicle was returned on June 8, 2011. The invoice indicated that the vehicle had been driven 6,209 miles over a five-week, two-day period. The total cost of the rental was $2,506.91. In addition to the initial charge of $133.43 (representing the original one-day rental and a deposit fee), three additional charges of $83.42 had been applied to appellant\u2019s VISA card. Furthermore, prior to the return of the vehicle, Triangle received cash payments of $127, $300, $130, and $540. However, the final invoice indicated that appellant owed Triangle an outstanding balance of $1,026.22. Triangle had not received any of that balance owed by the time of appellant's trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b324-7\">. Terrance did not testify at trial, and no evidence established that any of the cash payments that were made on appellant\u2019s account with Triangle prior to May 24, 2011 were made by anyone other than appellant. Furthermore, appellant never testified how much money Terrance was supposed to pay Triangle on May 24, 2011 or any date thereafter. Black testified that he \"was told [by appellant] that the first gentleman [who arrived at the Triangle branch] had her money to do the extension\u201d for the rental vehicle on June 8, 2011. However, nothing in the record indicates how much money the \"first gentleman\u201d intended to pay Triangle at that time, whether this amount would have been sufficient to extend the rental contract (even if, of course, the vehicle had not already been reported as stolen), or whether this \"first gentleman\u201d was even Terrance. Appellant also testified that, after she learned that Terrance had not paid Triangle with the money she gave him, she was assaulted by Terrance after she tried to reclaim that money. She testified that Terrance had been charged in another locality with assault and battery, and her counsel stated at appellant\u2019s sentencing hearing that Terrance had been convicted of that offense. However, the record contains no evidence corroborating these claims\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>and the trial court found that appellant\u2019s testimony on this subject was not \u201crelative to the terms\u201d of the offense of failing to return bailed property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-117 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">If any person comes into the possession as bailee of any animal, aircraft, vehicle, boat or vessel, and <em>fail to return </em>the same to the bailor, <em>in accordance with the bailment agreement, he shall be deemed guilty of larceny thereof </em>and receive the same punishment, according to the value of the thing stolen, prescribed for the punishment of the larceny of goods and chattels. The failure to return to the bailor such animal, aircraft, vehicle, boat or vessel, within five days from the time the bailee has agreed in writing to return the same shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of larceny by such bailee of such animal, aircraft, vehicle, boat or vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b327-6\">. The Supreme Court in <em>Maye </em>addressed an assertion that the statute now codified as Code \u00a7 18.2-117 was unconstitutional and that \"the failure of the statute to require <em>mens rea </em>or <em>scienter </em>[was] fatal.\" <em>Maye, </em>213 Va. at 49, 189 S.E.2d at 351. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, holding that \"such requirement will be read into the statute by the court when it appears the legislature implicitly intended that it must be proved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Interpreting its holding in <em>Maye, </em>the Supreme Court later indicated that \"proof of an intent to defraud\u201d is \"an essential element of the offense\u201d codified in Code \u00a7 18.2-117. <em>Makarov v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 381, 385-86, 228 S.E.2d 573, 576 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b329-6\">. Under the original terms of the rental contract, appellant was required to return the vehicle to Triangle one day after she rented it\u2014on May 3, 2011. Triangle, in its discretion, then permitted appellant to extend the contract verbally during telephone conversations with its rental agents. However, Black testified without objection that Triangle\u2019s file indicated that the final extension of time expired on May 24, 2011. Furthermore, the record contains Black\u2019s second certified demand letter, which was mailed to appellant's address of record on May 26, 2011. That letter specifically states, \u201c[T]he vehicle that you rented was not returned on or before <em>May 24, 2011 </em>[,] <em>the return date required in your rental agreement, </em>and still has not been returned as of the date of this letter.\u201d (Emphasis added). It is undisputed that the rental vehicle was not returned until June 8, 2011\u2014far more than five days after the vehicle was supposed to be returned. Furthermore, while appellant testified that she was unaware of the May 26, 2011 certified demand letter, we observe that the defendant\u2019s knowledge of a certified demand letter is not necessary for establishing <em>prima facie </em>evidence under the plain language of Code \u00a7 18.2-117\u2014which does not even require the owner of the bailed property to send a demand letter at all. Thus, appellant concedes on brief that the circumstances here \u201dcreat[ed] <em>the prima faci[e] </em>evidence\u201d that the factfinder is permitted to infer under Code \u00a7 18.2-117.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\">. Given appellant\u2019s concession that the Commonwealth established a <em>prima facie </em>case under Code \u00a7 18.2-117, her reliance on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Molash </em>is misplaced. As this Court explained in <em>Molash, </em>the \"portion of the statute establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case [was] not applicable\u201d there because the Commonwealth in that case failed to establish the existence of an agreement actually specifying when the defendants were required to return their employer's vehicle. <em>Molash, </em>3 Va.App. at 244, 348 S.E.2d at 869.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\">.
