(employer) appeals an award of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (commission) that required employer to pay for medical treatment to Wilbur N. Mease (claimant) relating to his traumatic brain injury. Employer contends the prior commission award approving the parties\u2019 agreement to pay benefits covered only \u201chead trauma\u201d and, thus, any claim regarding a traumatic brain injury is barred by the statute of limitations. Employer further argues the commission erred in imposing sanctions against employer for defending the instant claim without reasonable grounds. We hold credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s findings that (1) the scope of the original award included claimant\u2019s traumatic brain injury, thereby obligating employer to pay for the attendant medical treatment; and (2) employer defended claimant\u2019s claim without reasonable grounds, thereby justifying the imposition of attorney\u2019s fees against employer. Accordingly, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">On appeal from the commission, \u201cwe review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.\u201d <em>R.G. Moore Bldg. Corp. v. Mullins, </em>10 Va.App. 211, 212, 390 S. E.2d 788, 788 (1990). So viewed, the evidence establishes that on January 29, 2004, claimant fell at work and sustained a compensable injury. The parties endorsed an agreement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>pay benefits form<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that provided temporary total wage compensation and identified claimant\u2019s injury as \u201chead trauma.\u201d The commission issued a June 28, 2004 order that approved the agreement to pay benefits and awarded claimant lifetime medical benefits \u201cfor reasonable, necessary and authorized medical treatment causally related to the 1/29/2004 injury.\u201d Claimant saw numerous doctors following his accident and received payment from employer and its insurance carrier for treatment relating to his compensable injuries until 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">On March 10, 2011, claimant informed his treating physician, Dr. Patrick McGowan, that he had to decrease the number of physical therapy sessions from six per week to three per week. Henry Mease, claimant\u2019s brother and authorized attorney in fact, testified that the carrier\u2019s claims representative informed claimant in a telephone call that his physical therapy would be reduced because six sessions per week were too expensive. On May 20, 2011, claimant filed a claim requesting that employer provide physical therapy six times per week rather than three times weekly. Claimant attached two doctor\u2019s notes that recommended increased physical therapy and opined that claimant\u2019s health problems were related to his traumatic brain injury. Dr. McGowan indicated that the reduction in physical therapy sessions left claimant \u201cweaker and not as functional,\u201d and Dr. James Wilson confirmed that the reduction in physical therapy had led to \u201cincreased problems with balance and activity tolerance\u201d that had resulted in two ground level falls in the previous two weeks. Employer defended on the grounds that the treatment sought was not causally related to the compensable injury, was not reasonable or necessary, and was excessive and costly.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The deputy commissioner held that in \u201cthe absence of any conflicting advice from another physician, either by record review or personal evaluation,\u201d \u201cthe medical evidence clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>indicates the connection between the need for six days of physical therapy and [claimant\u2019s] compensable injuries.\u201d The deputy commissioner therefore awarded claimant temporary total disability compensation benefits and ordered that claimant be allowed to resume the six days of physical therapy per week as prescribed by his treating physicians. Regarding claimant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees, the deputy commissioner noted that employer \u201cobtained no medical information on [its] own\u201d and \u201cfailed to introduce any evidence to substantiate [its] defense.\u201d The deputy commissioner therefore held the \u201clack of effort in presenting any defense, in the face of two uncontradicted referrals from treating physicians, dictates the finding[ ] that the claim had been defended without reasonable grounds[,]\u201d and ordered employer to pay attorney\u2019s fees to claimant pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-713(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">On review to the commission, employer argued for the first time that claimant\u2019s claim for medical treatment relating to his brain injury was barred by the statute of limitations. The commission held that under its authority to interpret its own award orders, the agreement to pay benefits did not provide \u201ca reasonably definite medical diagnosis\u201d when it referred only to \u201chead trauma.\u201d The commission therefore looked to extrinsic evidence to give meaning to the intent of the parties. Specifically, the commission noted that employer \u201cwas well aware of the claimant\u2019s brain injury at the time it prepared the agreement,\u201d and accepted responsibility for the cost of treating the brain injury. Thus, the commission held employer\u2019s course of conduct demonstrated that the original award encompassed claimant\u2019s brain injury. The unanimous commission also affirmed the award of attorney\u2019s fees. The commission rejected employer\u2019s assertion that it presented a valid statute of limitations defense because it did not assert that defense to the deputy commissioner. Further, of the three defenses employer did present, the commission noted that employer offered no evidence to support its assertions that the requested treatment was unreasonable, unnecessary, and excessive.

Employer concedes that claimant suffered a traumatic brain injury and head trauma as a result of his January 29, 2004 industrial accident. However, employer argues the statute of limitations bars an award for medical benefits for the traumatic brain injury because such an injury did not fall within the scope of the original timely-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>filed agreement to pay benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Employer asserts that the original agreement to pay benefits covered only a \u201chead injury\u201d and that claimant failed to file a claim to add coverage of a traumatic brain injury to the scope of the award. Employer concludes that the May 20, 2011 request for increased therapy sessions was therefore untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">An employee must assert against his employer \u201cany claim that he might have for any injury growing out of the accident\u201d within the two-year statute of limitations period found in Code \u00a7 65.2-601. <em>Shawley v.

Prods., </em>18 Va.App. 18, 20, 441 S.E.2d 349, 350 (1994). The question of \u201c[w]hether a claim is barred by the statute of limitations is a question of law[,]\u201d which \u201c[t]his Court \u2018reviews <em>... de novo.\u2019 \u201d Tuck v.

However, \u201c[w]hether the information filed with the commission is sufficient to constitute a timely filed claim for a particular injury is a question of fact [that] ... will not be disturbed on appeal if supported by credible evidence.\u201d <em>Corporate Res.

Evidence relevant to interpreting the scope of the award includes whether the claimant \u201cfile[d] a formal claim listing [the disputed] injuries ... prior to expiration of the statute of limitations\u201d and whether the medical records contained \u201cany mention of injury to those body parts ... prior to expiration of the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Southers, </em>51 Va.App. at 129, 655 S.E.2d at 39. In addition, \u201cwe look not only to the express words of the agreement, but to extrinsic evidence and to employer\u2019s actual knowledge regarding the type of injury.\u201d <em>Tyco Elecs. v. VanPelt, </em>62 Va.App. 160, 173, 743 S.E.2d 293, 300 (2013); <em>see Boxley v. Onorato, </em>218 Va. 931, 936, 243 S.E.2d 201, 204 (1978) (affirming the commission\u2019s order that expanded the parties\u2019 original agreement where the supplemental agreement, while not expressly mentioning additional injuries, incorporated by reference a physician\u2019s note that described injuries to the claimant\u2019s neck and back). We hold credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">First, the undisputed medical evidence establishes employer had timely notice that claimant suffered a traumatic brain injury during his January 29, 2004 industrial accident. The accident report indicates claimant was discovered lying on the floor having vomited multiple times and with blood draining from his left ear. Claimant was immediately admitted to the hospital where he was diagnosed as having a \u201cleft subdural hematoma with minimal midline shift, as well as a left temporal parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage and left temporal contusions.\u201d On March 24, 2004, claimant, who was still hospitalized, informed employer that because of his injuries, he had authorized his siblings to make medical decisions on his behalf. The medical note accompanying this notice explicitly stated claimant \u201csustained a <em>TBI (traumatic brain injury) </em>on 1/29/04\u201d and was \u201cundergoing inpatient rehabilitation for functionary and cognitive deficits resulting from this injury.\u201d (Emphasis added). Employer was therefore clearly on notice of the scope of claimant\u2019s injuries when it endorsed the May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>27, 2004 agreement to pay benefits that provided wage compensation and medical benefits for claimant\u2019s \u201chead trauma.\u201d Moreover, the voluminous record contains hundreds of pages of medical reports that consistently indicate claimant \u201chad a traumatic brain injury in approximately January 2004, as a result of a fall.\u201d Thus, ample evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that employer had sufficient notice that claimant\u2019s head trauma included traumatic brain injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Further, employer\u2019s conduct since claimant\u2019s accident supports the commission\u2019s finding that the agreement to pay benefits extended to claimant\u2019s traumatic brain injury. Beginning April 19, 2004, claimant enrolled in a rehabilitation program to improve his cognitive, memory, and balance dysfunction. On November 20, 2007, claimant requested \u201ca case manager to assist him in connection with medical care that is necessary secondary to [his] traumatic brain injury.\u201d A letter from Dr. David McLeod, claimant\u2019s attending physician, dated October 26, 2007, supported the application. In addition, on October 4, 2010, claimant filed a hearing request to compel employer to pay for a sleep test for \u201cinsomnia and possible sleep apnea in connection with [claimant\u2019s] traumatic brain injury.\u201d Claimant enclosed a September 7, 2010 letter from Dr. Alan R. Towne, another of claimant\u2019s attending physicians, who opined that claimant\u2019s sleep problems were causally related to his January 29, 2004 traumatic brain injury. The claim form listed the nature of claimant\u2019s injury as \u201cMULTIPLE INJURIES, INCLUDING HEAD AND BRAIN INJURY.\u201d The record discloses that employer paid for all of these procedures and did not object to claimant\u2019s characterization of his compensable injury. In fact, employer\u2019s insurance carrier filed a response to the October 4, 2010 request indicating that \u201c[although not specific, the carrier agrees to the sleep study as recommended by Dr. Towne since he has related the condition to the January 29, 2004 work related injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Not only did employer pay for these medical treatments, it did not object when given the opportunity to do so. The medical provider filed numerous applications seeking payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>from employer for medical care linking claimant\u2019s sleep apnea to his traumatic brain injury. The commission, in ruling for the medical provider, noted that because employer paid a portion of the disputed charges and failed to raise any other defenses, the only issue before the commission was whether the medical treatment provided was reasonable. In other words, employer was provided multiple opportunities in the subsequent seven years in which it could have objected to paying for medical treatment associated with claimant\u2019s traumatic brain injury. Its failure to do so constitutes compelling extrinsic evidence that the agreement to pay benefits was intended to cover all medical treatments associated with claimant\u2019s traumatic brain injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Contrary to employer\u2019s argument, the term \u201chead trauma,\u201d as used in the accident report and agreement to pay benefits is ambiguous. \u201cTrauma\u201d refers to any \u201cwound, especially] one caused by sudden physical injury.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary </em>1201 (3d ed. 2008). In the abstract, this definition does not provide any clarity as to the extent of claimant\u2019s injuries\u2014i.e., whether the wounds were superficial lacerations or something more serious. Indeed, employer does not suggest what other kinds of head injuries claimant could have suffered. Claimant was found vomiting and bleeding from his ear. To suggest that cognitive dysfunction or internal hemorrhaging could emanate from some head injury separate from severe brain trauma defies common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Employer relies on <em>Johnson v. Paul Johnson Plastering, </em>37 Va.App. 716, 561 S.E.2d 40 (2002), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>265 Va. 237, 576 S.E.2d 447 (2003), to argue claimant\u2019s \u201cfiling for \u2018head\u2019 injury was not a sufficient filing for injury to the brain\u201d and that \u201cthe terms \u2018head\u2019 and \u2018brain\u2019 are not synonymous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 719, 723, 561 S.E.2d at 42, 44. Although we held in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>Johnson </em>that \u201c[u]se of the single word \u2018head,\u2019 generally is not sufficient filing of a claim for [an] injury to the brain,\u201d we explicitly applied that rationale \u201cwhere the only evidence to suggest this type of injury [wa]s a <em>minor </em>laceration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725, 561 S.E.2d at 45 (emphasis added). In fact, we unequivocally qualified that \u201c[w]e d[id] not intend to establish a bright line rule for other cases. In the appropriate context, a listing of \u2018head injury\u2019 may be sufficient to provide notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725 n. 6, 561 S.E.2d at 45 n. 6. The claimant in <em>Johnson </em>suffered a broken wrist and a laceration to his eyebrow. The claimant did not receive medical treatment for his head laceration, and the agreement to pay benefits mentioned only an injury to the claimant\u2019s arm. We held that under those facts, nothing in the record provided notice to the employer that an injury to the brain might be included in the claim because none of the documents\u2014the initial claim letter, the medical reports, the agreement to pay benefits, or the settlement letter\u2014indicated a possible brain injury. <em>Id. </em>at 726, 561 S.E.2d at 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">In stark contrast, the evidence in this case provides sufficient notice that claimant suffered injuries related to the brain. Claimant was found vomiting and bleeding from his left ear. The claimant in <em>Johnson </em>suffered a minor head laceration. Claimant received immediate medical treatment for symptoms related to a traumatic brain injury. The claimant in <em>Johnson </em>received no immediate medical care for his head laceration. Claimant displayed cognitive deficits and memory dysfunction immediately after his accident. The claimant in <em>Johnson </em>did not display cognitive defects that could possibly have been related to his accident until five years had passed. In sum, the facts in <em>Johnson </em>are wholly inapposite to the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The record here contains ample evidence that employer had notice that claimant suffered a traumatic brain injury and paid for medical procedures to treat that injury without objection. In light of this information, employer cannot plausibly claim that the May 20, 2011 request for the resumption of six physical therapy sessions per week \u201cseriously handicap[ped] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>[it] in determining whether or not there was in fact an injury, the nature and extent thereof, and if related to the accident.\u201d <em>Shawley, </em>216 Va. at 446, 219 S.E.2d at 853. The evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that the agreement to pay benefits included claimant\u2019s traumatic brain injury, and employer is required to pay for six physical therapy sessions per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">SANCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Employer next argues the commission erred in awarding claimant attorney\u2019s fees against employer. Employer contends that when it defended against claimant\u2019s May 20, 2011 request for increased physical therapy sessions, it did so on the basis that such treatment was not causally related to the compensable injury\u2014to wit, the \u201chead trauma.\u201d Employer maintains that this was a reasonable defense that was well-supported by case law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Code \u00a7 65.2-713(A) grants the commission the authority to assess against employer \u201cthe whole cost of these proceedings\u201d \u201cincluding a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d if it finds that the \u201cproceedings have been brought, prosecuted, or defended without reasonable grounds.\u201d \u201c[W]hether the employer defended a proceeding without reasonable grounds is to be judged from the perspective of the employer, not the employee.\u201d <em>Lynchburg Foundry Co. v. Goad, </em>15 Va.App. 710, 716, 427 S.E.2d 215, 219 (1993).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">If an employer refuses to pay a claim, reasonably believing that it is not compensable, and in the course of its investigation the grounds for refusal are not so contradicted as to be shown unfounded, then the subsequent defense is reasonable, even if it is later proven misplaced or in error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADT\"><em>Volvo White Truck Corp. v. Hedge, </em>1 Va.App. 195, 201, 336 S.E.2d 903, 907 (1985). \u201cThe decision to assess fees or costs rests in the sound discretion of the commission and will be reversed only for an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Va. Polytech</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>nic Inst. v. Posada, </em>47 Va.App. 150, 159, 622 S.E.2d 762, 767 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The evidence in this case supports the commission\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees against employer. After consistently paying for medical treatment for claimant\u2019s traumatic brain injury for seven years, employer unilaterally reduced the number of physical therapy sessions related to the same brain injury for which it was willing to pay. Employer offered no medical evidence to support its contentions that the requested treatment was not causally related to claimant\u2019s compensable injury or was unreasonable; claimant, by contrast, submitted two doctor\u2019s notes that indicated the reduction in physical therapy exacerbated claimant\u2019s difficulties with his motor skills and balance and recommended the resumption of six physical therapy sessions per week. <em>See Hedge, </em>1 Va.App. at 201, 336 S.E.2d at 907 (receiving \u201cconflicting expert medical opinions as to the cause of [a work-related injury]\u201d may create reasonable \u201cdoubt [as to] the compensability of the claim\u201d). Notably, employer asserts on brief that it originally defended the claim on \u201ccoverage grounds,\u201d which it claims is a \u201cwinning defense.\u201d Yet, employer abandoned that defense on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Employer\u2019s failure to offer conflicting medical evidence or evidence that the physical therapy sessions were excessive in light of two uncontradicted referrals from treating physicians supports the commission\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees against employer under Code \u00a7 65.2-713(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"A6\">Claimant requests an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in the course of this appeal.

Second, credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s decision to award claimant attorney\u2019s fees against employer. Because employer has not presented any reasonable ground for defense on appeal, we remand the matter to the commission to assess against employer reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-6\">.

The parties endorsed a new agreement to pay benefits on May 27, 2004, which corrected claimant\u2019s average weekly wage. For purposes of this opinion, we refer to the corrected agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-6\">. The record does not contain claimant's initial claim for benefits due to the loss of several files during the proceedings before the commission. However, the parties agree that the agreement to pay benefits, which was filed within the two-year time limitation of Code \u00a7 65.2-601, operates as a valid claim for benefits. <em>See Fairfax Cnty. Sch. Bd. v. Humphrey, </em>41 Va.App. 147, 157, 583 S.E.2d 65, 69 (2003) (holding that a filing meets the basic requirements of the Act for a claim for benefits where the underlying information conforms to Commission Rule 1.1(A)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\">. Although \u201cthe voluntary payment of medical bills by a carrier d[oes] not operate as a matter of law to toll the two-year limitation,\u201d <em>Clark v. United Airlines, </em>223 Va. 197, 200, 288 S.E.2d 441, 442 (1982), that rationale does not apply in the present case where the claimant has timely filed a claim and the only issue is the scope of the injuries included in the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\">. Employer initially defended against claimant's claim before the deputy commissioner on the grounds that the treatment sought was not causally related to the compensable injury, was not reasonable or necessary, and was excessive and costly. On review by the commission, employer argued for the first time that claimant\u2019s claim for medical treatment relating to his brain injury was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
