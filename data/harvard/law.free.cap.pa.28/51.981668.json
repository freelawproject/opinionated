The words \u201crelatives,\u201d \u201cnext of kin,\u201d and \u201c heirs\u201d by themselves would not include these parties. But there are many exceptions to this rule, which may all be classed under this leading principle \u2014 that where the testator has fixed a certain test by which those intended to be comprehended under one of these terms can be ascertained, his intention must prevail although some of the parties are not within the statute of distributions. A reference to the principal cases will illustrate the rule as stated, and show the unanimity of judicial sentiment upon this point: Lewis <em>v. </em>Fisher, 2 <em>Yeates </em>196; McNeilledge <em>v. </em>Galbreath, 8 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>45; McNeilledge <em>v. </em>Barclay, 11 <em>S &amp; R. </em>103; Stover <em>v. </em>Wheatley, 1 <em>Barr </em>506; Baskin\u2019s Appeal, 3 <em>Barr </em>304; Heck <em>v. </em>Clippinger, 5 <em>Id. </em>385; Eichelberger\u2019s Estate, <em>Id. </em>264. In all these cases it is conceded, that if other parts of the will should show an intention to extend the signification of the term employed beyond its strict legal acceptation, the testator\u2019s intention would be carried out.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-23\">Turning to the English cases the rule is equally clear: Parsons <em>v. </em>Parsons, 1 <em>Ves. jr. </em>266; Wilkinson <em>v. </em>Adams, 1 <em>Ves. &amp;. </em>422; Beachcroft <em>v. </em>Beachcroft, 1 <em>Madd. </em>430; Bayley <em>v. </em>Snel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>ham, 1 <em>Sim. &amp; S. </em>78; Meredith <em>v. </em>Farr, 2 <em>Yo. &amp; C. </em>525; Gill <em>v. </em>Shelly, 1 <em>Russ. &amp; M. </em>336; Garrick <em>v. </em>Lord Camden, 14 <em>Ves. </em>372; Owen <em>v. </em>Bryant, 13 <em>Eng. L. E. R. </em>217; Evans <em>v. </em>Davies, 7 <em>Hare </em>498; Hart <em>v. </em>Tribe, 19 <em>Eng. L. &amp; E. R. </em>564; Leigh <em>v. </em>Byron, 21 <em>Id. </em>510; McLeroth <em>v. </em>Bacon, 5 <em>Ves. </em>159; Blackwell <em>v. </em>Ball, 1 <em>Keen </em>176. There is but one case, it is believed, that is not in harmony with all these cases, and that is Maitland <em>v. </em>Adair, 3 <em>Ves. </em>230. The report occupies but a single page, and no counsel are stated as having argued it. A testator gave a legacy to a brother-in-law and other relatives, and in the residuary clause directed his property to be \u201c divided among my said relations in the proportion I have bequeathed the other part of my fortune.\u201d The brother-in-law was here excluded. The principle of the ease is doubted by Mr. Roper in his <em>Treatise on Legacies </em>118-119. It is in conflict with the later cases cited above.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-6\">The learned counsel then argued from the principles embraced in these cases, and applied to the will of testator in this case, that it was apparent from the whole will that testator meant to include his wife and step-son under the terms <em>\u201c </em>heirs and relatives,\u201d in the residuary clause.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-7\"><em>J. S. Serrill, I. Eallon, </em>and <em>W. L. </em>Hirst, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2P\">It is not denied that the intention of the testator, as shown by all the words used in the instrument, is to guide; but <em>conjecture </em>must not be taken for <em>implication: </em>Wilkinson <em>v. </em>Adams, 1 <em>Ves. B. </em>463. The will shows great eccentricity of mind and peculiarity of expression, and therefore greater caution is required in extending the well defined meaning of words.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-8\">Did the testator intend those to whom he had given annuities and legacies for life, to share the residue ? No part of his wife\u2019s estate had ever commingled with his own. His legacies and bequests to her are for life or widowhood. Can there be any inference, therefore, that he intended she should participate in the residuum ? Also in making provision for his mother, brother, sisters, and wife, he gives large sums for life. To his <em>own family </em>he gives small sums absolutely, all nearly equal, and then immediately follows the residuary clause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-9\">In the bequest to Tucker he uses the peculiarity of expression, <em>in perpetuity. </em>Stress is laid on the fact, that this legacy is larger than that given to testator\u2019s own family. But it is submitted that the testator supposed he was giving his step-son a life estate; and this is in consistency with the desire and intention expressed in the first clause, that none of his estate should go to his wife\u2019s family. 2. Can the widow or step-son claim as \u201c heirs, and relatives\u201d within the meaning of the residuary clause ? It is well settled in both England and our own state, that standing alone they would not be included: Culbertson <em>v. </em>Daly, 8 <em>N. &amp; S. </em>195; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Stover <em>v. </em>Wheatly, 1 <em>Barr </em>506; Baskin\u2019s Appeal, 3 <em>Id. </em>305; McNeilledge <em>v. </em>Barclay, 8 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>45; McNeilledge <em>v. </em>Barclay, 11 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>103; Natt <em>v. </em>Natt, 3 Ves. 244; Bailey <em>v. </em>Wright, 18 <em>Id. </em>49; Davis <em>v. </em>Bailey, 1 <em>Id. </em>84; Worseley <em>v. </em>Johnson, 3 <em>Atk. </em>758; Garrick <em>v. </em>Lord Camden, 14 <em>Ves. </em>372; Mifflin\u2019s Estate, Bender\u2019s Appeal, MS., decided at Pittsburgh, Jan. 2,1857. They argued that there was nothing in the will by which these words could be extended beyond their legal acceptation, and cited: Green <em>v. </em>Howard, 1 <em>Bro. Ch.

Is Mrs. Frances H. Hoff, under the will of her late husband, John Hoff, entitled to any part of the residuary estate ?</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">2d. If she is entitled to receive any portion of the residuary estate, how much is hers, and whether for life or absolutely ?</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">3d. Is Henry H. Tucker, the testator\u2019s step-son, one of the residuary legatees under the will ?</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">By his last will and testament John Hoff devised to his wife during life and widowhood, a house and lot in Chestnut street, and the interest on fifteen thousand dollars of stock, upon condition that she should receive it in place of a farm in Montgomery county, which was secured to her in lieu of dower by a marriage settlement made in 1824. To his step-son, Henry H. Tucker, he gave in perpetuity a legacy of four thousand dollars. To his brother Philip Hoff, his nieces Mrs. Knight and Mrs. Newell, his nephews Henry, John C., and George Hoff, were also given legacies of various amounts. Other devises were made by the will but which it is not necessary specifically to designate. The residuary clause is in these words:</p>\n<p id=\"b57-13\"><em>\u201c </em>Thirteenth. All my real and personal estate not hereby bequeathed which I may have at my death, I leave to be equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>divided, as per ratio in the bequests herein made, among my heirs and relatives, the fourth, fifth, and sixth bequests not inclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The fourth bequest was to the Theological Seminary at Princeton ; the fifth to the Marine Church at Charleston; the sixth to purchase a&gt; tract of land in Africa, to be called the \u201c State or district of Hoff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">It is argued by the appellees that Mrs. Hoff ought to be excluded from the residuary estate, because she was not an heir or relative of the testator, and because her bequests were for life and widowhood, in lieu of other property secured to her by a marriage settlement. We do not see the force of these objections. It is obvious that the testator used the words \u201cmy heirs\u201d not in their legal sense, but as designating the objects of his bounty under the will. It is not unusual for an unprofessional man to use the word heir as applicable to a devisee or legatee; and that it was used in this sense by John Hoff, is manifest from the clause excluding the seminary, the church, and the state of Hoff in Africa. Any other construction would make this clause utterly senseless. There is no ground for the supposition that the testator intended to give the residue of his estate to his brother, his nephews and nieces, to the exclusion of his wife and step-son, for these, though not heirs at law, nor relatives by blood, were included in the former bequests and were relations by marriage. The testator, in clear and unmistakeable language, has said which of the devisees were to be excluded from the residuary estate, and we cannot make the exclusion embrace those not mentioned by him. That the previous bequests to Mrs. Hoff were for life and widowhood, and upon condition that she received them as a substitute for the marriage settlement, may limit the duration of her interest in the residuary estate, but these considerations cannot defeat her claim altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">The residuary estate was to be equally divided \u201c as per ratio in the bequests.\u201d To fairly meet this provision, Mrs. Hoff should have the same estate in her part of the residuum as was given to her in the bequests, and this is an estate for life and widowhood. To exclude her altogether or to give her an absolute estate, would not be an equal division \u201cas per ratio in the bequests.\u201d In ascertaining the amount that should be set aside for her, the value of the house left to her at the death of the testator should be added to the fifteen thousand dollars in stocks; and so much of the fund on hand for distribution as was produced by the income of the amount belonging to her, belongs to her absolutely, and her interest in the remainder of her part will be for life and widowhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Henry H. Tucker is also entitled to participate in the residuary estate; and as his legacy was \u201cin perpetuity,\u201d his interest in the residuary estate is an absolute one. The Orphans\u2019 Court erred in decreeing distribution amongst the legatees to the exclusion of Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Frances H. Hoff and Henry H. Tucker, the appellants; and therefore its decree must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Decree. \u2014 This cause came on for hearing at the present term of this court at Philadelphia, on the appeal of Mrs. Frances II. Hoff and Henry H. Tucker, from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia city and county, making distribution of the estate of John Hoff, in the hands of his executors. And the said cause having been argued by counsel, it is considered that the decree of the said Orphans\u2019 Court be reversed, and that the case be remitted to the former auditor, John F. Belsterling, Esq., with directions to find and report to this court, 1st. What was the value of the house and lot in Chestnut street, bequeathed by John Hoff to one of the appellants, Mrs. Frances H. Hoff, at the time of the death of the testator ? 2d. How much of the fund now in hand for distribution is made up from the interest received, or the income derived, from the principal sum now to be distributed, since the death of the testator; and of this income or interest what is the part belonging to Mrs. Hoff, after adding the value of the house to the fifteen thousand dollars in stocks ? And the auditor is further instructed to report a table of distribution amongst those entitled to receive the fund on hand, including Henry H.' Tucker, and particularly designating in said table how much Mrs. Frances H. Hoff is entitled to receive absolutely, and how much for life and widowhood, upon the basis of the opinion accompanying this decree. A final decree to be made upon the reception and confirmation of the report of the auditor as .aforesaid.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
