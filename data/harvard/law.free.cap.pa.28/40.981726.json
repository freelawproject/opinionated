J. Lewis, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-n\">The nature of the devise in question is to be determined by the law as it stood at the death of the testator, nearly forty years ago.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-13\">There existed, at that time, certain established rules for the construction of such devises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-14\">One was, that where real property was devised,without limitation, the devisee took but an estate for life, unless from other parts of the will an intention to give a greater estate was plainly to be inferred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-15\">Another was that the heir at law was not to be disinherited without express words or necessary implication: Throgmorton <em>v. </em>Wright, 3 <em>Wil. </em>418; Bowes <em>v. </em>Blackett, <em>Cowp. </em>235.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-16\">By the Act of 28th January, 1777, the common law and such of the statutes of England as had been in force should be binding on the inhabitants of this state, and a multitude of decisions had settled the construction to be given to words such as are used in the devise in question: Mudge <em>v. </em>Blight, <em>Cowp. </em>355: and Lord Mansfield\u2019s opinion in that case was received as authoritative in Pennsylvania in cases of French <em>v. </em>McIlhenny, 2 <em>Binn. </em>30, and Clayton <em>v. </em>Clayton, 3 <em>Binn. </em>436.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-17\">No decision has gone the length of making the introductory words \u201cAs touching my worldly estate,\u201d &amp;c., sufficient of themselves to manifest an intention to give in fee simple when the devise is not coupled with words of express limitation: Busby <em>v. </em>Busby, 1 <em>Dall. </em>266, in which Throgmorton <em>v. </em>Wright, 3 <em>Wil. </em>414, was referred to, relied on, and adopted without qualification. He argued that the established rule was that the introductory clause would not have the effect of enlarging the subsequent devises to a fee without apt words used for that purpose: Denn <em>v. </em>Gaskin, <em>Cowp. </em>657; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Goodright <em>v. </em>Baker, 5 <em>T. R. </em>13; Doe <em>v. </em>Allen, 8 <em>T. R. </em>503: Doe <em>v. </em>Buckner, 6 <em>T. R. </em>610; Goodright <em>v. </em>Barrow, 11 <em>East 220; </em>Moor <em>v. </em>Denn, 2 <em>Bos. &amp; P. </em>247; 2 <em>Pow. on Dev. </em>416; <em>Ram. on Wills </em>65, 6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-6\">There is nothing in any case in Pennsylvania decided prior to 1852, which countenances the idea that such introductory words alone can make any difference in the quantity of the estate devised: Bushy <em>v. </em>Bushy, 1 <em>Dall. </em>266; Caldwell <em>v. </em>Ferguson, 2 <em>Yeates </em>250; Dougherty <em>v. </em>Brown, 2 <em>Id. </em>179; French <em>v. </em>M'Illhenny, 2 <em>Binn. </em>30; Cassell <em>v. </em>Cook, 8 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>288; Campbell <em>v. </em>Carson, 12 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>54; Steele <em>v. </em>Thompson, 14 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>84; Weidman <em>v. </em>Marsh, 4 <em>Harris </em>512.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-7\">Presented in its true light, the question is, do the words of this devise, unaided as they are by any others in the will, pass an estate in fee or for life, as the law stood in 1818.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-8\"><em>Darlington </em>and <em>BennypacJcer, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alf\">Did Enoch Walker take afee in the land devised? The defendant maintains that he did. If it be clear that the testator intended to dispose of his <em>whole </em>estate, the devise will be construed to pass a fee, although there are no words of limitation annexed. Whatever prejudice exists in England in favour of the heir over the devisee, there is no reason for the existence of any such feeling here. The intention of the testator is the polar star to guide the construction. This is to be gathered from the whole will. Various forms of expressions in the introductory clauses of wills have been deemed sufficient to indicate an intention to give a fee: Campbell <em>v. </em>Carson, 12 <em>S. &amp; R. 56. </em>The meaning of the words to \u201c <em>settle and adjust his worldly affairs,\u201d </em>is clearly that he intended to dispose of his estate by will, and the intention to do so is clearly dcducible from the face of the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-9\">This intention there manifested will be carried down and give' effect to the devising clause. It would be affectation of learning to cite the various authorities on this subject, which has been so fully reviewed by Justice Lowrie in Schriver <em>v. </em>Meyer, 7 <em>Harris </em>89.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-10\">That case was followed by Woods <em>v. </em>Hill, 7 <em>Id. </em>573, to the same effect, and both are recognised in Shinn <em>v. </em>Holmes, 1 <em>Casey </em>142. Now what reason exists for discarding the rule in this case ? In each case where the testator in this will expressly gives a life estate, there is a devise over. In the clause in question there is none; and this has been regarded as an important and significant fact: Miller <em>v. </em>Lynn, 7 <em>Barr </em>443; Shinn <em>v. </em>Holmes, 1 <em>Casey </em>144. In this case we have the clear intent to dispose of the whole estate, without any devise over, and no indication of any intention to give Enoch less than a fee in the twenty acres.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-11\">In the same clause the testator devises to Enoch eight acres of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number><em>hill land </em>without any words of perpetuity. This would be wholly useless if he had but a life estate in it; as he could reap no profits from, or commit any waste upon it: Caldwell <em>v. </em>Ferguson, 2 <em>Yeates </em>380. He could not intend a barren gift of the unimproved land; and the twrenty acres being in the same clause, there is no reason to believe any difference was intended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-5\">It is the remaining part of the hill land <em>bought </em>of Isaac Potts, that he devises to Enoch. \u201cMy late purchase\u201d will pass a fee: Neide <em>v. </em>Neide, 4 <em>R. </em>75.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-6\">This will is to be construed by the light of the present day, rather than the exploded notions favouring the heir prevalent in other times. By the Act of 1833, this is now the settled policy of our state, and the Supreme Court, in McClure <em>v. </em>Dowthit, 3 <em>Barr </em>406, say this should have been the construction before: Wood <em>v. </em>Hills, 7 <em>Harris </em>575.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b46-8\">Lowrie, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azz\">We think the learned President of the Comm oh Pleas decided this cause rightly, and we have very little to add to the reasons assigned by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">Let us keep in hand the rule that requires us to prefer the heir at law, in case of doubt; and therefore not to treat a devise as creating a fee, unless it clearly appears to be so intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">But this rule is different here from what it is in England, because heir has a different meaning: there it is the eldest son; here all the children. Here a will is usually the distribution of an inheritance among the heirs; there it is giving it away from the heir. When the latter is its character, we may be strict in requiring words of inheritance; when the former is, we cannot, to say the least, be so strict, for we are preferring the heir when we favour the devise. If we should read the' devise to one child without words of inheritance, and all the rest with them, we should cut off one heir from his inheritance; unless we could repair the wrong afterwards when we come to divide the reversion, which would he better done at first.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">There is abundant evidence in the will that the testator intended to dispose of all his property and thought he had done so, and no evidence of a contrary intention. Debts usually fall upon a residue ; but here they are specially charged upon Thomas\u2019s share. The lot in dispute is part of a tract which he divided into twenty-acre lots and devised among his sons, using words of inheritance in the other instances and not in this; while other words show that he supposed himself to be fully disposing of-the whole tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">Another tract was divided into eight and nine acre lots, and disposed of in the same way, and evidently with the same intention ; but here no words of inheritance are used in the gift of Jesse\u2019s lot; and yet, when he afterwards substitutes Thomas for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Jesse in this respect, it becomes apparent that he supposed that he had given Jesse a fee, and he gives it to Thomas, though still without words of inheritance. In two cases only did he intend to create life estates in land, and then he expressly says so.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">In the instance in dispute the whole frame of the will demands the implication of an inheritance, and that is all we have in the crowd of cases, -when the word heirs is omitted in fact, but in volved in the clear intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">And if we were to follow the principle that prevails in advancements and in marshalling the assets of decedents, insolvents, and bankrupts; and which requires those who have obtained a prefer ence to stand aside from the residue until others, who are equal to them before the law, shall be made equal in fact: if we were to follow this principle, it would most likely cure this alleged omission without profiting the plaintiffs. We do not say that this course could he taken, but the principle is quite unfriendly to the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
