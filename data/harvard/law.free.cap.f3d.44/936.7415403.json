We reverse and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-26\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b993-27\">A federal grand jury indicted Appellant Barry Spell on three counts of bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (West Supp.1994). In March 1993, Appellant entered into a plea agreement with the Government and pled guilty to one count of bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-28\">The Government\u2019s Presentenee Investigation Report (PSI) calculated Appellant\u2019s final adjusted offense level at 32 and recommended an imprisonment range of 210 to 262 months. Significantly, the PSI requested that Appellant receive a career offender enhancement, raising his offense level from 22 to 32. The Government cited two prior felony convictions which justified the enhance-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>merit; a state burglary conviction in May 1980, and a state robbery and battery conviction in April 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">At the July 1993 sentencing hearing, Appellant challenged the PSI\u2019s career offender recommendation, arguing that the May 1980 burglary conviction was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d which could support the requested enhancement. The district court overruled Appellant\u2019s objection, finding the burglary to be a crime of violence by looldng at the charging document. Pursuant to the Guidelines, Appellant was sentenced to 188 months incarceration. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Pinion, </em>4 F.3d 941, 943 (11th Cir.1993). <em>Accord United States v. Smith, </em>10 F.3d 724, 730 (10th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">B. <em>Career Offender Status</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">A district court may enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence as a career offender:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-10\">[1]f (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time of the instant offense, (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (Nov. 1992).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This provision is interpreted strictly, <em>United States v. Delvecchio, </em>920 F.2d 810, 812 (11th Cir.1991), and requires the Government to demonstrate all three elements by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Patrick, </em>983 F.2d 206, 208 (11th Cir.1993). Appellant does not dispute that he was over eighteen when convicted or that the instant offense is a qualified felony. Nor does Appellant dispute that the April 1988 conviction constitutes a crime of violence within the meaning of \u00a7 4B1.1. Thus, the issue before the Court is whether Appellant\u2019s May 1980 burglary conviction constitutes a crime of violence justifying career offender status.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-15\">\n<em>C.Crime of Violence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"An7\">A crime of violence, as used in \u00a7 4B1.1, is defined by the Guidelines as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-16\">[A]ny offense under federal or state law punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-17\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-18\">(ii) <em>is burglary of a dwelling, </em>arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-19\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(1) (emphasis added). In addition, Comment Two to \u00a7 4B1.2, which we generally must accept as binding, <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993), <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>26 F.3d 1533, 1544 (11th Cir.1994), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-22\">\u201cCrime of violence\u201d includes ... <em>burglary of a dwelling. </em>Other offenses are included where (A) that offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (B) <em>the conduct set forth (i.e., expressly charged) in the count of which the defendant was convicted </em>..., by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. Under this section, <em>the conduct of which the defendant was convicted is the focus of the inquiry.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n. 2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-23\">As the plain text of the Guidelines makes clear, the burglary of a dwelling is a crime of violence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(l)(ii). <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>911 F.2d 542, 548 (11th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>500 U.S. 933, 111 S.Ct. 2056, 114 L.Ed.2d 461 (1991). By explicitly including the burglary of a dwelling as a crime of violence, the Guidelines intended to exclude from the violent crime category those burglaries which do not involve dwellings and occupied structures. <em>Smith, </em>10 F.3d at 732. <em>Cf. United States v. Campbell, </em>888 F.2d 76, 79 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>Cir.1989) (government conceding that burglaries involving commercial buildings, rather than dwellings, do not constitute crimes of violence under the Guidelines), <em>cert. denied, </em>494 U.S. 1032, 110 S.Ct. 1484, 108 L.Ed.2d 620 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\">Appellant insists that his May 1980 burglary conviction was not for a crime of violence because the state court\u2019s judgment was for the burglary of a structure under Florida\u2019s burglary statute. <em>See </em>Fla.Stat. \u00a7 .810.02 (1993). The Government\u2019s position is that the May 1980 burglary was a crime of violence because the charging document charged Appellant with burglary of a dwelling. Despite the language of the state conviction, by looking at the charging document the district court found that the crime was the burglary of a dwelling and, therefore, a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2. Thus, the narrow question we face is whether the district court properly determined that Appellant\u2019s May 1980 conviction was a conviction for the burglary of a dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">D. <em>Determining Whether a Conviction is for a Crime of Violence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Appellant asserts that the district court erred by looking behind his conviction when it found that the May 1980 conviction was for a crime of violence. Relying on <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 601-03, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2160, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), <em>United States v. Wright, </em>968 F.2d 1167, 1172 (11th Cir.1992), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 113 S.Ct. 2325, 124 L.Ed.2d 238 (1993), and <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>911 F.2d at 547, Appellant argues that the district court was obliged to take a \u201ccategorical approach\u201d and look no farther than the judgment of conviction. The Government replies that those cases, decided under different enhancement statutes or prior versions of \u00a7 4B1.2, are contrary to the plain text of the Guidelines and are not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">Examination of the charging document is permitted under the Guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n. 2). But despite the Guidelines\u2019 approach, the ability to \u201clook behind\u201d state convictions in a federal sentencing proceeding is very limited. <em>See, e.g. United States v. Roman, </em>989 F.2d 1117, 1120 (11th Cir.1993) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, \u2014 </em>U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 2139, 128 L.Ed.2d 868 (1994). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>the practical difficulties of holding mini-trials on a defendant\u2019s prior convictions counsel against looking beyond the fact of conviction. <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 599-603, 110 S.Ct. at 2159-60 (1990). This reasoning applies with equal force to decisions under \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2. <em>See United States v. Oliver, </em>20 F.3d 415, 417 (11th Cir.1994), Thus, a district court only may inquire into the conduct surrounding a conviction if ambiguities in the judgment make the crime of violence determination impossible from the face of the judgment itself. <em>Smith, </em>10 F.3d at 733. The inquiry is limited to examining easily produced and evaluated court documents, including the judgment of conviction, charging papers, plea agreement, presentenee report adopted by the court, and the findings of a sentencing judge. <em>Id. </em>at 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">While the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Taylor </em>\u2014 decided under a different enhancement provision \u2014 often will guide our decisions under \u00a7 4B1.2, <em>see Oliver, </em>20 F.3d at 417, <em>United States v. Bell, </em>966 F.2d 703, 704-05 (1st Cir.1992), the Guidelines\u2019 commentary rejects its \u201ccategorical approach.\u201d The Guidelines\u2019 commentary also precludes the categorical approach of <em>Wright, </em>968 F.2d at 1172, and <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>911 F.2d at 547, which were decided under a previous version of the Guidelines. Consequently, we must reject Appellant\u2019s contention that a district court can never look behind a conviction in its \u00a7 4B1.2 crime of violence inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">In this case the ambiguity of the conviction and the statute under which Appellant was prosecuted required the court to look behind the judgment of conviction. Florida\u2019s burglary statute encompasses three different burglary situations; (1) where the offender is armed or commits assault or battery, he commits a felony of the first degree; (2) where the offender enters a dwelling or occupied building, he commits a felony of the second degree; and (3) in all other burglaries, the offender commits a felony of the third degree. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 810.02(2), (3) (1994). The problem is that <em>every </em>burglary under the Florida statute, whether a first, second, or third degree felony, requires the \u201centering or remaining in a <em>structure.\u201d </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02(1). Consequently, the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>ment of conviction\u2019s language of guilt for \u201cburglary of a structure\u201d encompasses some conduct which constitutes a crime of violence and some which does not. In such circumstances, the district court correctly went beyond the face of the May 1980 conviction in determining whether it was for a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">But the Guidelines stress that \u201cthe conduct <em>of which the defendant was convicted </em>is the focus of the inquiry.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n. 2). Thus, a district court may not rely on a charging document without first establishing that the crime charged was the same crime for which the defendant was convicted. Here, the district court relied on conduct contained in the charging document without ever determining whether Appellant was convicted for the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Appellant was charged with a second degree felony \u2014 burglary of a dwelling \u2014 and faced \u201ca term of imprisonment not exceeding 15 years.\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 775.082(3)(c). But he was convicted pursuant to a plea agreement, which might very well have been obtained for \u201cunaggravated\u201d burglary, a third degree felony, subjecting him to \u201ca term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years.\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 775.082(3)(d). Appellant\u2019s four-year sentence of imprisonment, and the judgment\u2019s language convicting him for \u201cburglary of a structure\u201d makes us unable to determine from the face of the judgment whether Appellant was convicted as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">The fact that Appellant\u2019s conviction was obtained through a plea agreement heightens our concern that Appellant\u2019s sentence enhancement may rely upon a crime for which he was never convicted. In <em>Taylor, </em>the enhancement statute at issue made any burglary conviction the basis for an enhancement. <em>Id., </em>495 U.S. at 588-90, 110 S.Ct. at 2153. The circuit court held that the sentencing court could look behind the defendant\u2019s plea and enhance the sentence because, regardless of the conviction, the original charge was for burglary. <em>Id. </em>495 U.S. at 578, 110 S.Ct. at 2148. In reversing the circuit court, the Supreme Court noted that \u201cif a guilty plea to a lesser, nonburglary offense was the result of a plea bargain, it would seem unfair to impose a sentence enhancement as if the defendant had pleaded guilty to burglary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>495 U.S. at 601-02, 110 S.Ct. at 2160.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">We hold that the district court erred by relying on the charging document without determining whether Appellant pled guilty to the crimes charged. On remand, the district court should examine Appellant\u2019s 1980 plea. If Appellant\u2019s plea was for a second degree felony, admits \u201cguilt as charged,\u201d or in some other way indicates a plea to the conduct charged in the indictment, then a career offender sentence enhancement is appropriate. But if the plea was for a third degree felony, or contains some other indication that Appellant pled to an \u201cunaggravated\u201d burglary, then the May 1980 conviction cannot be the basis for finding Appellant to be a career offender under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AQf\">The district court erred by enhancing Appellant\u2019s sentence based upon a charged crime for which Appellant might not have been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b994-13\">. We apply the Guidelines Manual in effect at the time of an offender\u2019s sentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.11(a). Appellant is therefore subject to the Guidelines in effect in July 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
