Each Petitioner asserts that the Board erred in its factual finding that he is not a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of Section 101(a)(42) of the Act and that the Board erred as a matter of law in relying on the reasoning of <em>Matter of Chang, </em>Int.Dee. 3107 (BIA 1989) and <em>Matter of G, </em>Int.Dee. 3215 (BIA 1993) in determining his claim of refugee status as to the forced abortion/foreed sterilization policies of China.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-16\">The Board\u2019s factual finding that an alien is not eligible for consideration for asylum must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Castillo-Rodriguez v. INS, </em>929 F.2d 181, 183 (5th Cir.1991). To reverse the Board\u2019s decision, Petitioner must show \u201cthat the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478,-, 112 S.Ct. 812, 817, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We will not reverse a finding simply because we differ with the Board\u2019s evaluations of the facts. <em>Castillo-Rodriguez, </em>929 F.2d at 184; and will uphold the Attorney General\u2019s determination whether to grant asylum unless the petitioner shows that the action was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-19\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs and the Board\u2019s Order and have concluded that the Board\u2019s determination that each Petitioner was not entitled to asylum must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-20\">The Act vests sole discretion as to the granting of asylum to \u201crefugees\u201d in the Attorney General, who has by regulation delegated that authority to the Board. While Petitioners have demonstrated various proposals to change the criteria defined in <em>Matter of Chang </em>and <em>Matter of G </em>for use in Chinese forced abortion/forced sterilization asylum claims, those proposals have unfortunately never been implemented. The criteria described in <em>Matter of Chang </em>and <em>Matter of G </em>are neither arbitrary nor capricious and are well within the discretion vested in the Attorney General by the Act. Accordingly, we are unable to conclude that the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>erred as a matter of law in relying on such eases.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">For the foregoing reasons, each of the Petitions for Review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
