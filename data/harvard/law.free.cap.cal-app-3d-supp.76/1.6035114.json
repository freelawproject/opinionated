J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AeB\">Defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction, based on his plea of guilty to a violation of Penal Code section 647, subdivision (a), and from an order finding him in violation of probation previously imposed on account of another conviction under the same section. The sole issue raised is the constitutionality of the section. Defendant\u2019s attack is based, essentially, on the claim that the words \u201clewd or dissolute\u201d appearing in the statute are impermissibly vague, thereby leading to a denial of due process of law and to other constitutional defects. In particular, the attack focuses on apparently conflicting definitions of \u201clewd or dissolute\u201d as used in the section, which definitions appear in <em>Silva </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 733 [115 Cal.Rptr. 479] and in <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 225 [130 Cal.Rptr. 460]. We believe the conflict is more apparent than real.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">In <em>Silva, </em>the Court of Appeal dealt with a contention by a defendant charged with soliciting lewd and dissolute, conduct that the words \u201clewd\u201d and \u201cdissolute\u201d were constitutionally vague and violated the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of freedom of speech. The court held that the term \u201c \u2018lewd or dissolute conduct\u2019 \u201d had to be given the meaning of \u201c \u2018obscene\u2019 \u201d conduct (40 Cal.App.3d at p. 738), and that when so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 3\">*Supp. 3</page-number>interpreted the phrase was not vague. It defined obscene conduct as \u201cthat sort of sexual conduct which is \u2018grossly repugnant\u2019 and \u2018patently offensive\u2019 to \u2018generally accepted notions df what is appropriate\u2019 and decent according to statewide contemporary standards.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 741.)</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">The First Amendment argument was disposed of on alternate theories. <em>First: </em>The First Amendment does not protect obscenity. Solicitation of an obscene act is itself obscene conduct and is therefore beyond First Amendment protection. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 737.) <em>Second: </em>Statutes which proscribe the solicitation of acts which are not in themselves criminal, but \u201creasonably deemed to be contrary to the public interest\u201d have never been held to violate the First Amendment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 738.)</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, 59 </em>Cal.App.3d 225, the defendant was convicted of engaging in lewd or dissolute conduct. Section 647, subdivision (a) condemns both soliciting and engaging in lewd or dissolute conduct in a public place. The trial court in <em>Williams </em>defined \u201clewd and dissolute\u201d conduct in the following manner: \u201cAs used in the foregoing instruction, the words \u2018lewd\u2019 and \u2018dissolute\u2019 are synonymous and mean lustful, lascivious, unchaste, wanton, or loose in morals and conduct.\u201d (The language is that of CALJIC No. 16.402.) The Court of Appeal held that the phrase \u201clewd and dissolute\u201d was not constitutionally vague as defined by the trial court. The <em>Williams </em>court disagreed with the decision by the Court of Appeal in <em>Silva </em>insofar as that opinion seems to hold that \u201clewd and dissolute\u201d must be defined synonymously with \u201cobscene\u201d in cases <em>not </em>involving theatrical performances. We agree with the decision in the <em>Williams </em>case that the definition of \u201clewd or dissolute\u201d conduct based on CALJIC No. 16.402 meets all constitutional challenges except in cases involving live performances on a stage. In such cases the <em>Silva </em>definition must be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">In any event, whichever definition prevails, the statute has been held to be constitutional. The decisions in <em>Silva </em>and <em>Williams </em>bind us. In oral argument counsel suggested that the United States Supreme Court had summarily affirmed a lower court decision <em>(District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Walters </em>(D.C.App. 1974) 319 A.2d 332) holding unconstitutional a statute with language similar to that in Penal Code section 647, subdivision (a). Accordingly, it was argued that we are bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s action. It turns out, however, that while the <em>Walters </em>decision was appealed to the Supreme Court that body dismissed the appeal for want of a properly presented federal question and, treating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 4\">*Supp. 4</page-number>the papers as though in certiorari, denied a petition for such a writ. Thus, there is no binding federal precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Alarcon, J., and Wenke, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
