The court sentenced Sheridan to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment. The court also specified an identical alternative sentence of thirty months pursuant to this court\u2019s recommendation in <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004), <em>opinion issued by, United States v. Hammond, 381 </em>F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. granted, judgment vacated,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005). Sheridan\u2019s attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that he has reviewed the record, researched the issues raised by Sheridan, and has found them to have no merit. In his <em>Anders </em>brief, Sheridan\u2019s attorney raised several issues related to the district court\u2019s calculation of Sheridan\u2019s sentence. Although informed of his right to do so, Sheridan has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. Sheridan was also afforded the opportunity to address the impact of <em>United States v. Booker,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), on his case in a supplemental brief, and he has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-23\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Sheridan\u2019s sentence. This court requires counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-24\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
