The district court denied his application for a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, as time barred. He now appeals. We granted a certificate of appealability on two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-26\">(1) Whether the district court properly found that [petitioner] did not make a sufficient showing of actual innocence to potentially overcome the untimeliness of his federal habeas corpus petition based on the limited record before it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-27\">(2) If not, whether the application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\u2019s one-year statute of limitations constitutes an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus? <em>See Wyzykowski v. Department of Corrections, </em>226 F.3d 1213, 1218-19 (11th Cir.2000).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-28\">A federal court reviewing a \u00a7 2254 petition must give a level of deference to a state court\u2019s findings of fact. Specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMs\">In a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall have the burden of rebut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>ting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Prisoners have a one-year limitation period to file a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). In <em>Wyzykowski, </em>we held that the \u00a7 2244(d)\u2019s one-year statute of limitations was not an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. We noted a \u201ctroubling and difficult constitutional question,\u201d however, when a petitioner can show actual innocence and the statute of limitations has expired. <em>Wyzykowski, </em>226 F.3d at 1218. We held that the petitioner must make the actual-innocence showing before the court will address the constitutional issue. <em>Id. </em>We vacated the district court\u2019s decision because there was \u201ca complete absence in the record on appeal concerning ... a showing of actual innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1219. In particular, although Wyzykowski had apparently pled guilty, we did not have access to his plea colloquy. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the district court never addressed Wyzykowski\u2019s claims of actual innocence. <em>Id. </em>at 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">To make a showing of actual innocence, the petitioner must establish that a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent. <em>Sibley v. Culliver, </em>377 F.3d 1196, 1205 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cTo meet this standard, a petitioner must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him of the underlying offense.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Alabama, </em>256 F.3d 1156, 1171 (11th Cir.2001) (quotations omitted); <em>see also Sibley, </em>377 F.3d at 1205. To accomplish this, the petitioner must offer reliable evidence that was not presented at trial. <em>Johnson, </em>256 F.3d at 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Here, the record before the district court was sufficient to enable the court to conclude that petitioner failed to meet the \u201cactual innocence\u201d exception. Included in the record were the state appellate court\u2019s opinion, the affidavits from the additional witnesses, the reports, and the recorded statements that were submitted with petitioner\u2019s traverse. We give deference to the facts set out in the state appellate court\u2019s opinion and presume them to be correct because petitioner Johnson failed to prove them incorrect by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). In the light of the state appellate court\u2019s summary of the testimony, the district court considered the new evidence petitioner offered to establish his innocence and found that such evidence would have been repetitive and conflicting. We agree. And, since we conclude that the district court properly found that petitioner failed to meet the \u201cactual innocence\u201d exception, we need not address the second issue the certificate of appealability presents, i.e., whether the \u00a7 2244(d) statute of limitations is constitutional as applied to someone who is actually innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
