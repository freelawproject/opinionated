The crux of Raezkowski\u2019s claim rests on his contention that the Social Security Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d) contains no provision prohibiting FTCA claims, since the FTCA covers \u201cnegligent and wrongful acts by any employee of the government.\u201d Furthermore, Raczkowski maintains that his complaint is not grounded in social security law, and thus, should not be barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-23\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Mexiport, Inc. v. Frontier Communications Services, Inc., </em>253 F.3d 573, 574 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-24\">The Act provides both a means of judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s determinations and a bar on FTCA claims. Section 405(g) of the Act states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-25\">Any individual, after any final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>made after a hearing to which he was a party, irrespective of the amount in controversy, may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action commenced within sixty days after the mailing to him of notice of such decision or within such further time as the Commissioner of Social Security may allow. Such action shall be brought in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the plaintiff resides....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Moreover, \u00a7 405(h) of the Act provides, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">The findings and decision of the Commissioner of Social Security after a hearing shall be binding upon all individuals who were parties to such hearing. No findings of fact or decision of the Commissioner of Social Security shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein provided. <em>No action against the United States, the Commissioner of Social Security, or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section 1331 or 1316 of Title 28 to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h) (emphasis added). The referred to federal jurisdictional statute \u00a7 1331 of Title 28 provides that \u201c[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Section 1346(b)(1), the FTCA, gives the district courts original jurisdiction for \u201ccivil actions on claims against the United States, for money damages ... for injury or loss of property ... caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment with the United States....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"A5W\">The Supreme Court has issued two decisions that held that \u00a7 405(h) bars social security benefits cases with jurisdictional grounding in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. In <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975), the Supreme Court held the district court erred when it found it had jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331 to hear a widow and her child\u2019s social security claims, after the SSA denied them survivor\u2019s benefits. <em>Salfi, </em>422 U.S. at 753, 95 S.Ct. at 2461. In examining the third sentence of \u00a7 405(h), the Court concluded that the district court had erroneously ignored the statute\u2019s plain language in its too narrow interpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 758, 95 S.Ct. at 2464.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">Several years later, in <em>Shalala v. Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc., </em>529 U.S. 1, 120 S.Ct. 1084, 146 L.Ed.2d 1 (2000), the Supreme Court reiterated its position that \u00a7 405(h) prevents plaintiffs from bringing suit in district court under \u00a7 1331 and seeking redress for a denial of social security benefits. <em>Shalala, </em>529 U.S. at 5, 10, 120 S.Ct. at 1089, 1092 (revisiting the issue in the context of a complaint brought against the Department of Health and Human Services under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ii, which incorporated \u00a7 405(h)6 of the Act). In examining the more recent version of \u00a7 405(h), the Court noted that its third sentence excluded jurisdiction under \u00a7 1346 as well, and held that the section\u2019s language <em>\u201cto recover on any claim arising under\u201d </em>undoubtedly references the usual social security claim \u201cwhere an individual seeks a monetary benefit from the agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 120 S.Ct. at 1092 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">We conclude that because RaczkowsH\u2019s claim is one arising under the Act, \u00a7 405(h) bars him from asserting jurisdiction under the FTCA, and the district court did not err when it dismissed his complaint for lack of subject matter juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>diction. Moreover, while \u00a7 405(g) provides a remedy for Raczkowski to advance his claim administratively, because more than 60 days have elapsed from the issuance of the SSA\u2019s final denial of benefits, this remedy is not available to him even if his complaint was construed as arising under it. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
