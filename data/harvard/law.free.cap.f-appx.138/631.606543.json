Lozano argues, for the first time on appeal, that 8 U .S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Loza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>no\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Also for the first time on appeal, Lozano, relying on the possibility that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>mil be overruled, as well as on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), argues that the federal sentencing guidelines are unconstitutional because they permit the enhancement of a sentence based on prior convictions. Lozano\u2019s argument fails because <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has not been overruled and because the enhancement of a sentence based on prior convictions does not violate the Sixth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Booker,</em>-U.S.-,-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b659-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.,5 the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
