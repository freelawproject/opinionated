He first argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. To obtain a conviction for illegal reentry, the Government must establish four elements: (1) alienage, (2) deportation, (3) reentry into or unlawful presence in the United States, and (4) lack of the Attorney General\u2019s consent to reenter. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a); <em>United States v. Sanchez-Milam, </em>305 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir.2002). Martinez-Cantu challenges only the last element.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">The evidence was more than sufficient to establish the lack of the Attorney General\u2019s consent to reenter into the United States. The Government offered a certificate of nonexistence of record which satisfies the Government\u2019s burden of proving that the Attorney General had not consented to reentry. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">Moreover, there was testimony showing that Martinez-Cantu did not have any documentation to allow him to enter into the United States after his deportation; he admitted as much to immigration officials. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, a reasonable jury could have concluded that Martinez-Cantu did not obtain the Attorney General\u2019s consent to reenter the United States. <em>United States v. Ortega Reyna, </em>148 F.3d 540, 543 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-15\">Martinez-Cantu argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) &amp; (2) were rendered unconstitutional by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), but he concedes that the issue is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and he raises it solely to preserve its further review by the Supreme Court. <em>\u201cApprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres.\u201d United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348. \u2022 This court must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>unless the Supreme Court overrules it. <em>Rivera, </em>265 F.3d at 312. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b670-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
