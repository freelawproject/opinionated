LCP and the public defender filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The District Court granted the motion and denied Flowers\u2019 motion for reconsideration. Flowers filed a timely notice of appeal. The Court issued an order to show cause why the matter should not be summarily remanded to the District Court for the District Court to grant Flowers leave to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">As it stands, Flowers\u2019 complaint clearly fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, essentially for the reasons stated by the District Court. <em>See Curtis v. Everette, </em>489 F.2d 516, 521 (3d Cir.1973); <em>Patton v. Przybylski, </em>822 F.2d 697, 700 (7th Cir.1987); <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 643, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997). However, the District Court did not give Flowers an opportunity to amend his complaint, or otherwise determine that any amendment would be inequitable or futile. <em>See Alston v. Parker, </em>363 F.3d 229, 235 (3d Cir.2004); <em>Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir.2002). Without expressing any opinion as to the ultimate merits of any possible amendment, we do not find that an amendment would be inequitable or futile. Accordingly, we will not dismiss this appeal as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e), and we will summarily remand the matter to the District Court with instructions to grant Flowers leave to amend his complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
