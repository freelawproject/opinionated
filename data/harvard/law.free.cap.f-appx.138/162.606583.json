Langford, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment, in favor of the TRW Employee Welfare Benefit Plan Trust (\u201cTRW Trust\u201d) and UNUM Life Insurance Company of America (\u201cUNUM\u201d), on her claims alleging improper denial of benefits under a long-term disability plan (\u201cLTD Plan\u201d), in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, <em>et seq. </em>On appeal, Langford argues that the district court erred by (1) finding that the TRW Trust had sufficient discretion, pursuant to the LTD Plan, to decide her claim so as to warrant application of the (more deferential) arbitrary and capricious standard of review, and (2) by denying her claim despite observing, prior to applying the arbitrary and capricious standard, that under a <em>de novo </em>standard, Langford would be entitled to continued benefits. After thorough review of the record, as well as careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-16\">When addressing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we review \u201cthe district court\u2019s ruling <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards that governed the district court\u2019s disposition.\u201d <em>Williams v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>373 F.3d 1132, 1134 (11th Cir.2004). In our review, we must view \u201call facts and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to [] the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Booker T. Washington Broad. Serv., Inc., </em>234 F.3d 501, 507 (11th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is warranted if the evidence shows \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-17\">We have delineated the following approach for reviewing \u201cvirtually <em>all\u201d </em>ERISA plan benefit denials:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-18\">(1) Apply the <em>de novo </em>standard to determine whether the claim administrator\u2019s benefits-denial decision is \u201cwrong\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>the court disagrees with the administrator\u2019s decision); if it is not, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>(2) If the administrator\u2019s decision in fact is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong,\u201d then determine whether he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims; if not, end judicial inquiry and reverse the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\">(3) If the administrator\u2019s decision is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong\u201d and he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims, then determine whether \u201creasonable\u201d grounds supported it (hence, review his decision under the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">(4) If no reasonable grounds exist, then end the inquiry and reverse the administrator\u2019s decision; if reasonable grounds do exist, then determine if he operated under a conflict of interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">(5) If there is no conflict, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">(6) If there is a conflict of interest, then apply heightened arbitrary and capricious review to the decision to affirm or deny it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-8\"><em>Williams, </em>373 F.3d at 1137-38 (emphasis in original) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Here, the district court first found that the TRW Trust\u2019s decision to deny benefits was <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong.\u201d Under the <em>de novo </em>standard, we have described \u201c \u2018[w]rong\u2019 [a]s the label used by our precedent to describe the conclusion a court reaches when, after reviewing the plan documents and disputed terms <em>de novo, </em>the court disagrees with the claims administrator\u2019s plan interpretation.\u201d <em>HCA Health Sews, of Ga., Inc. v. Employers Health Ins. Co., </em>240 F.3d 982, 994 n. 23 (11th Cir.2001). The defendants relied primarily on the opinion of a doctor who was employed by UNUM but did not personally examine Langford. While the defendants were not <em>obligated </em>to accord special deference to the opinions of Langford\u2019s treating physicians, the district court found the defendants completely ignored several of those opinions. <em>Cf. Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, </em>538 U.S. 822, 825, 123 S.Ct. 1965, 1967, 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003) (holding that \u201cplan administrators are not obliged to accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">After concluding its <em>de novo </em>review of the defendants\u2019 decision, in accordance with the test laid out in <em>Williams, </em>the district court then considered whether the TRW Trust had discretion to decide her claim. <em>See Williams, </em>373 F.3d at 1138. We have held that a defendant has discretion to decide a claim when \u201cthe benefit plan gives the [defendant] discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.\u201d <em>Cagle v. Bruner, </em>112 F.3d 1510, 1516 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation omitted). The LTD plan provided that the TRW Trust \u201cshall have the final authority to determine whether or not to pay any claims that UNUM recommends for payment or denial and shall have the final authority to authorize payment of claims.\u201d Thus, as the district court found, the TRW Trust had \u201cdiscretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">On the third prong of the <em>Williams </em>test, the inquiry is \u201cwhether [the claimant] has proposed a sound interpretation of the plan to rival [the defendant\u2019s] interpretation.\u201d <em>Lee v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Ala., </em>10 F.3d 1547, 1550 (11th Cir.1994). However, \u201c[e]ven if the court determines that the claimant\u2019s interpretation is reasonable, the claimant does not necessarily prevail.... The reason the claimant\u2019s reasonable interpretation does not trump the claims administrator\u2019s wrong interpretation is because the plan documents explicitly grant the claims administrator discretion to interpret the plan.\u201d <em>HCA, </em>240 F.3d at 994 (footnote omitted). We also have noted that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>[t]o find a claims administrator\u2019s interpretation arbitrary and capricious, the court must overcome the principle of trust law which states that a trustee\u2019s interpretation will not be disturbed if it is reasonable. Thus, the next step requires the court to determine whether the claims administrator\u2019s wrong interpretation is nonetheless reasonable. If the court determines that the claims administrator\u2019s wrong interpretation is reasonable, then this wrong but reasonable interpretation is entitled to deference even though the claimant\u2019s interpretation is also reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citation and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In the instant case, the district court found the defendants\u2019 interpretation of the LTD Plan was reasonable in light of the medical documents in the record and a UNUM doctor\u2019s conclusions. Although the UNUM doctor\u2019s conclusions differed from the opinions of some of Langford\u2019s treating physicians, the defendants were not obligated to accord special deference to the opinions of Langford\u2019s treating physicians. <em>See Black &amp; Decker, </em>538 U.S. at 825, 123 S.Ct. at 1967. Thus, although the TRW Trust\u2019s decision was <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong,\u201d reasonable grounds existed for its decision, under the second and third prongs of <em>Williams</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Contrary to Lang-ford\u2019s arguments on appeal, it was not error for the district court to proceed with its analysis beyond the <em>de novo </em>standard required by the first prong of <em>Williams, </em>nor was it reversible error for the court to conclude that, on this record, the defendants reasonably discontinued payment of benefits under the LTD Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-7\">. Langford did not argue in the district court, and she does not claim here, that the defendants had a conflict of interest or that their actions were motivated by self-interest. Thus, even viewing the facts in a light most favorable to Langford, summary judgment is proper because she did not present any \"genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d and the defendants are \"entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>See Johnson, </em>234 F.3d at 507 (11th Cir.2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Moreover, Langford abandoned any possible claims regarding the defendants' conflict of interest by failing to raise these arguments in her brief on appeal. <em>See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
