The motion was required because Ucon had not appealed from an adverse summary judgment within 30 days as required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a). It goes without saying that this time limitation is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d. <em>Huff v. Int\u2019l Longshoremen\u2019s Assoc., Local </em># <em>24, </em>799 F.2d 1087, 1089 (5th Cir.1986) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">On 8 July 2004, 41 days after summary judgment was awarded Sprint, Ucon filed a motion to withdraw as attorney and to extend the time to file the notice of appeal. For the latter, Ucon claimed it satisfied Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(5), which provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that a district court may extend the time for filing a notice of appeal upon a showing of \u201cexcusable neglect or good cause\u201d. Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(5). In the motion, Ucon\u2019s Milwaukee-based counsel asserted: a good faith effort had been made to replace withdrawing Texas counsel; and an extension of time to appeal would not prejudice Sprint because the summary judgment motion had been pending for over a year. On 15 July 2004, the district court granted the motion to withdraw as attorney but, without explanation, denied the motion to extend time.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Concerning that denial, Ucon timely filed a notice of appeal on 16 August 2004. The notice of appeal addressed both the extension-motion-denial and the summary judgment awarded Sprint.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">On 13 October 2004, Sprint moved in our court to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction; Ucon did not respond. By order dated 9 November 2004, that motion was carried with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Subsequently, Ucon filed its opening brief (18 January 2005). It is undisputed that Ucon\u2019s appeal from the summary judgment was not timely. Therefore, at present, our jurisdiction is limited to the denial of Ucon\u2019s motion to extend time to appeal. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>51 F.3d 42, 43 (5th Cir.1995). In the requisite jurisdictional statement in its opening brief, however, Ucon failed to address, or even acknowledge, the extension-motion-denial and instead claimed jurisdiction over the appeal from the summary judgment was proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. And, despite having acknowledged the extension-of-time-to-appeal issue in its notice of appeal, Ucon\u2019s brief addressed only its claims regarding summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">After Sprint addressed the jurisdictional issue in its response brief, Ucon finally addressed the extension-motion-denial in its reply brief. (Ucon claimed that, based on conversations with our clerk\u2019s office, it believed it should not address this issue in its opening brief, <em>despite </em>its having failed to respond to Sprint\u2019s motion to dismiss.) Obviously, because Ucon listed the extension-motion-denial in its notice of appeal, it should have addressed the issue in its opening brief, which was filed after Sprint\u2019s motion to dismiss was carried with the case. For that reason alone, we could dismiss. Moreover, the conduct by Ucon\u2019s counsel borders on being sanctionable; this is especially true for the misleading jurisdictional statement in Ucon\u2019s opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">In the alternative, because Ucon did not demonstrate good cause or excusable neglect, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ucon\u2019s extension motion. <em>See Midwest Employers Cas. Co. v. Williams, </em>161 F.3d 877, 882 (5th Cir.1998) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>(applying abuse of discretion standard to district court decision to extend time to appeal). For example, in <em>Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. Partnership, </em>the Supreme Court determined a lawyer\u2019s failure to meet a bankruptcy court deadline was excusable neglect because the deadline notice provided by the bankruptcy court was inadequate. 507 U.S. 380, 395-97, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993); <em>see also Halicki v. Louisiana Casino Cruises, Inc., </em>151 F.3d 465, 469 (5th Cir.1998) (adopting the <em>Pioneer </em>standard for Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(5)), <em>cert. denied, </em>526 U.S. 1005, 119 S.Ct. 1143, 143 L.Ed.2d 210 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">In its reply brief, Ucon primarily claims its failure to timely appeal was due to its inability to obtain qualified appellate counsel. Needless to say, this is not a sufficient basis for the requisite good cause or excusable neglect; and Ucon has cited no case holding that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Because Ucon\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely as to any other issues, we do not have jurisdiction to review them.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b635-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
