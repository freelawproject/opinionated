In his petition for review, Musoke contends that the Board and Immigration Judge erred in denying his applications for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-24\">\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevie, </em>467 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). To qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture, a petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004). Based on our review of the record, we find that Musoke has failed to meet these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
