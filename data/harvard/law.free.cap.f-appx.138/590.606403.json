Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 366 (4th Cir.2004). We will reverse this decision only if the evidence \u201c \u2018was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision and find substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Chen failed to establish the past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2004) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483, 112 S.Ct. 812 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Accordingly, we deny Chen\u2019s petition for review. We grant the Government\u2019s motion to strike the portions of the joint appendix that are not part of the administrative record, and the portions of Chen\u2019s brief that reference these documents. <em>See generally </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(a). We also grant the Government\u2019s motion to supplement the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(e)(2); 4th Cir. R. 10(e). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
