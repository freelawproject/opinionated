INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Because the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, however, the IJ\u2019s decision is the final agency determination for judicial review. <em>See id.; Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir.2003) (BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedure does not deprive court of basis for judicial review).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-18\">The determination that Kadival is not eligible for withholding of removal is a factual finding reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002). The substantial-evidence standard requires only that the BIA\u2019s conclusion be based on the evidence presented and be substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). This court must defer to the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-19\">\u201cTo be eligible for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate a \u2018clear probability\u2019 of persecution upon return.\u201d <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cA clear probability means that it is more likely than not that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on account of either his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To establish \u201cpersecution,\u201d the alien must show that he will suffer harm to punish him for possessing a belief or characteristic a persecutor seeks to overcome. <em>Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994). The alien must present specific facts demonstrating a reason to fear that he will be singled out for persecution be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>cause of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Kadival, a Muslim, contends that he will be subject to persecution by the Shiv Sena, a Hindu group, if he returns to India. Kadival does not address directly the IJ\u2019s determinations with regard to his credibility and his ability to avoid religious violence by relocating. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). Instead, he argues that the record shows that conditions for Muslims generally have deteriorated further.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The IJ\u2019s determinations, that Kadival had not shown a clear probability of persecution on his return to India and that it was reasonable for Kadival to avoid persecution by relocating within India, were supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Roy, </em>389 F.3d at 138. Kadival has not shown that the record compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See Faddoul, </em>37 F.3d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">To warrant the grant of a petition for review regarding a CAT claim, the record must compel a finding that Kadival met his burden to show that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to India. <em>See Bah v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 348, 352 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Although Kadival insists that the Shiv Sena has ties to the government and there is some support for this contention in the record, he does not present any argument with regard to the IJ\u2019s determination that he could reasonably relocate within India to avoid the Shiv Sena. The IJ\u2019s determination that Kadival is not entitled to relief under the CAT is supported by substantial evidence and Kadival has not shown that the record compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See Bah, </em>341 F.3d at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">Kadival contends that the proceedings were terminated because Notice to Appear bore an incorrect date. Because the issue was not briefed, it is waived. <em>See Communication Workers of America v. Ector County Hosp. Disk, </em>392 F.3d 733, 748 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-13\">The petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b735-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
