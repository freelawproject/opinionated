Stat. ch. \u00a7 61.08 <em>et seq. </em>After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">In a separate state court case, the Florida state trial court awarded alimony to Mrs. Elaine Greenberg, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. \u00a7 61.08. Subsequently, Mr. Greenberg, <em>pro se, </em>filed a complaint in federal court challenging the constitutionality of Florida\u2019s alimony provisions. Upon the defendants\u2019 motion, the district court dismissed Greenberg\u2019s complaint. Greenberg appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-18\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b226-19\">A. Facial Constitutional Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b226-20\">On appeal, Greenberg argues that the alimony provisions in Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 61.08 <em>et seq., </em>are facially unconstitutional because they violate: (1) the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; (2) the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) the Thirteenth Amendment\u2019s ban on involuntary servitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-21\">1. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b226-22\">We first conclude that Greenberg has failed to state a substantive due process claim. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no \u201cState [shall] deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. Substantive due process protects those rights that are considered \u201cfundamental\u201d or \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>McKinney v. Pate, </em>20 F.3d 1550, 1556 (11th Cir.1994) <em>(en banc) </em>(quotation marks omitted). This Court has recognized that \u201cthe right to marry is a fundamental right protected by the substantive component of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment....\u201d <em>Parks v. City of Warner Robins, Ga., </em>43 F.3d 609, 613 (11th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey, </em>505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992); <em>Zablocki v. Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374, 98 S.Ct. 673, 54 L.Ed.2d 618 (1978); <em>Loving v. Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967); <em>McCabe v. Sharrett, </em>12 F.3d 1558 (11th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Greenberg argues that the district court erred in failing to apply the strict scrutiny standard of review to Fla. Stat. ch. \u00a7 61.08. We disagree. \u201c[T]he Supreme Court has held that not every statute \u2018which relates in any way to the incidents of or prerequisites for marriage\u2019 must be subjected to strict scrutiny.\u201d <em>Parks, </em>43 F.3d at 613 (quoting <em>Zablocki, </em>434 U.S. at 386, 98 S.Ct. at 681). \u201c \u2018To the contrary, reasonable regulations that do not <em>significantly interfere </em>with decisions to enter into the marital relationship may legitimately be imposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Zablocki, </em>434 U.S. at 386, 98 S.Ct. at 681). \u201cA statutory classification must interfere \u2018directly and substantially\u2019 with the right to marry before it violates the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Zablocki, </em>434 U.S. at 387, 98 S.Ct. at 681).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">We conclude that Florida\u2019s alimony provisions do not directly and substantially interfere with the right to marry. The Florida alimony provisions do not prohibit marriage, nor prevent a person from marrying, nor substantially interfere with the right to marry. Moreover, the alimony provisions do not prohibit divorce, prevent a person from dissolving his or her marriage, nor substantially interfere with the decision to divorce. Indeed, the alimony provisions do not affect a Floridian\u2019s ability to obtain a divorce or to remarry. The Florida provisions simply provide a mechanism for parties to receive spousal support while they dissolve their marriage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Because Florida\u2019s alimony provisions do not directly and substantially interfere with the right to marry, we subject the provisions to rational basis scrutiny. <em>Parks, </em>43 F.3d at 614-15. Rational basis review only requires that a statute be \u201crationally related to the achievement of a legitimate government purpose.\u201d <em>Gary v. City of Warner Robins, Ga., </em>311 F.3d 1334, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation marks and citation omitted). We conclude, and Greenberg does not dispute, that the alimony provisions satisfy rational basis review. Thus, Greenberg has failed to state a substantive due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">2. Equal Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state shall \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>In <em>Orr v. Orr, </em>440 U.S. 268, 282-83, 99 S.Ct. 1102, 1112-14, 59 L.Ed.2d 306 (1979), the Supreme Court struck down Alabama\u2019s alimony statute because it allowed wives, not husbands, to receive alimony. The Alabama alimony statute on its face treated men filing for divorce differently than women, even though the two were similarly situated. Applying intermediate scrutiny, the Supreme Court determined that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">In this case, Greenberg has not alleged that the Florida alimony provisions on their face create classifications between similarly situated people. Any party filing for divorce has the right to request alimony pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. \u00a7 61.08. Accordingly, Greenberg has failed to state a claim under the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">3. Involuntary Servitude</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The Thirteenth Amendment provides that \u201c[njeither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime ..., shall exist within the United States.... \u201d U.S. Const. Amend XIII, \u00a7 1. As stated by the Supreme Court, \u201c[t]he primary purpose of the [Thirteenth] Amendment was to abolish the institution of African slavery as it had existed in the United States at the time of the Civil War.... \u201d <em>United States v. Kozminski, </em>487 U.S. 931, 942, 108 S.Ct. 2751, 2759, 101 L.Ed.2d 788 (1988). In <em>Kozminski, </em>the Supreme Court noted that \u201cin every case in which this Court has found a condition of involuntary servitude, the victim had no available choice but to work or be subject to legal sanction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943, 108 S.Ct. at 2760.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">In this case, Greenberg has failed to state a cause of action under the Thirteenth Amendment. Alimony is not the type of subject matter the Thirteenth Amendment was designed to address. Further, the Florida alimony provisions do not employ the use of physical or legal coercion to force people into involuntary servitude. Although Floridians who are required to pay alimony must do so or face consequences, such as being held in contempt of court, the district court correctly concluded that this does not amount to involuntary servitude.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">B. As Applied Constitutional Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"AxU\">Although the district court had jurisdiction to address Greenberg\u2019s facial constitutional challenges to Fla. Stat. ch. \u00a7 61.08 <em>et seq., </em>the district court correctly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine to address Greenberg\u2019s \u201cas applied\u201d constitutional challenge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In contrast to the facial constitutional challenge, Greenberg\u2019s as applied challenge is inextricably intertwined with the state court proceedings and is barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">According to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, \u201c \u2018a United States District Court has no authority to review final judgments of a state court in judicial proceedings. Review of such judgments may be had only in [the United States Supreme Court].\u2019 \u201d <em>Powell v. Powell, </em>80 F.3d 464, 466 (11th Cir.1996) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 482, 103 S.Ct. at 1315). \u201cThe doctrine applies not only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>claims actually raised in the state court, but also to claims that were not raised in the state court but are \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with the state court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Powell, </em>80 F.3d at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The Florida state trial court awarded alimony to Mrs. Greenberg, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. \u00a7 61.08. Mr. Greenberg\u2019s claim that the alimony provisions are unconstitutional as applied to him is inextricably intertwined with the state court\u2019s decision to award alimony to Mrs. Green-berg. If we were now to hold that the Florida trial court unconstitutionally applied the Florida alimony provisions as to Greenberg, we would \u201ceffectively nullify\u201d the state court\u2019s judgment that Mrs. Greenberg receive alimony. <em>See Powell, </em>80 F.3d at 467 (holding that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>barred \u201cas applied\u201d challenge to state court decision to distribute a portion of husband\u2019s naval retirement pay to wife upon divorce).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Thus, the district court properly dismissed Greenberg\u2019s as applied challenge for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court properly dismissed Greenberg\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-6\">. Although there is no decision directly on point under the United States Constitution, the Florida courts have rejected a constitutional challenge to Florida's alimony provisions under the Florida Constitution. <em>See Pacheco v. Pacheco, </em>246 So.2d 778, 782 (Fla. 1971) (considering under the Florida Constitution the constitutionality of permitting the denial of alimony to an adulterous wife, and concluding that, \" \u00a7 61.08 is a valid exercise of the State\u2019s police power and does not contravene constitutional assurances of due process and equal protection\u2019\u2019); <em>see also Bama v. Bama, </em>850 So.2d 603, 604 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2003) (finding constitutional attack on Florida alimony provisions to be so frivolous as to support the award of attorney\u2019s fees against the party who asserted it).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\">. Greenberg also argues that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing because the district court failed to accept the facts in his complaint as true; however, he fails to state any specific examples of facts that the district court did not accept as true.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b228-13\">. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is based on the following two cases: <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b229-12\">. This Court does have jurisdiction to hear Greenberg\u2019s facial challenge to the alimony provisions. This facial challenge is not \"inextricably intertwined\u201d because this claim does not succeed only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it. <em>See Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 482-83 &amp; 486, 103 S.Ct. at 1315-16 &amp; 1317 (stating that federal courts \"have subject matter jurisdiction over general challenges to state [statutes] ... which do not require review of a final state-court judgment in a particular case\u201d); <em>see also Dale v. Moore, </em>121 F.3d 624, 626-27 (11th Cir.1997) (noting that district courts have jurisdiction over facial constitutional challenges); <em>Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maryland </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>868 F.2d 1550, 1554 (11th Cir.1989) (\"Thus, although federal district courts have jurisdiction over general constitutional challenges, <em>Hooker </em>and <em>Feldman </em>prohibit such courts from exercising jurisdiction to decide federal issues that are inextricably intertwined with a state court\u2019s judgment.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
