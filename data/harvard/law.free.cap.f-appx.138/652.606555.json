We deny review.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">An alien may seek review of a final order of removal by fifing a petition with this court within 30 days following the date of the final order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1) (2000). The timely filing of a petition for review is a jurisdictional requirement, the absence of which deprives us of jurisdiction to review a decision of the BIA. <em>See Karimian-Kaklaki v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 108, 111-12 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The evidence supports a finding that on April 12, 2004 we received Shaikh\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s March 16, 2004 order. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 25(a)(2)(A) (fifing complete when clerk receives papers); <em>see also Ward v. Atlantic Coast Line R., </em>265 F.2d 75, 80-81 (5th Cir.1959), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>362 U.S. 396, 80 S.Ct. 789, 4 L.Ed.2d 820 (1960). As that filing was timely, we have jurisdiction to consider the merits of Shaikh\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Shaikh does not explicitly challenge the BIA\u2019s conclusion that he is not eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the CAT Act. Therefore, these issues are deemed abandoned. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986). Shaikh does, however, assert that the IJ erred in finding him not credible. On appeal, Shaikh has failed to demonstrate that the IJ\u2019s resolution of the credibility issue is not supported by substantial evidence and that the record compels a credibility determination contrary to that of the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">Shaikh argues on appeal that the BIA erred in denying his motion to reopen, but he did not file a petition for review relative to the BIA\u2019s July 16, 2004, order denying his motion to reopen. Therefore, we have no jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252; <em>Karimiarir-Kaklaki, </em>997 F.2d at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Accordingly, Shaikh\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b680-40\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
