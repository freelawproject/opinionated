After an investigation that included polygraph examinations and the conclusion that there had been a pattern of missing funds when McAdams was working, she was terminated. After filing a charge of discrimination with the Texas Commission on Human Rights, she sued the city, alleging race discrimination and the violation of her constitutional right against self incrimination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>As the district court noted, however, \u201cOther than filing this suit, McAdams has not engaged in steps necessary to prosecute it.\u201d McAdams failed to respond to requests for admissions and otherwise neglected to conduct any discovery or place any evidence in the record. Consequently, on the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court dismissed Mc-Adams\u2019s claims and entered judgment in favor of Huntsville. The court then granted McAdams\u2019s motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>for purposes of appeal. Mc-Adams later filed a \u201cMotion To Appeal Petition to Dismiss,\u201d which the district court treated as a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Pending before this court is Mc-Adams\u2019s \u201cMotion for Transcript,\u201d which requests an order directing the city to provide her with a copy of the transcript of her grievance hearing held by the city council. We treat this motion as tantamount to a motion to compel. This court is not the correct forum in which to conduct discovery. The proper method for pursuing this evidence would have been the filing of a similar motion in the district court before the discovery cut-off deadline. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a); 16(b). A court of appeals will not consider evidence not presented to the district court. <em>Stults v. Conoco, Inc., </em>76 F.3d 651, 657 (5th Cir.1996). McAdams\u2019s motion is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">In its motion for summary judgment, the city contended that McAdams had failed to establish even a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, and even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that such a case could be made, it argued that it has provided a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for McAdams\u2019s termination. As the district court noted, the city \u201cpresented evidence as to the basis for its conclusion that McAdams had taken money from her cash drawer.\u201d Mc-Adams, on the other hand, \u201cfailed to show any disputed facts supporting her claim that the City did not actually believe that allegation but instead used it as a pretext for an otherwise discriminatory dismissal.\u201d Because McAdams raised no genuine issues of material fact, summary judgment was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">Similarly, McAdams failed to enter into the record any evidence supporting her claims of deprivation of her Fifth Amendment or due process rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Those claims were also, therefore, properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">On appeal, McAdams argues that her failure to respond to repeated discovery requests and to the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment was the result of her eviction from her home and therefore constituted excusable neglect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the record reflects that either the plaintiff or someone else named \u201cMcAdams\u201d signed for all of the relevant correspondence, including the Joint Case Management Plan, discovery requests, and motion for summary judgment. In the end, regardless of her lack of response to correspondence, McAdams never provided any evidence to support her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>The judgment is AFFIRMED, and all pending motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b641-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AyZ\">. Although McAdams\u2019s complaint did not explicitly reference the operative statutes, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>city and the court have interpreted Mc-Adams\u2019s complaint as alleging violations of title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(a)(l), and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-9\">. A panel of this court denied the city\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b642-14\">. There is no evidence in the record to confirm this claim, and it does not appear that McAdams ever raised this issue with the district court before entry of judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
