On appeal, Massey\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), claiming there are no meritorious issues on appeal, but raising the question of whether the district court abused its discretion by sentencing Massey to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment. Massey filed a pro se supplemental brief raising several issues with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence and the effectiveness of counsel. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-24\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992). The district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2004). Factual determinations are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Carothers, </em>337 F.3d 1017, 1019 (8th Cir. 2003). We find the evidence was more than sufficient to support the court\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>sion to revoke supervised release. With respect to Massey\u2019s sentence, it did not exceed the statutory maximum and was plainly reasonable. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">With respect to Massey\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we have held that claims of ineffective assistance should be raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion in the district court rather than on appeal, unless the record conclusively shows ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Because the record does not conclusively show Massey\u2019s counsel was ineffective, the claim is not reviewable. We have reviewed Massey\u2019s remaining claims and find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Massey\u2019s judgment. This court requires counsel to inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
