United States, </em>331 F.3d 1210, 1213-14 (11th Cir.2003). Even if a defendant waives his right to object to the initial restitution calculation, however, a district court can modify a restitution order to reflect \u201ca <em>bona fide </em>change in the defendant\u2019s financial condition, either positive or negative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1215, <em>citing </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Keys failed to challenge the district court\u2019s restitution calculation either at his sentencing hearing or on direct appeal, and has failed to demonstrate the existence of exceptional circumstances that would excuse such failure. Consequently, he has waived his right to object to the initial restitution calculation. <em>See id. </em>at 1213-14. Furthermore, Keys has failed to demonstrate that his economic circumstances have changed in any way since the imposition of his sentence, thereby justifying a modification to the restitution order. Accordingly, Keys\u2019 \u201cpresent financial status is no different from that contemplated by the district court when it imposed the restitution order.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1216. The district court did not err in denying his motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-9\">.
