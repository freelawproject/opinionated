The order denied his motion to reopen the Board\u2019s summary dismissal of his appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s order denying relief from removal. We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E); 1003.2(a)(2005). In addition, we deny Ekanem\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(f)(2) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-25\">Accordingly, though we grant Ekanem\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-26\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
