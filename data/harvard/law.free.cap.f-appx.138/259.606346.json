Zorrilla argues on appeal that the district court committed reversible error in sentencing him under the then-mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cfederal guidelines\u201d), and based on facts that neither were charged in his indictment, nor admitted by him, in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) . For the reasons set forth more fully below, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-17\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment against Zorrilla, charging him with the above-referenced offenses. This indictment did not include a drug amount, other than the statutory amount of 100 grams or more of heroin. Zorrilla subsequently pled guilty to both counts in his indictment, without the benefit of a plea agreement. During Zorrilla\u2019s plea colloquy, he agreed that the government could show that he was responsible for 100 grams or more of heroin, but he disputed the exact amount of heroin proffered by the government, that is, 494 grams. At the conclusion of this hearing, the court determined that Zorrilla\u2019s plea was free and voluntary, and it adjudicated him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-18\">Prior to sentencing, a probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), which included the following description of Zorrilla\u2019s offense conduct. After receiving information from a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d), that a person in Miami named Juan Sanchez-Lemus was offering to sell heroin, agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) directed the Cl to initiate a drug transaction with Sanchez-Lemus. The Cl and Sanchez-Lemus, thereafter, agreed that a courier from Detroit, Michigan, who actually was an undercover agent (\u201cUC\u201d), would travel to Miami with a partial payment of $16,000, in exchange for SanchezLemus supplying an unidentified amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>of heroin. The UC met with the CS and Sanehez-Lemus at a mall in Miami, at which time Sanehez-Lemus, who was accompanied by a person later identified as Zorrilla, told the UC that Zorrilla would conduct the transaction. The UC then followed Zorrilla to a vehicle in the mall\u2019s parking lot, in which Zorrilla handed the UC a small shopping bag containing a diaper with a brown powder inside of it. A subsequent laboratory analysis by the DEA revealed that 494.9 grams of heroin were recovered from this diaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In addition to this offense conduct, the PSI grouped together Zorrilla\u2019s two offenses, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d); determined that he was responsible for 494.9 gram of heroin; and set his offense level at 28, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(6) (offense level applicable for offenses involving at least 400 grams, but less than 700 grams, of heroin). The probation officer also recommended a three-level downward adjustment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, for acceptance of responsibility. With an adjusted offense level of 25, and a criminal history category of II, Zorrilla\u2019s resulting guideline range was 63 to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Zorrilla objected to the PSI\u2019s failure to recommend an adjustment for his minor role in the offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3131.2(b), arguing that he was the least culpable person involved in the conspiracy. Zorrilla also generally objected to the district court\u2019s use of the federal guidelines, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely. </em>The government responded that (1) no minor-role adjustment was warranted because Zorrilla played a substantial role in the conspiracy, and (2) we had directed district courts to continue sentencing defendants under the federal guidelines unless and until the Supreme Court reached a contrary conclusion in then-pending cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">On September 28, 2004, at sentencing, Zorrilla renewed his objection to the PSI\u2019s failure to recommend a \u00a7 3131.2(b) adjustment, which the government again opposed. The district court overruled this objection, determining that Zorrilla was a substantial participant in a conspiracy involving a significant amount of drugs. Zorrilla also again raised a summary objection to the court\u2019s use of the federal guidelines, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely. </em>The district court overruled Zorrilla\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection, citing to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Reese. </em>After adopting the PSI\u2019s finding and confirming that neither party objected to a sentence at the low end of the guideline range, the court ultimately sentenced Zorrilla to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment, 4 years\u2019 supervised release, and a $200 special assessment fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Zorrilla argues on appeal, albeit in the portion of his brief labeled \u201csummary of his argument,\u201d that preserved <em>Blakely /Booker </em>error occurred because the court (1) sentenced him based on the then-mandatory federal guidelines, and (2) determined that he was responsible for 494.9 grams of heroin. Zorrilla also contends that these errors were not harmless because, given the opportunity to consider factors other than the federal guidelines, the court could have imposed a lesser sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">As a preliminary matter, the government is arguing that Zorrilla has abandoned his constitutional <em>Booker </em>argument by only including it in the summary por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>tion of his appeal brief. An appellant\u2019s brief must contain his argument, including (1) the appellant\u2019s contentions and reasons for them, (2) citations to relevant portions of the record and to supporting legal authority, and (3) the applicable standard of review for each issue. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(9). In addition, we have determined that \u201ca party seeking to raise a claim or issue on appeal must plainly and prominently so indicate. Otherwise, the issue\u2014 even if properly preserved at trial \u2014 will be considered abandoned.\u201d <em>See United States v. Jemigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">In <em>Jemigan, </em>we concluded that the appellant abandoned his challenge to a ruling under Fed.R.Crim.P. 404(b), by only making four passing references to the evidence at issue, each of which was embedded under different topical headings and was \u201cundertaken as background to,\u201d or buried in, the claims the appellant expressly advanced. <em>See id. </em>We explained that its requirement that claims be \u201cunambiguously demarcated\u201d \u201cstems from the obvious need to avoid confusion as to the issues that are in play and those that are not.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Similarly, in <em>Kelliher v. Veneman, </em>313 F.3d 1270 (11th Cir.2002)\u2014the case on which the government relies in arguing waiver \u2014 we concluded that the appellant waived an appellate claim by only mentioning it in the argument section of his initial brief, and by making no arguments on its merits. <em>See id. </em>at 1274 n. 3</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In the instant case, Zorrilla has set forth in the section of his brief labeled \u201csummary of the argument\u201d the district court\u2019s alleged errors under <em>Booker, </em>while he explained in the \u201cargument\u201d section of his brief why these errors were preserved and not harmless. However, unlike the facts in <em>Jemigan </em>and <em>Kelliher, </em>Zorrilla has notified the government and this Court what claims are being advanced, as well as providing supporting arguments for these claims. <em>Cf. Jemigan, </em>341 F.3d at 1283 n.8; <em>Kelliher, </em>313 F.3d at 1274 n. 3. Thus, although Zorrilla ideally should have placed all of his arguments in the \u201cargument\u201d section of his brief, we do not conclude that he has abandoned any of them by not arguing them on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Zorrilla also properly preserved both his constitutional and non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>claims in the district court by citing to <em>Blakely </em>in his objections to the PSI and at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that a defendant either must (1) refer to the Sixth Amendment; (2) <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or another other related case; (3) assert his right to have the jury decide the disputed fact; or (4) raise a challenge to the role of the judge as factfinder to preserve a <em>Blakely /Booker </em>claim). Because Zorrilla timely raised a <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court, we review his <em>Blakely /Booker </em>claim on appeal <em>de novo, </em>but reverse only for harmful error. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). Under harmless-error review, the government carries the burden of proof. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. Before Zorrilla\u2019s sentencing hearing, the Supreme Court revisited that rule in <em>Blakely, </em>in the context of Washington state\u2019s sentencing guideline scheme, and clarified that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>verdict or admitted by the defendant.... </em>In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at-, 124 S.Ct. at 2537 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Applying these principles, the Supreme Court held that Blakely\u2019s sentence \u2014 which was enhanced under the state guidelines based on the sentencing court\u2019s additional finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Blakely committed his kidnaping offense with deliberate cruelty \u2014 violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at-, 124 S.Ct. at 2534-38. In a footnote, however, the Court explicitly remarked that \u201c[t]he Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-n. 9,124 S.Ct. at 2538 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">While the instant case was pending on appeal, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker, </em>finding \u201cno distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue\u201d in <em>Blakely. Booker, </em>543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 749. Resolving the constitutional question left open in <em>Blakely, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the federal guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 749-51. In extending its holding in <em>Blakely </em>to the Guidelines, the Court explicitly reaffirmed its rationale in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">In a second and separate majority opinion, the Court in <em>Booker </em>concluded that, to best preserve Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the appropriate remedy was to \u201cexcise\u201d two specific sections\u201418 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (requiring a sentence within the guideline range, absent a departure) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (establishing standards of review on appeal, including <em>de novo </em>review of departures from the applicable guideline range) \u2014 thereby effectively rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory only. <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 764. Thus, the guidelines range is now advisory; it no longer dictates the final sentencing result but instead is an important sentencing factor that the sentencing court is to consider, along with the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 764-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-19\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>and on remand, we re-examined in <em>United States v. Reese, </em>397 F.3d 1337 (11th Cir.2005), a defendant\u2019s guideline sentence that had been enhanced, over objection, because the defendant had possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense. <em>Id. </em>at 1337. Concluding that the defendant\u2019s sentence was in violation of the Sixth Amendment, we vacated and remanded his sentence and ordered resentencing consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Booker. Id. </em>at 1338.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-20\">In <em>Paz, </em>we similarly examined a <em>Blakely /Booker </em>challenge to a guideline enhancement based on the district court\u2019s factual finding on an amount of loss involved in an offense. <em>Paz, 405 F.3d </em>at 947. We determined that the defendant\u2019s sentence was erroneous because (1) it was based on judicially determined facts that were not admitted by the defendant, and (2) it was enhanced under a mandatory guidelines system. <em>Id. </em>at 948. Moreover, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>eluded that the government could not show that these errors were harmless because the sentencing transcript clearly showed that, had the district court treated the federal guidelines as advisory, the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment would have been shorter. <em>Id. </em>at 948-49. We, therefore, vacated and remanded Paz\u2019s sentence for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker. Id. </em>at 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Here, the court set Zorrilla\u2019s base offense level at 28, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(6), based on the judicially determined fact that Zorrilla was responsible for 494.9 grams of heroin. Moreover, Zorrilla did not admit to this specific drug amount during his plea colloquy. Nevertheless, Zorrilla admitted this drug amount at sentencing by not disputing this fact in his PSI. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that sentence enhancement based on drug quantity did not violate <em>Booker </em>where the defendant did not dispute the facts in the PSI); <em>United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183 (11th Cir.2005) (rejecting <em>Booker </em>challenge under plain-error review because the defendant admitted facts relating to his relevant conduct by abandoning at sentencing his objections to various factual statements in the PSI). Thus, the court\u2019s determination of drug amount did not result in a Sixth Amendment violation under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">As the government concedes, however, the court sentenced Zorrilla with the understanding that the federal guidelines were mandatory, instead of advisory. A non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error, therefore, occurred. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31 (concluding that statutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory [guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">We have determined that there are two harmless error standards for <em>Booker </em>errors, dependent on whether the error is constitutional or statutory. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1290 (11th Cir.2005). We explained in <em>Paz </em>\u2014 an appeal involving a constitutional <em>Booker </em>error \u2014 that, when a constitutional <em>Booker </em>error occurs, the government only may establish that it was harmless by showing, under a heightened standard, that \u201cit is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the sentence obtained.\u201d <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948 (internal quotation and marks omitted). On the other hand, in <em>Mathenia, </em>we determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">non-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-10\"><em>Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1290 (internal quotations and marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">We further explained in <em>Mathenia </em>that \u201c[t]he non-constitutional harmless error standard is not easy for the government to meet. It is as difficult for the government to meet that standard as it is for a defendant to meet the third-prong prejudice standard for plain error review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>1291. Nevertheless, we concluded that the government had met this burden by citing to a statement by the district court that, if the Supreme Court determined that the federal guidelines were unconstitutional as mandatorily applied, the district court \u201cnonetheless [would] consider the guidelines as \u2014 for their persuasive value or as advisory, and the sentence [the court] would impose would be the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292. We, therefore, concluded in <em>Mathenia </em>that the government \u201cdemonstrated with fair assurance that the district court\u2019s error of applying the guidelines in a mandatory fashion did not affect, or had but a slight affect, on [the defendant\u2019s] ultimate sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Because this case involves only a non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error, we must apply the test discussed in <em>Mathenia, </em>instead of the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d test discussed in <em>Paz. </em>The district court did not state that it would have imposed a lighter sentence, but for the mandatory nature of the federal guidelines. However, the court explained that it was following our instruction in <em>Reese </em>that it continue to apply the then-mandatory federal guidelines. The court, without objection, also sentenced Zorrilla at the bottom of his guideline range. <em>But see United States v. Fields, </em>408 F.3d 1356, 1358 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding, under plain-error review, that the fact that the defendant was sentenced at the bottom his mandatory guideline range, without more, is insufficient evidence for the defendant to satisfy the prejudice prong).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Moreover, as the government concedes, unlike the facts in <em>Mathenia </em>and <em>Robles, </em>it cannot cite to evidence in the record showing that the court would have imposed an identical sentence if it had been proceeding under an advisory-guideline system. Because the record does not show \u201cwith fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error,\u201d we conclude that the government has not shown that Zorrilla\u2019s substantial rights were not violated, and, thus, it has not proven that the <em>Booker </em>error was harmless.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Mathenia, </em>at 1292; <em>see also United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir. 2005) (concluding that, despite the district court\u2019s grant of a motion for a downward departure for substantial assistance, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, the government could not show that the court\u2019s mandatory application of the guidelines in sentencing the defendant was harmless, because the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion only gave the court limited discretion in considering the defendant\u2019s assistance). We, therefore, vacate and remand for resentencing consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\">.
