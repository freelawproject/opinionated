Carolina Casualty claims that D <em>&amp; </em>G made material misrepresentations in its application for \u201cLawyers\u2019 Professional Liability Insurance\u201d by failing to divulge approximately 500 lawsuits filed against it. After both parties filed motions for summary judgment, the district court granted judgment in favor of D &amp; G. Carolina Casualty appeals, and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-21\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Williams v. Staples, Inc., </em>372 F.3d 662, 667 (4th Cir.2004). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Edell &amp; Assocs. v. Law Offices of Peter G. Angelos, </em>264 F.3d 424, 436 (4th Cir.2001). Moreover, when the language of a contract is plain and unambiguous, its interpretation is a question of law that may be determined by the court on a motion for summary judgment. <em>World-Wide Rights Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Combe Inc., </em>955 F.2d 242, 245 (4th Cir.1992). Although the material facts in this case are not in dispute, we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of D &amp; G by misinterpreting the meaning of the phrase \u201cprofessional liability claim\u201d in the Carolina Casualty insurance application.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">D &amp; G specializes in mortgage foreclosures, and its clients are typically mortgage servicing companies or mortgage lenders. In representing its clients in foreclosure actions against debtors, D &amp; G is routinely named as the successor trustee. Quite often, debtors will attempt to block the foreclosure actions against their property and will sue D &amp; G as a party defendant in its capacity as successor trustee. In the five years before applying for professional liability insurance from Carolina Casualty, D &amp; G was named as a party defendant in approximately 500 foreclosure or other similar lawsuits. Moreover, D &amp; G received \u201c[cjountless\u201d claim letters that ultimately did not result in lawsuits. J.A. 186. In reviewing the suits filed and claims made against it, D <em>&amp; </em>G would first determine whether it had made a mistake and, if so, whether the suit or claim posed a significant risk of liability. Because D &amp; G deemed the vast majority of these suits and claims to be frivolous, the firm routinely represented itself in those eases. D &amp; G considered some claims to be somewhat problematic, but the firm nevertheless decided to represent itself also in those matters. Of these problematic cases, D <em>&amp; </em>G ultimately paid settlements ranging from $1,000 to $20,000. The largest settlement \u2014 $20,000 \u2014 involved a suit by a nonclient debtor who alleged that D <em>&amp; </em>G violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act in the course of a foreclosure action. D &amp; G eventually retained counsel in that action after the judge presiding over the case disqualified the firm from representing itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Of the approximately 500 lawsuits filed and numerous claims made against it, D &amp; G considered five claims or suits to pose such a serious risk of liability that it sought defense and indemnity from its previous professional liability insurance carriers. All five suits or claims were brought by <em>nonclients </em>of the firm. Three suits were filed by debtors seeking liability against D <em>&amp; </em>G for its participation in foreclosure actions. One of these three suits was very similar to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act case that D <em>&amp; </em>G settled for $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">In the summer of 2002, David Draper, one of the principals of D <em>&amp; </em>G, began seeking a new professional liability policy for the firm because D &amp; G\u2019s existing carrier had notified the firm that it was discontinuing its professional liability insurance line. Draper was having difficulty obtaining reasonable price quotes from other carriers, so he attended a state bar meeting primarily to contact insurance providers. At the meeting Draper met an insurance broker and explained that his firm had been sued many times in foreclosure actions. The broker inquired how many claims D <em>&amp; </em>G had reported to its insurance carriers seeking defense and indemnification. When Draper informed the broker that D &amp; G had submitted only a few of the numerous suits and claims to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>carriers for coverage, the broker said that she could probably obtain a professional liability policy for the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The broker initially sought insurance for D &amp; G from CNA. CNA, however, rejected D &amp; G\u2019s application because of its policy of not insuring law firms with prior claims. The broker then sent D &amp; G an application form from Carolina Casualty. Question 16 of the Carolina Casualty application asked, \u201cHas any <em>professional liability claim </em>been made against the Applicant Firm ... during the past 5 years?\u201d J.A. 17 (emphasis added). If the applicant answered \u201cyes,\u201d the form directed the applicant to \u201cprovide details on the Claim/Incident Supplemental Form.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The supplemental form directed the applicant to \u201ccomplete one form for each claim, suit, or circumstance during the last 5 years.\u201d J.A. 22. Question 6 of the supplemental form asked, \u201cHas this [claim], suit, or circumstance been <em>reported </em>to any insurance carrier?\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Rather than report the approximately 500 suits filed and the countless claims made against it, D <em>&amp; </em>G instead provided details on the supplemental forms regarding only the five nonclient lawsuits and claims that it had previously submitted to its prior insurance carriers for coverage. Draper interpreted Question 16 as requesting information relating only to suits and claims previously reported to its insurance carrier \u2014 whether by clients or non-clients. His interpretation was influenced by the broker\u2019s comments to him at the bar meeting, suggesting that the insurance company would decide whether to issue a</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">policy based on reported suits and claims only. Draper and the broker never specifically discussed Question 16 on the Carolina Casualty application. On each of the supplemental forms, D <em>&amp; </em>G answered \u201cyes\u201d to Question 6 \u2014 that it had reported the claim or suit to its prior professional liability insurance carrier. D &amp; G verified that all the answers it provided in its application were true.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">A Carolina Casualty underwriter<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reviewed the firm\u2019s application and determined that only four of the five previous incidents reported by D <em>&amp; </em>G were responsive to Question 16. One of the reported incidents was deemed nonresponsive to the question because it occurred more than five years before D &amp; G applied for the Carolina Casualty policy. Based on the four responsive incidents, the underwriter determined that D <em>&amp; </em>G presented a slightly higher probability of future claim activity. The underwriter nevertheless recommended that the risk was acceptable provided that D &amp; G pay a higher deductible and premium. D &amp; G accepted the Carolina Casualty policy, and the parties agree that the application form completed by D &amp; G is part of the contract of insurance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">In May 2003, less than four months after obtaining the Carolina Casualty policy, D &amp; G was sued by a nonclient debtor in an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court arising out of a foreclosure action in Maryland. D &amp; G concedes that the nonclient debtor\u2019s complaint alleges \u201cerrors or omissions by D &amp; G arising out of its profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>sional services.\u201d Response Brief, p. 4. The debtor also sued Option One Mortgage Corporation, the lender that D &amp; G was representing in the underlying foreclosure action. The debtor claims that D &amp; G, as legal counsel for the lender and as substitute trustee in the foreclosure action, submitted sham fees for services that were never performed and other fees that were well in excess of the reasonable and customary charges. Among several other claims, the debtor alleges that D &amp; G breached its fiduciary duty to her by claiming bogus and excessive fees in the foreclosure action and that D &amp; G\u2019s conduct constituted a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The debtor seeks class certification, alleging that D &amp; G has charged sham and excessive fees in hundreds of similar foreclosure actions. The debtor also seeks both compensatory and punitive damages in excess of $1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Even though the proposed class action was filed by a nonclient of the firm, D <em>&amp; </em>G reported the lawsuit to Carolina Casualty, seeking defense and indemnification under its \u201clawyer\u2019s professional liability insurance policy.\u201d J.A. 75. Carolina Casualty agreed to provide a defense to D &amp; G under a reservation of rights. Soon after the debtor\u2019s suit was filed, Option One, D <em>&amp; </em>G\u2019s client in the debtor\u2019s foreclosure, demanded defense costs and indemnification from D <em>&amp; </em>G relating to the proposed class action, claiming that the debtor\u2019s claim against Option One arose out of the alleged improper fees charged by D <em>&amp; </em>G. D <em>&amp; </em>G also notified Carolina Casualty about Option One\u2019s claim against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Two weeks later, D <em>&amp; </em>G was sued in a similar proposed class action lawsuit in Maryland state court. The plaintiffs \u2014 all nonclient debtors \u2014 alleged that D &amp; G charged excessive and sham fees in foreclosure actions. Like the adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court, the state court complaint alleges that D &amp; G breached its fiduciary duty to the nonclient debtors and that D &amp; G violated the Fair Debt Collections Practice Act. In addition, the state court complaint alleges a negligence claim against D &amp; G. This complaint, like the bankruptcy adversary proceeding, seeks damages in excess of $1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">D <em>&amp; </em>G promptly notified Carolina Casualty of the Maryland state court lawsuit, seeking defense and indemnity under its \u201cLawyers\u2019 Professional Liability Policy.\u201d J.A. 82. Carolina Casualty agreed to defend and indemnify D &amp; G, but again reserved its rights not to pay punitive damages. Carolina Casualty further reserved its rights to continue to investigate other grounds it might have to avoid providing coverage in both the bankruptcy and Maryland state court lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Soon after receiving notice of the two proposed class action suits against D <em>&amp; </em>G, representatives of Carolina Casualty\u2019s underwriting and claims departments met to discuss the D <em>&amp; </em>G account. During that meeting, one of the representatives did a computer search to see if other lawsuits had been filed against D &amp; G. That search revealed eight other lawsuits that D <em>&amp; </em>G had not reported on its insurance application. Based on this new information, the group determined that it should hire a separate law firm to pursue rescinding the policy issued to D <em>&amp; </em>G. That law firm discovered a total of twenty-four lawsuits filed against D <em>&amp; </em>G that D <em>&amp; </em>G had failed to report on its insurance application. Counsel for Carolina Casualty informed D <em>&amp; </em>G of these newly discovered suits and stated that they could possibly constitute grounds for rescission of the policy. Counsel also stated that Carolina Casualty \u201cis well aware that the potential for a rescission of a policy is a serious matter, and therefore, prior to taking any action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>wanted to raise this issue with [D <em>&amp; </em>G] to obtain as much information as possible.... Specifically an explanation of why [D &amp; G] did not identify these numerous other matters on its application for insurance is needed.\u201d J.A. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In response, D &amp; G asserted that it answered Question 16 on the application correctly. It interpreted Question 16 to mean that \u201cit was only required to advise Carolina Casualty of <em>professional liability claims </em>for damages which D &amp; G had determined needed to be submitted to the E &amp; 0 carrier for indemnification and/or defense____ The [five] cases previously listed by D <em>&amp; </em>G were cases which it felt needed to be reported to the carrier(s) for the carrier(s) to handle.\u201d J.A. 115 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Based on its determination that D &amp; G had materially misrepresented its claims history by failing to report the twenty-four other lawsuits discovered during its investigation, Carolina Casualty brought this action seeking to rescind D &amp; G\u2019s professional liability policy. Carolina Casualty alleges that it would not have issued the policy to D &amp; G had it known of the twenty-four other lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">After the close of discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment in which each party advanced a different interpretation of the phrase \u201cprofessional liability claim\u201d in Question 16 of the insurance application. The district court ruled in favor of D &amp; G deciding, as a matter of law, that the phrase \u201c \u2018professional liability claim\u2019 unambiguously means negligence claims alleged against an attorney by his clients.\u201d J.A. 458. To reach this result, the district court engrafted a limitation under Virginia legal malpractice law providing that Virginia attorneys owe a duty to their clients only. Based on its interpretation that \u201cprofessional liability claims\u201d are necessarily claims by clients only, the district court determined that D &amp; G was not required to divulge any information on the insurance application about the approximately 500 lawsuits against D <em>&amp; </em>G filed by nonclients. Thus, the district court ruled that D &amp; G had truthfully answered Question 16. The district court further determined that D &amp; G\u2019s listing of the five claims by nonclients on the insurance application was merely gratuitous since D <em>&amp; </em>G had no duty to disclose any of the nonclient claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">Carolina Casualty argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of D &amp; G because it answered Question 16 untruthfully by failing to fully report its claims history and that this omission was material to the risk of insuring D &amp; G. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">Under Virginia law, an insured is obligated to answer an application truthfully and fully to give the insurer the opportunity to make its own inquiry and determine whether to undertake the risk. <em>Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co. v. Echols, </em>207 Va. 949, 154 S.E.2d 169, 172 (Va.1967). An insurance company is entitled to rescind a policy of insurance based on a representation in the application only if it clearly proves that (1) the insured\u2019s representation in the application was untrue; and (2) the insurance company\u2019s reliance on the false statement was material to its decision to assume the risk and issue the policy. Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 38.2-809; <em>Commercial Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Hunt &amp; Calderone, P.C., </em>261 Va. 38, 540 S.E.2d 491, 493 (Va.2001). The insurance company is not required to show that the insured\u2019s misrepresentation was willfully false. <em>Chitwood v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>206 Va. 314, 143 S.E.2d 915, 919 (Va.1965); <em>Inter-Ocean Ins. Co. v. Har</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>krader, </em>193 Va. 96, 67 S.E.2d 894, 897-98 (Va.1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">To be entitled to rescind the policy, Carolina Casualty must first clearly prove that D &amp; G misrepresented facts on the application. To determine whether D &amp; G answered Question 16 truthfully, we must first determine the meaning of \u201cprofessional liability claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Under Virginia law, an insurance policy is a contract and, like any other contract, the words used must be given their ordinary and customary meaning if they are susceptible to such a construction. <em>Graphic Arts Mut. Ins. Co. v. C.W. Warthen Co., </em>240 Va. 457, 397 S.E.2d 876, 877 (Va.1990). An insurance provision is ambiguous only if it may reasonably be understood in more than one way or when such language refers to two or more things at the same time. <em>Salzi v. Virginia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., </em>263 Va. 52, 556 S.E.2d 758, 760 (Va.2002). \u201cA well-settled principle of contract law dictates that \u2018where an agreement is complete on its face, is plain and unambiguous in its terms, the court is not at liberty to search for its meaning beyond the instrument itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ross v. Craw, </em>231 Va. 206, 343 S.E.2d 312, 316 (Va.1986) (quoting <em>Globe Iron Constr. Co. v. First Natl Bank of Boston, </em>205 Va. 841, 140 S.E.2d 629, 633 (Va.1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Thus, we begin our review of the meaning of Question 16 by giving the words their ordinary and customary meaning. Question 16 asks, \u201cHas any <em>professional liability claim </em>been made against the Applicant Firm ... during the past 5 years?\u201d J.A. 17 (emphasis added). The plain and ordinary meaning of the words \u201cprofessional liability claim\u201d encompasses any type of claim<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> attempting to assert liability against the applicant law firm arising out of its rendering of legal services.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because Question 16 on its face is susceptible to only one reasonable interpretation, we find it unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">D &amp; G disagrees, arguing instead that \u201cprofessional liability claim\u201d is necessarily limited to only negligence claims against an attorney by his client, <em>i.e, </em>legal malpractice claims. The primary shortcoming of this interpretation is that it is not based on the actual words used in Question 16. Question 16 does not ask the applicant to provide information about negligence claims only, and neither does it limit claims to those made by clients only. These limitations are not found on the face of Question 16. To find them, D <em>&amp; </em>G must import them from the Virginia law of legal malpractice, which the unambiguous words of Question 16 do not require or suggest. D &amp; G has not cited, nor can we find, Virginia case law suggesting that \u201cprofessional liability\u201d is coterminous with \u201clegal malpractice.\u201d Because no ambiguity exists on the face of Question 16, we interpret it according to its plain, ordinary meaning without importing other meanings from outside the text.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">In the alternative, D &amp; G argues that the meaning of \u201cprofessional liability claim\u201d is ambiguous and that we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>construe any ambiguity against Carolina Casualty and in favor of coverage. Because we have already concluded that no ambiguity exists, this argument fails. However, even if we were to conclude that the phrase \u201cprofessional liability claim\u201d is ambiguous, we would not affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment under the unique facts and circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Although Virginia follows the general rule that ambiguities in an insurance contract \u2014 and insurance applications \u2014 will be construed in favor of the insured,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> this rule of contract construction applies when there is evidence that the ambiguity in the insurance application could have misled the applicant into providing false information. <em>See Andrews v. American Health and Life Ins. Co., </em>236 Va. 221, 372 S.E.2d 399, 401 (1988). For instance, in <em>Andrews, </em>the life insurance application inquired whether the applicant had been treated for \u201cepilepsy or nervous disorder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicant did not divulge that he had previously been treated for depression, and the life insurance company issued the policy based on the representations in the application. The insured died soon after obtaining the policy, and his estate made claim for the life insurance benefits. The insurance company sought to rescind the policy based on the insured\u2019s failure to supply information on the insurance application about his prior treatment for depression. <em>Id. </em>The Virginia Supreme Court determined that \u201cnervous disorder\u201d was ambiguous, and the insured could have reasonably read \u201cnervous disorder\u201d not to include the emotional problems for which he had previously received treatment. Construing this ambiguity in favor of coverage, the Virginia Supreme Court ruled that the insurance company failed to clearly prove that the insured answered the insurance application untruthfully. <em>Id. </em>at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Unlike <em>Andrews </em>where there was no evidence of how the insured actually interpreted \u201cnervous disorder,\u201d we have in this case uncontradicted evidence that D &amp; G construed \u201cprofessional liability claim\u201d to include claims by nonclients. In fact, the only claims that D &amp; G divulged in its application were nonclient claims. It cannot now claim, based on its post-litigation construction of Question 16, that an ambiguity misled it into failing to make a full and truthful response. D <em>&amp; </em>G believed that Question 16 encompassed claims by nonclients, yet it faded to report more than 500 nonclient claims \u2014 some of which were similar to the five claims that it reported on its application and the two claims for which it now seeks a defense and- indemnity from Carolina Casualty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>D <em>&amp; </em>G is not entitled to the benefit of Virginia\u2019s rule of construction in favor of insureds, because it failed to answer Question 16 fully and truthfully under its literal understanding of the question when it completed the application.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">In sum, we conclude that the phrase \u201cprofessional liability claim\u201d unambiguously includes all claims seeking to assert liability against D &amp; G arising out of its practice of law. We also decide that the approximately 500 lawsuits that were filed against D &amp; G in its capacity as foreclosure trustee are \u201cprofessional liability claims.\u201d Because D <em>&amp; </em>G failed to report these claims on its insurance application, we conclude, as a matter of law, that D &amp; G failed to answer Question 16 fully and truthfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">In addition to showing that the insured misrepresented or omitted facts on an insurance application, to be entitled to rescind a policy the insurance company must also clearly prove that the misrepresentation or omission was material to the risk when assumed. <em>Montgomery Mut. Ins. Co. v. Riddle, </em>266 Va. 539, 587 S.E.2d 513, 515 (Va.2003). A false representation is material if a truthful answer would have reasonably influenced the insurance company\u2019s decision to issue the policy. <em>Id.; Echols, </em>154 S.E.2d at 172. When an insurer has proved that the insured misrepresented a fact in the application, the materiality of that misrepresentation is a question of law for the court. <em>United States Fid. and Guar. Co. v. Haywood, </em>211 Va. 394, 177 S.E.2d 530, 532 (Va.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">Two Carolina Casualty representatives testified that the company would not have issued the professional liability policy to D &amp; G had it known of even a small fraction of the hundreds of foreclosure lawsuits that D &amp; G failed to report on its application. These representatives stated that the mere fact that D &amp; G had been named in so many suits rendered D &amp; G an unacceptable risk to Carolina Casualty.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that D &amp; G\u2019s omission of its full claim history was material because Carolina Casualty would have been reasonably influenced to reject D &amp; G\u2019s application for professional liability insurance had it known of D &amp; G\u2019s claim history when it issued the policy. <em>See Inter-Ocean Ins., </em>67 S.E.2d at 896-98 (ruling that insured\u2019s failure to disclose on the application that he had previously been refused insurance was material based on the insurer\u2019s uncontradicted testimony that the application would have been denied had the insured provided a truthful answer).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">Because we conclude as a matter of law that D &amp; G made a material misrepresentation on its application for insurance, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of D &amp; G and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\">.

On the five supplemental forms it completed, it reported both demand letters and lawsuits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b576-13\">. D &amp; G complains that this definition is so broad that it would include a claim by a court reporter for D &amp; G\u2019s failure to pay for a deposition transcript. We disagree. Such a claim would not arise out of the firm\u2019s practice of law. Instead, it would arise out of D &amp; G's breach of its contractual obligation to pay the court reporter for the deposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b577-6\">. This general principle of contract construction should not be applied indiscriminately. It has limits. One implicit limit is Virginia Code \u00a7 38.2-309, which allows an insurer to rescind a policy if it can clearly show, among other things, that the insured answered the <em>insurance application </em>untruthfully. It is clear in this case that D &amp; G answered Question 16 untruthfully \u2014 even according to its own interpretation of the words used \u2014 when it completed the application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b577-7\">. Draper testified that he was influenced by the insurance broker\u2019s questions about how many claims D &amp; G had reported to its prior carriers. Based on the broker\u2019s comments, Draper concluded that the insurance company would be interested only in <em>reported </em>claims \u2014 claims that it had sought a defense and indemnity for from its prior professional liability carriers. This conclusion is soundly contradicted by the record. First, as Draper readily acknowledged in his deposition, there is no language in Question 16 that limits the inquiry to reported claims only. Second, Draper's conversation with the broker occurred several months before the broker provided the Carolina Casualty application to D &amp; G, and the broker did not provide any guidance to D &amp; G relating to Question 16. Third, the supplemental form \u2014 which is part of the contract \u2014 asks, \u201cHas this [claim or suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>that you are divulging to Carolina Casualty] been reported to any insurance carrier?\u201d J.A. 22. D &amp; G checked \"yes\u201d rather than \"no\u201d on all five supplemental forms. Accordingly, it is clear that Carolina Casualty wanted to know about reported <em>and. </em>nonreported claims and that D &amp; G had no legitimate basis to believe that Question 16 was literally asking about reported claims only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b578-12\">. Although the district court determined that D &amp; G merely volunteered information regarding nonclient claims, there is no evidence that D &amp; G reported the nonclient claims thinking it was providing nonresponsive information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b578-13\">. This testimony is not surprising especially in light of CNA\u2019s rejection of D &amp; G's application for having previous claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b579-11\">. D &amp; G argues on appeal alternative equitable bases to sustain the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in its favor. The district court did not reach these alternative bases. We have reviewed D &amp; G\u2019s alternative arguments and conclude that they do not entitle D &amp; G to summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b579-6\">HAMILTON, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ayf\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The majority opinion tells us that the meaning of \u201cprofessional liability claim\u201d is clear and unambiguous. In my view, the meaning of \u201cprofessional liability claim\u201d is not so cut-and-dry. Because the term is ambiguous, it must be construed in favor of the insured, Draper &amp; Goldberg (D &amp; G). Construing the term in D &amp; G\u2019s favor, Carolina Casualty Insurance Company (Carolina) is not entitled to rescind the policy. Accordingly, I dissent from the court\u2019s decision to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Question 16 asks, \u201cHas any professional liability claim been made against the Applicant Firm, or any predecessor in business, or any of the past or present lawyers in the firm, during the past 5 years?\u201d (J.A. 17). The parties concede that the application does not define the term \u201cprofessional liability claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The standard to be applied here is not in dispute. Under Virginia law, we must give the words used in an insurance contract their ordinary and customary meaning. <em>Graphic Arts Mut. Ins. Co. v. C.W. Warthen Co., </em>240 Va. 457, 397 S.E.2d 876, 877 (Va.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">The term \u201cprofessional\u201d is defined as \u201cfollowing an occupation as a means of livelihood.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>1056 (2000). There appears to be no dispute that the profession referred to in Question 16 is the practice of law by the lawyers of D <em>&amp; </em>G. A \u201clawyer\u201d is defined as a \u201cperson whose profession is to represent clients in a court of law or to advise or act for them in other legal matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 752. \u201cLiability\u201d is defined as the state of being \u201clegally responsible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">Because the term \u201clawyer\u201d has traditionally been associated with the representation of clients, it certainly is reasonable to conclude that \u201cprofession,\u201d in the legal context, relates to the representation of clients, not nonclients. Thus, it follows that a reasonable construction of the term \u201cprofessional liability claim\u201d is a claim made by a client against the attorney who represented the client for damages or other relief arising from the representation. <em>Cf. Ayyildiz v. Kidd, </em>220 Va. 1080, 266 S.E.2d 108, 112 (Va.1980) (noting that an \u201cattorney\u2019s liability for damages generally is only to his client following some dereliction of duty to the client\u201d). Under this interpretation of \u201cprofessional liability claim,\u201d D &amp; G was not required to disclose the 500 lawsuits at issue. This is so because it is undisputed by all parties, including the majority, <em>see ante </em>at-, that the 500 lawsuits at issue do not involve claims made by past or present clients of D&amp;G.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-15\">That is not to say that the above interpretation, which was adopted by the district court, is the only reasonable interpretation of the term \u201cprofessional liability claim.\u201d The majority itself provides such an interpretation. They conclude the \u201cplain and ordinary meaning of the words \u2018professional liability claim\u2019 encompasses any type of claim attempting to assert liability against the applicant law firm arising out of its rendering of legal services.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at---. According to this definition, if the claim arose from the ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>dering of legal services, then the claim was required to be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">It is arguable that performing the duties of a successor trustee does not involve the rendering of legal services, as nonlawyers may be appointed successor trustees. <em>Cf. Cohen v. Employers Reinsurance Corp., </em>117 A.D.2d 435, 503 N.Y.S.2d 33, 34-35 (1st Dep\u2019t 1986) (holding that, unless the policy specifically insures the attorney for liability arising out of an act or omission while serving as a trustee, such activities are not covered by a policy which limited coverage to claims arising out of the performance of professional services in the insured\u2019s capacity as a lawyer). However, it is plausible to interpret \u201cprofessional liability claim\u201d to include claims arising out of a lawyer\u2019s performance of successor trustee duties. Given such an interpretation, D &amp; G would have been required to disclose the 500 lawsuits at issue in this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">With two reasonable and logical interpretations of the term \u201cprofessional liability claim,\u201d one in favor of coverage and one against, the term unquestionably is ambiguous. Indeed, the majority has not identified a single case which provides a definitive definition one way or the other. But, more importantly, even Carolina conceded below that the term was ambiguous. As the district court noted, Carolina conceded that the term was susceptible to more than one interpretation when it stated that the \u201c\u2018five claims reported by D &amp; G in response to Question 16 are not all classic \u201cprofessional liability\u201d claims as the term may be conservatively interpreted.\u2019 \u201d (J.A. 461) (citation omitted); <em>cf. Home Ins. Co. v. Law Offices of Jonathan DeYoung, P.C., </em>32 F.Supp.2d 219, 230 (E.D.Pa. 1998) (noting that \u201cPennsylvania courts have found that where a professional liability insurance policy fails to define \u2018professional services,\u2019 as is the case here, the phrase standing alone can be deemed ambiguous, and therefore, must be construed against the insurer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Under Virginia law, if a term in an insurance contract is ambiguous, \u201cit will be construed against the insurance company and in favor of coverage.\u201d <em>Andrews v. American Health and Life Ins. Co., </em>236 Va. 221, 372 S.E.2d 399, 401 (Va.1988). Applying this long-standing principle, it is evident that Carolina is not entitled to rescission. Question 16 can be read to ask the law-firm applicant to disclose if any of their attorneys had claims made against them by a client for damages or other relief arising from the attorneys\u2019 or the firm\u2019s representation. As the record discloses no such claims, it cannot be said that D <em>&amp; </em>G provided materially false information. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 402 (\u201cBecause we conclude that the phrase \u2018nervous disorder,\u2019 as used in this application, is ambiguous and could be read to refer to only physical disorders, we find that Ballenger did not answer question four untruthfully when he failed to disclose his periods of depression for which he sought medical attention.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Citing <em>Andrews, </em>the majority states that Virginia\u2019s ambiguity rule of insurance contract construction applies only \u201cwhen there is evidence that the ambiguity in the insurance application could have misled the applicant into providing false information.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at -. From this premise, the majority concludes that Virginia\u2019s ambiguity rule does not apply here because D &amp; G construed the term \u201cprofessional liability claim\u201d to include claims by nonclients. One searches in vain in <em>Andrews </em>and Virginia\u2019s ambiguity case law for the subjective intent limitation formulated by the majority. In fact, there is nothing extraordinary about Virginia\u2019s ambiguity rule. As noted above, under Virginia law, \u201c[i]f the term is ambiguous, it will be construed against the insurance company and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>in favor of coverage.\u201d <em>Andrews, </em>372 S.E.2d at 401. Moreover, we examine the language of an insurance contract from an objective, rather than a subjective, standpoint. <em>Cf Dan River, Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>227 Va. 485, 317 S.E.2d 485, 487 (Va.1984) (holding \u201c[t]he interpretation of policy language\u201d authorizing notice when considered appropriate \u201cin the opinion of the insured\u201d nevertheless \u201cdemands an objective determination\u201d made \u201cfrom an objective standpoint\u201d). Thus, what D &amp; G\u2019s principals allegedly understood or did not is of no moment. Rather, what is of consequence is the meaning of \u201cprofessional liability claim\u201d in the objective sense. Under Virginia law, the term is ambiguous and must be construed against Carolina and in favor of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">It follows that I would affirm the well-reasoned opinion of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
