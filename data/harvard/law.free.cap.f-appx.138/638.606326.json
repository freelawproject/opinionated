Ferm\u00edn appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant United Healthcare Insurance Company (\u201cUnited\u201d). Fer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>min, acting as pro se litigant, brought suit against United, asserting a variety of claims based upon United\u2019s denial of coverage for two extended stay visits under three group hospital indemnity plans provided under master group policies issued by United to the American Association of Retired Persons (\u201cAARP\u201d). The plans provided limited hospital benefits to AARP covered members, including Ferm\u00edn.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The district court held that Ferm\u00edn failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted because (1) his claim for violations of 28 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 3.3073, 3.4020 and Tex. Ins.Code arts 3.51-2, 3.70-3 do not apply to the plans at issue and do not afford Ferm\u00edn a private right of action, (2) his claims for violation of 28 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 3.3009 3.3040(d) and Tex. Ins. Code art. 3.70-4-(B) do not apply to the plans or coverage at issue, and (3) Ferm\u00edn has no private right of action for federal criminal mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The district court further held that United properly denied Fermin\u2019s claims for reimbursement for his two facility stays because there was no genuine issue of material fact that the two facilities did not meet the definition of a covered \u201chospital\u201d provided under the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Additionally, the district court granted summary judgment for United on all of Fermin\u2019s claims, included claims for violations of Tex. Ins.Code arts. 21.21, 21.55, and Tex. Bus. &amp; Comm. Code \u00a7\u00a7 17.41-17.43 (\u201cDTPA\u201d), usury, and gross negligence and fraud, because of his failure to adduce evidence or facts supporting any of those claims. The court also held that Ferm\u00edn is not entitled to have the district court reopen a matter before and reconsider an order issued by another district judge. And finally, the court denied Fermin\u2019s request for a trial on the issue of alleged perjury based on United\u2019s consolidation of his AARP accounts because Ferm\u00edn failed to show any change in his coverage as a result of the consolidation or why a trial would be appropriate. Thus, the district court dismissed all of Fermin\u2019s claims with prejudice. Ferm\u00edn timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Blakely v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>406 F.3d 747, 750 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">On appeal, Fermin\u2019s brief raises arguments that fall into two categories: (1) arguments raised for the first time on appeal, and (2) arguments previously raised and properly disposed of by the district court. We do not consider evidence or arguments that were not presented to the district court for its consideration in ruling on the motion. <em>Louque v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>314 F.3d 776, 779-80, n. 1 (5th Cir.2002). As for the arguments raised below, Fermin raises no coherent arguments, nor does he present any evidence to support a finding of judicial error to justify reversal of the district court. Therefore, after a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for United for essentially the reasons as well-stated in its memorandum opinion and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b666-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under tile limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
