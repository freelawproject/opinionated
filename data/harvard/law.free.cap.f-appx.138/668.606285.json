Ramirez argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he actually or constructively possessed the cocaine found in the secret compartment in the vehicle in which he was a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">This court will affirm Ramirez\u2019s conviction if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, \u201ca rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Romero-Cruz, </em>201 F.3d 374, 378 (5th Cir.2000)(internal quotation and citation omitted). The evidence introduced at trial supports the inference that Ramirez had knowledge of and access to the contraband. <em>See United States v. Mergerson, </em>4 F.3d 337, 348-49 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also United States v. Diaz-Carreon, </em>915 F.2d 951, 954-55 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Ramirez argues that the district court erred in admitting Fed.R.Crim.P. 404(b) evidence. With respect to the testimony as to events in April 2003, such testimony was \u201cintrinsic\u201d evidence and does \u201cnot implicate Rule 404(b), and consideration of its admissibility pursuant to Rule 404(b) is unnecessary.\u201d <em>See United States v. Coleman, </em>78 F.3d 154, 156 (5th Cir.1996) (internal quotations and citation omitted). With respect to events in 2000, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony because the evidence was admissible on the issues of Ramirez\u2019s knowledge and intent. <em>See e.g., United States v. Osum, </em>943 F.2d 1394, 1404 (5th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Elwood, </em>999 F.2d 814, 815-16 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (5th Cir.1993). This evidence was more probative than prejudicial. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>932 F.2d 1529, 1534 (5th. Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Ramirez argues that the district court\u2019s admission of Diego Salas-Castillo\u2019s testimony violated his right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him. Because Ramirez has failed to identify on appeal, by citation to the trial transcript or otherwise, the specific testimony he seeks to challenge, he has waived the issue by failing to adequately brief it on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Ramirez argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial based on the Government\u2019s elicitation at trial of testimony of his post-arrest silence. It is a violation of a defendant\u2019s due process rights for the Government to comment on a defendant\u2019s postarrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>warning silence. <em>See Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617, 619, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). The record does not establish that the Government exploited Ramirez\u2019s silence after inducing that silence by advising him of his right to remain silent. <em>See Pitts v. Anderson, </em>122 F.3d 275, 279 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b696-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
