The district court imposed a guidelines sentence of one hundred months\u2019 imprisonment. The court also stated it would impose an identical alternative sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 (2000), treating the guidelines as advisory only, pursuant to this court\u2019s recommendation in <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc), <em>vacated,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-21\">Douglas appeals his sentence, contending that the judicially enhanced guidelines sentence was imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment under <em>United States v. Booker,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Douglas also asserts the alternative sentence enhanced by the court was unreasonable because the court did not \u201cspecifically address the factors enumerated in\u201d \u00a7 3553(a) and because the court assumed it had \u201cunfettered discretion\u201d when giving an alternative sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-24\">We have conducted an independent review of the record and find these contentions to be meritless. We further conclude that because the alternative discretionary sentence was identical to the sentence imposed under the federal sentencing guidelines as they existed at the time, any error in the imposition of the sentence was harmless. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 223-24 (4th Cir.2005) (error did not affect substantial rights when court indicated it was content with the guidelines range and sentence). Therefore, we affirm Douglas\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-25\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-26\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
