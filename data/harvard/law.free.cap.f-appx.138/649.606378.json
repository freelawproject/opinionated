He alleges that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, the evidence was not sufficient to support the convictions, the jury was improperly instructed, the district court improperly applied the sentencing guidelines, and the Government failed to prove that he used a weapon in relation to the offense under <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Davis contends that his claims fall within the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. \u201c[T]he savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 applies to a claim (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">With respect to his <em>non-Bailey </em>claims, Davis has not pointed to a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense, nor has he shown that these claims were foreclosed by circuit law at the time of his conviction or when he filed his initial 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 903-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Davis\u2019 <em>Bailey </em>claim was foreclosed by circuit law at the time that he filed his first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>927 F.2d 176, 179 (4th Cir. 1991). He is not entitled to raise the <em>Bailey </em>claim in a successive motion because the <em>Bailey </em>decision did not announce a new rule of constitutional law. <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 620-23, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998); \u00a7 2255. A valid <em>Bailey </em>claim is sufficient to meet the requirement that the claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court case. <em>See Bousley, </em>523 U.S. at 620-21, 118 S.Ct. 1604. However, it is unclear whether Davis can show that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense under <em>Bailey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Title 18. U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) calls for an enhanced sentence when a person uses or carries a firearm during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug-trafficking crime. The <em>Bailey </em>decision interpreted the \u201cuse\u201d prong of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) as requiring the Government to show \u201cactive employment of the firearm\u201d to sustain a conviction on that prong. 516 U.S. at 144, 116 S.Ct. 501. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that <em>Bailey </em>did not define \u201ccarrying\u201d within the context of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). <em>See United States v. Mitchell, </em>104 F.3d 649, 653 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">It cannot be determined from the record whether Davis was charged with \u201cusing\u201d or \u201ccarrying\u201d a firearm. Nor can it be discerned from the record whether Davis \u201cused\u201d the weapon within the meaning of <em>Bailey. </em>The judgment of the district court denying the motion is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for a determination whether Davis\u2019 conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) was valid in light of <em>Bailey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b677-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
