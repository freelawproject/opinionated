Int\u2019l Speedway Corp., </em>654 F.2d 1028, 1031 (5th Cir.1981). Yaw failed to make an initial showing of substantial prejudice as to his due process claim. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997). Further, because Yaw was not detained under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c) when he filed the instant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 application, he lacked Article III standing to challenge his detention under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c). <em>See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). Finally, because Yaw did not challenge his post-removal detention under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a) in the district court, this court need not consider it. <em>See Flores-Garza v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 797, 804 n. 7 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b628-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
