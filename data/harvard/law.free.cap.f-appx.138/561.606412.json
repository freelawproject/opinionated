Jones was released in 1998 but thereafter had his supervised release revoked and was sentenced to twenty-four months of incarceration. (J.A. 21, 23). Jones was diagnosed with schizophrenia and upon motion of the Government was committed to the custody of the Attorney General under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246 (2000). In 2002, Jones was conditionally released from his civil commitment under \u00a7 4246(e). Jones\u2019 conditional release was revoked in April 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">In December of 2003, Jones sought a hearing to again review whether he could be discharged from the custody of the Attorney General under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247(h) (2000). Following a hearing on the motion, the district court found that Jones continued to meet the criteria for commitment under \u00a7 4246. Jones appeals, arguing that he has met the requirements for release from his civil commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">We do not find that the district court clearly erred in its factual determination that Jones failed to meet the requirements for release from custody. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246(e) (2000); <em>United States v. Cox, </em>964 F.2d 1431, 1433 (4th Cir.1992) (stating general review standard for factual findings under \u00a7 4246). Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
