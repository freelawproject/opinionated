He argues that (1) his due process rights were violated under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), by the suppression of exculpatory evidence; (2) his sentence should not have been increased for being a manager or supervisor; and (3) he should have been granted an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Jacobs\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim was waived by his valid guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Lampazianie, </em>251 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>733 F.2d 371, 376 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the federal sentencing guidelines is reviewed de novo and the district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202-203 (5th Cir.2005). Examination of the record shows that the district court\u2019s findings that Jacobs was a manager or supervisor pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3131.1(b) and that Jacobs did not demonstrate acceptance of responsibility for his offense were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
