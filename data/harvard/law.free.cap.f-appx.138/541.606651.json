INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). Credibility determinations of the immigration judge and Board are entitled to deference as long as they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). We have reviewed the evidence of record, the immigration judge\u2019s decision, and the Board\u2019s order, and we find substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Wang failed to establish the past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2004) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483, 112 S.Ct. 812 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-21\">Accordingly, we deny Wang\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
