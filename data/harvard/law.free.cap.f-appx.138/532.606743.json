Harksen appeals the district court\u2019s orders dismissing without prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) (2000) his complaint filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000), for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of Harksen\u2019s due process and access to courts claims. Accordingly, we affirm this portion of the district court\u2019s order for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Harksen v. Braxton, </em>No. CA-04-242 (W-D.Va. Oct. 28, 2004); <em>see also Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993) (holding that dismissal without prejudice is final, appealable order where no amendment to complaint could cure deficiencies identified by district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>With regard to Harksen\u2019s Eighth Amendment claims, we find that this portion of the district court\u2019s order is not appealable. Harksen may cure the defects identified by the court by filing an amended complaint. We therefore dismiss this portion of the appeal. <em>See Domino Sugar, </em>10 F.3d at 1066-67. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b560-11\"> Harksen also appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion filed under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b). Because he failed to challenge the court's disposition of that motion in his informal brief, he has waived appellate review of that order. 4th Cir. R. 34(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
