Booker,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), he was sentenced pursuant to an unconstitutional mandatory guideline system. He contends that this argument is not precluded by his appeal waiver. In his plea agreement, Geron agreed to waive his right to appeal his sentence except in the case of \u201c(a) a sentence imposed above the statutory maximum; or (b) an \u2018upward departure\u2019 from the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d However, at rearraignment the magistrate judge described the applicable portion of Giron\u2019s appeal waiver as follows: \u201c[Y]ou give up the right to appeal your case to a higher court, except you could appeal from an illegal sentence.\u201d In light of the magistrate judge\u2019s statement and the fact that the magistrate judge did not ask Giron whether he had read the plea agreement, reviewed it with his attorney, understood it, or entered it voluntarily, it cannot be said that Giron knowingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>waived the right to raise the <em>Booker </em>issue, and, therefore, his appeal waiver does not bar the instant appeal. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Giron correctly acknowledges that his failure to raise the <em>Booker </em>issue in the district court results in review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines in their mandatory form constituted error that was plain. <em>See id. </em>at 733. However, Giron has not established that the error affected his substantial rights because he has not demonstrated that the record shows that the district judge would have imposed a different or lesser sentence under a <em>Booker </em>advisory regime. <em>See id. </em>Giron contends that the district court\u2019s error in sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines regime is of a type that should be presumed to affect his substantial rights. However, this argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Giron has not met the requirements to show plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Giron also argues for the first time on appeal that the sentencing provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional on their face and as applied in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Giron acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review. As Giron concedes, this issue is foreclosed. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b729-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
