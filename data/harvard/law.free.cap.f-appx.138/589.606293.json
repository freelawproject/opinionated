Dawkins concedes removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), but contends that the court did not properly consider his application for voluntary departure. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-27\">On May 11, 2005, The REAL ID Act, 119 Stat. \u00a7 231 went into effect, amending 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2) (2000) to add a subsection (D) that states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ5O\">(D) Judicial review of certain legal claims</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-28\">Nothing in subparagraph (B) or (C), or in any other provision of this chapter (other than this section) which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (2005). Although we have jurisdiction to consider Dawkins\u2019 claim, we find that it was not properly raised or pursued before either the immigration judge or the Board. We therefore find that Dawkins was not entitled to adjudication on the issue. Accordingly, we deny Dawkins\u2019 petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
