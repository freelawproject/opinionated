He fails to present any argument with regard to the Board\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider \u2014 the order that is the subject of the petition for review. Thus, Paniagua-Navarette has abandoned his challenge to the Board\u2019s August 26, 2004, decision denying his motion to reconsider by failing to brief it. <em>See Al-Ra\u2018id v. Ingle, </em>69 F.3d 28, 33 (5th Cir.1995). Accordingly, we DENY his petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b718-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
