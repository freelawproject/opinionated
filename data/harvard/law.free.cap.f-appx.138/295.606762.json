In these motions, Bell claimed, inter alia, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that he was actually innocent of the charges to which he had pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-17\">The district court conducted the required screening under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, noting that the motions had been docketed as a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action, but that Bell sought relief that was appropriate in a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The court then concluded that (1) if the motions were treated as \u00a7 1983 claims, they were barred by <em>Heck v. Hum</em>phrey<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because Bell had not shown that his state convictions had been overturned, and (2) if the claims were treated as \u00a7 2254 claims, the district court should not review the motions because Bell\u2019s state habeas petition was pending in the state supreme court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, the district court found that, even if the motions were construed under \u00a7 2254, they were untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-18\">We review frivolity dismissals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A de novo. <em>Harden v. Pataki, </em>320 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-19\">Section 1915A of the PLRA requires the district court to review civil actions and to identify cognizable claims or dismiss the complaint or portions thereof that are frivolous. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b). A claim is frivolous if it is based on an indisputably meritless legal theory or, after piercing the veil of the complaint, the court determines that the factual allegations are clearly baseless. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 1833, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989) (applying 28 U.S.C.1915(d)); <em>see also Carroll v.

According to the district court, Bell filed a state habeas petition, which was denied in 1999, and the state supreme court denied a certificate of probable cause in 2000. Bell then filed a second state habeas petition in 2003, which was denied as successive in 2004, and the request for a certificate of probable cause remained pending in the state supreme court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
