Booker,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-17\">Because Johnson-Cuervo preserved a <em>Blakely/Booker </em>objection in the district court, we review the challenge to his sentence de novo. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). <em>Booker </em>error must be disregarded if it was harmless. <em>Id. </em>To find harmless error, we must determine the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. A constitutional error, such as <em>Booker </em>error, does not affect substantial rights, if it is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>This standard is met only where it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt the error did not contribute to the sentence obtained. The government has the burden of showing the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-18\">The Government has not attempted to carry its burden of showing the error was harmless. Instead, the Government concedes error and joins Johnson-Cuervo in requesting a remand for resentencing. Accordingly, we vacate Johnson-Cuervo\u2019s sentences and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-19\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
