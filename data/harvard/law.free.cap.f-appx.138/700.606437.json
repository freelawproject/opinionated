He argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress the firearms that were discovered during a search of his property. He maintains that his wife did not have actual or apparent authority to consent to a search of the property, including a safe located in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Berthelot did not exhibit a subjective expectation of privacy in the property or the safe. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>337 F.3d 529, 536-37 (5th Cir.2003). Therefore, Sheila Berthelot had common authority to consent to the search of the property, including the safe. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Berthelot\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b728-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
