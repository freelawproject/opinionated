Wilson appeals the district court\u2019s order denying her Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1) motion. The motion was filed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>a case decided by final order entered by the district court on November 12, 2003, dismissing various claims relating to allegations of employment discrimination. Wilson\u2019s time to appeal that order had expired, and her Rule 60(b)(1) motion sought to reopen proceedings to allow Wilson to timely appeal the final order. The district court denied Wilson\u2019s Rule 60(b)(1) motion for lack of mistake or excusable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Rule 60(b)(1) provides for relief from a judgment based on mistake, surprise, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The extraordinary remedy of Rule 60(b) is only to be granted in exceptional circumstances. <em>See Compton v. Alton S.S. Co., </em>608 F.2d 96, 102 (4th Cir.1979). To obtain relief under the Rule based on excusable neglect, the movant \u201cmust demonstrate <em>inter alia </em>that [she] was not at fault and that the nonmoving party will not be prejudiced by the relief from judgment.\u201d <em>Home Port Rentals, Inc. v. Ruben, </em>957 F.2d 126, 132 (4th Cir.1992). We review the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See Nat\u2019l Org. for Women v. Operation Rescue, </em>47 F.3d 667, 669 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Wilson\u2019s only basis for the Rule 60(b)(1) motion was that Wilson\u2019s counsel did not receive the November 12, 2003 order. The final order was sent electronically to counsel at the electronic mail address submitted by counsel to the court when counsel registered to receive court documents electronically.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Wilson\u2019s claim of not receiving notice does not satisfy Rule 60(b)(1). Rule 77(d), Fed.R.Civ.P., \u201c\u2018plainly charges the prospective appellant with the duty of following the progress of the action and advising himself when the court makes the order he wishes to protest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hensley v. Chesapeake &amp; O. Ry., </em>651 F.2d 226, 231 (4th Cir.1981) (quoting <em>Long v. Emery, </em>383 F.2d 392, 394 (10th Cir.1967)). Wilson\u2019s counsel failed in this duty, and \u201cRule 77(d) bars Rule 60(b) relief when the <em>sole </em>reason asserted for that relief is the failure of a litigant to receive notice of the entry of an order or judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229. Wilson failed to prove mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and the district court accordingly did not abuse its discretion in denying Wilson\u2019s Rule 60(b)(1) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">We affirm the district court\u2019s order. We deny Wilson\u2019s motion to consolidate this case with <em>In re Wilson, </em>No. 04-1980 (4th Cir. Sept. 23, 2004), in which a final order has been entered and rehearing has been denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are fully presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
