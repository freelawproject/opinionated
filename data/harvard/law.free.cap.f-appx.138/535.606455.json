An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). Lothrarp argues, by counsel, that the district court incorrectly concluded that he had failed to exhaust his present federal claim under <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">We have independently reviewed the record, including the detailed record of the state court appellate proceedings, and we conclude that Lothrarp has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-14\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b564-10\"> It appears appellant's name is actually spelled \"Lotharp.\u201d We have maintained the spelling under which the case was docketed in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
