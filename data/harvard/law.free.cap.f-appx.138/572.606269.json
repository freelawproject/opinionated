See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b601-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">In these consolidated petitions for review, Xiang Ling Peng, a native and citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China, petitions for review of two separate orders of the Board of Immigration Appeals: (1) affirming, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s denial of her requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture; and (2) denying her motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">Peng first challenges the immigration judge\u2019s determination that she failed to establish her eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence [s]he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Peng fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Peng\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Peng fails to show that she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-14\">We also find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s finding that Peng fails to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2005). We find that Peng failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-15\">Peng also claims that the immigration judge refused to allow her sufficient time to present testimony in violation of her rights to due process. Our review of the record reveals that Peng was given the option to continue her case in order to present additional testimony but declined. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that Peng was denied due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-16\">Finally, Peng claims that the Board abused its discretion in denying her motion to reopen. We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision and find no abuse of discretion in its denial of the motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2005); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Yanez-Popp v. INS, </em>998 F.2d 231, 234 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-17\">Accordingly, we deny the petitions for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
