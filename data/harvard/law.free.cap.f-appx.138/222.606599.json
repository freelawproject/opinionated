On appeal, Caro maintains that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court lacked the authority to enhance his sentence based on facts not reflected in a jury verdict or admitted by Caro. Caro contends that the sentencing court enhanced his offense level after determining that he possessed between three and ten kilograms of heroin, even though that amount was not charged in the indictment nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, Caro argues that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-17\">\u201c[A] constitutional objection that is timely ... receives the benefit of preserved error review.\u201d <em>United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2001). Because Caro objected below, both in his objections to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) and again at sentencing, that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Blakely </em>by calculating his offense level based on an amount of drugs to which he did not stipulate, he raised a timely constitutional objection and is entitled to preserved error review. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-18\">We review preserved constitutional errors <em>de novo, </em>but \u201cwill reverse only for harmful error.\u201d <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d 1250, 1272 (11th Cir.2001) <em>(en banc). </em>Non-constitutional error is harmless when it does not affect the substantial rights of the parties. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111; <em>United States v. Guzman, </em>167 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.1999). Under this standard, we must reverse \u201conly if [the error] resulted in actual prejudice because it had substantial and injurious effect or influence\u201d on Caro\u2019s sentence. <em>See id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>There was error here because Caro was sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). However, when the district court sentenced Caro, it sentenced Caro in the alternative to 87 months \u201cstrictly under the statute,\u201d in the event that the Supreme Court found the guidelines unconstitutional. The court\u2019s comment establishes that the mandatory nature of the guidelines in place at the time of sentencing did not affect Caro\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Petho, </em>409 F.3d 1277 (11th Cir.2005) (finding error harmless because district court stated that it would sentence to the same number of months if the guidelines were not binding). Thus, we find that the <em>Booker </em>error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-15\">. There was no constitutional error in this case because Caro admitted at his change of plea hearing the amount of drugs that was used to determine his offense level. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Petho, </em>409 F.3d 1277, 1279-80 n. 1 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
