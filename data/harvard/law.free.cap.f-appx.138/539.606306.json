Pruneda, </em>No. CA-02-42-WCE-JES (N.D.W.Va. May 6, 2005). As explained below, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">State and County has been sued for unfair claims settlement practices in the <em>Miller </em>litigation. During discovery, State and County refused to produce the documents to the plaintiffs, invoking the attorney-client privilege, West Virginia\u2019s \u201cquasi attorney-client privilege,\u201d and the work product doctrine. Following <em>in camera </em>inspections of the documents, the magistrate judge concluded they are not privileged and ordered them disclosed. State and County then filed objections to the judge\u2019s orders. In its May 6, 2005 Order, the district court overruled these objections and, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s reasoning, directed State and County to \u201cproduce forthwith the documents.\u201d This directive was subsequently stayed by the court pending our ruling on State and County\u2019s Petition for Writ of Prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">State and County filed its petition on June 2, 2005, and the Respondents (plaintiffs in the <em>Miller </em>litigation) filed their answer on June 22, 2005. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 21(b)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our assessment of the petition must be guided by the long-standing principle that prohibition, like mandamus, is a \u201cdrastic and extraordinary\u201d remedy. <em>Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Holland, </em>346 U.S. 379, 384, 74 S.Ct. 145, 98 L.Ed. 106 (1953) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, \u201cthe party seeking issuance of the writ [must] have no other adequate means to attain the relief\u2019 it desires. <em>Kerr v. United States Disk Ct., </em>426 U.S. 394, 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>see also United States v. Moussaoui, </em>333 F.3d 509, 517 (4th Cir.2003). And, the petitioner bears \u201cthe burden of showing that [its] right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Kerr, </em>426 U.S. at 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Moussaoui, </em>333 F.3d at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">State and County contends that it is entitled to a writ of prohibition, because otherwise it will be compelled to disclose the documents, effectively nullifying the privileges attached thereto. However, another avenue of relief appears to be available to State and County: it could refuse to comply with the May 6, 2005 Order and appeal from any contempt sanction imposed by the district court. <em>See Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 9, 18 n. 11, 113 S.Ct. 447, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992) (\u201cA party that seeks to present an objection to a discovery order immediately to a court of appeals must refuse compliance, be held in contempt, and then appeal the contempt order.\u201d). We therefore deny State and County\u2019s Petition for Writ of Prohibition, rather than permitting it to be improperly used as a substitute for appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-7\">.
