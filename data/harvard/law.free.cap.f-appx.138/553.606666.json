We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-23\">Williams argues his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary as to the firearm count because the district court did not adequately explain that the firearm must have been used or carried in relation to a drug trafficking crime. He also contends the firearm count was not adequately supported by a factual basis. Because Williams did not seek to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court, we review these issues for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 527 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-24\">Before accepting a guilty plea, a trial court, through colloquy with the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>dant, must inform the defendant of, and determine that he understands, the nature of the eharge(s) to which the plea is offered. <em>Id. </em>at 530. A judge has wide discretion in deciding how to ensure the defendant\u2019s understanding. <em>Id. </em>We have reviewed the record and conclude the district court did not contravene Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b) in explaining the firearm charge to Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Before entering judgment on a guilty plea, the court must also determine that there is a factual basis for the plea. Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3). This \u201censures that the court make clear exactly what a defendant admits to, and whether those admissions are factually sufficient to constitute the alleged crime.\u201d <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120 (4th Cir.1991). The court \u201cmay conclude that a factual basis exists from anything that appears on the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our review of the record reveals that the district court did not unreasonably determine that there was a sufficient factual basis for the charge. We therefore affirm Williams\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Williams next challenges his sentence, asserting it violates the rule announced in <em>United States v. Booker,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We conclude, however, that because Williams was sentenced to the statutory m\u00ednimums for two counts of conviction, and received a concurrent sentence on the third count that did not exceed the sentence to which it was tied, Williams can show no prejudicial error. <em>See United States v. Ellis, </em>326 F.3d 593, 599-600 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 907, 124 S.Ct. 204, 157 L.Ed.2d 194 (2003). Accordingly, we affirm Williams\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are' adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
