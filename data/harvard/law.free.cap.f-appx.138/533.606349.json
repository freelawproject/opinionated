Harper does not challenge his conviction on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Harper argues the district court erred when it increased his base offense level after finding he used one of the firearms recovered from his vehicle \u201cin connection with another felony offense.\u201d <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2003), provides for a four-level increase if the firearm was \u201cused or possessed ... in connection with another felony offense.\u201d \u201cFelony offense\u201d is defined to mean \u201cany offense (federal, state, or local) punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, whether or not a criminal charge was brought, or conviction obtained.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n.7).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The Government has the burden of proving the necessary facts by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 828 (4th Cir.2001). Factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989). Clear error occurs when the court, upon reviewing the record as a whole, is left with the \u201c \u2018definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Powell, </em>124 F.3d 655, 667 (5th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948)). We have reviewed the record and conclude there was sufficient evidence for the district court to find Harper used the firearm in connection with the felony offense of attempted first-degree murder. <em>See </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-202(a)(2) (2002). We therefore conclude Harper\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Harper\u2019s sentence, however, violated the rule announced in <em>United States v. Booker,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005), we held that when a sentence calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines exceeds the maximum sentence authorized by the facts found by the jury alone, the defendant could demonstrate plain error that warranted resentencing under <em>Booker. </em>Because it is undisputed that the district court made factual determinations beyond facts Harper admitted to that increased his sentence, Harper is entitled to resentencing. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we affirm Harper\u2019s conviction but vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing \u201cconsistent with the remedial scheme set forth in Justice Breyer\u2019s opinion for the Court in <em>Booker. </em>\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-6\">. Just as we noted in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4. (4th Cir.2005), \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Harper\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\">. Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \"consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \"within the statutorily prescribed range ... and reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
