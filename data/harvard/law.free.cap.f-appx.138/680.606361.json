He contends that the factual basis of his plea indicated that his only participation in the vast drug enterprise was his loading of marijuana from a warehouse into a tractor-trailer on two occasions, that he had little knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise, and that others who were higher up in the conspiracy received sentences that were lower than or equal to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The fact that Soto loaded and unloaded boxes of marijuana to and from tractor-trailers and a warehouse on three separate occasions, the fact that Soto accompanied a marijuana shipment after it was loaded on one of those occasions, and the fact that two tractor-trailers that were loaded at the warehouse, one of which Soto loaded, contained thousands of pounds of marijuana indicate that Soto in fact knew the scope and structure of the enterprise. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.4); <em>United States v. Becerra, </em>155 F.3d 740, 757 (5th Cir.1998). Furthermore, the district court was not required to find, based solely on Soto\u2019s bare assertion that he did not know of the scope or structure of the enterprise, that such a role adjustment was warranted. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(C)). Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in determining that Soto was not entitled to a minimal-role downward adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">Soto\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED. We REMAND to the district court for correction of the judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 36 to reflect that Soto was convicted under count two of possession with intent to distribute \u201ca quantity\u201d of marijuana, rather than possession with intent to distribute \u201c&gt;1000 kgs\u201d of marijuana.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
