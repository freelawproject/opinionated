He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Doyle has been transferred to the Community Corrections Center, so he has received the relief requested in his \u00a7 2241 petition. Moreover, we find there has been no undue delay in the district court. Accordingly, we deny Doyle\u2019s petition for mandamus relief. We deny Doyle\u2019s motion to be placed on home confinement. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
