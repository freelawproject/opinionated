She appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the determination that she is not eligible for early release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e). Duque contends that prison officials were required to notify her immediately of any change in her eligibility for early release. She argues that prison officials were not authorized to revoke her eligibility for early release based on a disciplinary violation that occurred three years before. Duque concedes that the Bureau of Prison\u2019s Program Statement 3550.10, which requires, inter alia, compliance with the disciplinary rules governing the possession and use of alcohol and drugs, is reasonable. She asserts, however, that the statement in this provision that \u201c[a]n inmate shall lose his or her provisional early release date immediately if the DHO/UDC finds the inmate, pursuant to an incident report, to have: *Used or possessed alcohol or drugs ...\u201d imposes a temporal requirement that limits the Bureau of Prison\u2019s authority to change an inmate\u2019s eligibility status. She contends that the failure to comply with this requirement is a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Duque also asserts in her reply brief that she is innocent of the disciplinary violation that is the basis for the denial of her eligibility for early release. Duque has abandoned her challenge to the disciplinary charge, however, as she did not raise this issue in her initial brief. <em>See Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">Duque has not shown that any delay in the change in her eligibility status under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e) is a violation of federal or constitutional law entitling her to remain eligible for early release. <em>See Rublee v. Fleming, </em>160 F.3d 213, 216-17 (5th Cir.1998). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b676-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
