If the property was in fact sold for an excessive sum, that fact may be shown to invalidate the sale; but the presumption is in favor of the regularity of official action.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b167-10\">IiX-\u2014Recital of Interest Sold.\u2014It is not ground of objection to a certificate of tax sale and a tax deed thereunder that the certificate recites that the bidder \u201coffered to take the least quantity of said property, or the smallest portion of interest therein,\u201d when the certificate and deed both show by the description of the premises sold that quantity was offered and only quantity was sold.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b167-11\">Id.\u2014Recital of Costs of Publication.\u2014A recital in the certificate of tax sale and tax deed of the non-payment of the costs of publication will not vitiate the sale or deed, if it does not appear that the amount for which the property was actually sold included anything for costs of publication.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b167-12\">Id. \u2014Tax Proceedings \u2014 Substantial Conformity to Law\u2014Quieting Title \u2014 Evidence. - - When a certificate of tax sale and tax deed conform substantially to the requirements of the Political Code, it is error to refuse to admit the deed in evidence in an action to quiet title founded thereupon.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b167-13\">Appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court of Sacramento County, and from an order denying a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-14\">The facts are stated in the-opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-15\"><em>D.

(Pol.

At the trial plaintiff offered in evidence to support his claim of title a certificate of tax sale and a tax deed. \u2022 The certificate was admitted; the deed was excluded. The ruling of the court in excluding the deed is assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Respondent contends that the deed is void because it does not recite the matters recited in the certificate. We have examined the particulars in which the deed differs from the certificate, and are of the opinion that none of them are material.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">In the certificate it is stated that the taxes and costs amount in all to the sum of $35.71. In the deed, the amount recited is $35.21. The authorities cited hold that if a <em>sale </em>of land for a delinquent tax is made for a sum in excess of the tax and legal costs, the sale is void unless the excess is less than the smallest fractional coin authorized by law. We cannot say that because the certificate and deed differ in such recitals that the <em>sale </em>was for a sum in excess of the tax and legal costs. If an excessive amount was demanded and the property sold therefor it would invalidate the sale, and that fact may be shown, but the presumption is in favor of the regularity of official action.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">In the certificate it is recited that Mayo was <em>\u201c </em>the bidder who offered to take the least quantity of said property, or the smallest portion of interest therein.\u201d \u2022 The point is made that* only the \u201cleast quantity\u201d should have been offered for sale or sold. We think it clear that such was the fact. The certificate and deed both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>define what is meant by least quantity and smallest portion of interest as follows: \u201c Said least quantity of said property or smallest portion of interest therein is situated in said county of Sacramento, and is described as follows, to wit: All of the above described property.\u201d Quantity was offered and only quantity was sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">It is contended that the certificate and deed both show that a portion of the costs for which the property was sold was \u201c costs of publication\u201d; that although it does not appear how much was collected. by the tax collector as costs of publication, yet the recitals make it clear that something was collected; and that as the law nowhere provides that any costs of publication may be collected, the sale must have been for a sum in excess of the taxes and legal costs due, and was therefore void. There are in the certificate and deed preliminary statements that \u201c said taxes, with five per cent, <em>and the cost of publication, </em>and other costs, not having been paid,\u201d etc.; but they both recite that Mayo was the bidder who offered to take the least quantity and pay the taxes and <em>costs due thereon, </em>including fifty cents for the certificate, and it does not appear that the amount for which the property was actually sold included anything for <em>\u201c </em>costs of publication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">We think that the certificate and deed conform substantially to sections 3776 and 3786, Political Code, and that the court erred in refusing to admit the deed in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Works, J., Beatty, C. J., and Sharpstein, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">McFarland, J., dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
