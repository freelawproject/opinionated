But a finding that the property was taken from plaintiff\u2019s possession, and converted by the defendant to his own use, though defective as being a finding of evidence of title rather than of the ultimate fact of title, when considered in connection with a finding that plaintiffs were the owners and entitled to the possession of the property at the time of the commencement of the action, is an error or defect which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties, and should be disregarded.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-7\">/</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-8\">Appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court of Monterey County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-9\">The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-10\"><em>William H.

The evidence is not before us, and the contention of appellants here is, that the fact of plaintiffs\u2019 ownership at the time of the seizure is not found. We must confess that it is not found as directly as it should be. But the court has found that at the time of the commencement of this action the plaintiffs were the owners and entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>to the possession of all of said property. If this had been preceded by a finding that at the date of the seizure the plaintiffs were the owners and entitled to the possession of it, the case probably would never have reached this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">There is a finding \u201c that on the said tenth day of October, 1884, the said defendant L. G. Sobrunes, in his official capacity as constable of San Antonio township, against plaintiffs\u2019 will and consent, wrongfully and unlawfully took all of the personal property mentioned and described in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint from said plaintiffs\u2019 possession, and converted the same to his own use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Possession is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of title, but it is not title, and the ultimate fact, and not the evidence of it, should in all cases be found. But this error or defect is one which, in our opinion, does not affect the substantial rights of the parties, and therefore must be disregarded. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 475.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">McFarland, J., and Thornton, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
