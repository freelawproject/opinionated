The court below found that the dismissal of the action under a special agreement involving other disputed matters was sufficient to bar the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and in this we think the court was right. <em>(Merritt </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>47 Cal. 542.)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">The plaintiff had full knowledge of the agreement and dismissal, and must be held to have been bound thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">McFarland, J., Paterson, J., Thornton, J:, Sharp-stein, J., and Beatty, C.
