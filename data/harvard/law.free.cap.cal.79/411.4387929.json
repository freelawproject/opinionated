Two or three witnesses testified that when the line was being run, plaintiff stated that he always thought the fence was not on the line. Plaintiff denied having made this statement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-5\">The instructions 2 and 7 referred to in the opinion as given at request of defendant, were as follows: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-6\">\u201c2. If the jury believe, from the evidence, that the fence mentioned by the different witnesses in this case as the \u201c old fence \u201d was a fence placed and maintained by Blankenship or with his consent on the westerly boundary of the land in suit merely as a temporary fence, and without any intent or purpose on the part of Blankenship that the same was to be a permanent division fence between the lands of defendant and the lands of plaintiff or his predecessor .in interest, Balch, then there was no acquiescence on the part of Blankenship that said fence was or was to be the division fence between the lands of Blankenship and the lands of plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-7\"><em>\u201c </em>7. If the jury find that the old fence mentioned by witnesses was put up and maintained merely for a temporary purpose, and for temporary convenience, and that it was not agreed or intended between defendant and plaintiff, or the predecessors in interest of plaintiff, as being the correct division fence between their lands, then there was no acquiescence on the part of defendant that such fence was or was to be a division fence between lands of plaintiff, or lands of his predecessor in interest, and the lands of the defendant.\u201d The further facts are stated in the opinion of th\u00e9 court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-8\">J. <em>B.

The verdict and judgment were for defendant. Plaintiff appeals from the judgment, and from an order denying a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\">Plaintiff owns a tract of land which is generally described as the southeast quarter of section 26, according to a plan of survey, called the Weber survey, of a grant called the Campo de los Franceses, and defendant owns the southwest quarter according to the same survey,\u2014the two tracts adjoining each other in (practically) the same manner in which subdivisions under United States government surveys adjoin. The main issue in the case was, Where is the true boundary line between said two quarter-sections ? Both parties hold under Charles W- Weber, their common grantor, who procured said survey to be made, and to whom the grant was patented. At the trial, the plaintiff offered, by witnesses, to prove that said Weber, before he conveyed to defendant, and when the owner of all the land, did, while he was on said land, point out certain posts and points as being on the line between said quarter-sections, and made certain declarations concerning the boundaries thereof. To this testimony defendant objected as incompetent, irrelevant, and hearsay; the objection was sustained, and plaintiff excepted. This ruling was clearly erroneous. It is the established .law that in a case of a disputed boundary line, which is in doubt, the declarations of a grantor, at or before the time of the sale and conveyance, are admissible against both him and the parties claiming under him. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1849; <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Green, </em>12 Cal. 148; <em>McFadden </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>38 Cal. 51; <em>McFadden </em>v. <em>Ellmaker, </em>52 Cal. 349.) And it would be useless to argue that the offered evidence was not material and important. For this reason the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Most of the other points made by appellant go to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>sufficiency of the evidence to justify the various findings of the jury, and that said findings are contradictory; but it is not necessary to discuss these points, as a new trial must be granted for the reason above stated. (It may be remarked that the special issues and the instructions asked were unnecessarily numerous and long; and that each party seems to have tried the case upon the theory that he would lose, and should therefore set every possible trap for a reversal.)</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">We see no objection to the evidence of the survey of 1878, and the acts and declarations of plaintiff in regard to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The instructions given at request of plaintiff were very full, and those having been given, we see no error in the refusal to give instruction c, asked by plaintiff, or in giving instructions 2 and 7, asked by defendant. Instructions <em>a </em>and <em>b, </em>asked by plaintiff, were refused, of course, because they referred to certain acts and declarations of Weber, and the testimony on that subject had been ruled out. Perhaps on another trial some instruction on that subject may be proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Judgment and order reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Sharpstein, J., Beatty, C. J., Works, J., and Thornton, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Paterson, J., being disqualified, took no part in the decision of this cause.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
