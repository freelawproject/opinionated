In the present case the parties made it an express condition of any cause of action upon their contract that the money to be paid should be collected out of property to be pointed out by J. H. Long. There is no averment in the complaint that any money was ever thus collected. <em>(Fisher </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>48 Cal. 472; <em>Mickle </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>1 Cal. 200; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Menzies, </em>60 Cal. 341; <em>Loup </em>v. <em>California S.
