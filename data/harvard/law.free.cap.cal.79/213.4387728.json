The defendant demurred to the petition, and his demurrer was overruled. He then answered, setting up as an excuse for his refusal to execute the writ that he was unable to locate the premises by the description therein contained. The court held that the description was sufficient, arud by its judgment ordered the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate commanding the defendant to forthwith execute the writ of possession, or any further writ that might be issued by the justice\u2019s court upon its judgment. From this judgment, and from an order refusing him a new trial, the defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b244-4\"><em>Edward P. </em>Cole, and <em>J. B. Southard, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-5\"><em>Mandamus </em>is not the appropriate remedy in this case, as the plaintiff has a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the justice\u2019s court to compel the execution of the writ by proceeding against the sheriff for contempt. <em>(Kim-ball </em>v. <em>Union Water Co., </em>44 Cal. 175; 13 Am.

William Reads, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-7\">The jurisdiction of the justice\u2019s court is special and limited, and does not include the power to punish for contempt a sheriff who refuses to perform his duty. <em>(Weimmer </em>v. <em>Sutherland, </em>74 Cal. 343; <em>Rutherford </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>66 N.

In such case, the party seeking the enforcement of his judgment can apply to the superior court for a writ of mandate (on the refusal of the sheriff to execute the writ of execution) to compel him to execute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">We find no error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Sharpstein, J., Works, J., and McFarland, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
