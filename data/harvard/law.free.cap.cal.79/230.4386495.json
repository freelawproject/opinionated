Whereupon he prays judgment against Brown and Steffan for $527.20, costs and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The appellant Brown demurred to this amended complaint, upon the ground, among others, that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. His demurrer was overruled, and upon trial of the cause, judgment was rendered against him alone for said balance of $527.20, with interest and costs; from which judgment, and an order overruling his motion for a new trial, he prosecutes this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The superior court erred in overruling the demurrer. On the facts stated, Steffan alone is liable to plaintiff for the balance of the contract price of the sheep. Brown is in no wise liable on the contract, and he is guilty of no conversion of the property, or any part of it. Whatever claim he may have against Steffan on the note is no concern of the plaintiff. Steffan is none the less answerable to plaintiff because he may, by his own fault, have incurred an additional obligation to Brown or his assignees.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The judgment and order appealed from are reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
