The court below gave judgment for the defendant, and the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">The first point is, that the insolvency act of 1880 impairs the validity of the contract; in other words, that under that act a discharge could not be granted which would bar a debt contracted in 1878. This precise question, however, has been decided against the appellant. <em>(Pomeroy </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>66 Cal. 574; <em>Hundley </em>v. <em>Chaney, </em>65 Cal. 363.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">The only other point made is, that it is not pleaded or found that the plaintiff was a citizen or resident of the state. The insolvency act provides, however, that the discharge shall be a bar to all the debts which were or might have been proved, with certain specified exceptions (of which this is not one), and \u201c may be pleaded by a simple averment that on the day of its date such discharge was granted to him, setting forth the same in full, and the same shall be a complete bar to all suits brought on any such debts, claims, and liabilities or demands, and the certificate shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence in favor of such facts, and of the regularity of such discharge.\u201d (Sec. 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Under this provision, if the plaintiff was not a citizen or resident of the state, and consequently not affected by the discharge, he should have proved the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We therefore advise that the judgment appealed from be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Foote, C., and Belcher, C.
