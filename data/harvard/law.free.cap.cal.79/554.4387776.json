They had undergone two preliminary examinations, and after the first examination, were discharged by the superior court of Solano County, on a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>for insufficiency of the evidence adduced at that examination. The record does not show what evidence, was adduced at either preliminary examination. The evidence, adduced at the trial showed that a burglary and larceny had been committed by forcibly entering the store of Joseph Swalbe, in the night-time, and taking away a large assortment of rings and cutlery; that the defendants were found in possession of some jewelry and cutlery in'their bedroom, in San Francisco, and had sold two rings in San Francisco, which were identified by Swalbe as his property by certain peculiarities; and that the defendants made different statements to the officer who arrested them as to how the jewelry was obtained, and gave to him false names. The defendants undertook to prove an <em>alibi, </em>and themselves testified that they were in San Francisco at the time of the burglary, and that they did not commit the offense charged. But no other person testified to their presence in San Francisco at that time. There was no direct proof that they were then in Vallejo. The evidence showed a previous conviction in Solano County of defendant\" Smith for burglary, and of defendant Mullen for larceny.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b585-5\"><em>Charles H.
