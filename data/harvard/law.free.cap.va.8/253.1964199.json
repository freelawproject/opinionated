That he afterwards understood that <em>Wood Jones </em>had obtained and surveyed an order of council for 2000 acres, and included therein the tract aforesaid, although <em>Hatcher, </em>as appeared by the surveyor\u2019s books, had, in fact, surveyed it four years before <em>Jones\u2019s </em>order of council was obtained : but the patent for it was delayed, until the 17th of August, 1756, in consequence of the dispute between governour <em>Einwiddie </em>and the locators of lands relative to his claim of a pistole for signing patents : which occasioned the loss of the said tract of 426 acres for non-payment of quit-rents, and the failure to seat and cultivate. In consequence of which the plaintiff petitioned for it as lapsed land j and, by consent, a decree was made in his favour, and a patent issued to the plaintiff, on the 15th of August, 1764. But, pending these difficulties, <em>Jones, </em>fraudulently, paid the governour the pistole and obtained his patent for the 2000 acres, and retains the 426 acres as part of the same. The bill therefore prayed that <em>Jones </em>might be compelled to give possession of the said 426 acres to the plaintiff, and for general relief. <em>Jones </em>afterwards dying, the suit was revived against his heir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-10\">The answer of <em>Jones\u2019s </em>son and devisee states, That <em>Wood Jones\u2019s </em>order of council was surveyed before the plaintiff\u2019s purchase of <em>Hatcher. </em>That the plaintiff had brought several suits, against his father, for the said land, but had failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>in all of them. That <em>Wood Jones </em>was not guilty of fraud in obtaining his patent: and that <em>Iiatcher, </em>if he ever had any right, forfeited it by his obstinacy'in not submitting to the laws. That a court of chancery had not jurisdiction in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-9\">There were no depositions taken; but the exhibits were, 1. A copy of <em>Hatcher\u2019s </em>survey, dated 6th November, 1740, of 530 acres of <em>land; </em>which does not state that it was made under an order of council or other public act. 2. A copy of <em>Wood Jones\u2019s </em>order of council, for two thousand acres in the following words : \u201c At a council held May 6th, 1743, leave was given to <em>Wood Jones to savvey </em>and obtain a patent for two thousand acres of land in Amelia county, on Turkey branch, a branch of Cub creek, beginning at a marked oak, and running up and down both sides the said creek and branch. And at a council held May 3d, 1744, a former order obtained by <em>Wood Jones </em>was renewed for two thousand acres in Brunswick, lying on Turkey branch, a branch of Cub creek, beginning at a marked oak, and running up and down both sides the said branch and up the said creek. <em>John Blair, C. C. council.\u201d. </em>3. The patent, dated 16th of August, 1756, to <em>Henry Hatcher. </em>4. The patent, dated the 15th of August, 1764, to <em>Elisha White, </em>which recites that to <em>Hatcher; </em>the lapse by non-payment of quit-rents and failure to cultivate and improve, and that <em>White </em>had brought suit and obtained a grant for the same. ' xThe county court, on the 4th of May, 1789, decreed <em>Jones </em>to convey the 426 acres to <em>White; </em>and from that decree <em>Jones, </em>after the <em>hah ere facias possessionem </em>was executed, petitioned for, and obtained, an appeal to the high court of chancery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-10\">On the I2th of May, <em>1791, </em>the high court of chancery made the <em>following </em>decree :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-11\">\u201c This court is of opinion, that the appellee\u2019s title, if any he hath, to the land in controversy must be supported on the foundation, that the grant to <em>Henry Hatcher </em>operated retroactively, giving, to his title, like vigour, as if the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>summation thereof, by the grant, had been cotemporaneous with the commencement, which preceded the commencement of the appellant\u2019s right 5 or on this other foundation, that the grant to <em>Wood Jones </em>was obtained surreptitiously, when the officer, to whose function the transaction of that business belonged, did not know part of the land comprehended, in the grant, to have been appropriated, or claimed before by another, who, in not perfecting his title, had been in no default; or was obtained by collusion, between the officers and the grantee; and upon supposition that the grant, to <em>Henry Hatcher, by </em>relation, was prior in effect, although posterior in date, to the other; or that the latter was fraudulent; this, so far as it tended to intercept his right, was void ; and the appellee\u2019s remedy, in a court of common law, was proper and adequate; and this court discerning no ground for application here, especially, when so great a lapse of time had elapsed, after the commencement of <em>Hatcher's </em>title, before any one appeareth to have attempted to <em>assert </em>it, and the manner in which it was derived to the appellee are remembered, is of opinion that the said decree of the court below, by which the appellee recovered the said land, against the appellant with costs, is erroneous; and, therefore, doth reverse the said decree, as it is accordingly hereby reversed, and doth adjudge, order and decree, that the bill of the appellee be dismissed, and that he do pay, unto the appellant, the costs expended by him, as well in his defence in the county court, as in the prosecution of his appeal, all which is ordered and decreed accordingly.\u201d From which decree <em>White </em>appealed'to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-4\"><em>Tunis, </em>attorney genera], and <em>Warden, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgO\">The decree of the high court of chancery is clearly erroneous. For the fraud of <em>Jones </em>was manifest, as the survey of <em>Harris, </em>which was recorded in the surveyor\u2019s books, was notice to him of the claim; and that alone conferred jurisdiction. Consequently, as <em>White's </em>title, as purchaser from <em>Hatcher, </em>was clearly good, the county court did right in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>decreeing a conveyance ; and their sentence ought to have been affirmed by the court of chancery. Besides, the <em>habere facias possessionem </em>had been actually executed, at the time of the appeal from the decree of the county court, after which the petition of appeal was too late, and ought not to have been allowed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-9\">\n<em>Marshall, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMD\">The decree was right, as the complainant neither shewed title nor equity. For <em>Hatcher's </em>order of council, if he had one, is not produced; and the survey does not purport to have been made by any order of council, or other public warrant. Of course, constructive notice is not established ; and actual knowledge is <em>not </em>pretended. But if it had been, still the complainant had no title, at the time' of <em>Jones's </em>order of council and survey; for he had neither paid quit-rents, nor cultivated and improved the land. On the contrary, the probability is, that he did as many others, at that time, were known to do; that is, that he had a survey made, without any authority, in order to secure the land free from quit-rents and other charges, until it might suit his'purposes better, and thus shut out others from obtaining it. But, if it were otherwise, what prevented his filing a <em>caveat </em>against <em>Jones's </em>survey: which would have brought on a decision of the contest, between him and the governour, and put an end to the controversy. The length of time before the suit was commenced, argues despair of success while things were recent; and that alone is sufficient to repel the claim of the appellant. But <em>White </em>was not, as he pretends,' a purchaser, without notice in any sense. For-he was apprized of <em>Jones's </em>patent, at the time of his alledged purchase, (if, indeed, he made one; of which there is not the slightest proof in the c\u00e1use;) and, therefore, he was clearly the purchaser of a pretensed title. Besides, there is no evidence, that the 426 acres are part of' <em>Jones's </em>patent; and therefore, the appellee was entitled to a decree in bar. But, if the complainant had even had right, he had a clear remedy at law; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>for it has long been decided, that fraud, in obtaining it, would vitiate the grant in a court of common law. <em>Chew </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>in the old general court; and <em>Hambleton </em>v. <em>Wells, (ante.) </em>in this court. Consequently, the exception to the jurisdiction is sustained ; and the chancellor did right in dismissing the bill. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-4\">Cur. <em>adv. </em>vult.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b297-5\">Pendleton, President,</author>\n<p id=\"ALc\">delivered the resolution of the court, as follows;</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">It was said, that, after the <em>habere facias possessionem, </em>was executed, it was too late to appeal, and none could be allowed. But the practice in England proves this to be a mistake; for there, unless there be a special application for a writ of <em>supersedeas, </em>the execution is not postponed; but restitution is awarded in case of a reversal. However, it is unnecessary to enquire into the doctrine there; because the act of assembly, allowing a petition of appeal, bounds the right to it, by the three years limitation only.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">That difficulty removed, we proceed to examine the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Courts of law have determined, that where patents have been surreptitiously obtained, they are void at common law, and that suits, at law, may be- brought to set them aside: But such decisions are rare; none are recollected by us in England, since the reign of queen <em>Elizabeth: </em>and but two in this country, that of <em>Chew </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>in the old general court, and that of <em>Hambleton </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>in this court. These never having been published, were necessarily, known only to very few of the profession; and perhaps, hardly to any practising in the country only: The remedy at law, therefore, in the present case, was doubtful, and less eligible, evidently, than a suit in equity; which warranted the application to the latter court. But, if that were not so, it has long been established, that courts of law and equity have concurrent jurisdiction in cases of fraud; the allegation, of which, was the very <em>git </em>of the present suit. Whenever, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>person having the elder title is postponed by fraud, a court of equity can more effectually set things to rights again; and establish, upon a view of all circumstances, complete justice between the parties, than a court of common law: and therefore, is, in practice, the tribunal usually resorted to. The court has thought proper to notice these things, test, by a general affirmance of the chancellor\u2019s decree in this case, a contrary doctrine might be thought to be established.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Upon the merits of the cause, however, the court is of opinion, that the appellant has made no case for relief. , By the settled rules of the former government, a man lost his right, under a survey, unless it was returned, into the secretary\u2019s office, within six months: which does not appear to have been done by <em>Hatcher: </em>Neither is it.proved, that he ever had any order of council, or other public warrant for the survey; or ever made any application for a patent, paid the quit-rents, or cultivated or improved the land; but on the contrary, a neglect of those things occasioned the petition for it, by the complainant, as lapsed land. Nor do the objections stop there; for the-identity of the land is not proved; or that it is part of the lands comprehended in <em>Jones\u2019s </em>patent, without which the plaintiff could have no 'cause of complaint against the latter. The bill, indeed, suggests that the delay of performance on the part of <em>Hatcher </em>arose from the contest with the governour,- about the pistole fee ; but even this is not proved ; and, if it had, no cause is shewn, why a <em>caveat </em>was not filed to <em>Jones\u2019s </em>survey : which would have brought the whole controversy to an end. In short, nothing appears to have been done to save <em>Hatcher\u2019s </em>right; and, although the case, stated in the bill, is probably a fair one; yet the plaintiff has not sup-' ported his allegations. The only thing, therefore, that can be done, is to affirm the decree of the chancellor; which the court accordingly directs, and the following is to be the entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-10\">\u201c This day came the parties by their counsel, and on consideration of the record and the arguments of the counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>although this court doth not approve of the general reasoning in the introduction to the decree of the said high court of chancery, being of opinion that, in controversies of this nature, where fraud is suggested and proved, courts of equity have competent jurisdiction, are most usually and properly resorted to, and can afford ample and adequate relief; yet since the appellant hath made no proof in support of the allegations of his bill, or of any fraud, on the part of <em>Wood Jones, </em>father of the appellee, in obtaining his patent, this court is of opinion there is no error in the said decree: Therefore it is decreed and ordered, that the same be affirmed, and that the appellant pay, to the appellee, his costs, by him, about his defence in this behalf expended: which is ordered to be certified to the said high court of chancery.\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
