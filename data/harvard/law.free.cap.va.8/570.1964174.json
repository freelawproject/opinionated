But there is no such act of assent, registration, proclamation, or newspaper, now to be found; nor any other public act or document extant to prove that the royal assent ever was in fact obtained.

For if not, the motion upon the <em>forthcoming bond, </em>in the district court, could not be sustained, and the judgment was erroneous.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-8\">For the appellants, it was said, that the judgment was erroneous, as there was no proof that the royal assent had ever been obtained ; for the note, at the foot of the law, in the Chancellor\u2019s Revisal, was of no authenticity; because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>those who made it had no authority to enquire into it; and, if they had, their memorandum was founded upon hearsay only, without any judicial examination, or even the form of an affidavit: which was not sufficient, in a case where the validity of the law depended upon the royal assent being obtained; for, until that was procured, the act, by the express terms of it, was to be suspended. That the only competent evidence of the king\u2019s approbation was the act of <em>royal assent, </em>or, at least, a certificate from the council books, or a copy of the governour\u2019s proclamation: and, as none of these was produced, the act was of- no validity, \u00e1nd did not warrant the motion and judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-4\">For the appellee, it was said, that the memorandum at the foot of the act, in the Chancellor\u2019s Revisal, was evidence of the king\u2019s assent,'after so great a lapse of time : \u00e1nd the constant practice under it, for upwards of twenty years, by all the courts, afforded irresistible testimony of the fact; for it was impossible that such a uniform practice could have prevailed, without it; because, not only would the courts have required the proof, but the debtors, themselves, must have, frequently, raised the objection, if it had existed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b614-5\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b614-6\">Pendleton, President,</author>\n<p id=\"A4l\">delivered the resolution of the court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The doubt raised was whether the royal assent, to the act of 1769, relative to motions upon forthcoming bonds, was ever obtained, as the act was suspended, until that was procured ?</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The ordinary evidence in such cases is the council books of the time, and the governour\u2019s proclamation, published in the Virginia Gazette; but the derangement of the council books during the revolutionary war, and the perishable nature of newspapers, have deprived us of that kind of testimony; and therefore the court proceeded, under the act of 1787, to supply the defect of evidence, by making such en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>quiries as might lead to some satisfactory result. The fruit of which is as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">1. Mr. <em>Brown </em>the clerk informs us, that application was once made to him as clerk under the <em>stray </em>law; and that he applied, to Mr. <em>Carrington, </em>respecting it; who told him, that he had read the governour\u2019s proclamation announcing the royal assent; which he himself afterwards saw in the newspaper, and noted in his book, that the <em>stray </em>law was assented to. That, being a law of the same period, and thus authenticated, is, of itself, a strong circumstance to prove, that the law concerning executions was also assented to, as nothing appears to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">2. The act concerning executions has been uniformly acted under, from that time, to this; which is most conclusive evidence, that the royal assent to it had been obtained, in the sense of the legislature expressed in the act of 1787, which declares that \u201c every such question shall be discussed upon such evidence and <em>circumstances </em>as may be produced <em>by </em>the parties, without requiring either party <em>to shew the </em>official assent to such act, or a certificate from the council books, that such assent was registered therein For the long practice, commencing at a very early period after the passage of the act, and continued, afterwards, without interruption, is a <em>circumstance, </em>entirely, convincing, that the king\u2019s approbation had been procured.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">3. The legislature, itself, seems to have acted under the same impression. For the act of 1787, omits <em>forthcoming </em>bonds altogether, and only repeals the laws relative to <em>replevy </em>bonds of <em>three </em>months; substituting, in their stead, the <em>twelve months </em>replevy bonds; and repealing, so much of all acts as came within the purview of that, leaving the <em>forthcoming bond, </em>untouched, although that had, as before observed, been acted on, from 1770 to that period : and it is impossible that such an inveterate practice could have escaped the observation of the assembly, which proves that they meant it should continue, and that they considered that the king\u2019s approbation had, in fact, been obtained; but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>the official evidence of it was lost: and it was, to supply the lost evidence, that the act of 1787 was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">4. But the act of 1788 still further elucidates that i titpression; and removes all doubt with regard to the legislative opinion of the validity of the act of 1769; for it declares, in words, that \u201c Bonds may still be given for the <em>forthcoming of goods or other property at the day of sale; </em>but if the condition of such bond is not complied with, and judgment shall be entered thereupon, the obligors shall be deprived of the benefit of this and the above recited act.\u201d 12 <em>Hen. Stat. </em>777. Which was intended as a commination, to produce compliance; but there would have been very little terror in it, if it related to the act of 1748, as that was nothing more than a common obligation to the sheriff, upon which a suit only, and not a motion, could be maintained ; an evil which the act of 1769 professed to remedy; and there is nothing to shew that either the legislative will, or the sentiment of the country, had changed, upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">All these circumstances combined, lead to absolute conviction, that the royal assent was, in fact, obtained. But, if those circumstances had not been so conclusive, the court would have presumed, that it had been proved in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">See 5 <em>Hen. Stat. </em>559, for the form of the instrument declaring the royal assent to an act of assembly, with a suspending clause to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">And see the same book, page 566, for the form of the governour\u2019s proclamation repealing an act of assembly, which had no suspending clause to it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
