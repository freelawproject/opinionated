The commissioner appended to his report, at the instance of <em>Fadeleij, </em>1. An account of taxes paid and repairs done by the said <em>Fadeley </em>on the property devised to him, since he had been in possession thereof; amounting to the sum of 150 dollars 82 cents. 2. An account of the rents and profits of the separate property of <em>Jane Weatherly, </em>from the period of the separation from her husband until his death, amounting to 4437 dollars 50 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqZ\">In May 1829, on the petition of the defendant <em>Jacob Fadeley, </em>he was allowed to file a bill against the executors of <em>Jane Weatherly </em>(which the order styles <em>a lili of review and, supplement) </em>and the same was filed accordingly. This bill states that since the order for account was entered in the original cause, the present complainant had found, by minute search in the clerk\u2019s office of <em>Loudoun </em>county, two deeds executed by <em>Matthew Weatherly </em>and his wife in 1808, at the period of their separation, which the said complainant was advised would entirely change the aspect of the controversy. These deeds were exhibited with the bill and prayed to be taken as a part thereof. One of them, marked A. is mutilated in part, but sufficiently appears to be a conveyance from <em>Matthew Weatherly </em>and <em>Jane </em>his wife to <em>John Littlejohn, </em>whereby the said <em>Matthew </em>and <em>Jane, </em>for the consideration of one dollar paid to the said <em>Matthew, </em>bargain and sell to <em>Littlejohn, </em>with special warranty against themselves and those claiming under them, two houses and lots lying in <em>Leeslurg, </em>and one lying in the vicinity or suburbs thereof. One of the lots is particularly described, and the mutilation occurs in the description of the other two. This deed is dated the 30th of June 1808, and is signed and sealed by <em>Matthew </em>and <em>Jane Weatherly, </em>and attested by three subscribing witnesses. The deed marked B. is dated the 30th of June 1808, and is likewise signed and sealed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>Matthew </em>and <em>Jane Weatherly, </em>and attested <em>by three wit</em>nesses. By this deed <em>Matthew Weatherly </em>and <em>Jane </em>his wife, for the consideration of 200 dollars paid to the said <em>Matthew </em>by <em>James Crane, </em>bargain and sell to the said <em>Crane \u201c </em>all the tract of land lying in the county of and the county of <em>Fauquier, </em>now in possession of the said <em>Matthew </em>and <em>Jane, </em>supposed to contain 151 acres, and a house and lot in Middleburgwith special warranty against all persons claiming under them. Annexed to this deed is a memorandum in these words: \u201c I am to convey the within property to the direction of mrs. <em>Weatherly </em>within mentioned, or to such person as</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-5\">she may direct. <em>James Crane </em>| Seal |. And the me-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\">morandum is attested by the three witnesses who subscribed the deed. The privy examination and acknowledgment of <em>Jane Weatherly </em>does not appear to have been taken to either deed, nor was either <em>of them </em>recorded. The bill then refers to the accounts reported by the commissioner, as proving that the rents of the property given up by <em>Matthew Weatherly </em>to the said <em>Jane </em>under the contract of 1808, and by her retained until the death of the said <em>Matthew, </em>with the approbation of <em>James Crane </em>the trustee chosen and appointed by her at the time of the separation, far exceeded the rents of the <em>Ijceslurg </em>lots from the death of the said <em>Matthew </em>to the death of the said <em>Jane. </em>Wherefore the bill prays, that the executors of <em>Jane Weatherly </em>may be made defendants and compelled to answer the premises; that the decree rendered in the original cause may be reviewed and set aside, and the complainant relieved entirely from the payment of the rents of the <em>Leesburg </em>lots; and general relief. An affidavit of the truth of the matters stated in the bill was made <em>by </em>the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-7\"><em>James Crane, </em>one of the executors of <em>Jane Weatherly, </em>answered the bill of <em>Fadeley. </em>He states that he has no recollection, nor does he believe, that the object of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>the deed </em>marked A. was to give <em>to Matthew Weatherby </em>a release of <em>Jane Weatherly's </em>claim to the <em>Leeslurg </em>lots un&lt;jer the marriage settlement; and he objects that neither of the deeds mentioned in the bill was ever ac-]mow\u00a1e(jge\u00bfj prove\u00bfi or recorded, and that one of them is so much mutilated as to render it impossible to perceive its object. He submits whether those deeds can anywise alter the aspect of the cause, and prays that the <em>bill of review may </em>be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-9\">No proceeding whatever against <em>the </em>other executor of <em>Jane Weatherby </em>appears in the record, nor did he ever answer the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-10\">On the 9th of December 1830, both causes came on to be heard together in the superiour court of chancery. The opinion of that court was given in the following terms: \u201c The court is of opinion that it was competent to <em>Weatherby </em>and wife, by conveyance duly executed, to pass away his right <em>to </em>the estate conveyed to <em>Burr Powell </em>by the marriage agreement, and that <em>it </em>Was also competent to them, by arrangement and proper conveyances, to reinvest each party with their respective ante-nuptial rights, the court being of opinion that a <em>feme covert, </em>where there is no express restriction, may dispose even of her separate estate in lands by proper instrument; and unless the power of disposition is required to be exercised in a particular form, the disposition will be effectual if made with the ceremonies required by law for the conveyance of the real estate of a <em>feme covert. </em>If therefore the supposed designs of the parties in 1808 had been carried into legal and effectual operation, the court is of opinion that as the pecuniary advantage of the arrangement was obviously on the side of the wife, it should have been recognized. But the court is of opinion that the newly discovered exhibits were but a project, and abandoned, the deed filed, in the original suit and dated June 30. 1808, and the bond which <em>Crane </em>was to have executed, having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>probably substituted for them; and even if this were not so, the said deeds which have served as the <em>foun~ </em>dation of this bill did not bind or affect the rights of <em>Jane Weatherly, </em>as she was not privily examined and assenting thereto.\u201d Wherefore the court decreed the <em>bill of remew </em>filed by <em>Fadeley </em>be dismissed with costs; that the said <em>Fadeley, </em>defendant in the original suit, pay to the plaintiffs in that suit (who admitted all the credits claimed by him) the sum of 803 dollars 92 cents, with interest from the 5th July 1827 till paid; that <em>II. II. Lee, </em>defendant in the said original suit, pay to the said plaintiffs 165 dollars 32 cents, with interest from the said 5th July until paid; and that the said plaintiffs in the original suit recover of the said defendants their costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-5\">From this decree <em>Fadeley </em>prayed an appeal to this court, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-6\"><em>Leigh, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-7\"><em>Johnson, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b49-11\"> He decided the cause in the court of chancery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b57-8\">Brockenbrough, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AW\"><em>Matthew Weatherly </em>being possessed of certain lots and houses in the town of Xees<em>hurg, </em>and <em>Jane M'Farland </em>widow of <em>John M'Farland </em>being possessed of considerable personal property, and of real estate in and near the town of <em>Middleburg, </em>entered into marriage articles which, before the marriage took place, were carried into effect by a deed of marriage settlement dated in January 1804. The parties made two trustees, to one of whom, <em>James Crane, </em>was conveyed all of <em>Jane M'Farland's </em>estate, and to the other, <em>Burr jPowell, </em>was conveyed all of <em>Matthew Weatherly's </em>estate. As to the first, the declaration of trust was, that after the solemnization of the marriage, <em>Weatherly </em>the husband was to enjoy all the profits of his wife\u2019s estate, real and personal, during the <em>joint lives </em>of himself and his wife, or might sell, transfer and convey, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>jointly with his wife, any of the said property of his wife which she might when sole have disposed of, <em>she consenting to the sale and joining in the conveyance; </em>if she survived the husband, the trustee was to reconvey to \u2018 her all her own estate not disposed of as aforesaid; but if the husband survived the wife, then her estate was to go to whomsoever she should by deed or will, attested by three witnesses, appoint (and in such case not to be subject to the control or debts of the said <em>Matthew Weatherly) </em>and in default of appointment, to her nephews and nieces. As to <em>his </em>estate conveyed as aforesaid to <em>Burr Powell, </em>the said trustee was to permit <em>Matthew Weatherly, </em>during his life, to receive the profits thereof, or to <em>sell and convey the same, provided his wife \u25a0should consent to the sale and join in the conveyance; </em>and in case he survived his wife, the trustee to reconvey to him; but if the wife survived the husband, the trustee was to permit <em>the wife, during her life, to enjoy the profits thereof; </em>with similar power of appointment, and on failure of appointment, to his right heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">The husband and wife did not live together in hai\u2019mony; they soon agreed to separate, and did separate. In June 1808 the parties executed two deeds. By one of these deeds (the same which is marked B. and annexed to the deposition of <em>Henderson) </em>the said <em>Matthew Weatherly </em>and <em>Jane </em>his wife conveyed with general warranty, for the consideration of 200 dollars, to <em>James Crane </em>(who was trustee of the wife in the marriage settlement deed) the land adjacent to <em>Middlelurg, </em>and the lot in that town.. By a memorandum at the foot of this deed, the said <em>James Crane </em>bound himself to convey the said property according to the direction of <em>Jane Weatherly, </em>or to such person as she might direct. The other deed (marked A.) was executed on the same day by the same grantors, to <em>John Littlejohn, </em>and although it is in part mutilated, yet it appears clearly enough to be a conveyance, for the consideration of one dollar, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>the said <em>Matthew Weatherly's </em>lots in <em>Leeslurg </em>and its suburbs. The witness <em>Henderson </em>says that <em>James Crane </em>the trustee was to execute a bond to <em>Matthew Weatherly, </em>binding himself to convey to him the said lots, so that he might receive an unincumbered title to them; and he thinks that <em>Crane </em>did execute such bond, binding himself to see the conveyance put into due form by <em>Jane </em>Weatherly, or that she should not set up any claim to the said lots. He moreover proves that the consideration operating on <em>Matthew Weatherly </em>to execute the deed <em>(B.) </em>conveying his wife\u2019s property to her trustee, was that he should receive his own lots free from incumbrance; and this is also proved by <em>Chilton. </em>To these deeds <em>Jane Weatherly </em>was never privily examined, and they were never recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">But it is clear that a separation between this husband and wife did <em>in fact </em>take place, at least as early as June 180S: that the wife did from thenceforth take and enjoy all the profits of the lot in <em>Middleburg </em>and the land adjacent, as well as of sundry slaves which were in her possession at the time of the marriage, until the death of her husband in 1821, a period of nearly 14 years. It is also certain that by the terms of the marriage settlement deed the husband was entitled to all those profits during his life, and that, by surrendering them to her use, in consequence of the arrangement made by the <em>separation </em>deeds, great loss was sustained by him, and great benefit accrued to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\"><em>Jane Weatherly </em>survived her husband, and the original bill in this case was filed by herself, for the purpose of recovering from the executor and devisee of the husband the rents and profits of his lots which accrued after his death, and those which might thereafter accrue during her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">There is no doubt that under the marriage settlement deed she would have been entitled to those rents and profits, if she had continued to stand in the same rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>tion towards her husband as she did on the execution of it. But the question is whether, either under the <em>separation </em>deeds, or the fact of actual separation and the enjoyment of her own property as before mentioned, she or her executors can now recover those profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">It was contended by the appellant\u2019s counsel that the' deed (marked A.) which purports to convey the lots of the husband to <em>Littlejohn, </em>was made in conformity with the power and authority conferred by the marriage settlement deed on <em>Weatherly, </em>to sell and convey the same, provided his wife should consent to the sale and join in the conveyance. I cannot think so, for two reasons; first, because the sale contemplated by the marriage settlement deed was one which should transfer the estate to a real purchaser, and not to a mere trustee for the purpose of reconveying it to the husband himself; and secondly, because the wife did not unite in the conveyance to <em>Littlejohn in the mode directed by law. She </em>was not privily examined; and although the settlement deed does not in terms speak of a privy examination, yet as there is no other mode by which a <em>feme covert </em>can by law convey her interest in land, the parties cannot be supposed to mean any other, unless they had so expressed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">It was next contended by the appellant\u2019s counsel that the actual separation which occurred in this case, following the clearly proved parol agreement to separate on certain specific terms, and the possession of the property, real and personal, yielded to the wife in virtue of that agreement, would justify a court of equity specifically to execute that contract, on a bill filed by the wife for that purpose. This position is, I think, supported by the decisions of the courts of equity in <em>'England, </em>in which it seems to be established that husband and wife have the power to effect a legal and binding separation through the intervention of trustees, by mutual agreement to part. 2 Roper 272. In this case, infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>mal as the instrument is which was executed by the * husband and wife, yet the agreement to separate and the terms of the separation are satisfactorily proved, and this was to be effected through the agency of <em>James Crane, </em>the same trustee who had been chosen when settlement was made. If the husband had undertaken to dispossess the wife of this <em>Middleburg </em>property, after having separated by mutual consent, and after having yielded to her the property for her own use, I am of opinion that a court of equity would rightfully have interposed, and have specifically executed the agreement of separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">But the husband made no such attempt; on the contrary he quietly surrendered to her all her own property, to the profits of which he would have been entitled but for the agreement to separate; he voluntarily extended equity to her; he did all that the most liberal forum could have required at his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">But she is not contented with that full measure of justice. Having, during her husband\u2019s life, claimed <em>against </em>the deed of settlement, as soon as she becomes a <em>feme sole </em>she sets up her claim <em>under </em>the deed. This is unjust and iniquitous, and cannot be tolerated. It would not be right to allow her claim, without requiring her to account for the profits received from her part of the estate, even if those profits were less than those accruing from her husband\u2019s part. How much more glaring is it, when it is proved that they are much greater! It appears that the net profits of the husband\u2019s estate from the time of his death to the death of the wife were 969 dollars 24 cents; and by the commissioner\u2019s report, founded on <em>M'VeigKs </em>evidence, the profits which she derived -from her part of the estate, after the separation and to the time of her husband\u2019s death, amounted to 4437 dollars 50 cents; which sum he would have been entitled to, but for the separation.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>I am of opinion that the decree be reversed with costs; that the original bill filed by <em>Jane Weatherly </em>be dismissed; and that the appellant recover his costs, as well in the suit in which he was plaintiff as in the said \u00bb \u2022 <em>-t </em>\u2022 . original suit.</p>\n<author id=\"A9n\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A-P\">It is not necessary to decide whether, if either of the parties to the terms of separation, so clearly and fully proved in this case, had refused to comply with those terms, a court of equity would have enforced their specific execution. That question does not arise: for they were actually executed by the parties themselves; so far at least as related to the enjoyment of the benefits resulting from the arrangement. <em>Weatherly </em>yielded up all his rights under the marriage settlement, and strictly complied during the balance of his life, a period of 14 'years, with the terms of the separation, which were disadvantageous to himself and highly beneficial to his wife. During all this period she acquiesced in and received the benefit of the arrangement made by her own trustee, and then, on the death of her husband, claimed the benefit of the marriage settlement which she had so long repudiated. This ought not to be tolerated in a .court of equity and good conscience.
