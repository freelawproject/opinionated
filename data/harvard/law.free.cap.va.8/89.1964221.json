And therefore, the court doth order, adjudge and decree, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>that the probate of the said will be revolted, annulled, and . , , , , ... ,. set aside; and the paper purporting to be a will as aioresaid, be considered and declared to be null, void and of no effect.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-7\">Whereupon, another will of the said <em>William Savage, </em>deceased, was exhibited by Doctor <em>Samuel Dickinson, </em>one of the executors named in the said will; and there being no subscribing witness to the same, it was proved by the oaths of two witnesses, that the whole of the said will, as well as the signature, was in the handwriting of the said <em>William Savage, </em>deceased; and thereupon, <em>Dickinson </em>qualified as executor, and obtained letters testamentary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-8\">In April 1785, <em>Rice </em>exhibited the first named will to the genera] court of Virginia for probate there : which <em>Walter Jones </em>opposed, and produced a copy of the record of the proceedings aforesaid in the court of North Carolina, in support of his opposition to the said probate^; and thereupon the general court made the following order, <em>\u201c </em>the court here, on hearing what could be alledged by the counsel on both sides, not being advised as to their jurisdiction herein; and being of opinion, that it is a case of difficulty and novelty, do adjourn the same to the court of appeals.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-9\"><em>On </em>the part of <em>Rice, </em>it was insisted, that, as the will respected lands lying in Virginia, the court of North Carolina had not jurisdiction as to those lands; but that the question of probate with regard to them, belonged exclusively to the courts of Virginia; for no country assumes jurisdiction over the lands of another : and that the lands lie in another state out of the jurisdiction of the court in which the action is brought, is always a good plea in abatement. That therefore, whether the lands in Virginia were devised, or not, was a question which necessarily belonged to the courts here to decide; and, of course, the sufficiency of all instruments to pass them. Consequently, that the question, on the will, so far as related to those lands, was <em>coram non judice, </em>in the court of North Carolina; and therefore, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>general court ought to have received probate of the will, notwithstanding the North Carolina judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-4\">For <em>Jones, </em>on the other hand, it was urged, that as the testator lived in North Carolina, whether the paper produced was his will or not, emphatically belonged to the courts of that state to decide; and, as the competent tribunal there had pronounced it void, on account of the incapacity of the testator to make it, the decision was conclusive, and barred all further enquiry. That it is not universally true, that every question relating to lands, in a foreign country, must be decided by the courts of that country : for events may arise, which may incidentally, bring the instrument conveying them into controversy in another country; as, if the deed was obtained by fraud, and a bill in chancery were brought to set it aside, on account of the fraud, it would be competent to the court to declare the writing void for misconduct in the grantee, although the lands did not lie within the jurisdiction of the court, as fraud vitiated the instrument every where, and the courts of all countries were competent to decide upon it. That, with respect to the other property, mentioned in the will, it was admitted the Carolina court had complete jurisdiction; and it was novel doctrine to say, that an instrument declared void on account of fraud by one court, could -be resuscitated by another, which, in the main, admitted the rectitude of the decision made by the annulling court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The judgment of the court of appeals was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">\u201c The court this day gave their opinion, that the general court are not restrained from receiving any will, by which, lands, lying in this state, are devised, so far as the title of lands may be affected, although the same will may have been declared void by any court in any other of the United States, for any cause whatever.\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
