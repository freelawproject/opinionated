The record stated that the parties, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>their attorneys, mutually submitted all matters of differenco between them in these suits to the final determination of <em>Bolden Rhodes </em>and <em>Herbert A. </em>Claiborne, gentlemen, and agreed that their award, or the award of such person as they should choose for an umpire* thereupon, should be made the judgment of the court; and the same was ordered accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-4\">The arbitrators reported, that having heard the parties and maturely considered the evidence by them produced, they found the following facts, either admitted by the parties, or proved to their satisfaction, viz. That the defendant, beiug indebted to the plaintiffs on the 10th February 182S in the sum of 176 dollars 37 cents, by single bill dated June the 19th 1827 and payable on demand (which forms the subject of the suit first mentioned) and in the further sum of 85 dollars 80 cents with interest from 7lh December 1827, for goods furnished to him between the 19th June 1827 and the 10th February 182S, and in the further sum of 65 dollars 90 cents with interest from 1st April 1827, for goods furnished to <em>Martha W. Harrison </em>on the credit of the defendant (which two last sums form the subject of the other suit) did, on the said 10th February 1828, draw a draft or inland bill of that date, in favour of the plaintiffs, on <em>Jerman Baker </em>then of <em>Richmond </em>city, for 155 dollars, without time of payment mentioned therein, and so payable at sight; \"which draft the defendant inclosed to the plaintiffs in a letter of the same date, directing the money, <em>'when received, </em>to be placed to his credit with them. That the plaintiffs received the letter and draft in due course of mail, and duly presented the draft to the drawee, who, on the 15th of February 1828, accepted the same in writing, payable at CO days. That the plaintiffs put the draft into bank for collection, and it was protested for nonpayment on the 18th of April 1828. That late in March 1828 the drawee died insolvent. That on or about the 4th of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>April 1828, the plaintiffs\u2019 clerk presented to the defen<em>i r , i </em>. dant, tor a settlement by note, a written statement ot their account against him, not mentioning the said draft \u00b0 . \u00b0 or single bill, or the particulars of their demand, but merely referring to and stating the amount of a former account, rendered on the 7th of December 1827, in which the said single bill Avas comprised ; and that on the presentation aforesaid the defendant declined giving his note, saying he would be in town again in a short time, and Avould pay the account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-8\">The report of the arbitrators then proceeds as follows: \u201cWhether the defendant examined the account so presented, or whether the amount was mentioned to him, does not appear to us. Nor does it appear to us that any thing was then said, to or by him, of the draft aforesaid, or that he then had received notice or had knowledge of the presentment of the draft, of the terms of acceptance, of its nonpayment, or of its deposit in bank. Sometime afterwards, and after the <em>draft </em>was protested for nonpayment, when applied to for a settlement of the account, the defendant claimed credit for the amount of the draft.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-9\">And upon the facts aforesaid we differ in 'opinionj one of us, viz. <em>Holden </em>Rhodes, being of opinion that the said defendant should have credit for the amount of the said draft, <em>to be </em>applied in discharge of the said open account at the time of the presentment of the said draft by the plaintiffs to the drawee, viz. February 15. 1828, which would then leave a balance due to the plaintiffs, on the said open account, of 1 dollar 9 cents with interest from the same time; that the suit founded on the said open account should be dismissed at the costs of the plaintiffs, the said balance of 1 dollar 9 cents being applied in reduction of the costs to be adjudged to the defendant therein; and that the plaintiffs should have judgment for the amount claimed by them in the first mentioned suit, with interest and costs. And the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>of us, viz. <em>Herbert A. </em>Claiborne, being of opinion that it was also in proof that the plaintiffs were in the habit of receiving drafts and other claims from their country customers, for collection, and that their general rule was not to apply such claims, but the money thereupon when collected, to the credit of their accounts against such country customers, is therefore, under all the circumstances of the ease, led inevitably to the conclusion that the said draft was never considered by the plaintiffs as a payment; that the defendant himself, at the time it was sent, did not. consider the draft as a payment, and never thought of contending for it as such, <em>till after the </em>death of <em>Jermun Bulker </em>and the insolvency of his estate had become notorious; and therefore that the said draft should be rejected as a payment: that the plaintiffs should have judgment for the principal, interest and costs in the first mentioned suit; and in the second suit, for 151 dollars <em>70 </em>cents, with interest on 65 dollars 90 cents part thereof from the 1st of April 1827 till paid, and with interest on 85 dollars 80 cents the residue thereof from the 7th of December 1827 till paid, and the costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-4\">Wherefore we the arbitrators aforesaid, not being able to agree upon any award between the said parties, choose and appoint <em>Convmj Robinson </em>esq. as umpire to determine between the parties aforesaid, in pursuance of the order aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-5\">The award of the umpire was as follows: \u201cUpon the facts reported by the arbitrators, the question is presented whether the defendant is entitled to make a discount against the demand of the plaintiffs, of the bill on <em>Jerman Bulker, </em>mentioned in the report of the said arbitrators. If he is so entitled, it is because his discount is in the nature of a payment, or is the proper subject of a set-ofE</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-6\">I think it is very clear that the bill was not offered nor received in <em>payment (pro tanto) </em>of a previously ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>isting debt; but the money, <em>when </em>received, was to be placed to the credit of the defendant. The money was never received; and it cannot be regarded as a payment on the part of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AxH\">The other and more difficult enquiry is whether the defendant has any claim against the plaintiffs, arising out of the bill, which can be made the subject of a set-off in these suits; and the answer to this,enquiry depends upon several questions, which will now be considered in their proper order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-6\">1. Did the plaintiffs ever make themselves liable on account of the bill? I think they did. Although they did not receive it in payment, yet they took it to be collected in the usual method of business, and that method ought to have been pursued. It was not pursued. The bill, according to its legal effect, was a bill payable at sight; and the plaintiffs, instead of getting it accepted according to its tenor, took an acceptance payable at 60 days. They were not <em>bound to receive such an </em>acceptance, but might have treated the bill as dishonoured, and given notice to the drawer. Yet if they did receive it, it became their duty to give immediate notice to the drawer, of the nature of the acceptance offered. By giving such notice they might have discharged themselves from all liability; for they would thereby have put it in the power of the drawer to recover from the drawee the debt in the hands of the latter. By failing to give notice, they leave the drawer under an impression that the bill has been paid according to its tenor, and prevent him from using any measures to obtain the money due from-his debtor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-7\"><em>2. </em>After the plaintiffs had been guilty of <em>laches </em>in respect of the bill, and thereby made themselves liable on that account, was the claim of the defendant against them waived by the subsequent promise which he made ? Before it can be held that the promise amounted to a waiver of claim on account of the <em>laches </em>of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>tiffs, I think it should be established that, at the time of making the promise, the <em>laches </em>was known to the detendant. That knowledge, I think, cannot be presumed in this case. It does not appear that the defendant exa- , , , . . , mined the account, or that the amount was mentioned to him. In the absence of any information to the contrary, derived from the plaintiffs or from an inspection of the account, it was reasonable for the defendant to suppose that the plaintiffs had done their duty in relation to the bill; and if that had been done, he had a right to conclude that the money was paid according to the terms of the bill, and was placed to his credit with the plaintiffs. Under such circumstances, the promise of the defendant must be regarded as a promise to pay the account upon a supposition that he was allowed therein the amount of the bill. This view of the case is not repelled by the fact that if the bill had been credited, there was hut a small balance due on the open account. It can hardly be supposed that the defendant knew precisely how much he owed the plaintiffs; and independent of this, the promise extended to the single bill, which was embraced in the account. But while the view which I have taken is not affected by the actual condition of the accounts, its correctness is strongly enforced by what transpired afterwards. After the bill had been protested, the defendant claimed a credit for the amount of it. Why then did he claim the credit, if he had waived it on the 4th April 1328? Was it because <em>Baker </em>had in the meantime become insolvent? Certainly not; for <em>Baker </em>had died insolvent in March 1828. It is not susceptible of that explanation, but it is susceptible of a different one. When he promised to pay the account, he did not know that the bill had not been credited. When he claimed the credit, the fact had been ascertained to be otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-9\">3. The plaintiffs being liable for their conduct in relation to the bill, is that liability necessarily the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>of the bill ? and if not, what is the extent of it ? I do not think the liability, when ascertained to exist, must 0f necessity be the amount of the bill. <em>The </em>relation in this case seems to me to be that of principal and agent. The plaintiffs undertook the collection of a bill in the usual course of business, and having done so, they were bound to exert such a portion of activity and care as might reasonably satisfy the trust reposed in them. They have failed in this, and I consider have made themselves liable for the actual damage sustained by the defendant by reason of that failure. That damage \u25a0may in point of fact be the amount of the bill, or it may be less.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-4\">4. Is the actual damage sustained by the defendant \u2022such damage as the defendant has a right to set off in these suits ? I know of no better rule as to the damages which may be the subject of set-off than this, that they -must be liquidated, and (where they do not grow out of a specialty) such as <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>will lie for. In this case, it seems to me, the damages could not be recovered in an action of <em>assumpsit for the payment of money; </em>but the action would be one setting forth the implied undertaking to use due care in the collection of the <em>bill; </em>charging a breach of that undertaking, and a \u25a0consequent loss to the plaintiff, and claiming damages for that loss. These damages must be regarded as unliquidated and uncertain. The case of <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Hackley, </em>2 Cranch 342. seems to me completely analogous, and to leave scarcely a doubt upon' the subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-5\">Entertaining the opinion that the damages which the -defendant has sustained by the misconduct of the plaintiffs in relation to the bill cannot be set off in these suits, it is altogether useless to determine on the amount of those damages. Although I should be of opinion that the amount of the damages is the amount of the bill, yet I could not allow the damages without, in my opinion, exceeding the powers given me by the submis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>sion. Those powers are, to determine <em>the matters in controversy between the parties in these suits: </em>and the matter in controversy touching the bill is whether the bill or any part of it can be allowed as a sot-off' <em>in these </em>suits, or either of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-5\">Upon all the facts reported by the arbitrators, 1 <em>Conway Robinson </em>am of opinion, and do therefore award and determine, that the plaintiffs, in their action of debt against the defendant, recover against the said defendant the sum of 176 dollars 37 cents, with interest from the 19th of June 1827 till payment, and their costs about their said suit expended ; and that the said plaintiffs, in their action on the case against the defendant, <em>recover </em>against the said defendant the sum of 1-51 dollars 70 cents, with interest on 65 dollars 90 cents part thereof from the. 1st of April 1827, and on 85 dollars 80 cents the residue thereof from the 7th of December 1827, till payment, and their costs about the said last-mentioned suit expended.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-6\">The award being returned to the superiour court of law at October term 1830, judgment was rendered pursuant thereto in each action.

The submission was \u201c of all matters of difference between the parties in this suit.\u201d There is a well settled distinction between such a submission, and a general reference of all matters in difference between the parties. <em>Malcolm and others </em>v. <em>Fullerton, 2 </em>T. R. 645. The umpire was therefore right in looking to the pleadings to determine the extent of his authority. The issues were payment or no payment, set-off or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>no set-off; and the matters in difference beween the parties were, whether the defendant had paid the debt or had an available set-off against it. Payment was not pretended; and the set-off consisted of an order on <em>Jerman Baker </em>in favour of the plaintiffs, payable at sight, which draft the defendant enclosed to the plaintiffs in a letter, directing the money, <em>when </em>received, to be placed to his credit. It is manifest that this was no payment to the plaintiffs, until the money was received ; for he directs it to be placed to his credit <em>when </em>received\u201e Nor is it a good set-off, unless the <em>negligence of the </em>plaintiffs in collecting the amount of the draft made them liable for <em>liquidated </em>damages, and entitled the defendant to bring <em>assumpsit </em>for that amount. But the umpire decided (and in my opinion correctly) that the liability of the plaintiffs was not necessarily to the amount of the order on <em>Baker, </em>but for such damages as a jury might assess for any supposed misconduct of the plaintiffs in <em>collecting the </em>debt; which <em>damages were </em>wholly unliquidated and uncertain. They might be merely nominal, or they might amount to the sum of 155 dollars mentioned in the draft or order. If <em>Baker was </em>insolvent at the date of the bill, or when it came into the plaintiffs\u2019 hands, or if any other cause rendered it prudent for these agents to take an acceptance a.t 60 days, instead of returning it to their principal, a jury would give no damages; and other circumstances might vary their amount, from one cent to the full amount of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">If this be the nature of the defendant\u2019s claim, he could not offer it as a set-off, even if the arbitrators are to be regarded as chancellors; for although the law allows all just discounts, it does not, in <em>any </em>court, permit unliquidated demands to be set off. <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Couch, </em>6 Rand. 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The objection taken that the award is not <em>final </em>seems to me to have no weight. An award is final which set-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>ties the matters submitted ; and I have endeavoured to shew that this claim for unliquidated damages was not included in the order of reference. The award itself, too, shews that the subject matter of this claim was not passed upon by the umpire. The idea therefore that <em>Harrison., </em>by the award, is denied the power of recovering any claim against <em>Wortham SfM\u2019Gruder </em>for a breach of their implied undertaking to use due diligence in the collection of the bill, is wholly without foundation. <em>If </em>in such action the defendants should plead the award, the plaintiff might reply that the subject matter of the present action was not included in the reference, and not considered or determined by the arbitrators. And even if the reference had been more general, it would not have barred the action. <em>Ravee </em>v. <em>Farmer, </em>4 T. R. 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">This view of the case renders it unnecessary to give any opinion upon another point arising in the cause; namely, whether the appellant can be permitted to urge objections to the award, in this court, when it does not appear by the record that any objection or exception to it was taken in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">T\u00fccker, P. and Cabell, J. concurred in the opinion of judge <em>Parker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
