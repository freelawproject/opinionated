That, upon application to the auditor for payment, he refused; and thereupon, they applied to the legislature, who referred them to the judiciary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-9\">The auditor, on the 6th of April, 1792, admitted notice of the appeal; and endorsed upon the petition, That he did not recollect that the claim had ever been submitted to him before the claimants made application for payment to the general assembly; and that the resolution of the legislature referring it to the judiciary, had now taken it out of the cognizance of the auditor. That if application had been made to him before that resolution, he should have required proof of the impressment and appraisement of the vessel and cargo.

If, however, the impressment had been legal, the county court had not cognizance of the case, but the whole proceeding was <em>coram non judice, </em>and void. For the act of November 1781, only gave jurisdiction as to property impressed within the body of a county, which was not the case here. Besides, the act had expired by its own limitation, before application to the court; and none of the continuing acts were in force when the certificate was obtained. The proceeding was <em>ex parte; </em>and it does not appear that there were any papers or evidence before the court to enable it to form a correct opinion upon the subject. The petitioners did not leave the vessel in the possession of the public, but raised, and kept her after she had been sunk, without any application to government; which had consequently no opportunity of ascertaining the condition of the property, or the amount of the loss. The most, therefore, that the petitioners could claim upon account of the vessel, with any semblance of justice, would be the expense of repairing her; but the certificate far exceeds any fair compensation upon that account: and, as to the tobacco, there is no voucher or testimony which supports the quantity or value of the article. The lapse of time precludes enquiry, as the public have not only lost such countervailing testimony as it would have been in their power to have produced at an earlier period; but are deprived, by the act of congress, of an opportunity of obtaining reimbursement from the United States; which would not have happened, if a recent investigation before the proper tribunals had taken place.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\n<em>Marshall, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afn\">From the nature of things, the exe- . . . ..... , , cutive must, in periods of imminent danger, have power to impress such articles as are necessary for the immediate defence of the country against the ravages of an invading foe; and there can be no other distinction, as to the articles be impressed, than the purposes for which they are wanted, and the exigency of the case. The county court had jurisdiction under the act of November 1781, which was meant to apply to all impressments, and the time for application had not expired, as the spirit of the continuing acts embraced it. It is not material that the impressment was in the bay, as it was made within the acknowledged jurisdiction of the state; for the legislature did not regard the place of impressment, but their sole object was a fair investigation before an impartial tribunal. That the proceeding was <em>ex parte, </em>is no objection; for the act meant that it should be so; and the confidence of the legislature was that the county court would take care of the interest of the public. There is nothing to impeach the opinion of the county court; and it was not necessary, that the evidence, upon which it was founded, should be stated. The petitioners did right in taking possession of the vessel, as it was a saving to the state, which had no longer any occasion for her. There has been no delay on the part of the claimants ; on the contrary, their efforts were incessant. For they successively applied to the county court, the auditor, and the assembly, who referred them to the judiciary. Therefore nothing was left undone, which it was in their power to perform.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-8\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b375-9\">Pendleton, President,</author>\n<p id=\"A1T-\">delivered the opinion of the court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">The question as to the power of the executive to impress, is settled by a resolution of the general assembly, passed in March 178], in the following words : \u201c Resolved, that the governor, with the advice of council, be empowered to impress and take into the public service such and so many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>vessels, being private property, with their crews, for the transportation of troops, military stores or baggage across the rivers, creeks or bays, or other purposes as the exigencies of affairs and the public service may require; and that general assembly do approve of the conduct of the governor in heretofore impressing such vessels and their crews for the purpose of forwarding the public service, and that they will indemnify the proprietor thereof for all loss and damage consequent thereupon.\u201d By this resolution, the court think that the impressment in the present case was either authorized, or <em>approved; </em>and that the public was bound to pay the loss consequent upon it. But the certificate of the county court of Nansemond, made on the 14th of June, 1784, when there was no law in force to authorize it, should not have been received to fix <em>the </em>amount of the loss; but that the same ought to have been ascertained by the original appraisement, if to be had, and found to be liable to no objection upon the score of fairness or justice : or if that was not to be had, or was found to be exceptionable on either of the grounds just mentioned, then by other satisfactory, evidence. The judgment of the district court is therefore to be reversed; and the following is to be the entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The court is of opinion, that under the resolution of the general assembly of March the twelfth, 1781, the impressment of the vessel and cargo of the appellees in the proceedings mentioned, by order of the executive, was either authorized or approved, and the public was bound to pay them for their loss consequent thereon: But that the certificate of the county court of Nansemond, of June the fourteenth, 1784, when there was no law in force which authorized county courts to adjust and certify such claims, ought not to have been admitted to fix the amount thereof, which should be ascertained by the original appraisement, if to be had, and liable to no objection as to its fairness or justice : But if that is not to be had, or should be found exceptionable on either of those grounds, then by other satisfactory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>proof; and that the judgment aforesaid is erroneous : Therefore it is considered that the same be reversed and annulled, and that the appellees pay the costs of the prosecution of the appeal aforesaid here: and the cause is remanded to the said district court for that court to proceed to ascertain the loss of the appellees in manner before directed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Upon the return of the cause to the district court, that court made the following order: <em>\u201c </em>It not appearing that the original appraisement of the vessel and cargo in the proceedings mentioned is to be had, the court proceeded to hear the cause on the petition of appeal aforesaid, sundry depositions and exhibits, the judgment aforesaid of the court of appeals, the testimony of divers witnesses, who were sworn and examined, and the arguments of counsel; on consideration whereof, it is ordered that an issue be made up, in order to ascertain the appellants\u2019\" loss, consequent on the impressment of the said vessel and cargo, by order of the executive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The petitioners accordingly filed a declaration, stating the impressment, sinking, and injury to. the brig, with the total loss of the cargo; and that the commonwealth was liable to them for the loss sustained, amounting to <em>\u00a3 </em>7000.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The <em>attorney general </em>pleaded, that the petitioners had <em>\u201c </em>sustained no damage by the impressment of the vessel and cargo;\u201d and the petitioners took issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Verdict, that the petitioners had \u201c sustained damage by the impressment of the vessel and cargo in the declaration mentioned ;\u201d and assessed the same as follows, to wit, to the sum of \u00a34264. 8. 3J. for principal, and \u00a3 2771. 17. 4\u00bf. for interest, amounting in the whole to \u00a3 7036. 5. 7\u00a3.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">The court, however, was of opinion that the petitioners were not entitled to interest; and gave judgment for the \u00a3 4264. 8. 3J. only.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">The <em>attorney general </em>appealed to the court of appeals; but the judgment was affirmed, in April 1794.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
