During the same year that the sale was made, the testator died. On the 16th of December 1807 his will was proved, and two months afterwards <em>John Mitchell </em>and <em>Conally Finlay </em>qualified as executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-4\">On the 9th of May 1812, <em>John Allen, </em>by a writing under his hand and seal, transferred to <em>Daniel Sheffey </em>the legacy given to himself and wife; and soon after-wards <em>Sheffey </em>filed a bill to recover the same, in the superiour court of chancery ho'lden at <em>Wythe </em>court bouse, making <em>Finlay </em>a,nd <em>Mitchell </em>the executors of <em>King, </em>and <em>Allen </em>the assignor of complainant, defendants thereto. A bill of revivor and supplement was afterwards filed, to revive the cause against the representatives of the executors, and making the other devisees interested in the <em>Fincastle </em>property parties to the suit. <em>Finlay's </em>administrator insisted in his answer, that by the sale which the testator made of the <em>Fincastle </em>property, the legacy to <em>Allen </em>and wife, of one fifth of the proceeds of that property, was adeemed. The cause being transferred to the circuit court of <em>Wythe, </em>that, court declared its opinion <em>to bo, </em>that the legacy to <em>Allen </em>and wife was specific, and not adeemed by any act of the testator; and an account was thereupon ordered of the administration on <em>King's </em>estate, and also upon the estate of <em>Finlay, </em>who appeared to have been the acting executor of <em>King. </em>From this decree an appeal was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b635-12\"><em>M'Comas, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AOX\"><em>Preston, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b635-13\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AcW\">The testator in this case gave to his wife one third part of the rents and profits of his <em>Fin-castle </em>property, for her life, leaving <em>the </em>other two thirds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>during her life undisposed of, except that he constituted that property the fund for paying his debts. He then says, \u201c To the children of my son and daughter <em>Conally </em>and <em>Nancy Finlay, </em>I give one half of my personal property in <em>Washington, </em>also two fifth parts of the net proceeds of my estate in <em>Fincastle </em>aforesaid, <em>which is to be sold at my beloved wife\u2019s death, at the discretion of my exe'cutors.\u201d </em>He then gives two other fifths to <em>Mitchell </em>and wife, and the remaining fifth to <em>Allen </em>and wife, whose interest is claimed by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">It seems to have been <em>assumed </em>by the counsel for the appellee, that these devises of the proceeds of the <em>Fincastle </em>estate were to be considered as <em>legacies; </em>but it was very properly admitted that <em>as </em>legacies, they came within the description of <em>specific </em>legacies. And if they are legacies at all, in the strict sense of the term, they are strictly specific, and are not of that class of legacies of money or quantity, which are said to be only <em>in the nature </em>of specific legacies, and which, if the fund be called in or fail, will be paid out of the general assets. 1 Roper on Legacies 169. For here it is clear, the testator had no design that his general asset's should ever be charged with these legacies. The fund out of which they were to come was a <em>land </em>fund, and the personalty could never be reached by them. 6 Munf. 163. Moreover, it was not a bequest of a <em>certain </em>sum (as of 500 dollars) chargeable upon the land, which, according to the case of <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Willoughby, 2 </em>Sim. &amp; Stuart 354. might be charged on the general assets, if the land failed, but it was a devise of an <em>uncertain </em>interest, which would be more or less, according to the price for which the land might sell; the amount of which did not admit of being ascertained except by sale. And if the testator had in his lifetime given the land to his three sons, or devised it to them by a subsequent will, it cannot be pretended that the legatees under this will could have resorted to the personal estate for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Now in this point of view it is clear that intention uias nothing to do with the question of ademption. The question is merely whether there be an extinction of the subject. \u201c The word ademption,\u201d says a standard writer, \u201c when applied to specific legacies of stock or money, or securities for money, must be considered as synonymous with <em>extinction. </em>For if stock &amp;c. so bequeathed be sold or disposed of, there is a complete extinction of the subject, and nothing remains to which the words of the will can apply. For if the proceeds from such sale or disposition were <em>to be </em>substituted, and permitted to pass, the effect would be to convert a specific into a general legacy. 3 Brown\u2019s G. C. 432. The intention of the testator is <em>immaterial </em>in the ademption of specific legacies, because the subject being extinct at the death of the testator, there is nothing upon which the will can operate.\u201d These positions seem to me to be sound and incontrovertible. If then this had been an actual bequest of <em>stock, </em>and subsequently to the execution of the will the stock had been sold, though the <em>proceeds </em>of the stock were brought into the personal fund, and could be ascertained, yet the legatee could not have <em>followed </em>them into that fund, and demanded that they should be <em>paid to </em>him; since that would be, in the language of <em>the </em>lord chancellor in the above cited case, to convert a specific into a general legacy. We shall presently see that the case at bar is much stronger than the case supposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">To come to a just understanding of this case, however, we must consider it more closely. - This is the ease of a devise; and it is a devise of <em>real </em>estate. This is sufficiently obvious from the consideration, that to make the will effectual as to this clause, it must be proved as a will of real estate. No one can suppose that a devise that lands shall be sold and the proceeds paid to A. B. would be valid to authorize the sale of the lands, unless the will be executed according to the sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>tute. It was clearly, then, a will of real estate. And if not a devise to the executors in so many words, yet in equity the descent is considered as broken by a de~ vise that the land shall be sold for payment of debts or legacies. 7 Ves. 319. 8 Ves. 26. Nay more, \u2014 from the earliest time, \u201c albeit the executors, in case of a devise that they shall sell, have no estate or interest in the land, but only a bare an'd naked power, yet their feoffment amounteth to an <em>alienation, </em>to vest the land in the <em>feoffee; </em>and the feoffee shall be <em>in by the devisor.\u201d </em>1 Tho. Co. Lit. 459, [397,] So, completely, indeed, is it a devise of the land to the three beneficiaries, that if it had not been sold, <em>Finlay, Mitchell </em>and <em>Allen might now, </em>by their concurrent act, demand a conveyance of the land itself, And arrest the sale; for a right to the whole proceeds of the estate is a right to the estate itself. This matter was very fully discussed in the case of <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin\u2019s ex\u2019ors &amp;c. </em>5 Munf. 156. in which the court indeed was divided, but upon the ground that the legatees, being aliens and incapable to take land, had not a right of election to take the land itself, but were confined to take the interest as money. But it was most strongly contended by judges <em>Cabell </em>and <em>Roane </em>(and judge <em>Broohe </em>concurred with them, though he did not sit) that the effect of a devise that land should be sold and the money paid over to A. and B. was to vest in A. and B. an <em>equitable </em>interest in the land itself, and that this was so even in the case of aliens. I do not understand judge <em>Coalter </em>or judge <em>Fleming </em>as denying the general proposition. They only denied its application to aliens, and others disabled to hold lands; on the ground that this maxim of equity cannot be extended to them, against the principles of public policy, or merely for their own destruction. I will add a reference to some of the cases cited. 9 Mod. 167. 3 P. Wms. 46. Doug. 770. In this last case lord <em>Mansfield </em>says, \u201c A devisee of the surplus arising from the sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>lands <em>has an equitable interest </em>in the lands themselves, it being in his option to pay the debts and legacies and keep the lands.\u201d And it is the same thing, whether the whole proceeds of sale are devised to one, or to be divided among several; although a bequest of a sped-lie sum of <em>\u00a3 </em>100. to be paid out of the proceeds of sale, is a money legacy, with a collateral charge only for payment. This equitable interest may be enforced by the legatee against the person holding the legal estate, whether heir or executor, and a conveyance will be decreed in his <em>favour; so </em>that in this case the legatees might, at this day, if the land were unsold, file their bill against the heirs for a conveyance of the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The devise, then, being of realty, that is, of an equitable interest in land, was revoked by alienation. This principle is too plain to require support. If I devise lands today, and sell them tomorrow, it is a revocation; and it will make no diiibrence, although I should buy them back again the next day. See 7 T. R. 416. 5 Johns. Ch. Rep. 441. 1 Wms. Saund. 277. n. 4. 2 Munf. 209. and the cases cited in that case; <em>7 </em>Johns. Ch. Rep. 258, 270. 19 Ves. 170, 178. According to this principle, if <em>King, </em>after having sold the lands, had taken them back again, the will would not have operated upon them. And if it would not have operated upon <em>them, </em>by what course of reasoning can it be made to operate upon the <em>bonds </em>for which (hey were sold ?</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">So much for the case, upon matter of <em>principle. </em>But, as lord <em>Eldon </em>said in <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Ekins, 7 </em>Ves. 323. \u201c what is infinitely more satisfactory to me,\u201d upon <em>authority </em>there was a clear revocation of this devise. In the case of <em>Arnald </em>v. <em>Arnald, </em>1 Bro. Ch. Ca. 401. <em>E. M. </em>by her will ordered her estate to be sold, and the <em>produce </em>to be divided between several persons. After making the will, she sold the estate for .\u00a32500. part of which was left on mortgage, and the remainder was invested in the 3 per cents; so that the price was easily followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>into the personalty. It was contended (precisely as has been contended here) that this was not a revocation; that the testatrix had only done the act herself, which, at the time of making the will, she intended should be done by the trustees; and although the legatees could not take it <em>in the form in which the testatrix then intended, they might have the substance. </em>This is the very argument of our counsel; yet the court said, \u201c There is an <em>absolute disposition </em>made by the will; and before that can take effect, another absolute disposition, inconsistent with it, is made by the testatrix herself.\u201d His lordship <em>(Thurlow) </em>therefore decreed that the will was revoked; and the residuary legatee of the personal estate took the produce or proceeds of sale of the lands, as part of the personalty. So in <em>Newbold </em>v. <em>Roadknight, </em>1 Russell &amp; Mylne 677. there was a devise to trustees to sell, and out of the proceeds to pay <em>T. N. </em>\u00bf63000.; and the residue to be divided among several. Afterwards the testator sold the lands, and conveyed them to the purchaser. The master of the rolls decided, that all the legacies were adeemed, \u2014 even the particular legacy of <em>\u00a3 </em>3000. He said, \u201c The gift to one of a sum of money, part of the produce of real estate directed to be sold, followed by a gift'of the residue of the purchase money to others, is substantially a <em>gift of the estate, </em>and not a gift of legacies with a collateral <em>charge </em>upon the estate;\u201d and that, he said, distinguished this case from <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Willoughby.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">These cases seem to me decisive of the present question. See Powell on Devises 376. A distinction, however, has been attempted between the last case and the case at bar, which, if well founded, applies also <em>to Arnold </em>v. <em>Arnold. </em>It is, that there the land was devised to <em>trustees, </em>\u2014 here <em>there </em>is no such devise. But I have already shewn that there is a devise of the equitable title, and the heir himself is trustee for the legatees. The distinction therefore weighs nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>But It is said that the testator, having in this ca.se direeled a sale out and out, the character of personalty is imperatively fixed upon the land, and the lega<em>t</em>ees would have taken it as personalty. This <em>principle </em>is not denied, but its <em>application </em>is. It is a principle that is called into action in all cases, as between the legatees themselves, when ail will not assent to take <em>land </em>instead of money, and between the husband or other personal representative of a legatee, and the heir. In those cases the estate is considered as of the character imperatively fixed by <em>the </em>will. The rule rests upon the principie, that equity considers that as done by the executor or trustee, which ought to have been done, and that the rights of parties shall not be affected by the trustee\u2019s delay. If, in case of such devise to a <em>feme covert, </em>the executor had sold before the death of the devisee or legatee, her husband would have had a right to the money. The land therefore is considered as money, and will go to him, though <em>unsold; for it ought to </em>have been sold. And so between the personal representative and the heir. But as it respects the devise itself, if'is well understood \u201cthat the produce of an estate directed by the devisor to be sold can never be strictly a part of Ais general personal estate. If he even direct it to be paid to his executors, and <em>applied as part of his personal estate, </em>still the executors take it but as <em>devisees. </em>Every person taking an interest in land directed to be sold, is in truth a. devisee and not a legatee.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Claxton, </em>4 Mad. Ch. Rep. american edi. 256, 260. Hence it is clear that though the legatee takes the gift as money, the estate retains the quality of land in the testator\u2019s hands. And thus we are brought back to the position that the devise is in this case a devise of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">I have already said, intention has nothing to do with this question. Seo Powell on Devises 376. But even if \"it had, it is impossible to say how the testator\u2019s mind may have changed in five years, or what may have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>the influence of the change effected by his wife\u2019s death. she lived, two thirds of the estate would during her life have gone to the heirs general. By her death, o \u2022/ that two thirds would be taken from them, and would ^ave gone to increase the interest of these legatees, if the will had not been changed by the sale. Who can say that this fact, with the possibility of relenting as to his sons, to whom he had given nothing, did not produce the change ? The effect, now, is to put all on an equality.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">It only remains to observe that as <em>the will, being </em>a will of realty, speaks as of the day of its date, it cannot be interpreted to embrace the bonds which did not exist till five years afterwards. Had there been a republication after the sale, they would doubtless have passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">I am of opinion that the decree be reversed, and the bill dismissed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">The other .judges concurred. Decree reversed and bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
