And this held to be proper.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-13\">This was a proceeding in the County court of Ohio county, by the Overseers of the poor of that county against James Lyle, for the purpose of charging him with the support of a bastard child. It appeared from the evidence, that the mother of the bastard child was a married woman. She had been married in March 1843, but her husband left her in the fall of that year, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>and had not returned. Since that time she had lived with her father; and the child was born in October 1847. It appeared that the mother was entitled to an interest worth about 200 dollars in a small tract of land, This proceeding was commenced on the 29th of April 1848. The case came on to be heard before the County court at the September term of that year, when the Court made an order that the defendant Lyle be charged with the annual payment of 25 dollars to the Overseers of the poor of the county for the space of six years from the birth of said child, to wit: for six years from the 18th day of October 1847, if the child shall live so long. Lyle obtained a <em>supersedeas </em>to this judgment, from the Judge of the Circuit court of Ohio <em>county; </em>but when the case came on to be heard in that Court, the judgment of the County court was affirmed : whereupon he applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-8\"><em>Price, </em>for the appellant, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-9\"><em>Jacob, </em>for the appellees, submitted the case.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b45-10\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"ABL\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
