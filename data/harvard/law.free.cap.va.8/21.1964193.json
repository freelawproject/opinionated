whereupon the company in order to encourage the speedy settlement of that frontier, appointed <em>Thomas Walker, esq. </em>one of their number, agent, with power and direction to survey any of the said land in small parcels, and sell the same to settlers, at the rate of three pounds per hundred acres, over and above the expence of surveyors\u2019 fees and rights.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\u201c That these terms being published, through the states of America, were so generally agreeable, that, in that year and the beginning of the following, there was surveyed and sold the several parcels in the schedule annexed ; and the company would have been able to have compleated their whole surveys within the time allowed them, but that, in the said year 1754, a war commenced, in that country, with the neighbouring Indians, which stop\u2019d their further progress, and drove all or the greater part of the settlers from the lands surveyed and sold them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-4\">\u201cThat, on the establishment of peace, the company, on the 25th of May, 1763, petitioned the then governour and council for a renewal and confirmation of their said grant, having been hindered, by the war, from performing the condition thereof, but the <em>board </em>were of opinion that they were restrained, by the king\u2019s instructions, from granting such renewal and confirmation,\u201d so that the denial arose, not for want of equity in its foundation, but- because the British ministry designing to oppress America and slop the settlement of that, \u201c <em>frontier (too remote to be easily </em>subjugated\u201d) had \u201c instructed their governour not to grant any lands on the waters of the Mississippi;

and also of </em>Andrew Lewis, <em>agent for the Green-brier company, praying that the grants made to the officers and soldiers under-his majesty\u2019s proclamation in </em>1763, <em>may not be suffered to be located so as to interfere with their grants: and also, of the petition of sundry inhabitants settled on those grants to the same purpose;

And that every settler shall have fifty acres, at least; and, also, for every three acres of cleared land, fifty acres more, and so in proportion, which is to be taken as part of the grants of the said companies respectively, when the land office shall be open to them, unless such settlers shall chuse to hold under the officers and soldiers, or any of them, rather than under the said companies\u2019\u201d </em>That this order, proved, \u201c that the governour and council considered the grant, to the Loyal company, as then remaining in force; and that a time would come when the land office (then shut up by the royal instructions) would be open to them for confirmation <em>of the whole; </em>and that, in the mean time, they allowed the actual settlers to shelter themselves under the said grants for protecting their settlements, in case they pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>ferred that to a bargain with the officers; which claim, under the company, was obviously to be obtained, of them, upon the terms of paying the price of three pounds per hundred acres, originally fixed thereon, and so it was well understood by all persons concerned.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-4\">That in consequence of the last mentioned order of the governour and council, the agent, for the company, surveyed, in 1774 and 1775, the several parcels of land, and for the persons whose names and their respective quantities were contained in a schedule annexed : \u201c Which surveys the company intended to have returned to the secretary\u2019s office; obtained patents thereupon and conveyed the lands, to the respective persons, upon their paying or securing the consideration money, but the flight of the governour, and subsequent change of government prevented them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">The petition, therefore, prayed for certificates to entitle them to grants for the surveys; that the quantity for each person might be made up 400 acres; that grants for the whole might issue to the agent of the company, to be by him conveyed to each person, upon payment of the purchase money, with the surveyors\u2019 and office fees, and rights (which the company were ready to pay into the treasury); and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-6\">The petition for the <em>Greenbrier company </em>set forth, That by an order of the governour and council (made <em>\u201cpursuant to the form of granting lands in this </em>state) bearing date the 29th day of October, 1751, leave was granted to the said company to take up one hundred thousand acres of land, lying on Greenbrier river north west and west of the Cow-pasture, and Newfoundland, and four years time were allowed them to survey and pay rights for the same, upon return of the plans to the secretary\u2019s office.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-7\">That, in execution of the said order, the agent for the company in, and prior to, the year 1754, surveyed and sold, in small parcels, to sundry persons, several tracts of land as per list annexed : At which last mentioned period an invasion of the Indians, in that country, put an end to all further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>proceedings; and, during that invasion, the proclamation of the king, on the 16th of December, 1773, prohibiting the sett^eraeni\u2019 or grant, of any lands, on the <em>western waters, </em>the further execution of the said order, until the *6th of December, 1773; when the then governour and council considered the grant to the company as still in force, and allowed any settlers, on the Greenbrier lands, to have surveys made under the said order, for the purpose of securing, to themselves, the lands they had settled on : such settlers paying, to the company, the price at which they had sold their other lands formerly surveyed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-4\">That, in consequence of the last mentioned order, the company surveyed lands for sundry <em>actual settlers; </em>but as patents had not issued for the same during the existence of the late government, grants could not now b.e obtained, for them, without the aid of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-5\">The petition therefore prayed, that certificates might be granted pursuant to the act of assembly aforesaid, enabling the petitioners\u2019 agent to procure patents for the lands, and to convey the same to the respective purchasers and settlers according to his contracts; and for further relief,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-6\"><em>John Taylor, </em>for the petitioners,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AX9\">argued, that the claims were clearly not lost, as sufficient excuses were offered for all the delays, if such they could be called, which had taken place. That the act of God, public enemies, and restraints of government, were always considered as a justification. All which had occurred; for the hand of time had swept away most of the members of the companies, and those w,ho remained were incapacitated by age and infirmities to pursue their rights with the promptitude of younger years. But the war with the Indians, in the first place, was decisive, for negligence is never imputed <em>flagrante hello; </em>which ever excuses delay: And, after that period, the arbitrary acts of government, which could not be resisted, put a stop to any effectual proceedings on the part of the claimants; who, nevertheless, did all they could towards performance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>by conditional arrangements with purchasers and settlers. That the company had, to obviate all difficulties, solicited further time in 1763; and were denied it, not because the governour and council believed it to be wrong, (for they thought it right,) but because the British ministry, in order to weaken the colony, had resolved to stop the settlement of the frontier; and, to that end, had not only instructed the governour not to grant any lands on the waters of the Mississippi ; but had issued a royal proclamation prohibiting all persons from settling there, and even requiring those already settled under patents to remove to the interior : thus imagining, vainly indeed, to stifle all efforts to strengthen the country, but still sufficient to prevent the operations of the companies; who ought not to be prejudiced by the tyranny of their rulers, whose authority they could not resist. That thoughts of this kind had, evidently, their effect in the year 1773, when the governour and council restrained the officers and soldiers from locating their warrants so as not to interfere with legal surveys, or actual settlements; and declaring actual settlers, to be such as resided on any tract of land before the next preceding October; to each of whom fifty acres for settlement, and fifty for every <em>three </em>acres cleared, (to be taken as part of the grants to the companies respectively,) were to be allotted, <em>when the land office should be open to </em>them,; Which manifestly proves that the governour and council of that period considered the right as still existent, and capable of being rendered effectual at a future day. That with this gleam of hope, the companies proceeded; had further surveys made; and were prepared to carry them into grant, when the flight of the governour arrested their progress, and the subsequent events of the revolution prevented all future exertion. That this was sufficient to entitle the claimants to relief, even upon legal grounds; but much more so in equity, as it was a case which lay in compensation; for the country would be settled and all public dues discharged in the same manner as if no delay had taken place; and that was all that ever was contemplated by government, or could be justly demanded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>That the foregoing view of things brought the case expressly within the meaning of the act of assembly, and entitled the claimants to the lands they solicit: which would . be evident from a very slight review of certain parts of the statute. For the 1st section, although applied to specified cases only, clearly shews, that the legislature thought all surveys under orders of council should be carried into grant. And the 4th section provides, that mere settlers should be protected. The 5th gives the same benefits to villagers; and the right of preemption to all settlers. Which proves that the <em>paternal </em>hand of government was, to be extended to all who had been oppressed by difficulties, over which they had no co'ntroul; and that if the general policy of settling the country was maintained, and the public dues satisfied, the lands should, in all instances, be secured to the fair claimants; for this, in the spirit of the rule upon mortgages, was all that the state could justly demand.. But if any doubt could remain, it was completely dissipated by the 7th section; which, in terms, includes the case; for it recites the agreements between purchasers and companies; and declares that the former should have their titles confirmed, <em>by the companies, </em>upon payment of the original price with interest: which necessarily settles the question, and proves that the orders in council are still in force; and that the companies have a right to the lands upon substantial fulfilment of the conditions contained in them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-7\"><em>Randolph, </em>attorney general,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ap\">contended that the claims could not be sustained. That the grants were, originally, upon conditions which had not been complied with, and therefore, that the whole of them were void. That the conditions contained no exceptions; and the excuses offered, if any were admissible, which he doubted, were not sufficient. That there had been time enough, between the dates of the orders of council and the alleged interruptions from the Indian war, to have carried them into effect; and no cause, at all, was shewn, why it was not done; and, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>claimants had delayed the performance of the acts necessary to the fulfilment of the conditions, they must abide the consequences ; for <em>vigil antibus, non dormientibus, leges subveniunt. </em>'That the case bore no resemblance to a mortgage; for there the money and interest was all that the lender expected ; and if he got that he obtained exact justice, and consequently had no right to complain ; but here, the original object, whatever might have been the after thoughts of government, was a speedy settlement of the country; and if that was not attended to, the motive for the grant failed, and government was so far injured. That the impediments subsequent to the Indian war, were to a great degree imaginary : but, be that as it may, the right depended upon performance of the condition ; and if that was not effected, the right ceased altogether. That the case was not within any of the provisions of the act of assembly; for they all suppose due diligence, and necessary impediments from circumstances which could not be controuled; and, out of indulgence for the impossibility of performance, relief was extended to them by the legislature. But here was no such impossibility; and if the delay was not voluntary, and for the convenience of the claimants themselves, it was quite unnecessary; and therefore not. to be countenanced. That the 7th section was in unison with the rest of the act, and spolce of such companies, and such companies only, as had so fulfilled the conditions of the orders of council, that forms merely were wanting to complete the title: in which case, as circumstances, over which they had no controul, prevented full compliance, it was right that they should have an opportunity of perfecting their titles: of which class was the case of <em>Preston </em>and <em>Patton, </em>in this court: For, although that was not a company claim, it shewed the principle which should govern in every case, namely, that the applicant must have done all that it was in his power to do. But that was not the situation of the companies before the court; who had been guilty of the grossest negligence, and could not complain, if they were subjected to the consequences of it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Taylor, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiS\">There is a difference, between a con-</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIp\">dition upon which a right is to accrue; and a condition to defeat a right. The first requires strict performance, or. the right never commences: But the latter, in the eye of a court of equity, only requires substantial performance; and, if compensation can be made, it is all that is requisite. In the present case, that compensation has been already in great part accomplished; and the whole that remains undone, can now be perfected, without the slightest loss to the state ; and therefore it is completely within the rule of equity; which is sufficient to entitle them to a grant of their lands.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b61-15\"> There were two modes of taking up waste and unappropriated lands at that time. One was by obtaining an order of council simply; the form of which, in the year 1721, was sometimes as follows, to wit, \u201c On the petition of-, leave is granted him to take, up-acres of land lying in the county of-.\u201d But this form seems to have afterwards changed to the following, \u201c On the petition of --, leave is granted him to take up-acres of vacant land lying in the county of-; and four years allowed to survey, and pay rights, on return of the plan to the secretary\u2019s office.\u201d A copy of this order was carried to the auditor\u2019s office, who made an entry of it, and certified it on the copy of the order, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>was then lodged with the surveyor; but was seldom, if ever, referred to, by him, in the survey. The other mode was for military services; and in order to obtain the stipulated quantities, a <em>warrant </em>was procured from the governour, by each officer or soldier, directing the surveyor <em>to </em>survey the land for him. This however was often impracticable to the claimant, from distance, poverty and other causes; which, it is said, was the source of great popularity to general <em>Washington; </em>who, after the indian war, obtained the warrants for all the officers and soldiers of his regiment; and had the surveys made, and transmitted the plans to them, so as to prevent their falling into the hands of speculators, and obtaining little, or nothing, for their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">I have understood, that an <em>entry </em>in the council books, describing the land intended to be taken up, would, if an order of the <em>hoard, </em>afterwards followed it, be sufficient to entitle the petitioner to priority of grant: which seems to be sanctioned, by the first section of the act of 1779, <em>Ch. Rev. </em>90, declaring such <em>entries </em>to be valid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The judgment of the court was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\u201c The several claims of <em>Thomas Walker, </em>esquire, on behalf of himself and the other members of the Loyal company; and <em>Thomas Nelson, </em>esquire, on behalf of the Greenbrier company, to grants of all the lands surveyed under several orders of council, bearing date the 12th of July, 1749, the 29th of October, 1751, the 14th of June, 1753, and the 16th of December, 1773, came on to be heard yesterday and this day; and thereupon, the arguments of the counsel for the claimants, and of the <em>attorney general </em>for the commonwealth, having been fully heard and considered : It is the opinion of the court, and accordingly decreed and ordered, that all surveys made by a county surveyor, or his deputy, properly qualified according to law, previous to the year 1776, and certified to have been made by virtue of the orders of council to the Loyal and Greenbrier companies, or either of them, ought to be confirmed; and that the register be directed to issue patents upon all such surveys as shall be returned, and so certified.\"<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b72-9\"> This, I presume, <em>means, </em>that a certificate, whenever given, either before or subsequent to the date of this judgment, provided the survey was \u25a0actually made under an order of council, should be deemed sufficient; for, upon inspecting a variety of surveys in the general court, and other places, before the revolution, I do not discover, that the order of council was, <em>in </em>general cases, referred to in the survey.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
