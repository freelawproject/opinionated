Hollingsworth </em>in the county court of <em>Frederick. The </em>declaration contained three counts, all of which were in debt. The first was in these words: \u201c For this, that whereas on the-day of-- 1825, at the county aforesaid, a certain <em>David H. Allen, </em>by his note in writing signed with the proper name of him the said <em>David H. Allen </em>by his own hand, did order the said <em>Joseph P. Hollingsworth </em>to pay to the said <em>Eben Milton </em>or order the said sum of 172 dollars 50 cents, with interest from the 25th of February last, that being the balance due from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>you (meaning the said <em>Hollingsworth) </em>to me (meaning the said <em>Allen) </em>for wheat; and whereas afterwards, to wit, on the 30th day of May .1.825, at the county aforesaid, the said order was presented to the said <em>Joseph F. Hollingsworth, </em>who, by indorsement thereon, signed with the proper name of him the said <em>Hollingsworth </em>by his own hand, accepted the same, which said order and indorsement thereon is now here shewn to the court; by virtue of which said premises a right accrued to the said plaintiff to have and demand tire said sum of money of the said defendant, &amp;c.\u201d The second count was for money had and received; and the third on an account stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-4\">The defendant pleaded <em>nil debet, </em>on which issue was joined; and he also demurred generally. The demurrer, upon argument, was overruled. And then a verdict was found and judgment rendered for the plaintiff. Upon a <em>supersedeas </em>from the superiour court of law, the judgment was affirmed; and an appeal was allowed to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-6\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-7\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b71-8\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A0I\">In this case the only question presented arises upon the general demurrer to the declaration, and if any one of the counts is good, that demurrer must be overruled. Now upon examining the forms in <em>Chittfs </em>very valuable book of precedents, vol. 2. pp. 385. 387.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it is obvious that the second count (for money had and received) and the third count (upon an account stated) are taken <em>verbatim et literatim </em>from those forms. The counts are not in <em>assumpsit, </em>as counsel seem to have supposed. Such counts in <em>assumpsit </em>would have been bad, since no <em>promise </em>is laid. The alleged indebtedness supplies its place. 1 think therefore that even though the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>first count be bad, on the ground that debt does not lie against the acceptor of an order (for this is no bill of exchange) yet the demurrer was properly overruled and judgment entered on the verdict. I will add, however, j fiave no doubt that under the 4-th section of the act, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 125. p. 484. an action of debt lies against the acceptor of an order. For the action is given upon any <em>\u201c </em>note or <em>writing </em>by which the person signing the same <em>shall promise or oblige himself </em>to pay a sum of money or quantity of tobacco.\u201d Now the acceptor of an order does by his acceptance <em>oblige </em>himself to pay the amount of the draft to the payee. And from this obligation nothing can release him. It is absolute and unconditional. It does not depend upon the treatment of the paper afterwards by the payee or his indorsees. Do what they will, the acceptor is bound. His case is altogether unlike that of the indorser, whose indorsement has been very properly decided not to be a note in writing within our statutes, <em>Hatcher </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>4 Rand. 152. for his undertaking is collateral, and so far from being absolute, it binds him only in the event that the bill shall appear to have been properly dealt with, and due notice shall have been given to him of nonpayment and protest. But the acceptor is absolutely bound, and therefore is within the letter, as he certainly is within the spirit of the statute. In the cases of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Segar, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 394. and <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Crowdhill, </em>2 Munf. 302. (which however were acceptances on bills of exchange) the influence of this'statute does not seem to have been considered. In the recent case of <em>Peasley </em>v. <em>Boatwright, </em>2 Leigh 195. the original statute, 4 Hen. Stat. at large pp. 273-5. from which the present act is substantially copied, came under examination; and it was decided by all the judges that debt would lie, under the act, on a promissory note not expressed to be for value received, and without laying any consideration, though it was admitted the defendant might go into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>consideration. This case decides nothing indeed as to , ... , ... the action lying against the acceptor; but it clearly establishes that if the.acceptance in writing is an obliga- \u25a0 tion to pay within the statute (which I think it is) there is no necessity for setting out any other consideration except the fact of acceptance, which very strongly imports it.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">'With these views, I am clearly for affirming the judgment; a result not the less gratifying, as it does justice between the parties, and at the same time tends to unfetter judicial proceedings from unnecessary and vexatious technicalities. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Brockexbrough, Cabell and Brooke, /.concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AJ3\"> American edition of 1837.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
