The process does not seem to have been served upon Hunt, and an attachment to enforce an appearance was issued and levied on slaves. A judgment was confirmed against Hunt in the office ; and at the October term of the Court his death was suggested. At the May term 1846 the suit was revived against Coleman as administrator with the will annexed of Eustace Hunt, upon a <em>scire facias </em>said to be issued on the 11th of March, but it is not in the record, and the clerk of the Circuit court certified that it was not among the papers in the cause in his office. At the May term of the Court, Coleman appeared and pleaded the general issue, and offered three special pleas, which were objected to by the plaintiff, and rejected by the Court. To the rejection of which the defendant excepted. The third plea avers that after the suit was brought, and between the death of Hunt and the issue of process to revive the suit against the defendant, he had delivered all the slaves but one to the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff had accepted them. The first and second pleas as to the slaves claimed in the declaration, aver that after the suit was brought and between the death of Hunt and the issue of the process to revive the suit against the defendant, he had delivered all the slaves but one to the plaintiff who had accepted them ; and as to that one the defendant did not detain him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-5\">At the May term of the Court the cause was tried, when the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for all except one slave, and his damages were assessed at 2000 dollars. Whereupon the defendant moved the Court for a new trial, but the plaintiff releasing 500 dol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>lars of the damages, the Court overruled the motion, and gave a personal judgment against the defendant for the slaves and 1500 dollars damages. But the plaintiff afterwards released on the record the slaves and their alt6matlVe VallIeS'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEs2\">The defendant applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b604-6\">Grattan, for the apppellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b604-7\"><em>Griswold, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b604-8\">Daniel, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ahr\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The third special plea tendered by the plaintiff in error, whilst it professes in its commencement to be a plea to the whole action, answers only as to the slaves in the declaration mentioned, and is wholly silent as to the damages for detention, and as to the costs of the action against Hunt. On the death of Hunt the defendant in error had a right to demand of his administrator not only the slaves but also the damages for their detention and the costs incurred in prosecuting the original action against Hunt in his lifetime. <em>A </em>plea therefore averring the delivery of the slaves to the defendant in error, and the acceptance of them by him, was no answer to so much of the <em>scire facias </em>as claimed the damages and costs aforesaid. The Court is of opinion that the said plea was therefore defective, and that the Circuit court did not err in refusing to receive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">The first and second special pleas do not profess in terms to answer the whole action, and might perhaps have been properly received by the Court as pleas to so much of the <em>scire facias </em>as demanded the slaves therein mentioned. The error (if any) however in refusing to receive said pleas was cured by the release of his recovery as to the slaves and their values, subsequently made by the defendant in error; and there is now no injury arising from the refusal of the Court to receive said pleas, of which the plaintiff in error can complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>The objection taken here in argument for the first time by the counsel of the plaintiff in error, that there is no <em>scire facias </em>nor declaration alleging that the slaves in controversy have since the death of Hunt, come into the possession of his administrator cannot avail him. From an inspection of the certificate of the clerk of the Circuit court which has been read by the agreement and consent of the counsel, it appears that the <em>scire facias </em>which issued on the 11th March 1846, is no longer on file in his office. In the absence of the said <em>scire facias, </em>the record being silent as to any objection having been taken to it in the Circuit court, it must be presumed by this Court that the said <em>scire facias </em>was in all respects regular, and that it suggested, as it ought to have done, the coming of the slaves into the possession of the administrator since the death of the testator, in which case there was no need of any such allegation by a formal declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The Court is however of opinion that the Circuit court erred in rendering a personal judgment against the plaintiff in error for the damages for the detention of the slaves and the costs, instead of rendering a judgment for said damages and costs against the plaintiff in error as administrator, to be levied of the goods &amp;c. of the testator in his hands to be administered. The said judgment is therefore reversed with costs &amp;c., and this Court proceeding to render such judgment as ought to have been rendered ; and it appearing that the defendant in error has released to the plaintiff in error the slaves together with their respective values, it is adjudged &amp;c. that the said defendant in error recover against the said plaintiff in error 1500 dollars, the damages aforesaid, and the costs in the Court below, to be levied of the goods &amp;c. of the testator in his hands to be administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>J</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
