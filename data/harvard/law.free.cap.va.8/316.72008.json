C. Woodford's </em>estate were unpaid; that the only available claims against that estate were two debts, of small amount, due to <em>Aylett Hawes </em>and <em>Gray Boulware </em>respectively ; and that these debts the plaintiff was willing to discharge. Wherefore the bill prayed that <em>Buckner, L. Goodwin's </em>administratrix, <em>Anderson, Hawes, Boulware, </em>and all other creditors of <em>W. C. Woodjord\u2019s </em>estate who had just debts which were made kuowu to the executor before the division of the property, and all creditors wilh debts binding the heirs or devisees, might be made defendants; that a decree might be made directing a release of the deed executed to <em>Buckner, </em>upon complainant\u2019s satisfying the debts due to <em>Hawes </em>and <em>Boulware, </em>and all others that should be exhibited before a commissioner of the court within a reasonable time after publication for that purpose; that <em>Anderson, </em>on such release being executed, might be decreed to pay complainant \u201c the balance of his purchase money aforesaid, amounting to -\u201d; and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-8\"><em>Anderson, </em>in his answer, said that he was ready and willing to pay the money mentioned in the bill, when the title to the land should be secured against the claim under the deed of trust, but not before; and that <em>he was willing the cause should be heard as to him by consent.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A47\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>The execution of the bond for 2200 dollars by <em>Anderson </em>was 'proved by a witness, <em>Thomas G.

C. Wood-ford\u2019s </em>estate, which might be a lien on the land in the bill mentioned, the commissioner reported that <em>the </em>only debts of that character which had been brought forward after due publication of notice to creditors, were a debt due to <em>Aylett Hawes, </em>of 123 dollars 63 cents, with interest on 54 dollars 67 cents part thereof from 1st February 1827, and a debt due to <em>Gray Boulware, </em>of 13 dollars 27 cents, with interest thereon from the same period.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-6\">The suit was pending until the 15th of October 1830; the delay being chiefly owing to the difficulty of ascertaining what claims existed, of the character described in the order of reference. Meanwhile <em>Buckner </em>the trustee died, and the suit was revived against his heirs at law.. On the 15th October 1830, the court, with the assent of the defendant <em>Elizabeth Goodwin, </em>decreed that the heirs of <em>Buckner </em>release to <em>Anderson, </em>by proper deed, all their right, title and interest in the land conveyed to said <em>Buckner </em>by the deed of trust; and, <em>with the consent of the parties, </em>decreed further that <em>Anderson </em>pay to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>codefendants <em>Hawes </em>and <em>Boulware, </em>out of the amount due the plaintiff on the bond executed for the balance of the <em>White Hall </em>purchase money, the debts and interest reported by the commissioner to be due them respectively, and to the plaintiff the sum of 1972 dollars <em>2 </em>cents, <em>\u201c with interest thereon from the said 1st day of February </em>1S27 <em>until paid, </em>that being the balance due on that day to the plaintiff upon the said bond, after crediting the said <em>Anderson </em>with 140 dollars indorsed on said bond, and the sums decreed to be paid by him to the defendants <em>Hawes </em>and <em>Boulwarc.\"</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-4\">In October 1831, <em>Anderson </em>instituted a suit in chancery in the circuit superiour court of <em>Spotsylvania </em>county, against <em>J. B. Woodford, John Dickinson </em>and <em>Robert Hord. </em>The bill set forth the plaintiff\u2019s purchase of the <em>While Hall </em>tract of land from <em>Woodford, </em>and the terms of that purchase as shewn by the bond and agreement of the 10th September 1825; stating also the proceedings and decree in <em>Woodford's </em>suit against the complainant and others, as above detailed, and exhibiting the record of that suit. And then the bill alleged, that <em>Dickinson </em>had been retained as counsel to prosecute the said suit; and complainant, having entire Confidence in him, and believing that nothing more was required by <em>Woodford's </em>bill than payment of the <em>principal </em>sum of <em>2200 </em>dollars, and not even that until the lien upon the land, created by the trust deed to <em>Buckner, </em>should be removed, felt no hesitation in signing the answer to the bill, which had been prepared for him by <em>Dickinson, </em>to whom he confided the management of the suit so far as he was concerned, and who had himself assisted in drawing the agreement of the 10th September 1825. That complainant therefore took no agency whatsoever in the suit, until some time in 1S30, when he requested another attorney, <em>John L. Marye </em>esq. to examine the papers in reference to the title of the land, and if necessary, to appear for him. That on the 13th September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>1826, complainant sold <em>Woodford </em>a horse at the price of 140 dollars, for which he took <em>Woodford\u2019s </em>bond payable 0n demand, and apprised <em>Dickinson </em>thereof, in order that it might be credited against the 2200 dollars due to Woodford, whenever he should become entitled, according to the terms of the agreement respecting the land, to receive the balance .of the purchase money. That on the 24th of October 1829, <em>Atwell C. Coleman </em>assigned to <em>Dickinson </em>his interest in 1865 dollars of the said purchase money, which <em>Woodford </em>had before assigned to <em>Coleman; </em>so that the suit was in effect, after the 24th of October 1829, prosecuted for <em>Dickinson\u2019s </em>own benefit. That <em>Woodford </em>had subsequently assigned to <em>Robert Word </em>the balance of the claim against complainant on account of the said purchase money. That notwithstanding the decree against complainant appears to have been rendered <em>by consent, </em>yet tire attorney employed by complainant had informed him, that being requested to examine merely the state of the title to the land, he never had his attention directed to any other question, and on being satisfied that a good title could be made, left it entirely to <em>Dickinson </em>to draw the decree; and when the rough draught was presented to him for signature, he signed the same without ever reading it, not dreaming that the complainant was concerned in any question other than that relating to the title. That complainant never threw any difficulty in. the way of a speedy termination of the suit, but was desirous to pay the balance of the purchase money he owed, and so stated to his counsel when he employed him. That when complainant learned, to his great surprise, that a decree for the payment of <em>interest </em>on the said balance had been rendered against him, he announced to <em>Dickinson </em>his determination not to abide by the <em>decree </em>in that <em>respect; </em>whereupon <em>Dickinson </em>agreed, that if complainant would' go on to make a payment of 1465 dollars to <em>Coleman </em>on behalf of <em>Dickinson, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>question of interest should be submitted to the chancellor at the succeeding term for correction. That complainant, resting on this assurance, proceeded to make several payments in satisfaction of that part of the decree which stands in <em>Woodford's </em>name, amounting in the aggregate to 1870 dollars 36 cents ; having, in addition, paid to <em>Hawes </em>and <em>Boulware </em>the amounts decreed to them respectively. Notwithstanding which, an execution on the decree bad been recently sued out against the complainant, and placed in the hands of the sheriff; and that too, when the conveyance of the legal title to the land, decreed to be made by <em>Buckner's </em>heirs, had never been executed. Wherefore, inasmuch as the said decree was unjust, both in allowing interest on the 2200 dollars, and omitting to allow it on the credit for 140 dollars, and was obtained against complainant wholly by surprise, the bill prayed that <em>Woodford, Dickinson </em>and <em>Hard </em>might be injoincd from proceeding under it to coerce any further payment, until the legal title should be conveyed to complainant by <em>Buckner's </em>heirs; and that he might then be subjected only to the payment of what should prove to be justly due on the said bond for 2200 dollars, after deducting <em>Woodford's </em>bond for 140 dollars, <em>with interest, from the date thereof, </em>and the several sums paid since the rendition of the decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-4\">With his bill, the complainant exhibited a letter written by <em>Dickinson, </em>on the 20th November 1830, to <em>J. L. Ma/rye, </em>in the following terms: \u201c D\u2019r sir, 1 saw mr. <em>Thomas Anderson </em>to-day, and he says he conceives, according to the contract with <em>J. B. Woodford, </em>he is not to pay interest on the bond on which I got the decree last term. I have agreed, if he will settle 1465 dollars for me with <em>Atwell Coleman, </em>to let the case rest till next term, and submit the agreement to the chancellor. And that his payment to <em>Coleman </em>on my order may not prejudice his claim to corrections, I told him I would write to you on the subject, and he promised to pay <em>Coleman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>if you should decide that it would not prejudice his claim. I draw the order in favour of <em>Coleman </em>guarded as to that subject, and I hope you will say that he can run no risk. <em>Atwell Coleman\u2019s </em>assignment to me on my giving him my bond, I have sent to the clerk to file with the papers. It will greatly oblige me to have <em>Coleman </em>paid the,1465 dollars, as he is pressing me for it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-4\">The injunction prayeddn the bill was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-5\"><em>Dickinson </em>answered, that he had no recollection of having ever seen the agreement mentioned in the bill, and that complainant for the first time stated to him the existence of an agreement by which he was exempted from paying interest, when the notice was given for taking the deposition of <em>Thomas G. Thornton; </em>on which occasion, and repeatedly afterwards during the pendency of the suit, respondent urged him to produce and file the agreement, as the duty of respondent to <em>Wood-ford, </em>his client, forbade the allowance of the claim to such exemption, unless it had been clearly stipulated <em>: </em>but the complainant could never be persuaded to produce the paper. Respondent utterly denied that complainant had the slightest ground to rely on him for protection against the payment of interest, though he did undertake to guard him against liens on the land. He admitted that, having become <em>Woodford\u2019s </em>surety for the debt he owed <em>Coleman, </em>and' <em>Woodford </em>being insolvent, he had executed his individual bond to <em>Coleman </em>for the debt, and taken <em>Coleman\u2019s </em>assignment to himself of the interest which <em>Woodford </em>had previously assigned to <em>Coleman </em>in the purchase money due from <em>Anderson. </em>He admitted that after.the decree was rendered, <em>Anderson </em>did complain of it for allowing interest, and proposed to leave the matter to reference, which, without reflection, respondent <em>partially assented to; </em>but reflecting that others were interested, he informed <em>Anderson </em>that he must decline it: afterwards, however, he wrote that if</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>Anderson </em>would go on to pay <em>Coleman </em>the amount of the order which respondent had drawn in his favour, and take in respondent\u2019s bond, he would have no objection to submit the question of his pretensions to the chancellor. He admitted the payments which <em>Anderson </em>alleged he had made on account of the decree. And he stated that the execution against <em>Anderson </em>was sued out upon the requisition of <em>Robert Hord, </em>who was <em>Woodford\u2019s </em>assignee of so much of the purchase money as had not been assigned to <em>Coleman.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-4\"><em>Woodford </em>and <em>Hord </em>answered severally; the former stating that he had no recollection of the particular terms of the agreement with <em>Anderson, </em>as respected the payment of interest, and the latter disclaiming all knowledge on the subject of <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>claim to exemption; and both of them referring to <em>Dickinson\u2019s </em>answer, and insisting on the decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-5\">It was proved by the deposition of a witness examined in the cause, that the indorsement, under date of 10tb September 1825, upon the agreement between <em>Woodford </em>and <em>Anderson, </em>was wholly in the handwriting of the defendant <em>Dickinson. </em>And it was further proved that the said agreement had remained, from the time of its execution until after the rendition of the decree, in the custody of <em>Thomas G. Thornton, </em>the same individual who was examined as a witness for <em>Woodford, </em>to prove the execution of the bond for 2200 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-6\"><em>JohnL. Marge </em>was also examined as a witness. His deposition sustained all the statements of the bill, in reference to his employment and agency as <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>counsel. He said, that <em>Dickinson </em>having informed hitn, that the decree which he had prepared was in conformity with deponent\u2019s views in regard to the removal of the lien created by the deed to <em>Buckner, </em>deponent thereupon signed the decree without ever reading it; not dreaming, at the time, that <em>Anderson </em>had any interest in the matter other than in regard to the title, which de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>ponent had, as he conceived, sufficiently guarded. Deponent further stated, that, understanding <em>Dickinson's </em>letter as amounting to an agreement on his part to submit the question of the liability of <em>Anderson </em>for interest to the chancellor, he advised <em>Anderson </em>to make the payment desired by <em>Dickinson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-7\">The cause was heard on the 6th of J uly 1S33: whereupon the chancellor, being of opinion that it would be dangerous to violate the rule established in chancery, by no means to set aside a decree obtained by consent of counsel <em>on </em>both sides, where there is no collusion or' fraud in the ease, \u2014 decreed that the bill be dismissed, but without costs. From this decree <em>Anderson </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-8\"><em>Leigh, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-9\"><em>Johnson, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b346-10\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Afb\">The agreement filed in this case admits'of no doubt as to the exemption of <em>Anderson from </em>interest until the incumbrances were all removed; and the decree having given interest from a date long anteriour, the appellant has been injured, and his adversaries have recovered some hundreds of dollars to which they have no title. The case then, upon the merits of his demand, seems clear. The questions presented are, whether he has title to any redress, and whether the remedy pursued by him is the proper one.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">I do not think there has been any gross negligence in this case, on the part of <em>Anderson. </em>The suit was not, in its origin, a controversy between him and <em>Woodford. </em>It was bi\u2019ought to perfect the title and extinguish the incumbrances ; and so far was it from being considered a matter of contest between them, that the same counsel drew both bill and answer; and the answer was merely formal. Indeed the bill had set forth the demand against <em>Anderson </em>in blank; thus leaving him fairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>to infer that the decree would he taken according to the contract. That he was afterwards warned by <em>Dickinson </em>and repeatedly urged to produce the agreement, is alleged indeed in the answer of <em>Dickinson, </em>hut not proved in the cause; so that, for aught that appears, he still acted under the impression that the suit was rather the joint concern of himself and <em>Woodford, </em>than a suit between them. It is remarkable, too, that his application to counsel was to <em>assist </em>mr. <em>Dickinson </em>in the prosecution, instead of <em>contesting </em>any matter <em>with </em>him : and it is not less remarkable that the sagacious and vigilant counsel thus employed should obviously have had the same impression throughout, \u201c never dreaming that <em>Anderson </em>had any interest in the matter other than in regard to the title.\u201d He accordingly had the decree entered by consent, and seems to have taken it for granted that it was for the proper amount. To me this appears to have been a complete surprise; and a surprise, too, produced by the plaintiff\u2019s setting forth his claim in blank, \u2014 pretending to no title to interest, and failing to produce the documentary evidence of his demand, which it was in his power to produce, for it was in the hands of the very witness whose deposition he took to prove the bond, which bond refers to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Independent of every other consideration, then, it would seem that <em>Anderson </em>was entitled to relief. But the case does not rest here. After the decree is rendered, and before it is carried into execution, <em>Anderson </em>demands its correction, and <em>Dickinson </em>engages to submit the matter to the chancellor, if certain payments were made; which stipulation was substantially compli\u00e9d with by <em>Anderson. </em>But <em>Dickinson </em>did not submit the matter; aud this bill was the consequence. <em>\u2019Shat Dickinson, </em>if he had owned the whole of the debt, would have been bound by this engagement, cannot be questioned. The iniquity of pocketing a considerable sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>which did not belong to him would have laid the ground of a moral obligation sufficient to sustain the promise. But in truth he owned only a part of the debt, and the deduction was destined to fall on those entitled under <em>Woodford </em>to the residuum. Yet he was their counsel; his power over the cause yet continued, and he had a right to bind them by an engagement to submit the matter to the court, whereby a suit would be avoided for the correctiorrof the error. That the consent to the decree given by counsel was under tfie influence of mistake, seems obvious; and it was therefore susceptible of correction, either by bill of review or in some other mode. <em>Dickinson </em>had a sufficient motive, then, for consenting to submit the matter to the judge, upon receiving a very large payment, instead of leaving the defendant <em>Anderson </em>to file a bill of review, or a bill impeaching the decree, and in the mean time to retain the whole money in his hands. This view of the case satisfies me, not only that the plaintiff is entitled to relief, but to relief by way of original bill. I will add, however, that I see no reason to doubt that an original bill will lie to set aside a decree obtained by surprise, an well as one obtained by fraud. There is no doubt that equity relieves equally against surprise or fraud in judgments at law; and there is no assignable reason why it should not relieve, against surprise in equity. The only question is, whether it should be by bill of review or original bill. It cannot be by bill of review for <em>matter in law, </em>for that is inappropriate to the nature of the case. Nor can it in all cases be by bill of review for new matter discovered since the decree; for (as in this case) there may be surprise, and yet it may not arise out of new matter upon which to ground a bill of review. An original bill impeaching the decree on the ground that it has been obtained by surprise or mistake, is then the. proper remedy. It is the remedy recognized in the case of <em>Erwin </em>v. <em>Vint, </em>6 Munf. 267. where a decree by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>default was obtained under circumstances of surprise and the like principle is conceded in the case of <em>Callaway </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>&amp;c.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> decided a few days since. Admitting, as it seems to me it must clearly be admitted, that the consent decree has been entered under a mistake (and that mistake an innocent one) and that the counsel for the party agreed that the matter should be submitted again to the court for its decision, I think it must be conceded that this bill was the proper remedy, instead of a bill of review, which would bring again before the court the numerous parties to the former litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">I am of opinion to reverse the decree, and send the cause back, for the purpose of adjusting the balance really due, and for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Cabell and Brockenbbotigh, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Decree reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-10\"> Reported <em>ante, </em>p. 114.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
