After the declaraof independence, he refused to take the oath of fidelity to the commonwe\u00e1ltb, and professing himself to be a British subject, returned to England $. having previously empowered <em>Roger Atkinson </em>and <em>Richard Taylor </em>to sell his houses and lot, if a thousand pounds sterling, in good bills of exchange, could be obtained for them. In 1778, <em>Atkinson </em>and <em>Taylor, without any deed, </em>sold the lot and houses, to <em>John King, </em>a citizen of Virginia, for a thousand pounds sterling, payable on demand: And, on the 8th of September, 1779, an inquisition of escheat was taken of the said lot and houses, which found <em>Hanson </em>to be a British subject; but that <em>King </em>had purchased the premises as aforesaid. The inquisition was sent to the general court office; where <em>King </em>filed a <em>monstrans de droit, </em>and traverse thereto, but the same were never decided on by that court. <em>King </em>frequently offered payment of the purchase money to <em>Atkinson </em>and <em>Taylor; </em>who declining to accept it, he deposited the same in the loan office, as a debt due, from him, to a British subject. On the 17th of December, 1779, <em>King </em>obtained an injunction from a judge of the high court of chancery, against <em>Kennon Jones </em>the escheator, <em>Edmund Randolph </em>the attorney general, <em>Hanson, Taylor </em>and <em>Atkinson, </em>to prevent a sale of the property under the escheat, and for a conveyance of the lot and houses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-4\">The bill set forth, That <em>Hanson, </em>on the 31st of July, 1776, being about to leave this country, appointed <em>Atkinson </em>and <em>Taylor </em>his attornies in fact, with authority to sell the said lot and houses.

That <em>Atkinson </em>and <em>Taylor </em>having frequently declined to receive the purchase money in paper currency, he deposited it in the treasury. But notwithstanding all this, <em>Kennon Jones, </em>the esch\u00e9ator, had taken an inquisition of escheat, stating that the said lot and houses belonged to a British subject; which he had returned into the office of the general court, although he and the jury knew, that the plaintiff had purchased the property. That the <em>attorney general </em>threatened to have the lot and houses sold, notwithstanding the act of assembly protecting the interests of citizens in estates found, by inquisitions of escheat, to be British property.

Because the sale was not agreeable to the power, which directed that it should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>made for bills of exchange, with security. 2. Because it was not under seal as the act of assembly required; and the clause relative to equitable interests would not help the case, for that related to anterior interests, before the date of independence. 3. That the payment into the treasury dispensed with a sale under the inquisition, and compleated the escheat before the end of the war.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-4\">On the other hand, it was said-on behalf of the representatives of King, that the sale was good, as <em>Hanson </em>had approved of it; and that the tender of the money to his attornies; and, upon their refusal to accept it, the deposit of the amount in the treasury, was a complete discharge of the debt, and entitled <em>King\u2019s </em>estate to a conveyance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-5\">For <em>Hanson </em>it was argued, that the tender, and subsequent deposit of the money in the treasury was no discharge ; and that the representatives of <em>King </em>should now be decreed to pay the purchase money, interest and costs, or restore the property to him, with the rents and profits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AXV\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The court, after time taken to consider, made the following decree in the cause :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">\u201c This day came the parties by their counsel, and the court having maturely considered the transcript of the record, and the arguments of counsel on both sides, are of opinion, that the said decree is erroneous in this, that, in the event of the sale of the lot with the appurtenances, by the commissioners, the said <em>Richard Hanson </em>is not directed to convey the estate to the purchaser in fee simple; and also, in this, that the said <em>Hanson </em>is allowed all his costs in both suits, whereas he ought to pay all costs upon the injunction bill, as well as the costs, in the general court, of the proceedings in the inquisition of escheat, the same being necessary to protect his interest. Therefore, it is decreed and ordered, that the said decree be reversed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>annulled, and that the said <em>Richard Hanson </em>pay to the appellants their costs by them expended in the prosecution of their appeal aforesaid here.
