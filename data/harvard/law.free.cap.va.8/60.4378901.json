Watson, administrator of Robert Tinsley, and his sureties in his official bond, among whom were Bernard Owen and the appellants James S. Allen and Robert Ervine. The bill charged that the complainant had, in 1829, recovered a judgment against Robert Tinsley, in his lifetime, for 1055 dollars 96 cents, with interest from the 28th of January 1823, until paid. That Tinsley died in 1839. That a <em>scire facias </em>to revive the judgment against Watson the administrator, was issued in April 1839, and served upon him. That the administrator had been guilty of a <em>devastavit </em>in paying away the assets of his intestate\u2019s estate. That Tinsley had in his lifetime executed a bond to the firm of Watson &amp; Owens, of which firm the administrator was a partner, for the sum of 4721 dollars 57 cents; and they had, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>after Tinsley\u2019s death, assigned this bond to Bernard Owen, who brought suit upon it against the administrator; and that he, with the knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, had confessed a judgment for the amount of the bond, with interest, for the purpose of giving the assignee of Watson &amp; Owens a preference over the other creditors of the estate. That upon this judgment execution was immediately issued, and was levied on the slaves of the intestate in the hands of the administrator, which were sold to the amount of 2378 dollars 37 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-4\">Watson answered, calling for proof of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment against Tinsley, and denying notice of it. But the <em>scire facias </em>to revive the judgment seems to have been served upon him before the confession of judgment to Owen. The defendant also set up other grounds of defence, which it is not necessary to notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-6\">Bernard Owen also answered, taking the same grounds of defence as Watson. The other sureties, Allen and Ervine, also answered, and insisted, that if the plaintiff\u2019s judgment was entitled to priority over that of Owen, so that the application of the assets to the satisfaction of the latter was a devastavit, then that Owen should be held responsible personally to the creditors of Tinsley\u2019s estate, before resort was had to the other sureties; because said Owen was one of Watson\u2019s sureties, as administrator of Tinsley, and had no right to unite with him in the misapplication of the assets of the estate, and thereby to benefit himself by the injury of his co-sureties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-7\">The accounts of the administrator were referred to a commissioner, who, excluding the payment to Owen\u2019s debt, reported a balance due to the estate, of 2728 dollars 51 cents, with interest on 2617 dollars 31 cents, a part thereof, from the 31st of December 1840 until paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The cause came on to be heard in April 1846, when the Court rendered a decree in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant Watson, and all his sureties. From this decree Allen and Ervine applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b86-10\">Michie, for the appellants, and <em>Boyd, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaG\">submitted the case upon notes. The questions were, 1st. Whether the Court below should have decreed between the co-defendants, without a cross bill. And 2d. Whether under any state of the pleadings, the other sureties of Watson were entitled to a decree over against Bernard Owen.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b84-12\"> Judge <em>Daniel </em>had been counsel in other cases out of which this originated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b86-11\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AGL\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">The Court is of opinion, that the only questions raised by the issue between the complainants and defendants in the Court below, were the <em>devastavit </em>charged to have been committed by the administrator of Robert Tinsley, and the joint liability of his sureties in his official bond therefor; and that upon the case, as made out by the pleadings and proofs between the said complainants and defendants, no decree could have been properly rendered as between the co-defendants. The Court therefore, without deciding upon the equities of the co-defendants, as amongst themselves, is of opinion, that as between the complainants and defendants in the Court below, there is no error in the decree. It is therefore adjudged and ordered, that the same be affirmed with costs to the appellees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
