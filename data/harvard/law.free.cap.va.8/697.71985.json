The tenant also gave in evidence a deed for the moiety so granted unto <em>Andrew Donnally </em>junior, from <em>Donnally </em>and wife to <em>Hugh Gilmore, </em>bearing date the 12th of September .1S14, and admitted to record in the county court of <em>Mason </em>in March 1817 : likewise a deed from <em>Hugh Gilmore </em>and wife and <em>Morris Gilmore </em>to <em>Matthew D.

It was admitted by the deman<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>dant that the tenant is the son of the said <em>Elliott Brown, </em>and devisee of the land described in the lastmentioned conveyance. And it was proved in the cause that <em>Andrew Honnally </em>junior and <em>Reuben Slaughter, </em>and those claiming under them, had been in possession of the land from the line marked I H on the plat, up to <em>Plantation </em>creek, under and from the date of <em>Bonnally </em>and <em>Slaughter's </em>patent, and by actual occupation from 1810 to the present time: and that the demandant and his ancestor had been in possession of the land from the mouth of <em>Plantation </em>creek up to <em>Crailc\u2019s </em>lower river corner, under and from the date of the patent to <em>Shadrach Harriman, </em>and by actual occupation from 1795 to the present time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b720-4\">The demandant then offered, as presumptive evidence of his beginning corner being on or adjoining the line of <em>Washington, </em>a copy of an entry on which his survey and patent were founded, in these words: \u201c1785, January 18. <em>Shadrach Harriman, </em>assignee of <em>Jacob Paff, </em>assignee of <em>John Hawkins, </em>by virtue 'of a land warrant of 2000 acres, number 16,035, dated 8th of May 1783, enters the same as follows, viz. 400 acres on the <em>Ohio, </em>joining general <em>Washington's </em>line; 200 acres joining the lower end of <em>G.

The deposition of <em>Lewis Jones </em>being offered in connexion with the foregoing evidence, and the depositions of <em>Benjamin Jones </em>and <em>William Arbuckle </em>being also offered, the demandant objected to the same being read, for certain reasons endorsed on the deposition of <em>Leivis Jones, </em>which were repeated, as to each of the others, <em>ore tenus. </em>The endorsement states that the deposition was objected to so fiir as it gives the belief of the deponent, or others, as to the matters spoken of by him, or ,the understanding, reputation or tradition of the neighbourhood; it not being competent to prove boundaries between individuals by such evidence : that it was objected to also, so far as it purports to give the sayings or doings of others not parties to this suit., <em>David Milburn </em>being alive, and capable of being used as a witness: and that the answers to some questions were objected to, on the ground that the questions were of a leading character. The court overruled the objections, and allowed the depositions to be read : to which opinion the demandant excepted. To understand the opinion of the appellate court, it is necessary to set forth portions of the depositions of <em>Lewis Jones </em>and <em>William Arbuckle. Jones </em>deposed that in December 1795 his father moved to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>land of <em>Shadrach Harriman </em>on the <em>Great Kanawha </em>river, in what was then <em>Kanawha </em>county; that his father lived on this land about seven years, and whilst living on it, built a cabin and cleared some land; that <em>Shadrach Harriman </em>was then dead, and <em>David Milburn, </em>who married his widow and acted as guardian for <em>Harrim.an\u2019s </em>children, leased the land to the witness\u2019s father; that while his father lived on the land, <em>Milburn </em>shewed to his father particular trees as <em>Harriman\u2019s </em>corners, and it wms then well understood in the country that those trees were <em>Harriman\u2019s </em>corners. The witness stated his belief that he knew the corners of <em>Harriman\u2019s </em>land well, especially the front or' river corners. The lower front or river corner, he said, was a black walnut tree, which stood just below the mouth of <em>Plantation </em>creek, which walnut tree was then, by almost every person in the country who knew any thing about the land surveys, called and believed to be <em>Washington\u2019s </em>upper front corner, it being marked with the initials of his name, viz. G. W. At the time of giving this deposition, the witness\u2019s father was dead. By the deposition of <em>William Arbuckle </em>it appeared that the witness, after stating that he always heard that <em>Washington\u2019s </em>upper corner was a black walnut with G.' W. on it, and that <em>Harriman\u2019s </em>lower corner was <em>Washington\u2019s </em>upper corner, was asked by what means he ascertained that walnut to be <em>Harriman\u2019s </em>corner; and his answer was, that he was told by <em>Reuben Slaughter </em>that it was <em>Washington\u2019s </em>upper corner, and from the common report of the country he ascertained that <em>Washington\u2019s </em>upper corner was <em>Harriman\u2019s </em>lower comer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b722-4\">The tenant called and examined a witness, who proved that in 1791 a hunting party discovered the walnut tree standing at the mouth of <em>Plantation </em>creek, which was then marked with the letters G. W. and with marks like those usually placed on corner trees; that one of the party concluded it must be general <em>Washington\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>corner, but another was of opinion that the marks looked i-too new for his survey. The witness however stated that the marks and letters seemed to him at that time to be ancient. By other witnesses it was proved, that from <em>Hamer\u2019s </em>defeat up to the pacification produced by general <em>Wayne\u2019s </em>treaty with the indians in 1795, there were no settlements on the <em>Great Kanawha </em>river, except a military post at the mouth thereof, another post of like character at the mouth of <em>Cole </em>river, and another at the mouth of <em>Elk, </em>from which hunters frequently penetrated the forests in search of game, whose journeys were <em>generally </em>performed up and down the river in canoes. That after <em>Wayne\u2019s </em>treaty, emigrants from the east commenced settlements in the valley of the <em>Great Kanawha, </em>and continued to increase thenceforward. That among the emigrants and settlers on the river, acquainted with the walnut at the mouth of <em>Plantation </em>creek, that tree was reputed and considered as <em>Washington\u2019s </em>upper river corner, and as the lower corner of <em>Harriman\u2019s </em>survey. \u2014 To the introduction of this evidence the demandant objected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b723-5\">The opinion given by the court relates both to the depositions and the oral testimony. The court decided that the said depositions and oral testimony, so far as they related to the tradition and reputation of the walnut tree at the mouth of <em>Plantation </em>creek being the upper corner of <em>Washington\u2019s </em>survey, were not proper and competent evidence to prove that fact, unless accompanied by evidence of a possession under his title, and consistent with such tradition and reputation ; but that the said depositions and oral testimony were admissible to shew that the marks on that tree, and the tradition and reputation in relation thereto, as before mentioned, might have existed as far back as 1786, when <em>Harriman\u2019s </em>survey was made, and that the said tree might then have been taken and called for by the surveyor of <em>Harriman\u2019s </em>land, as a corner adjoining <em>Washington\u2019s </em>land. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>^\u00b0r PurPose evidence was permitted to go to the jury, to have such weight as the jury might think it deserved. To which opinion the demandant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ajq\">The jury found that the tenant did not hold that part of the land mentioned in the count, lying above <em>Plantation </em>creek, laid down in the plat of the surveyor, and included within certain lines designated by the letters B F E D C B ; and as to that part of the land, they found for the demandant, the tenant disclaiming title and tenure thereto. This was land tying wholly <em>above </em>the black walnut. They further found that the tenant had more right to hold the land below <em>Plantation </em>creek, laid down on the plat, and included within certain lines designated by the letters B I G F B, than the demandant to have it. The land so found for the tenant lay between the black walnut and the point I in <em>Washington\u2019s </em>upper line. Upon this verdict, judgment was rendered in favour of the tenant for the lastmentioned land, with costs; to which judgment the demandant obtained a <em>supersedeas.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b724-6\"><em>Summers </em>and <em>B.

His patent call is to adjoin the upper end of <em>Washington\u2019s </em>survey, at a large black walnut. Now the acknowledged upper boundary of <em>Washington </em>was about 565 poles, or considerably more than a mile and a half, below the black walnut contended for. And hence it became necessary to ascertain whether this black walnut was the tree referred to in the survey; for if so, it would control the call for <em>Washington's </em>line, upon the well established principle that natural or artificial boun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>claries, which are the objects of the senses, must control the call for ideal boundaries, or for lines which are often matters of conjecture and always liable to be mistaken, and particularly where (as was the case here) the upper line of <em>Washington </em>was a protracted line. See <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Evett\u2019s lessee, </em>7 Monroe 329, 333, 334. In order then to establish the fact that the black walnut was the reputed corner of <em>Harriman, </em>and that in making tiie survey it was by mistake supposed to be <em>Washington\u2019s </em>upper corner, the tenant introduced the depositions of <em>Lewis Jones, Benjamin Jones </em>and <em>William ArhucJcle. To </em>these depositions the demandant objected. We concur in overruling his objections, for the following very satisfactory reasons, for which I am indebted to my brother <em>Parker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">\u201c Three depositions were offered by the tenant, to the reading of which, and of either of them, the demandant objected, \u2018for the reasons indorsed on the deposition of <em>Lewis Jones, </em>which were repealed, as to each of the others, <em>ore temis.\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">That indorsement objected to the deposition, so far as it gives the belief of the deponent, or others, as to the matters spoken of by him, or the understanding, reputation or tradition of the neighbourhood, it not being competent to prove boundaries between individuals by such evidence; also scalar as it purports to give the sayings or doings of others, not parties to this suit; that <em>David Milhurn </em>is living, and might be used as a witness; that it was not competent to prove what he said or did, even if such testimony was proper, without proving it by himself; that there were <em>some </em>questions of a leading character, the answers to which are objected to on that account.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">This was the indorsement on the deposition of <em>Lewis Jones. </em>It was not an objection to the whole deposition, on the ground of interest, or any other; and it is palpable that there was much of that deposition which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>ought to have been read in evidence, even if some of the demandant\u2019s objections were sustainable. Then it was the duty of the party objecting, to point out the ex-eeptionable passages in the depositions, and move the <em>court to </em>expunge or disregard them. The demandant could not object to the reading of the whole deposition because there were parts of it exceptionable. It certainly was his duty to lay his finger upon the passages which in his opinion came within the scope of his objections, so that the mind of the court might be brought to bear upon them, instead of making a motion equivalent to the rejection of all the depositions; a motion which the court could not legally sustain. See <em>Buster\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. Wallace, 4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The objections indorsed upon <em>Jones\u2019s </em>deposition were perhaps all of them unfounded. <em>Milburn </em>was an interested witness, and could not have been examined by the tenant. He had married the widow, who was entitled to dower in all the land in <em>controversy; </em>and <em>it is </em>not shewn by the demandant that <em>Milburn\u2019s </em>wife was dead. Being alive in the year 1795, the presumption was that at the time of the trial she was still living, unless the contrary was shewn. Bnt even if <em>Milburn </em>was living and competent to give evidence, it is not perceived how the evidence of <em>Jones, </em>connected with <em>Mil-'burn, </em>was incompetent. He speaks of facts, and not of mere declarations on the part of <em>Milburn. Milburn </em>put his father in possession of the land as <em>Shadrack Harriman\u2019s. </em>He had married the widow, was guardian to the children, and in either character was entitled to rent the land. He also shewed the corners to his tenant, which cornel's, as the witness says, were then well understood in the country to be the true corners. It is then not a mere declaration o\u2019f <em>Milburn </em>that the witness gives in evidence, but it is an act, to wit, the shewing of certain corner trees, which the general reputation of the neighbourhood fixed upon as the corners to <em>Harri</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number><em>man\u2019s </em>land. How could it be illegal evidence for <em>Jones </em>to speak of being shewn corners (no matter by whom) \u2018which every person in the country, who knew any thing of the land surveys, called and believed to be <em>Washington\u2019s,\u2019 </em>\u2014 unless this last evidence of general reputation was inadmissible? The act of shewing the corner trees was one thing; the evidence establishing them as the true comers of the land, another. Even if <em>Milburn\u2019s </em>shewing certain trees as the corners of the land was not evidence to establish them as comers, the fact that he pointed out trees, which by other evidence arc established as true corners, could not be rejected. The same remarks apply to <em>Benjamin Jones\u2019s </em>deposition ; and as to <em>ArbucMe\u2019s, </em>the objections indorsed do not, in several respects, touch it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">It is objected, however, that evidence of reputation as to boundary is inadmissible, and that for this reason also the testimony introduced was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Questions of boundary, after the lapse of many years, become of necessity questions of hearsay and reputation. For boundaries are artificial, arbitrary, and often perishable; and when a generation or two have passed away, they cannot be established by the testimony of -eyewitnesses. In such cases, therefore, it becomes necessary to look to reputation, or depend upon hearsay evidence of the former existence and actual locality of an artificial boundary. \u201c That boundaries may be proved by hearsay testimony,\u201d says the supreme court, \u201c is a rule well settled, and the necessity or propriety of which is not now questioned. Land marks are frequently formed of perishable materials, which pass away with the generation in which they wore made. By the improvement of the country, and from other causes, they are often destroyed. It is therefore important in many cases, that hearsay or reputation should be received to establish ancient boundaries.\u201d <em>Boardman </em>v. <em>Reed, 6 </em>Peters 328, 341. The reasons for ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>mitting evidence of reputation are so obvious, indeed, that they are <em>forcibly </em>stated even by those who fall short of our doctrines on this subject. See 1 Starkie on Evid. 54, 56. \u201c Some of these facts,\u201d says this author <em>(boundary </em>is one of those of which he Awas speaking) \u201c from their antiquity, do not admit of direct proof by living witnesses, and consequently resort must be had to the best means of proof which the nature of the case affords. This consists in the traditionary declarations, in relation to matters of antiquity, of those who were likely to have possessed a knowledge on the subject, derived from their own observation or the information of others. Upon questions of fact to which antiquity is essential, as prescription, custom or boundary, the evidence of living witnesses is of little avail. For any knowledge concerning such rights, drawn from times more remote, recourse must be had to reputation and tradition.\u201d It is singular that with such conclusive reasons in favour of this kind of proof in cases of boundary, the english courts, which recognize them, should have been inclined to confine the principle to <em>public </em>boundaries, such as the boundaries of manors, parishes, highways, and the like, and exclude its operation in a dispute about boundary between two <em>private </em>estates. 1 Starkie\u2019s Evid. <em>62, </em>14 East 331, 3 Bac. Abr. Evidence. K. From these authorities it would seem that this has been and still continues <em>vexata qucsstio. </em>I shall therefore abandon them, and seek for guidance from the light of reason and from the american .cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Before I proceed with our enquiry, I beg leave to quote the remarks of justice <em>Story </em>upon this subject of evidence. <em>\u201cIt </em>is obvious,\u201d says he, <em>\u201c </em>that as the rules of evidence are founded upon general interest and convenience, they must from time to time admit of modifications, to adapt them to the actual condition and business of men, or they would work manifest injustice; and lord <em>Ellenborough </em>has very justly observed that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>must expand according to the exigencies of society.\u201d 8 Wheat. 332. \u201c We are not,\u201d says lord <em>Mansfield, </em>\u201c to sit here, to take our rules of evidence from <em>Keble </em>or from <em>Sideifin.\u201d </em>And if a rigorous adherence to antiquated rales of evidence would be inexpedient or unjust in the english courts, what differences, what <em>expansions </em>of those rules must not necessarily arise in a new country like ours, conquered from the savage, and granted out: to private adventurers while it still remained a wilderness. Because we have not <em>manors, </em>shall we therefore lose the benefit of the rule which considers boundary as matter of reputation, and permits hearsay evidence of its locality ? If a like state of things exists among us, if the principle will be found to apply in its utmost strictness, shall we reject the evidence because the case is not identical ? By no means. What then is the avowed principle on which the distinction rests in the Snglish courts ? <em>\u201c </em>In questions concerning public rights, reputation is admissible; for in such cases all mankind are considered as interested in preserving the evidence.\u201d Bac. Abr. <em>ubi supra. \u201c </em>Upon questions of <em>public </em>right, all are interested, and must be presumed conversant with them ; and this is the distinction taken between public and private rights.\u201d <em>Per </em>lord <em>Ellenborough, </em>1 Maule &amp; Selw. 686. \u201c Evidence of reputation upon general points is receivable, because all mankind being interested therein, it is natural to suppose that they may be conversant with the subjects, and that they would discourse together about them, having all the same means of information.\u201d <em>Per </em>lord <em>Kenyon. </em>What language can be more appropriate to the c\u00e1se of laud adventurers in our western country? That country was covered with entries and surveys between fifty and sixty years ago, and it was often many years after a survey was made, before the tracts taken up were settled by their owners. Thousands have never yet seen their lands. The impossibility, in innumerable in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>stances, of proving marked corners-by eyewitnesses is apparent. What is to supply that lost evidence ? If reputation is admissible to establish the boundaries of a manor, because all the tenants of the manor are interested therein, and are naturally conversant about the boundary, and may be presumed to discourse together about it, what shall we say in the case of our wild lands, which were covered with early adventurers, whose chief concern was to make themselves acquainted with the lines and corners of all around them ? Every one, who knows any thing of the history of that country, must know the deep interest and familiar knowledge which the early settlers possessed in relation to the corners and boundaries and localities, not only of their own particular tract, but of almost every tract within range of their settlement. Every one knows that such subjects were not only the <em>familiar </em>topics of conversation, but that they were <em>the all absorbing </em>topio\u00ab. I will venture to conjecture that for one discussion <em>in </em>private conversation as to the boundaries of an english manor, there have been a hundred animated and interested debates about the situation of a corner tree in our western counties. I take it, therefore, that every motive for the admission of hearsay testimony as ta boundary in case of a manor, applies with equal force to its admission in questions of boundary with us. I coincide in the opinion cited from <em>Peters, </em>that \u201c boundaries may be proved by hearsay testimony.\u201d The testimony so admitted must however be that of a witness who is dead ; for if living .he ought himself to be brought forward.// I' rely also on the case of <em>Ralston &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Miller &amp;c. </em>3 Rand. 44. although it was a question as to the boundaries of town lots, which perhaps, upon the strictest principles, may be considered as falling within even the english decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The question still recurs, however, whether evidence may be introduced to prove the declarations of a wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>ness as to a particular fact, or merely as to general reputation. Thus, admitting the declarations of a witness that this black walnut was the <em>reputed </em>corner, to be proper, should we admit his declarations of the <em>fact </em>that that tree was pointed out to him, by a person who is dead or disqualified, as the true corner ?</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">The doctrine in <em>England, </em>as laid down in the books, is that though hearsay is good evidence in matters of reputation, yet a particular fact cannot be'proved by traditionary evidence. <em>Outram </em>v. <em>Morewood, 5 </em>T. R. 123. 1 Starkie on Evid. 61. Yet, notwithstanding this general rule, there are cases which form exceptions to it. Thus, the written memorandum of a father as to the time of the birth of his son may be given in evidence. 1 Starkie on Evid. 70.71. Yet this is but hearsay reduced to writing, and hearsay of a particular fact which is perfectly susceptible of proof <em>aliunde. </em>So the written entry of a surveyor, or his survey, which is made and returned under the sanction of an oath, would be evidence. Again, the entry of a clerk charging goods to a party is good evidence of the fact of delivery, if the clerk be dead. 1 Starkie on Evid. 72. Yet this is direct evidence, not on oath, to a particular fact which may be otherwise proved. Why then is it admitted ? \u201c Because,\u201d says the author, \u201c he had peculiar means of knowledge, and made it in the course of a particular routine of business, at the same time, or nearly so, with the supposed act.\u201d 1 Starkie 72. So with the surveyor. His survey is made in the course of an official routine of business, and he had peculiar means of knowing the facts which it sets forth. So in <em>Nicholls </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>8 Wheat. 326. the notary\u2019s books were admitted, after his decease, -as evidence of the particular facts of a demand of payment and notice of nonpayment; and <em>pari ratione </em>ihe survey must be admissible to prove a particular fact. Thus, then, it would seem that the <em>written declarations </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>of a party having peculiar means of information are ad- . - TT . . . , missible. How is it as to parol declarations r</p>\n<p id=\"ANqf\">In <em>Mima Queen </em>v. <em>Hepburn, </em>7 Cranch 290. the distinction was strongly taken between general evidence of reputation, and hearsay evidence as to a particular fact. This case was firmly relied on by judge <em>Carr </em>in <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Baugh, 2 </em>Leigh 665. and cited with approbation also by judge <em>Brooke. </em>,, The court was divided upon the question, judges <em>Green </em>and <em>Cabell </em>deeming the evidence of the particular fact admissible and proper. Judge <em>Green </em>observed that \u201c all evidence, whether direct or.by hearsay and reputation, consists in the proof of specific or particular facts. The general rule is indeed as laid down; but there are admitted exceptions, depending upon no arbitrary decisions of courts of justice, but upon sound principles of necessity and reason, according to the nature of the facts. If the fact be of such a nature as that, in the ordinary course of things, if it really existed, it might reasonably be expected <em>that </em>direct evidence of it would also exist, hearsay or reputation is inadmissible. But pedigree is an exception to the rule, and may be proved by hearsay and reputation.\u201d He then proceeds to shew that pedigree consists exclusively of specific facts, among which he enumerates identity. All this applies most strongly io the proof of the identity of a corner tree, by proof of the declarations of a deceased witness. It is a fact which, in the ordinary course of things, after a generation has passed away, never can be proved by direct evidence, where the artificial boundary has been destroyed by time; and titles must be insecure, if this species of evidence is not admitted to establish the locality of a corner, where the marked tree has been destroyed. Accordingly, in the case of <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Baugh, </em>I understand judge <em>Brooke </em>(who resisted the evidence in that case) to admit that in our country, in cases of boundary, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>evidence of particular facts must be admitted. The same thing is also decided by the supreme court (as I understand the case, already cited from Peters\u2019s Reports) where the court is reported to have said that \u201c boundaries may be proved by hearsay testimony.\u201d It is difficult indeed to understand why <em>reputation </em>that a particular tree is the boundary should be evidence, when the direct testimony of the man who knows the fact, and marked the tree, is not so. Both are equally without oath, and the latter has the advantage of the former, not only in being at the foundation, but also in the uncertainty which always hangs around matters of mere reputation, as to the accuracy of the source from whence it has been derived.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">I hold, then, clearly, that evidence is admissible to prove the declarations of a deceased person as to the identity of a particular corner tree or bouudary, provided such person had peculiar means of knowing the fact; as, for instance, the surveyor or chain carrier who were engaged upon the original survey, or the owner of the\u2018tract, or of an adjoining tract calling for the same boundaries; and so of tenants, processioners, and others whose duty or interest would lead them to diligent enquiry and accurate information of the fact; always, however, excluding those declarations which are liable to the suspicion of bias from interest. If these principles be true, the declarations of <em>Milburn against </em>his own interest (if they are to be considered as declarations) were properly introduced ; for that is a sanction for his veracity which the law has always respected; and as he could not be compelled to testify, bis admissions ought to be received as if he were dead. See, on this subject, Starkie on Evid. part 4. p. 42. in note, citing 1 Esp. N. P. Cas. 458. See also 2 T. R. 54. 5 T. R. 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">As to the evidence respecting the hunting party, it appears to me to be fairly incidental to the evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>reputation. For it is always proper to enquire into the _ , , . . . , source from which reputation arises; since peraaventure it may have sprung <em>from </em>an <em>improper </em>source. Thus, if <em>Arbuclde </em>had derived <em>his </em>information from <em>Slaughter alone, </em>his evidence would have been assailable, as the tenant claims under <em>Slaughter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Lastly, as to the entry. That the entry of a party may sometimes be admitted in evidence before the jury, to identify the calls of the patent, is acknowledged to have been decided by this court in <em>Camden et al. </em>v. <em>Haskill, </em>3 Rand. 462. In <em>this </em>case the entry was rejected by the same judge who had, upon the trial, admitted it in the case just cited. I think there is much reason for distinction between the two cases. In <em>Camden et al. </em>v. <em>Haskill, </em>the patent called for \u201c a white oak and beech, corner to a survey of 40,000 acres made for <em>David </em>Lockwoodwithout any further description. The white oak and beech claimed by the plaintiff were proved to be \u201c 80 poles below the falls of <em>Little Kanawha, </em>on the north .side thereof.\u201d The plaintiff introduced a copy of the entry on which his patent was founded, which called to begin at \u201c a white oak and beech on the north bank of the <em>Little Kanawha, </em>80 poles below the falls thereof.\u201d Now this entry did not control or <em>contradict </em>the patent. It only explained it, and identified the call, which in the patent itself was left indefinite. But in this case the patent calls \u201cto adjoin the upper end of <em>Washington's </em>survey, at a large black walnut;\u201d and thus refers to a certain, visible, actual boundary, which controls the call for the <em>Washington </em>survey, the location of which was mere matter of conjecture, and might easily have been mistaken, and in point of fact <em>was </em>mistaken. Taking the patent without the entry, the black walnut controls the other call. For what, then, was the entry to be introduced ? It was, to counteract this legitimate construction of the patent, and to lead the jury to be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>licve that the plaintiff had a right to go to <em>Washington's </em>survey, wherever it might be. Whether it ought to have this effect or not, it was illegal testimony. If it would have the effect, it would contradict and control the patent; if not, it would be irrelevant, and therefore improper, as only calculated to embarrass and mislead the jury. I think, therefore, it was properly rejected, and that there is no error in the judgment of the circuit superiour court; which must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">The other judges concurred. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
