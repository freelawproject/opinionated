Davis, Waitman Davis and three others, against Bushrod Q,. Hogue, to recover from him the amount which they had been compelled to pay as subsequent endorsers upon a note made by Robert Davis to Bushrod Q,. Hogue, and discounted at the bank in Morgantown. The note bore date July 29th, 1844, and was for 2500 dollars, payable in ninety days, at the Jjancaster Bank in the State of Pennsylvania, and was endorsed by all the parties for the accommodation of Robert Davis. Before the note fell due, Robert Davis absconded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-8\">The ground of defence was, that all the endorsers were to be jointly and equally bound. The only witnesses who spoke to the making of the note, were John Davis, a brother of two of the plaintiffs, and Albert G. Davis a cousin. According to their testimony Hogue boarded with Robert Davis, and endorsed the note at Davis\u2019s house, in the absence of the other endorsers ; and Robert Davis then took the note to obtain other endorsers upon it. That he applied to his father Thomas Davis to endorse it, who declined to do it, when Robert Davis told him there was no danger as both he and Hogue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>would have to fail before said Thomas Davis could be liable. Albert G. Davis stated that Hogue informed him he had furnished Robert Davis money to buy cat-tie, and intended to do so as long as he wanted to do business, and that he was to have a share of the profits arising from the business. That this was before said Davis absconded, and after the witness had understood they had gotten money out of the bank at Morgantown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-4\">It was proved that after the note was protested and returned to the bank at Morgantown several of the endorsers, including Hogue, came to the bank for the purpose of making arrangements for its payment. They first proposed to give a bond for the whole amount, and the bond was prepared and some of them signed it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-5\">They arranged to borrow some four or five hundred dollars from a Mr. Han way to aid them in the payment; and a note was prepared and taken away' by them but was not returned; and they all left the bank without making arrangements to take up the original note. Shortly afterwards some of the sureties informed Mr. Hanway they had ascertained that the note was not of such a character as they had supposed <em>; </em>and that they would not be liable as they believed, until the property of Bushrod Q.. Hogue was exhausted ; and that they declined taking the loan. On the same day they were at the bank, James T. Davis, one of the endorsers, had a conversation with the cashier of the bank, and that officer understood from him that although they might not be legally bound to pay any part of the note, yet they were joint endorsers with Hogue, or something to that effect, and did not intend to take any advantage of him ; and that they considered themselves equally bound with Hogue as the cashier understood him. It seems probable that neither Hogue or the endorsers knew the difference between the note payable as it was and a joint endorsement of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The Circuit court gave the plaintiffs a judgment against the defendant for-1179 dollars and 38 cents, with interest from October the 6th, 1846, until paid, that being the balance due upon the note, after applying thereto the proceeds of certain property of Robert Davis, which the plaintiffs had been compelled to pay. And thereupon Hogue applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-4\"><em>A. F.
