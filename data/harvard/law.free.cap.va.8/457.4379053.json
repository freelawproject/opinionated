A deed which conveys all the property of the grantor in trust for the payment of his debts, is valid, though it contains a provision that no creditor shall take any benefit under the deed who does not, within thirty days from its date, signify his acceptance of its terms and conditions <em>; </em>and further agree to release and acquit the grantor from all further claim for the debt acknowledged therein.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b481-11\">2. The creditors named in such a deed, being dissatisfied with the trusts therein declared, it is agreed between each other and the debtor, that none of them will sign it; and that when the thirty days expires, another deed shall be executed by the debtor with other provisions. The day before the thirty days expires, two of the creditors execute the deed, with the avowed purpose to each other, of securing the benefit of the deed to all the creditors. After the <em>thirty </em>days has expired, one of these signing creditors files a bill against the other and the trustee, to have the trust executed for the exclusive benefit of the two ; which the other resists. The other creditors having sued the debtor and obtained judgments by confession, on which the debtor took the oath of an insolvent debtor, filed their bill in the same Court against the debtor and signing creditors, charging that the deed was void as to them, and that the plaintiff in the first suit was guilty of a fraud in signing the deed. On the hearing the first bill should be dismissed with costs; and the deed being in fact valid, the fund should be distributed among all the creditors according to its provisions.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-12\">On the 12th of May 1837, John Durham, a boot and shoe maker residing in the city of Richmond, having been sued for a debt which he considered he did not owe, and apprehending that a judgment might be recovered against him during the term of the Court which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>had then commenced, executed a deed of trust on his property for the benefit of his other creditors by name : providing in the deed, however, that no creditor who not within thirty days from its date, signify his assent to) and acceptance of, its terms and conditions, and further agree to release and acquit the said Durham from all further claim on account of the debt acknowledged by said deed to be due to such creditor, should take any benefit under the deed ; and that the surplus, after paying the debts of the accepting and releasing creditors, should be paid over to the said Durham. This deed appears to have been executed without the knowledge of the creditors for whose benefit it was made, and was never signed by the trustee. On the day after its execution it was acknowledged by Durham in the clerk\u2019s office. On the 10th of June 1837, the day before the expiration of the thirty days mentioned in the deed, it was signed and acknowledged by two of the creditors, to wit, Thomas Mieure, and Phippen &amp; Mallory, by B. \"W. Mallory. It was never signed by any of the other creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-5\">On the 17th of June 1837, Mallory &amp; Phippen exhibited their bill in chancery against Durham, Pulliam the trustee, and Mieure; claiming that they and Mieure as the only accepting creditors, were exclusively entitled to the benefit of the deed, and praying for an injunction, that a trustee might be substituted to the place of Pulliam who declined to act, and that the trust might be executed. On the same day the injunction was awarded; and under the order awarding it, the sheriff took possession of the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-6\">On the 23d of the same month, June 1837, Durham confessed judgments in the clerk\u2019s office at the suits of his other creditors, and being prayed in custody took the oath of an insolvent debtor ; surrendering in his schedule, (besides some other subjects, apparently of little value,) whatever interest he might have in the property conveyed by said deed of trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>At July rules thereafter, Stevens and others, the schedule creditors, exhibited their bill in chancery in the same Court, against Mallory &amp; Phippen, Pulliam, Mieure and Durham, and William D. Wren, sergeant of the city of Richmond, charging that after the execution of the deed and before the expiration of the 30 days, it was agreed by all the parties, including Mallory &amp; Phippen, that the recorded deed should not be adopted, but should become inoperative by the expiration of the 30 days, and a new deed should be made and different provisions introduced. That afterwards, to wit, on the 10th of June, the day before the expiration of the 30 days, Mieure, thinking that some benefit might result to Durham and his creditors by a mere formal signature of the deed by one or more of the creditors, proposed to Mallory to sign the deed, with the understanding that such signature should be for the benefit of all the other creditors, if it should become necessary to avail themselves of the same; with the design, however, that if no judgment should be obtained against Durham, as was apprehended by him, the deed should be cancelled, and another made carrying out the new agreement and understanding between the parties. That Mallory assented to these views of Mieure, and it was understood between them that should a judgment go against Durham at the then term of the Court, all the trust property should be sold and applied to the payment of all the debts mentioned in the deed, as if it had been signed by all the creditors. That with these views and this express understanding, Mieure and Mallory proceeded to the clerk\u2019s office to sign the deed ; and at or about the time of getting there, Mallory proposed to Mieure to sign the deed and claim the whole amount of proceeds, (as the same would not very much exceed the amount of their respective debts,) in exclusion of all the other creditors: that Mieure indignantly rejected this proposition as a fraud on the other credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>tors, and on Durham also, and a plain and flagrant violation of the then subsisting understanding among all the parties; and further admonished Mallory that if he persisted in any such design, he had yet time and would inform Durham and every creditor, so that they might on that and the succeeding day come in and sign the deed and defeat the purposes of Mallory. That finding Mieure inflexible in this respect, Mallory yielded and signed the deed with the distinct agreement and understanding that the acceptance, if operative at all, was to be for the joint benefit of all the creditors: that such was, and is yet, the understanding of Mieure, who has a clear pecuniary interest to take under the deed in exclusion of, and not in participation with, the other creditors; as in the one case he would get all of his debt, and in the other little more than one half of the same, if so much, and that in consequence of this agreement Mieure gave no notice to Durham nor to the other creditors. And they insisted that by reason of the premises the said deed was void as to them, and the said property was vested by law in the said sergeant of Richmond for their benefit; and praying that the said deed might be declared fraudulent and void as to them, and the property sold, and the proceeds applied to the payment of the debts due to them; or that such other or further decree might be made as upon all the facts of the case might seem just and equitable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-10\">At August rules in the same year, 1837, Mieure filed his answer to the bill of Mallory &amp; Phippen, making substantially the same statement as was made in the bill of the schedule creditors, in regard to the agreement of the parties not to accept the deed, and the subsequent execution thereof by himself and Mallory, and the purposes for which it was so executed, and declining to participate in what he considered to be a fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-11\">On the 2d of August 1837 there was an order of sale in Mallory &amp; Phippen\u2019s suit, and on the 1st of January 1838 the report of sale was returned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>On the 19th of April 1838 the depositions of Mieure and Durham were returned and filed in the suit of the schedule creditors. Mieure proved substantially what he had stated in his answer to Mallory &amp; Phippen\u2019s bill. Durham proved that about ten days after the deed had been admitted to record, Mr. James C. Crane, of the firm of James C. Crane &amp;\u2022 Co., creditors named therein, stated to him that he had examined the said deed, was not satisfied with it, and did not consider it good for anything, or words to that effect, and proposed that another deed with different provisions should be made and executed: that to this deponent consented; and at the instance of said Crane went to see all the creditors named in the deed who resided in Richmond: the first of them he called on was George Phippen, of the firm of Mallory &amp; Phippen, to whom he stated what had occurred between Mr. Crane and himself: that said Phippen declared he thought the arrangement proposed by Mr. Crane the best that could be made; that he was willing to do whatever the other creditors thought most advisable, and would not sign the deed that had been admitted to record. That deponent considered said Phippen as agreeing for Mallory <em>&amp;, </em>Phippen not to sign the said deed, but that another deed with different provisions was to be prepared and executed for the benefit of all the creditors named in the deed: that a day or two after the expiration of the said term of 30 days, Mallory called on deponent and informed him he had signed said deed; deponent enquired why he had done' so after the agreement and understanding aforesaid. Mallory replied that he had never committed himself in the affair, and had signed the deed with a view to secure himself; and that he had it in contemplation from the first \u2014 that is, from the time of the interview between deponent and Mr. Phippen, that if none of the other creditors signed the said deed he would sign it himself and take the benefit thereof to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>the exclusion of the other creditors, and thus secure his debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-10\">Although the bill of the schedule creditors was filed in July 1837, the <em>subpoena </em>issued thereon was returned executed on Mallory &amp; Phippen on the 1st of November 1837, the answer of Mieure to the bill of Mallory &amp; Phippen was filed in August 1837, and the depositions of Mieure and Durham were returned and filed in April 1838; no answer was ever filed by Mallory to the bill of the schedule creditors ; and none by Phippen until June 1842 \u2014 five years after the bill was filed. In his answer he denies that Mallory &amp;\u25a0 Phippen in any manner released or renounced their claim to the benefits of the said deed; or that they ever accepted it on any other terms than those expressed in the deed; or that Mallory accepted and signed it in the manner and upon the terms set forth in the bill; or that Mallory had any right or authority to renounce the said deed for the firm, and to surrender without consideration, valuable in law, the rights of the firm under the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-11\">The two suits were never formally consolidated; but after 1838 the orders made in them were joint orders\u2014 among which was an order of continuance on the motion of Mallory &amp; Phippen, and the affidavit of Phippen made in March 1843. On the 28th of June 1843 they came on to be heard together, and the decree was made from which the appeal was taken. By that decree the bill of Mallory &amp; Phippen was dismissed with <em>costs; </em>the Court being of opinion that the deed was fraudulent and void: and one of its commissioners was ordered to state an account of the claims of all the creditors of Durham in the suit of the schedule creditors, and apportion the fund among them according to the amount of their respective claims, making alternative apportionments, in one of which the debts due to Mallory &amp; Phippen and Mieure shall be embraced, and from the other they shall be excluded, and to report, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>On the day after the said decree was rendered, to wit, the 29th of June 1843, the deposition of Mallory was returned and filed in both of the cases. It was taken in Missouri. The deposition, though a short one, was taken in parcels on three different days. On the first day the witness stated, \u201c I recollect that sometime in the year 1837 I did sign a deed executed by John Durham for the benefit of certain creditors named therein, by the signing of which I as one of the firm of Mallory &amp; Phippen, which firm was a creditor of said Durham, agreed to the stipulations therein contained for the benefit of the creditors.\u201d On the 2d day he stated, \u201c I recollect that in the month of June 1837, I went in company with Thomas Mieure, from the Bank of Yirginia, to the Hustings court office, and then and there each of us, in each other\u2019s presence, signed the deed made by Durham as I before referred to ; and the said Mieure remarked at the same time, that he should not avail himself of its benefits to the exclusion of other creditors, but merely signed it so as to make the same binding on the said Durham. I did not give my assent to that or any other remark which went to shew that I signed it for the same purpose.\u201d And on the 3d day he stated, \u201c I signed the aforementioned deed with the intention of securing whatever advantages the said deed would give. Some time after signing the deed, I was astonished to learn that the aforesaid Mieure said I assented to any thing that would compromit my interest, or deprive me of the full benefit of said deed.\u201d The deposition was objected to by the schedule creditors on the ground that Mallory the witness was a party on the record and interested in the subject in contest; and that the same was taken without leave of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-6\">On the next day, June 30th, 1843, a motion was made by Mallory &amp; Phippen to set aside the decree ; in support of which motion they offered the said depo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>sition of Mallory: but the motion was overruled. The Court at the same time certified, that on the calling of the causes, the counsel for Mallory &amp; Phippen moved ^ court to continue them, in order that they might have the benefit of the deposition above mentioned, which they were in daily expectation of receiving ; but the Court overruled the said motion, and entered the decree aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-4\">Phippen applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-5\"><em>Lyons, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-6\"><em>Robert G.

While the many cases on this subject are conflicting, I think the preponderance is against the validity of such a deed. The cases are collected in 1 American Leading Cases, p. 69-85. This Court however has decided in favour of the validity of such a deed; <em>Skipwith\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>8 Leigh 271; and while I do not approve, I yet bow to the authority of that decision. That case expressly recognizes the distinction taken by Chancellor Kent in <em>Seaving </em>v. <em>Brinkerhoff, 5 </em>John. Ch. R. 329, that to make such a deed valid it must convey all, and not a part only, of the debtor\u2019s property. And as the deed in this case does not profess to convey, and did not in fact convey, all of the debtor\u2019s property, it might be contended that the deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>was on that ground invalid. The property however not included in the deed, was probably of small value, consisting, as appears from the schedule, of <em>dioses in action </em>to the amount of 131 dollars 65 cents, an interest in lands lying in western Virginia, forfeited for nonpayment of taxes, three old stoves <em>See., </em>and it would therefore perhaps be proper to say in this case, as was said in the case of <em>Skipwith\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>that \u201c the deed essentially complies with the requirements of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">But conceding that such a deed may be valid, it is certainly important to its validity that the creditors who claim the benefit of it should take no unfair advantage of the other creditors. The transaction in its very nature requires the utmost fairness in the dealings of the parties with each other. A debtor in failing circumstances proposes to surrender all his property for the equal benefit of all his creditors who will release him from all further claims; and he executes and puts on record a deed for that purpose. His object is to obtain a release from all his creditors, and to be disembarrassed in his future operations; and he offers, as the price of this relief, to make a full and fair surrender of all his property, and to place his creditors on the footing of equality. It is proper that his creditors should be notified of his offer a reasonable time before the expiration of the period limited for its acceptance, in order that they may obtain such information as will enable them to exercise their choice with discretion. It is proper that the creditors should have an opportunity of acting in concert; and it is natural and reasonable that they should so act. In this case it was especially so ; as, when the deed was executed, it was extremely doubtful whether it would be valid if accepted. The deed bears date the 12th of May 1837. The case of <em>Skipwith </em>v. <em>Cunningham </em>was decided at April term 1837. If decided at the date of the deed, the decision was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>then reported, and could only have been known to a very few. At that time many counsel would have advised that such a deed would be invalid; and all wou|(j kav.e a(jvise(j that its validity would at least extremely doubtful. Whether such a deed would be invalid, or of doubtful validity, it would have been unwise in the creditors to accept it; for by accepting it they would have tied their own hands, and might have defeated the very object they had in view. In this case therefore there was a double motive for concert among the creditors ; and accordingly the evidence shews that they did act in concert; at least so far as to determine among themselves that they would not accept the deed. Durham proves that about ten days after the deed was executed, Mr. Crane a creditor, stated that he had examined the deed, was not satisfied with it, and did not consider it good for any thing ; and proposed that another \u25a0deed with different provisions should be executed. To this proposition Durham assented, and at Crane\u2019s instance went to see the other creditors. The first he saw was Phippen, who approved the arrangement proposed by Mr. Crane, expressed his willingness to do whatever the other creditors thought most advisable, and declared that he would not sign the deed that had been admitted to record. After this express disclaimer of the deed by Phippen, it may be doubted whether he could retract his disclaimer and accept the deed. But certainly he could not do so without informing the other creditors in time to enable them to accept the deed within the 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Now if the claim of the schedule creditors stood alone upon the evidence of Durham, supported as it is by corroborating circumstances, I would regard it as not overthrown by the only countervailing evidence in the case, which is to be found in the answer of Phippen. It is contended that that answer is responsive to the bill and can only be overthrown by the evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>at least two witnesses, or one witness and corroborating circumstances. I do not consider that answer entitied to so much weight. It was not filed until about five years after the bill and the answer of Mieure, and four years after the depositions of Durham and Mieure were filed. In all of these documents it was expressly charged or proved that Phippen, or Mallory &amp; Phippen, had consented that the deed should be inoperative, and that they were guilty of a fraud in afterwards accepting the deed or attempting to set it up for their benefit against the other creditors. Such a charge if untrue should be promptly denied; and if the denial be long postponed, it must lose its weight in the same proportion. The answer too is brief and general, though the charge is full and specific. On the other hand the evidence of Durham is corroborated by the circumstance already stated, that what he proves might naturally and reasonably have been expected to occur; and by the further circumstance, that the conduct of the non-accepting creditors is almost inexplicable on any other hypothesis. They probably would not have remained quiet but for an agreement or understanding among all the creditors that the deed would not be aceepted. But for such an agreement or understanding, it is hardly credible that (the debtor and creditors residing in Richmond where the deed was recorded,) the debtor and non-accepting creditors, or some of them, would not have gone to the clerk\u2019s office on the last of the 30 days to see if any of the creditors had signed the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">But the claim of the schedule creditors does not stand alone on the evidence of Durham, supported as it is by corroborating circumstances. Mieure proved that some days previous to the last day upon which, according to the terms of the deed, the creditors had a right to sign it, all the creditors therein named, as deponent believed, and certainly Mallory &amp; Phip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>pen, determined not to accept the deed, but to suffer it to be inoperative by the expiration of the 30 days without signing the same. Deponent was confident ^is was the understanding and agreement among ap saj\u00bf[ creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Now here are two witnesses positively testifying to a fact which is decisive of this case, to wit, the fact that within the 30 days the creditors, and certainly Phippen, agreed not to accept the deed, and if the answer of Phippen had denied this fact in the most positive and explicit terms, and were entitled to all the weight to which an answer can be entitled, it would be insufficient to resist the force of the concurring testimony of these two witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">But Mieure proved another fact which is decisive of this case, to wit, that he and Mallory signed the deed with the express understanding and agreement, that, if carried out by a sale of the property therein mentioned, it should enure to the benefit of every creditor who should think proper to take under the same, in the same manner and to the same extent as though they had also on that day signed said deed. What evidence is there in the case to disprove this decisive fact thus proved by the evidence of Mieure? Not a particle, unless the deposition of Mallory, Avhich will be presently noticed, be considered as evidence in the case. It is true that Phippen in his answer denies that Mallory accepted and signed the deed in the manner and upon the terms set forth in the bill. But that denial was not made on the personal knowledge of Phippen; and if made on any information at all, such information must have been derived from Mallory. The denial therefore is not evidence ; and certainly cannot weigh down the evidence of Mieure.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">It will not do for Mallory to say that Phippen could not bind him by agreeing not to accept the deed. Nor for Phippen to say that Mallory had no right \u201c to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>nounce the said deed for the firm, and to surrender without consideration valuable in law, the rights of the firm under the deed.\u201d If these parties were right in saying that one could not bind the other, yet certainly each could bind himself, and as each did bind himself by agreeing to that which is decisive against the claim of the firm, therefore the firm is as much bound as if they had both expressly agreed not to accept the deed, or to accept it for the benefit of all the creditors. But I apprehend they are not right in so saying; and that the said several agreements of Mallory &amp; Phippen for the firm, are binding on the firm and each member of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Durham and Mieure are both competent witnesses. Durham is disinterested ,\u2022 and the interest of Mieure is against his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">But it is contended that the Court below erred in overruling the motion of Mallory &amp; Phippen to continue the case, in order that they might have the benefit of the deposition of Mallory, which they were in daily expectation of receiving, and also in overruling their motion to set aside the decree after said deposition was returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The suits were instituted in 1837. The charges made in the bill of the schedule creditors were of such a nature as to render it proper that if they could be disproved by Mallory, his deposition should be taken and filed without any unnecessary delay. He was at that time in Richmond; for in November 1837, the <em>subpoena </em>was returned executed upon him. When he left Richmond or the state, does not appear; nor is there any trace in the record of any effort to take his deposition until March 1843 ; six years after the filing of the bill; when the suits were continued on the motion of Mallory &amp; Phippen, and on the affidavit of Phippen that he had in the preceding December, sent the necessary papers to St. Louis, Missouri, for the purpose of taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Mallory\u2019s deposition, but that they had miscarried, and therefore the deposition had not been taken. At the next term, to wit, on the 28th of June L843, when the suits were again called for hearing, Mallory &amp; Phippen mo7e(j for another continuance for the same cause, and the Court overruled the motion. It seems to me that without accounting for the great apparent default which had occurred in not taking the deposition before, Mallory &amp;\u2022 Phippen had no right to have the trial of the suits longer delayed on that ground, and that the Court, in its discretion, might properly overrule the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">But let us consider the deposition as <em>in </em>the case ; and enquire first whether it be competent evidence, and secondly what is its effect, if competent. First, is he a competent witness ? He certainly is not, unless he be rendered so by a release or assignment of his interest, and there is no evidence in the record of any such release or assignment, or that his interest which certainly once existed, has ever, in any manner, been extinguished. The only allusion to-.the subject of his interest is contained in the affidavit of Phippen before referred to, in which he says, \u201cthat the said Mallory has now no interest in them (the suits) whatever, his whole interest having been long since transferred to this affiant\u201d &amp;c. But this is certainly not sufficient to disprove his interest. Secondly, suppose that he is a competent witness, what is the effect of his evidence ? It might be supposed to be unnecessary to answer this question; supposing the witness to be incompetent, as he undoubtedly is, on the record as it now stands. But it is to be remembered that the deposition of Mallory was not filed, and the exception to the competency of the witness taken, until after the dismission of the bill of Mallory &amp; Phippen. Mallory may in fact have no interest in the controversy, as is stated in the affidavit of Phippen before mentioned; and the fact that he has none, may have been, or may yet be, proved in the suit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>schedule creditors, which is still pending in the Court below. In this view of the case it becomes important to answer the question as to the effect of Mallory\u2019s evidence, supposing him to be competent; and I will therefore now proceed to do so. He testifies under very unfavourable circumstances. In 1837 when the deed was executed and the transactions connected with it were all fresh, a full and specific detail of them was made in the bill of the schedule creditors, and the answer of Mieure to the bill of Mallory &amp; Phippen, and the conduct of Mallory was thereby deeply implicated. He never answered the charges made against him; and never gave his deposition in the suits until June 1843, six years after the suits were instituted; when his deposition was taken in Missouri. The deposition is equivocal and unsatisfactory; and under the circumstances can have little weight against the testimony of a witness testifying against his interest and at a time when the transaction to which the testimony relates were all fresh in the memory of the witness. But admit the statement of Mallory to be strictly and literally true; and what does it shew? \u201cI recollect\u201d says the witness, \u201c that in the month of June 1837 I went in company with Thomas Mieure from the Bank of Virginia to the Hustings court office, and then and there each of us in each other\u2019s presence, signed the deed made by Durham, as I before referred to ; and the said Mieure remarked at the same time that he should not avail himself of its benefits to the exclusion of other creditors, but merely signed it so as to make the same binding on the said Durham. <em>I did not give my assent to that or any other remark which went to shew that I signed it for the same </em>purpose.\u201d But did he express his dissent to that remark of Mieure ? He does not say that he did, as he certainly would have said, had the fact been so. Then when the remark was made by Mieure, Mallory according to his own admission was silent: And his silence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>either designed to give consent, or to induce Mieure to believe that he consented, and prevent him from informing the other creditors. For Mallory must have known ha(j given the slightest intimation of dissent ]\\/[jeure would have at once informed the other creditors, so that they might by signing the deed in time, defeat the object of Mallory and accomplish that of Mieure. If the silence of Mallory was designed to give consent, then Mallory &amp; Phippen are bound by such consent. If it was designed to deceive Mieure, it was a fraud which can give Mallory &amp; Phippen no advantage over the other creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">If therefore the case stood alone upon the statement of Mallory, that statement would be fatal to the pretensions of Mallory &amp; Phippen to the whole of the trust fund in exclusion of the schedule creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The great difficulty I have had in this case, has been in determining whether Mallory &amp; Phippen should be allowed to participate at all in the distribution of the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">In attempting to secure to themselves the benefit of the deed of trust in exclusion of the schedule creditors, they attempted to perpetrate a fraud. They came into a Court of equity with unclean hands; and one of the established maxims of that Court required it, I think, to dismiss their bill; \u201cfor the Court will never assist a wrong doer in effectuating his wrongful and illegal purpose.\u201d 1 Story\u2019s Equ. Jur. \u00a7 64, e. But it must be remembered that the schedule creditors also came into a Court of equity; and though they came in with clean hands, yet they came asking equity. And another maxim of the Court, one which, of all others, it perhaps most delights to enforce, certainly most often enforces, declares that \u201c he who asks equity must do equity.\u201d Then the question is, Is there any equity which these schedule creditors should be required to do to the accepting creditors, as the price of that equity which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>demanded by the former ? I think there is. The deed of trust was not in itself fraudulent; and was accepted by Mieure, if not Mallory also, with the understanding that it sh8uld enure to the benefit of all the creditors. They seem therefore to have acquired a legal advantage, and to have some equity. And the schedule creditors cannot deprive them of that legal advantage without the aid of a Court of equity; and cannot obtain that aid without doing equity. But what is the measure of that equity ? Certainly not the payment of the whole of the claims of the accepting creditors; for that would exhaust the whole trust subject, and be against the understanding with which the deed was accepted, besides giving effect to the unlawful purpose to which Mallory &amp; Phippen afterwards sought to pervert their acceptance of the deed. The answer to the question is given by another maxim of the Court, that \u201c equality is equity;\u201d or, as it is sometimes expressed, \u201cequity delighteth in equality.\u201d 1 Story's Equ. Jur. \u00a7 64, f. The application of this maxim to the case will carry into effect the understanding with which the deed was accepted, and will do equal justice to all the creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">But a question still remains to be answered, and that is, whether the creditors shall be required to release their debtor Durham from all further claim on account of the debts due them after the fund aforesaid shall have been exhausted in the payment of said debts, according to a provision to that effect in the deed ? With all deference for the opinions of those of my brethren who differ in opinion with me on this question, I think the creditors should not be so required. To require them to do so, would be to give effect to the deed against the express agreement of all the creditors that it should be <em>ineffectual; </em>would be to take away from the schedule creditors rights acquired by legal diligence, without any necessity whatever for so doing. All that the accepting creditors can require is, to be allowed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>participate <em>pro rata </em>in the distribution of the fund. When that is accorded to them, why should any other terms be imposed on the schedule creditors? Why sj10u^ tiley be required to release the debtor ? The ^epting creditors will not be benefitted by the release of the debtor. Their interest is the other way. The schedule creditors ask no equity against the debtor: against him their rights both at law and in equity are complete. He not only has no equity, but demands no equity in the case. He is a defendant in both of the bills, and answers neither of them. According to the pretensions of Mallory &amp; Phippen, they and Mieure would get the whole trust fund and release the debtor, while the entire claims of the schedule creditors would be left unsatisfied and liable to be enforced against him. According to the pretensions of the schedule creditors they would get the whole trust fund, leaving the balance of their claims, and the entire claims of the accepting creditors, or at least of Mallory &amp; Phippen, unsatisfied and liable to be enforced against the debtor. In this conflict of pretensions the debtor has no legal or equitable interest, and claims none. In his deposition he maintains the pretensions of the schedule creditors, which leave him bound for the entire amount of the claims against him after applying the trust fund to their payment. The only question is whether the schedule creditors should get all under their execution liens, or allow the accepting creditors to participate with them. These two classes of creditors are alone interested in the solution of this question. It is a matter of indifference to the debtor whether the balance due by him after the application of the trust fund be due to one class or other of his creditors. Why then should a release be required of the creditors ? Why should this measure of relief be forced upon a debtor not seeking it ? Not entitled to it according to his own evidence in the case ? I am for giving no effect whatever to the deed of trust except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>to the extent of affording an opportunity to a Court of equity for the application of its favourite maxims, that <em>\u201c </em>he who asks equity must do equity,\u201d and \u201c equality is equity,\u201d and it is with great difficulty that I go even to that extent in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">The Court below in dismissing the bill of Mallory &amp; Phippen did not intend to decide that they were not entitled to participate in the distribution of the fund, but reserved that question for future decision in the suit of the schedule creditors. In that suit, to which all the parties to this suit are defendants, the fund can, and ought I think, to be apportioned <em>pro rata </em>among all the creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">I am for affirming the decree.</p>\n<author id=\"b499-12\">Daniel, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AJh\">I have not been able to discover anything on the face of the deed out of which this controversy has arisen, or in the history of the case, from which to draw the conclusions that the said deed is fraudulent in fact or in law. The right of a debtor, in making a deed of trust upon all of his estate for the benefit of his creditors, to insert in the deed the condition that all who should accept its provisions should release him from all further demand on account of the debts secured, was recognized by this Court in the case of <em>Skipwith's ex'or </em>v. Cunningham, 8 Leigh 271; and reason and authority are there furnished for the distinction made between the conveyance <em>of the whole </em>and the conveyance of <em>part </em>only of the debtor\u2019s property upon such condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">There is, I think, nothing in the case from which to infer that the deed made by Durham originated in any purpose or design to conceal from his creditors or secure to himself any portion of his property. It is true that the schedule rendered by him on taking the oath of an insolvent debtor, contains a list of small debts due to him, and a few articles of personal property of trifling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>value not mentioned in his deed. There is no proof however that these debts existed, or that he owned these articles of property at the date of the deed. \u25a0\u00a3 suc]1 proof existed, or the probability of the existence of the fact is to be inferred from the short space of time that elapsed between the date of the deed and the time of surrendering the schedule, it would, in the absence of all other evidence of fraud, and in view of the inconsiderable value of the subjects in question, be harsh, I think, to refer the failure to embrace them in the deed to any dishonest purpose on the part of the grantor. The charitable and fair presumption is, that he omitted them from forgetfulness, if indeed he was the owner of them when he made the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"ANh\">The deed may therefore be justly treated as one dthe whole of the debtor\u2019s property to the demans of his creditors, and the objection made to the qdiidition which it imposes on the creditors, is answered by the decision of this Court in the case above cited, -^phe deed is, I think, unassailable on this ground or on any other so far as the grantor is concerned; and the Circuit court erred in dismissing the plaintiif\u2019s bill <em>on the ground that the deed was fraudulent and void. </em>The conduct of the plaintiffs has however been such as, in my opinion, to debar them of all claim to the interference of a Court of equity to enforce, at their suit, any right which they acquired by virtue of their having signed and accepted the deed within the time prescribed. They and Mieure only of the creditors having executed the deed, stand according to its provisions, as preferred creditors, and entitled to appropriate the whole of the trust fund, if necessary, to the satisfaction of their debts. The testimony taken in the suit of Stevens and the other schedule creditors, however, discloses the fact that the deed was signed by Mieure, and by Mallory, in the name of Phippen &amp; Mallory, with the express understanding that the deed should enure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>the benefit of all the creditors as fully as if each of the others had also signed the deed. Phippen &amp; Mallory now repudiate this understanding, and avail themselves of their position to claim for themselves and Mieure the whole of the trust fund to the exclusion of the other creditors. This conduct, taken in connection with the fact disclosed in the testimony of Mieure, that Mallory had proposed to him that they should sign the deed and claim the benefit of it to the exclusion of the other creditors; and only consented to the understanding above mentioned upon being warned by Mieure, that if he did not the other creditors should be notified of his course, and thus have an opportunity also of signing the deed, furnishes, I think, sufficient proof that the use now sought to be made of the deed by Mallorwas one contemplated by him at the time he b party to it. Such being the origin and nature claim, Phippen &amp; Mallory, as plaintiffs in a equity, were, in my opinion, entitled to no aid whatever; and the Chancellor, for the reason stated, did right, I think, in dismissing their bill, ther their position as defendants in the suit brought by the schedule creditors will so far avail them as to give them the right to insist that they shall not be compelled to yield their place in the deed, except on the condition of being allowed to receive, according to the understanding with Mieure, their <em>pro rata </em>share of the fund, is a question reserved by the Chancellor for a future adjudication, which I do not wish to anticipate by any expression of opinion further than what has been rendered necessary in passing upon their rights in their own suit. As yet no step has been taken in either branch of the proceedings of which the appellants have, in my opinion, any right to complain; and I am for affirming the decree.</p>\n<author id=\"A_U-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AHjs\">This is an appeal from a joint decree, rendered in two suits embracing the same subject and involving the same controversy, and heard together objection: and the appeal has therefore brought 11P causes for adjudication here. In one of them, that first instituted, Mallory &amp; Phippen are the plaintiffs ; and in consequence of the omission as defendants of all the creditors secured by the trust deed in question, except Mieure, the merits of the controversy are not fully developed in that suit. But in the other, brought by nearly all the creditors secured by the deed very shortly after the first, the merits of the controversy have been fully developed, by the pleadings, proceedings and proofs, between the proper parties. It is not to be supposed for a moment that it would be proper, from separate and unconnected views of the two cases, to render a decree repugnant and conflicting in itself in regard to the rights of the parties and the relief consequent thereupon. We must therefore, of necessity, look in the first place to the suit in which the merits have been fully developed, for the consideration and determination thereof, and the result will then designate the disposition to be made of the other case.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">In Virginia the principle is established that a deed of trust made by a debtor conveying his property for the security of creditors, which is in all other respects fair and <em>bona fide, </em>is not to be treated as fraudulent because it imposes upon the creditors intended to be secured the condition of releasing to the grantor so much of their respective demands as may remain unsatisfied after the application thereto of the proceeds of the trust subject, and requires of them their acceptance of the provisions of the deed within a given time. <em>Skipwith\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>8 Leigh 271. The effect of such a condition is to give the whole benefit of the trust to the creditors who comply with' it, to the exclusion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>those who fail to do so within the prescribed period. It has somewhat the nature of a forfeiture, and there ought to be perfect fairness and good faith on the part of the creditors seeking to avail themselves of it. If therefore some of the creditors, with the design of ex-eluding the rest, resort to false representations or other deceptive arts, by which the latter are surprised or deluded, and so prevented from acceding to the terms proposed in the deed, such misconduct furnishes a proper ground for relief in a Court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">I think it appears from the record, that by common understanding and agreement amongst the creditors, including the defendants Mallory &amp; Phippen, it was determined, in consequence of apprehensions entertained in respect to the validity of the deed, that none of them would become parties to the instrument, but that the same should be suffered to become inoperative, by their failure to affix their signatures within the prescribed period of thirty days; that in conformity with this understanding and agreement the deed was not signed by any of the creditors, with the exception of Mallory &amp; Phippen, and the defendant Mieure; that within a day or. two before the expiration of the time limited, Mallory and Mieure went together to the clerk\u2019s office where the deed was deposited and recorded, and then and there signed the same, the latter individually, and the former for himself and his partner Phippen; that Mieure acted for the honest purpose of preserving to the creditors in general intended to be secured by the deed the benefit of its provisions, by admitting them to a participation therein; and Mallory for the dishonest purpose, and with the preconceived design, of taking the other creditors by surprise, excl uding them from all resort to the property, and appropriating it to the satisfaction of the debt due to himself and partner; and that Mallory accomplished his purpose by taking advantage of the general delusion and general expectation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the creditors to which he had contributed, by lying by . , , until it was too late to warn the other creditors, unless by the vigilance and diligence of Mieure; and by quie).jng tjje jatt01.; (wh0 had indignantly rejected a propos^on t0 become his confederate, and threatened to rouse the other creditors,) by consenting to concur with \u25a0him in admitting them to participation in the benefits of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">These facts, I think, are established by the deposition of Mieure, of whose competency there can be no doubt, his evidence being directly against his own pecuniary interest, which, like that of Mallory, is to exclude the other creditors from all participation in the trust subject. The testimony of Mieure is strongly corroborated and sustained by the deposition of Durham, if the latter be a competent witness, which is a question of some difficulty, from the peculiar nature of the case. It is a question which I do not deem it necessary to consider, -and I shall therefore not rely upon the evidence of Durham, but treat Mieure as the only witness for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The credibility of Mieure is quite obvious, and the weight of his testimony is not impaired by the rule of evidence that requires a responsive answer, negativing allegations of the bill to be overcome by two witnesses, or one witness and corroborating circumstances. The rule is not applicable to a case like this, in which the respondent does not speak from his own personal knowledge. The answer though purporting to be that of Mallory &amp; Phippen, is in fact the answer of Phippen alone; and was sworn to and filed by him only, and not by Mallory, against whom the bill is taken for confessed. It is a sweeping answer putting in issue by denial general allegations of the bill, but evading the details therein set forth in regard to the misconduct of Mallory, as to which the respondent Phippen knew nothing personally, though seeking to avail himself of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>it, and in regard to which he does not undertake to express any knowledge or even belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">The veracious testimony of Mieure is therefore sufficient in itself, and I need not even refer to the circumstances of the case by which it is corroborated. In regard to the deposition of Mallory, one of the plaintiffs, filed after the rendition of the decree, if the matter of it were entitled to any weight, it is so obviously irregular and incompetent, that in my view of the case it would be a waste of words to make any remarks upon if.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">It seems to me clear that the plaintiffs are entitled to relief within the scope of the allegations of their bill, but not to that specifically designated in the bill, which seeks to set aside the deed of trust altogether, and enforce their supposed rights as schedule creditors subsequently acquired when Durham took the oath of insolvency. But that relief would, I think, be improper, the sound objection being not to the validity but the abuse of the deed, which was regularly accepted by both Mieure and Mallory, and avowedly with the view of admitting the other trust creditors into participation with them of its benefits. The purpose of Mieure was <em>bona </em>fide, and though that of Mallory was not so, it may be treated as if it had been; and it cannot be doubted that it was competent for them to waive any exclusive advantage to themselves, and constitute themselves trustees for the other creditors intended to be secured. To abrogate the deed would be wrong and injurious in regard to some of the trust creditors, who were not also schedule creditors, including Mallory &amp;. Phippen, and against them the plaintiffs are entitled to relief only upon the condition of doing equity, according to the well established rule which operates in favour of wrong doers, however iniquitous and fraudulent their conduct may have been. It would be improper also in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>respect to Durham, against whom the trust ought to be carried out upon the prescribed condition of his being released from the demands of the creditors so far as unsat-g\u00a3e\u00bf ky application of the trust subject.</p>\n<p id=\"A2d\">Mallory &amp; Phippen, for the reasons already stated, are not 'aggrieved by so much of the Chancellor\u2019s decree as dismisses their bill with costs, that being the legitimate consequence of a decision against them upon the merits in the other suit, in which any equities on their part are reserved for the final decree, by which complete justice may be done all round amongst the parties. It is true the reason for dismissing the bill of Mallory &amp;&gt; Phippen is stated to be that the deed of trust is fraudulent and void; but the presumption is that the Chancellor had in mind the fraudulent operation sought to be given to the deed, and that he did not mean to treat the provisions of the deed as nought, directly in the teeth of the express decision of this Court in the case of <em>Skipwith\u2019s ex'or </em>v. <em>Cunningham. </em>And however this may be, the decree is merely interlocutory, with the proper reservation, and we are not to anticipate that it will be carried out by the final decree upon erroneous principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">I think there is no error in the decree to the prejudice of the appellants, and that it ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b506-6\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A6W\">The case of <em>Skipwith </em>v. <em>Cunningham </em>has affirmed the right of the debtor conveying all his property for the benefit of his creditors, to exact a general release from the creditors accepting the provisions of the deed, as the condition on which they shall participate in the fund provided. The deed in this case cannot be assailed on that ground; nor is there any evidence of actual fraud in its execution. The evidence however, I think, shews that there was an understanding on the part of the creditors, including the appellants, that the proceeds of the property embraced in the trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>should be applied to the payment of all the debts named in the deed in the same manner as if all had signed it. The appellants therefore have been guilty of the fraudulent attempt to acquire an unfair advantage over the other creditors, in the effort to exclude them from the benefits of the deed. Still it seems to me the Court below erred in dismissing the bill filed by the appellants to enforce the execution of the deed. Though the case came on for hearing together with the bill filed by the judgment creditors to impeach the deed for fraud, there was no necessary connection between the causes. The decree dismissing the bill is a final adjudication against the appellants. Mallory &amp; Phippen are not judgment creditors. Their whole claim to satisfaction of their debt, or any part of it, out of this property, rests upon the deed, and this the Court by its decree declares to be fraudulent and void, and therefore dismisses the bill. If this decree stands, of what avail is the instruction of the Court in the case of the creditors directing the commissioner to make alternative apportionments of the fund amongst the creditors, one embracing, the other excluding the debt of Mallory &amp; Phippen ? Resting as they must do on the deed alone, and that being adjudged in so many words to be fraudulent and void, it is difficult to perceive how they can be let in to participate in the fund. The general creditors claim, not under but against the deed <em>; </em>they assert their legal lien; and when by the decree in the case of the appellants the deed is put out of the way as utterly void, the property must of necessity be distributed amongst the creditors at whose suit the debtor has taken the insolvent oath. Considering the deed as valid, and that the conduct of the appellants in asserting an exclusive claim to the benefits of it, though improper as it regards the other creditors, could not avoid the deed or do away with the effect of an acceptance of its provisions, it only remained for the Court to carry into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>execution the agreement and understanding of the parties <em>i </em>and to apply the proceeds to the debts named, in the same way as if the creditors had signed it. If they ka(j s|gtle\u00bf they would have released their debtor for the residue of their debts. This has been done by Mallory &amp; Phippen.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The debtor having made a fair dedication of his property upon terms which the law justified him in imposing, has a right to insist upon a release from all who claim to participate. And the fund should have been divided between the creditors who have signed and such of those named in the deed as may agree to the terms prescribed. Such a distribution of the trust fund can only be made in the suit instituted by Mallory &amp; Phippen to execute the trust; and would be totally inconsistent with the case made by the general creditors, who rely on their legal lien alone; and repudiate the deed. And it would present a most anomalous case, were the Court, after a solemn decree declaring the deed fraudulent and void in a suit brought to enforce it, to proceed in a suit brought to impeach it, to distribute the trust fund as though the deed were a valid security.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The rule that the party to entitle himself to relief must appear with clean hands, cannot be applied to this case without injustice to others as well as the appellants, the plaintiffs in the Court below. The deed if valid divested the debtor of his property and vested it in the trustee for the benefit of the creditors who signed within the period prescribed. The signatures of Mallory &amp; Phippen and Mieure imparted vitality to the deed ; and the fund eould only be administered by the trustee or under the direction of a Court of equity. When therefore the trustee declined to act, a Court of equity was constrained upon the application of any party interested to interpose and protect the fund. And its jurisdiction having once attached it must go on to dispose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the subject according to the rights of the parties. The bill was not filed to set up a fraudulent deed, that is conceded to be good and valid ; the claim therefore as preferred by the bill was proper, and the objection goes, not to the validity of the deed, but to the extent of the rights of the creditors named, as modified by the understanding and agreement amongst them. This therefore is nothing more than the ordinary case of a party who has rights proper to be enforced in a Court of equity, claiming more than the proof shews him entitled to. The Court in such cases may, in the exercise of its discretion, subject the party to costs ; but it cannot refuse relief of some kind. This will appear more clearly if the case is viewed by itself and without reference to the bill filed by the creditors after the institution of the suit by Mallory &amp; Phippen. Could the Court if that were the sole case pending, have dismissed the bill after its jurisdiction had attached and it had actually taken possession of the trust fund ? It must of necessity go on to dispose of the fund ; if the deed is sustained it could not be restored to the debtor for he had parted with all right to it. Nor would it be proper to place it in the hands of the trustee, even if as in this case he had not declined to act. Nothing would remain for the Court to do but to enquire into the rights of the parties and to distribute the fund accordingly. A dismissal of the bill would have been erroneous in the case supposed, and there does not seem to be any distinction between that and the case before us. But in this case the error is aggravated by the decree declaring the deed fraudulent and void; thus precluding the Court from ever treating it as a valid subsisting security for any purpose as between these parties, in any subsequent proceeding. I think the decree should be reversed, and the cause remanded with instructions to hear both causes together and to distribute the trust fund amongst <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>the creditors who have signed the deed, and such others of the creditors named therein as may elect to come in and release the debtor according to the terms of the , _ deed.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ0\">But the other Judges differ from me, and the decree is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
