Wood. </em>That for this land he was to pay <em>Edward Wood </em>500 dollars in May or June 1825, 350 dollars in August 1825, and five subsequent instalments of 380 dollars each, making in all 2750 dollars; and <em>Wood </em>was to make him an undoubted title in fee simple to the land, as would appear by a title bond executed by <em>Wood, </em>and exhibited with the bill. That complainant\u2019s object in making the purchase was <em>to </em>settle some of his children on the land, and he would not have purchased, if he had entertained any suspicions of the title. That previous to the contract with <em>Wood, </em>complainant had heard some rumours that <em>Wood\u2019s </em>vendor, a certain <em>Brown Jenks, </em>had not a sufficient title; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>but at the time of the purchase, <em>Wood </em>assured the complainant that <em>Jen'ks </em>had procured an undeniable title; and complainant, having great reliance on the integrity and fair dealing of Wood, made no examination into the title, and had. since paid the two sums of 500 dollars and 350 dollars, and one of the bonds for 380 dollars. That <em>Wood </em>had at various times afterwards repeated his assurances that the title was unquestionable, and had promised to furnish the evidence of it, but had never done so. That in the fall of <em>1828, Wood </em>sent to complainant a deed for the land (which was exhibited with the <em>bill); </em>but complainant\u2019s doubts'of the sufficiency of the title being now very strong, lie never accepted that deed, or spread it on the record as evidence of title; and be bad strong reason to believe that an insufficient title had been knowingly and fraudulently imposed on him. That <em>Wood </em>had lately avowed that himself and <em>JenTcs </em>were, and had always been, in partnership in selling the lo.nds of the <em>Sherwood </em>survey. That according to information derived from <em>Wood </em>himself, the only title papers which <em>Jen'ks </em>had for the land sold to complainant, were a deed from <em>Robert Pend\u00ed </em>and wife (exhibited with the bill) and a similar deed from <em>Joseph Meredith </em>and wife, each conveying to <em>Jen'ks </em>an undivided seventh of a tract of 18,000 acres, which, from anything in those deeds, was not ascertained to be part of the <em>Sherwood </em>survey at all; and if it should turn out to be in fact a part of that survey, yet it did not appear what part it was. That the deeds from <em>Pend\u00ed </em>and <em>Meredith </em>had never been properly authenticated and recorded, and the right of dower of mrs. <em>Pencil </em>had never been properly relinquished. That although these deeds were the only conveyances which <em>Jen'ks </em>and <em>Wood </em>had for land in the <em>Sherwood </em>tract, yet they had surveyed the whole tract of 104,000 acres (whereof they shewed to complainant a plat, at the time he was in treaty for the land sold to him) and they had offered to sell to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>complainant any part of the said <em>Sherwood </em>tract, except ,1 , \u201e , \u201e ,,, such parts of lots number 1. and 2. as had been previously sold. That the tract of 18,000 acres, of which two sevenths only were conveyed by <em>Pencil </em>and <em>Meredit.h, </em>had never, as complainant believed, been divided : that by an order, purporting to be made at the instance of the heirs of <em>Joseph Pencil </em>deceased, a division had indeed been directed by the county court of <em>Randolph, </em>but that order did' not appear to have ever been executed, and complainant had heard of no other. That as the parties who sold to <em>Jenks </em>claimed as devisees of <em>Joseph Pencil </em>deceased, to whom the land was patented, complainant was advised that the will, unless executed according to the statute of <em>Virginia, </em>could convey no title to the land devised; and as it was executed in another state, he required proof that the forms necessary to constitute a good devise of <em>Virginia </em>lands had been <em>observed; </em>he had never seen the will, and believed it had never been recorded in this state. That complainant, trusting to <em>Wood\u2019s </em>assurances, had expended large sums in improving the land sold him ; but he now believed that he had been deceived by <em>Wood, </em>and that no title could be made for the land. That <em>Wood </em>had transferred two of the bonds for the purchase money to <em>George Seiveley, </em>who had instituted suits thereon against complainant, and recovered judgments, which he was threatening to enforce by execution. Wherefore the bill prayed that <em>Seiveley, Wood, Jenks </em>and the devisees of <em>Joseph Pencil </em>deceased might be made parties thereto: that <em>Seiveley </em>might be injoined from proceeding on his judgments: that <em>Jenks </em>and <em>Wood </em>might say whether they were partners in the sale of the land purchased by complainant, and what title they had thereto; whether the tract of 18,000 acres were part of the survey of 104,000 acres, and if it were, ' where it was situated; and v/hetber they and each of them had not offered to sell to complainant and others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>any part of the tract of 104,000 acres: that <em>Wood </em>might be decreed to make a good title to complainant for the land sold him ; and if he could not do so, then that the contract might be rescinded, the purchase money refunded with interest, and <em>Wood </em>compelled to pay the complainant for his improvements: and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-7\">The title bond referred to in the bill, and therewith exhibited, was dated the 3d day o,f August 1S25. <em>Wood </em>thereby bound himself to <em>Beale </em>in the penalty of 5500 dollars, with condition reciting that he had sold to <em>Beale </em>a tract of land in <em>Pocahontas </em>county, designated by the number 5. on the plat of a survey of 104,000 acres known as the <em>Sherwood </em>survey; the land sold being only the land in lot number 5. which lay south of the land of <em>James M. Wood, </em>and not including the land lying within the'lines of <em>Warwick Gateivood\u2019s </em>survey: and providing that if <em>Wood, </em>when required, should make a good and sufficient title in fee simple to the said <em>Beale, </em>his heirs or assigns, then the obligation to be void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-9\">The deed executed by <em>Wood </em>to <em>Beale </em>in pursuance of the foregoing bond, was a conveyance from <em>Edward Wood </em>and <em>Sarah </em>If s wife, dated the 25th of November 1S2S, whereby the said <em>Wood </em>and wife, in consideration of 2750 dollars expressed to be paid them by <em>Beale, </em>granted, bargained and sold to him a certain tract of land in lot number 5. in the <em>Sherwood </em>survey, particularly described in the deed by metes and bounds, and appearing, from that description, to adjoin the land of <em>James M. Wood. </em>This tract was stated in the deed to contain 2000 acres more or less; and all the land within the lines of <em>Warwick Gatewood\u2019s </em>survey, on which ho then resided, was expressly excepted out of the conveyance. The deed further stated that the land thereby granted was surveyed in the name of <em>Joseph Pencil </em>in the year 1786, and patented to him in 1787; and was conveyed, by the heirs of <em>Pencil, </em>to <em>Brown Jenks, </em>who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>conveyed it to <em>Wood; </em>as would more fully appear by examining the offices of <em>Pocahontas </em>and <em>Randolph </em>counties, and the register\u2019s office at <em>Richmond. Wood </em>and wife covenanted with <em>Beale, </em>and his heirs and assigns, to warrant and defend the land against all and every person or persons whatsoever, claiming or to claim the same. The privy examination and acknowledgment of <em>Sarah Wood, </em>and the acknowledgment of <em>Edward Wood, </em>were duly certified by two justices of the peace.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b682-4\">The deed from <em>Robert Penell </em>and wife to <em>Brown denies, </em>exhibited wilh the bill, was a conveyance dated the 25th of April 1825, whereby the said <em>Penell </em>and wife, of <em>Delaware </em>county in the state of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>in consideration of 1000 dollars expressed to be paid them by <em>Jenhs, </em>bargained, sold and conveyed to him their right, title and interest (being one equal undivided seventh part) of and in a tract of land situate in <em>Randolph </em>county in <em>Virginia, </em>supposed to contain 18,680 acres, which <em>Joseph Penell, </em>who in his <em>lifetime was </em>seized thereof, devised by his last will to his sons <em>Robert </em>and <em>Joseph Penell, </em>his son in law <em>Joseph Meredith, </em>and his grandsons <em>Penell Palmer, Penell Hammon, Penell Churchman </em>and <em>Leiois Penell, </em>to be divided among them part and share alike. This deed contained only a special warranty against <em>Robert Penell </em>and his heirs, and persons' claiming by, from or under him or them. The acknowledgment of <em>Robert Pencil </em>and his wife was certified by a single justice of the peace of the said county of <em>Delaware; </em>and the certificate respecting mrs. <em>Pencil's </em>acknowledgment was not conformable in other respects to the requisitions of the <em>Virginia </em>statute of conveyances. But the d.eed appeared, by the certificate of the clerk of <em>Randolph </em>county court, to have been recorded in that court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b682-5\">The deed from <em>Joseph Meredith </em>and wife to <em>Brown Jenhs, </em>referred to in the bill, though not exhibited therewith, was afterwards filed in the cause. It was in all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>respects similar to the deed from <em>Robert Penell </em>and wife, \u25a0** conveying an \u25a0undivided seventh o\u00ed the tract oi 18,680 acres, and exhibiting the same defects in the certificate of acknowledgment as appeared in the other deed, This deed also was recorded in <em>Randolph </em>county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b683-6\">With the bill the complainant also exhibited an order of the county court of <em>Randolph, </em>dated in June 182-5, purporting to be made on the motion of <em>Robert Penell </em>and others, the heirs of <em>Joseph Penell </em>senior deceased, by which the court appointed <em>Thomas O. Williams </em>and three others commissioners to make partition of the lands owned in <em>Randolph </em>county by the said heirs of <em>Joseph Penell </em>senior, and report the same to the court. No report appeared to have been made under this order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b683-7\">The injunction prayed in the bill was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b683-8\"><em>Seiveley </em>put in an answer to the bill, in which he disclaimed ail knowledge of the contract between the complainant and <em>Wood, </em>and alleged that he had acquired the bonds whereon his judgments were obtained against the complainant, for a valuable consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b683-9\"><em>Jenks </em>answered, that the county court of <em>Randolph </em>having admitted the deeds of <em>Robert Penell </em>and <em>Meredith </em>to record, he had not been aware of any defect in the relinquishment of dower on the part of mrs. <em>Penell or </em>mrs. <em>Meredith, </em>and was confident that if any such defect existed, there would bo no difficulty in procuring relinquishments in due form. That respondent had not been aware, until recently, of the necessity of having the will of <em>Joseph Penell </em>senior recorded in <em>Virginia; </em>but this had been lately done. That the commissioners appointed by the county court of <em>Randolph </em>to divide the lands devised by the said will, having failed to report the division which they made, respondent afterwards proceeded in the same court, in chancery, against the heirs of <em>Joseph Pend\u00ed </em>senior, and procured other commissioners to be appointed, who had since reported, and assigned to respondent the land which he sold to his co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>defendant <em>Wood, </em>and which was subsequently sold by <em>Wood </em>to the plaintiff; which land, was a part of the 18,000 acre tract. That the plaintiff had always had peaceable possession of the land sold him, and was in no danger of being disturbed. RespondenTdenied that there was any partnership between himself and his co-defendant <em>Wood </em>in the sale of lands in the <em>Sherwood </em>survey, or that he had ever pretended to own the whole of those lands, or offered to sell the whole to the plaintiff or any other person.' He denied that the plaintiff was induced to purchase the land which he actually bought from <em>Wood, </em>by any <em>representations </em>of <em>Wood </em>respecting the title. On the contrary, he alleged that the plaintiff was anxious to purchase that very land from respondent, while the negotiation between the respondent and <em>Wood </em>was pending, and made a proposition to respondent to purchase the same on better terms than those offered by <em>Wood, </em>which proposition respondent felt himself bound to reject, and did reject. That at the period when <em>Wood </em>completed his purchase from respondent, the plaintiff accompanied him to respondent\u2019s house in <em>Randolph </em>county, and there examined the title papers, which he pronounced to be regular and correct, and thereupon advised <em>Wood </em>that there was <em>no </em>danger in making the purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b684-4\">With <em>his </em>answer, <em>Jenhs </em>exhibited the will of <em>Joseph Penell </em>senior, by which it appeared that the devise of the lands in <em>Randolph </em>county was correctly set forth in the deeds (already stated) from <em>Robert Penell </em>and <em>Joseph Meredith </em>to <em>JenJcs. </em>He also exhibited the record of his suit in the ^county court of <em>Randolph, </em>against the devisees of <em>Joseph Penell </em>senior; for partition of the lands so devised; whereby it appeared that in December 1830, a decree was made for partition, according to the provisions of the will, and the deeds from <em>Robert Penell </em>and <em>Meredith </em>to <em>JenJcs, </em>and commissioners -were appointed to make such partition and report the same to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>the court.: that in January following, the commissioners reported a division of the said lands, in which lot number 5. and another lot were assigned to <em>Jenks: </em>and that the court thereupon approved the said report., and awarded to <em>Jenks </em>possession of the lands so assigned him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b685-4\"><em>Wood </em>answered, that it was not true that the plaintiff\u2019s confidence in the title of the land he had purchased from respondent, arose from any representations made by him. He alleged that the plaintiff applied to him to purchase the land, before <em>Jenks </em>had made any deed for the same; and that the plaintiff himself accompanied the respondent when he went to meet <em>Jenks </em>and consummate lite purchase; whereupon, <em>Jenks </em>having exhibited the deeds from <em>Robert Pencil </em>and <em>Joseph </em>Meredith, and respondent having proposed to defer the business until he could, consult counsel as to the sufficiency of these papers, the plaintiff requested that the papers might be committed to him for examination, saying that he could judge of the title as well as a lawyer. That respondent, having great confidence in the judgment and intelligence of the plaintiff gave him the papers for examination; and the plaintiff having examined them, declared that the title was good, and that if respondent would sell him the land, he would consent to take <em>Jenks's </em>title directly to himself, without further enquiry. That respondent declined to sell the property at that time, but observed to plaintiff that if he considered <em>Jenks's </em>title good, respondent would close the contract, and accept a conveyance without further delay; which was accordingly done, the plaintiff aiding during the whole transaction with his advice. Respondent denied that he ever gave the plaintiff any assurance that the title was indisputable, the plaintiff being himself much better acquainted with it than respondent was. He denied that the deed executed by respondent to the plaintiff was <em>sent </em>to him, as alleged in the bill; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>on the contrary, he said that the deed was delivered to the plaintiff by the respondent, and when it was delivered, he made no objection to the deed or to the title; and therefore he denied the allegation that the plaintiff never accepted the said deed. He denied the existence of any partnership between <em>Jenks </em>and himself, or that an insufficient title had been knowingly or fraudulently imposed on the plaintiff. And as the plaintiff held respondent\u2019s deed with general warranty, and had never been disturbed in the enjoyment of the land, he insisted that he bad no right to withhold the purchase money. He further stated, that the tract of 104,000 acres was call\u00e9d the <em>Sherwood </em>survey, because <em>Sherwood </em>made it for the <em>Pencils; </em>that for his trouble in making it, a part \u25a0 -was given to him; that the residue was patented to <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Joseph Pencil, </em>the locators, separately ; that they both sold out portions in their lifetime; and that <em>Joseph Pencil </em>senior, at the time <em>of his death, </em>still owned the 18,000 acre tract, embracing the land sold to the plaintiff. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b686-5\">With his answer <em>Wood </em>exhibited a deed from <em>Jenlcs </em>and wife to him, dated the 27th of May 1825, whereby <em>Jenks </em>and wdfe, in consideration of 1000 dollars expressed to be paid them by <em>Wood, </em>conveyed to him. a tract of land in lot number 5. in the <em>She?'wood, </em>survey, containing two thousand acres more or less. The land was described in the deed by metes and bounds in the same manner as in the conveyance from <em>Wood </em>to <em>Beale; </em>and 88 acres lying on the southwest side of the tract, which were stated to belong to <em>Warwick Gatewood, </em>and to be the land on which he then lived, were expressly excepted out of the conveyance. This deed contained a general warranty on the part of <em>Jenks </em>and wdfe. The acknovdedgment of <em>Jenlcs, </em>and the privy examination and acknowledgment of his wife, W'ere duly certified by two justices of the peace, and the deed was thereupon recorded in <em>Ppcahontas </em>county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b687-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>As to the defendants other than <em>Seiveley, JenJcs </em>and <em>Wood, </em>the bill was taken for confessed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Adv\">In the progress of the cause, the defendants filed the record of anolher suit for partition, brought by <em>JenJcs </em>in the circuit superiour court of law and chancery for <em>Randolph </em>county, against, the devisees of <em>Joseph Pencil </em>senior. This suit was instituted in August 1S31. On the 26th of September 1832, the circuit court made an order appointing three commissioners to divide the lands in <em>Randolph </em>county, which were devised by the will of <em>Joseph Pencil </em>senior, between the plaintiff and defendants in the suit, assigning to the plaintiff two sevenths, the shares of <em>Robert Pencil </em>and <em>Joseph Meredith. </em>The commissioners (the same who had made the division in the suit brought by <em>JenJcs </em>in the county court of <em>Randolph) </em>accordingly reported that they had made a partition of the said lands, and had assigned lot number <em>5. </em>and another lot, to the plaintiff <em>JenJcs. </em>On the 26th of April 1833, the court-confirmed the report of the commissioners, and decreed that the plaintiff and defendants hold in severally the lands assigned to them respectively by the said report: allowing the defendants (all of whom appeared to be nonresidents) three years to shew cause against the decree. <em>Beale </em>objected to the admission of the record of this suit as evidence, 1. because he was no party therein ; 2. because it was not conclusive of the rights of the nonresident defendants ; and 8. because the suit was instituted after the commencement of <em>Beale\u2019s </em>suit against <em>JenJcs </em>and others, and in fraud of his rights.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b687-5\">It appeared that while the suit was pending, the acknowledgments of mrs. <em>Pencil </em>and mrs. <em>Meredith, </em>of the deeds executed by <em>Robert Pencil </em>and <em>Joseph Meredith </em>respectively to <em>JenJcs, </em>were taken anew' before two justices of the peace. The justices certified the privy examination and acknowdedgment of mrs. <em>Meredith, </em>in the form prescribed by the statute: but though mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number><em>Pencil's </em>privy examination and acknowledgment were also certified, it appeared from the certificate itself that her husband was at that time dead. Both these certificates were admitted to record in the court of <em>Randolph </em>county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b688-3\">Many depositions were taken and filed by the parties. Those taken on behalf of the plaintiff <em>Beale </em>appeared to be chiefly intended to prove that <em>Jenhs </em>and <em>Wood, </em>were partners in the sale of lands in the <em>Sherwood </em>sur- \u25a0 vey, that they were in possession of plats of those lands, and that they offered to sell the whole or any part which remained unsold. This court, however, considered the evidence relating to these points as unimportant in the cause. The depositions taken for the defendants proved, that <em>Beale </em>was present when <em>levies </em>and <em>Wood </em>were engaged, in May 1825, in laying off lots in the <em>Sherwood </em>survey; that he examined the deeds from <em>Robert Pencil </em>and <em>Meredith </em>to <em>Jenhs, </em>and that <em>from Jenles </em>to <em>Wood; </em>that he expressed to <em>Wood </em>his opinion that <em>Jenlcs\u2019s title </em>was a good and sufficient one; and that he had been in possession of the land purchased from <em>Wood, </em>ever since October 1825.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b688-4\">The circuit court of <em>Augusta </em>county, at the hearing of the cause on the 29th of November 1S33, decreed that the injunction be dissolved, without damages, and. that the bill be dismissed with costs. From this decree the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b688-5\">The <em>attorney general, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b688-6\"><em>Johnson, Peyton </em>and <em>Baldwin, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b688-7\">Parker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AMS\">If the appellant had not received his deed in the present case, containing a general warranty, it might somewhat vary bis equitable rights. He admits in his bill that it was sent to him soon after its date, but says he never accepted it, or spread it upon the record as evidence of his title. <em>Wood, </em>in his answer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>swears that he delivered it to the appellant, and that he made no objection to it. It is precisely such a deed as, under the title bond, <em>Wood </em>was bou,ud to make. It is dated in November 1828, and <em>Beale </em>was then in possession of the land, and had been in possession from October 1825. There is no evidence, or even averment, that he refused to accept the deed or offered to return it, or that he relinquished the possession of the land. It was near two years after he had received the deed (for the purpose, as he alleges, of examining the title) before he brought this suit; and under these circumstances, he must bo considered as accepting and holding under it. Then he is a vendee in possession under a deed with general warranty, and his title has never been questioned by a suit, either prosecuted or threatened, nor does he pretend that his warrantor is in insolvent or failing circumstances. The only ground left for entertaining him in a court of equity is that of fraudulent combination between his vendor and <em>Janies, </em>from whom <em>Wood </em>purchased. To enable a court, to relieve a vendee in possession under a deed with warranty, it must appear that the vendor knew of a defect in the title, which the purchaser had no means of discovering, and which the vendor' fraudulently suppressed. See <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>M'Leay, </em>Coop. Ch. Ca. 308. affirmed by lord <em>Eldon </em>on appeal, 2 Swanst. 287. It seems that if the defects be such as might have been discovered by a vigilant man, the purchaser has no remedy but such as his covenants afford ; for to an improvident purchaser the ancient maxim applies, <em>vigilantihus, non dormientibus, jura subveniunl. </em>The doctrine applicable to the sellers and purchasers of land, and the kind of fraud which will induce a court of equity to relieve <em>before </em>eviction, is so fully, and in my judgment so accurately, slated by the president in the opinion he is about to deliver, that it is unnecessary for me to enlarge on it. I will only refer to some of the cases and authorities sustaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>propositions I have just advanced. They are <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Allen, 2 </em>Johns. Ch. Rep. 519. <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>M\u2019Leay, </em>cited above; <em>Grantland </em>v. <em>Wight, </em>5 Munf. <em>295. Urnston </em>v. <em>Pate, </em>4 Cruise\u2019s Dig. tit. 32, ch. 25, \u00a7 90, p. 420. Sugden on Vendors, 9th London edi. 553. to the end of that section; and <em>Koger et al. </em>v. <em>Kane\u2019s adm\u2019r &amp;c. 5 </em>Leigh 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">To apply these' doctrines to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"Aiz\">If there are any defects in <em>Beale\u2019s </em>title, there is no evidence in the cause outweighing <em>Wood\u2019s </em>allegation, responsive to the bill, that he knew no more of them than <em>Beale. </em>If a partnership between <em>denies </em>and <em>Wood </em>had been established, it would avail nothing, except as a ground for inferring that <em>Wood </em>had fraudulently concealed an incumbrance or defect of title from <em>Beale. </em>\u25a0But the other proof in the cause repels this inference. It is proved, I think, beyond reasonable doubt, that on the 27th of May 1825, when <em>denies </em>convej'ed to <em>Wood, Beale </em>was present, and inspected <em>the tide deeds from Penell </em>and <em>Meredith </em>to <em>denies. </em>He therefore knew that they conveyed no land in severalty, but only two sevenths of a large tract, supposed to contain more than 18,000 acres, which the grantors derived under the will of <em>doseph Penell </em>senior. \u2018 He also knew that there was a survey and plat of this land in existence; that some attempts had been made to divide it, either with or without an order of court; that it was part of a larger survey, called by the settlers in that country the <em>Sherwood </em>survey; and that it was a particular lot in that survey, which, with certain reservations, <em>Jenks </em>undertook to convey, and did convey, to <em>Wood. </em>He saw that the deed from <em>denies </em>located the land in lot number 5. in the <em>Sherwood </em>survey; that it set out metes and bounds, called for known and ascertained corners, excepted a tract of 88 acres lying on the southwest side, belonging to <em>Warwick Gatewood, </em>the position of which he was perfectly acquainted with, and stated that the survey had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>been made by <em>Sherwood, </em>in 1787 for <em>Joseph Tend\u00ed </em>senior, ; . from two o\u00ed wnose devisees <em>JevJes </em>derived ins title. Thus <em>Beale, </em>before he bought, knew all that <em>V/ood </em>is proved to have known about ihe title, and all that is yet known. He also knew the precise location of the tract sold to him. His title bond bound <em>Wood </em>to convey to him that very tract adjoining the lands of <em>James M. Wood </em>and <em>Gatewood, </em>and it was conveyed to him in the same words as <em>Jcnks </em>conveyed to <em>Wood. </em>Soon after-wards he took possession, and has hold it ever since, without any one\u2019s asserting or threatening a claim. If he shall ever he evicted by superiour title, he has his covenant of warranty for his protection. Then what pretence has he to ask for a rescission of the contract, or that the purchase money shall be injoined ? Suppose that the partition made under the direction of the circuit superiour court is irregular, and may by possibility be set aside ; can a court of equity, upon the bare <em>possibility of eviction, </em>afford him relief? I think not; and am therefore for affirming the decree.</p>\n<author id=\"b691-7\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AsJ\">Though the cause of the appellant has been sustained with very great, ability, an attentive perusal of the record has satisfied me that there never was a plaintiff who had less <em>title </em>to come into equity. Of what does he complain ? He has in possession the identical land that he purchased. He has a deed for it, with general warranty, from a vendor whoso solvency he does not venture to question. He holds k (in point of fact at least) in severalty, without any contest for the possession. l\u00ede has enjoyed it for twelve years without paying for it. He has never been evicted, or sued or threatened with a suit, by any other claimant. His title is traced accurately from the <em>Pencils, </em>who were the owners of this portion of the <em>Sherwood </em>tract. He has offered no evidence of superiour title in another, no proof of the want of title in the <em>Pencils, </em>and no test!<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>mony to assail the right of <em>Jenks </em>as claiming under them, though he has industriously searched out whatever he supposed might suffice to throw suspicion over the title; a title which, from his relation to his vendor, it was rather his duty to strengthen and clear up than to impugn and destroy. Lastly, though he had received and retained his deed for eighteen months, he most unreasonably calls upon his vendor to investigate his title <em>ah ovo, </em>and to vindicate it against all the technical objections which ingenious and diligent counsel can suggest.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\">I am persuaded that many cases of this <em>description </em>are brought before the court, for want of a due attention to the nature and character of the relations of vendor and- vendee, and of the contracts entered into between them. I ask leave therefore to offer a few considerations on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">On entering into a treaty for the purchase of land, the engagements and responsibilities assumed 'by the respective parties are important to be understood. The purchaser may be acquainted with the title in all its details, and for the consideration of an abatement of the price, may be willing to take upon himself the hazard of all defects and faults, and to exonerate the seller from all responsibility whatever. Where this is the character of the contract, he takes a deed with special warranty only; and then, no matter what may be the weakness of the tide he procures, he must abide the issue. He can have no remedy against the vendor. The rule \u201c <em>caveat emptor\" </em>strictly applies. His agreeing to take a special warranty is an engagement to abide the hazard, and for that risque it will be intended that he has received compensation in the diminished price. Having taken no covenants for-his security, he has no, remedy at law. He has bought with his eyes open, and has taken a special warranty, which amounts to a negation of liability on the part of the vendor for any defect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>whatever. These principles prevail in equity as well as at law, with the single exception that where there is a fraudulent misrepresentation or a fraudulent conceal-merit, on the part of the vendor, of a fact <em>which the venr dee had no means of knowing, </em>the vendee may have relief, either at law by action for the deceit, or by bill in equity. For these principles, seo <em>Bree </em>v. <em>Holbech, </em>Doug. 654. 6 T. R. 606. Sugclen on Vendors 560, 564. <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>M'Leay, </em>Cooper\u2019s Ch. Ca. 308. modified on appeal, by the lord chancellor; <em>2 </em>Swanst. 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">It may happen, however, that the vendee will not take the hazard of the tillo. The vendor on his part may be willing to assure it lo a certain extent, but no farther. He may be very willing to encounter the hazard of <em>eviction, </em>talcing the chances of his title being-strengthened in its weak points by lapse of time, before a superiour title is enforced. Ho may therefore be willing to give a general warranty, which cannot be enforced until <em>eviction, </em>but not a covenant for good title which he may not have, and which covenant would of course be broken the instant it is entered into, if his title be defective. Thus, as in the case of special warranty he discharges himself of <em>all </em>responsibility, and only sells the chance of a good title, so, where he enters into a general warranty without other covenants, he makes himself only responsible for <em>eviction, </em>and secures to himself the advantage of every doubt which hung over his title being removed by lapse of time. In these cases, therefore, the vendee is confined to the covenant of general warranty. He has chosen, or at least has agreed upon, his remedy, and to that remedy he must be tied down. Jlowever bad his title, he cannot sue upon bis warranty unless he be <em>evicted; </em>and if he cannot do so at law, upon what principle can equity make the vendor liable beyond the terms of his contract ? A contract without other covenants than a warranty, is in effect an agreement between the vendor and vendee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>that the vendor is never to be responsible until the vendee is turned out by superiour title. How can equity make him responsible farther ? \u201cIt cannot mend men\u2019s bargains, though it sometimes mends their assurances.\u201d <em>pgr </em>jorcj <em>Nottingham, </em>in <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Moseley, 3 </em>Swanst. 651. It cannot do so without making a new contract for the parties, or interpolating a new and substantive principle into that already made. Accordingly it is the established principle in the courts of equity in <em>England, </em>that if the conveyance has been actually executed, the purchaser can obtain no relief against the payment of the purchase money. He must look to his covenants <em>i </em>he has contracted for his remedy, and to that remedy he must resort. He has no right, I take it, after such a purchase with warranty, to call for the title of his vendor, to sift it to the very bran, and to injoin or recover back the purchase money upon its supposed defects. See <em>Urmston </em>v. <em>Pate, </em>4 Cruise\u2019s <em>Dig. </em>tit. 32, ch. 25, \u00a7 90, p. 420. Sugden on Vendors 558. So far from it, that if he knew of the defects and did not provide against them, he is without remedy. Co. Litt. 384. Butler\u2019s note. For if there be no covenants for good title, it is, as I have said, equivalent to the declaration that the vendor is not to be responsible for <em>defect </em>of title, but only for eviction. Were it otherwise, an inducement would be held out to the vendee to hunt up defects and expose flaws in a title, which, but for his intermeddling, might in a few years have been removed and repaired t\u00a1y time : and thus he would be converted from an ally into an enemy and spy, engaged industriously in sapping the foundations of his vendor\u2019s title, instead of supporting and strengthening it, as he is bound to do upon every principle of equity and good faith. Possessed of the title papers, and (if the vendor has acted fairly) possessed also of all his secrets; fully informed of all the weak points of the title, he makes the confidence reposed in him the means of betrayal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>and seeks to get rid of a disadvantageous bargain by _ , \u00bb treachery towards one whom the law considers as conjunct in interest with himself, and from' whom it rigorously enforces a disclosure of all the facts in relation to the subject of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Such, I take it, are the considerations, in part, which sustain the rule of the courts of <em>England. </em>To that rule there has recently been an admitted exception. Where the seller is aware of a fact from which a defect of title arises, and <em>which the vendee had no means of knowing, </em>the purchaser may either maintain an action at law for the deceit, or have a rescission of the contract itself, by an appeal to a court of equity. Such is the principle laid down in <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>M'Leay, </em>Cooper\u2019s Ch. Ca. 308. as modified by lord <em>Eldon </em>on appeal in the same case, 2 Swanst. 287. See also Sugden\u2019s Vend. 565. Co. Litt. 384. a. Butler\u2019s note, <em>adfmem. </em>The same principle has been followed in the courts of <em>New York, Abbott </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>2 Johns. Ch. Rep. 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">With us it cannot be denied that the practice has been more lax. But even with us,-relief is only given to a purchaser who has obtained his deed, where there has been an actual eviction, or where a suit is depending or threatened, or where the vendee placing himself in the attitude of the superiour claimant, can shew a clear outstanding title or incumbrance. <em>Ralston </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>3 Rand. 44. <em>Yancey </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 390. <em>Grantland </em>v. <em>Wight, </em>5 Munf. 295. <em>Koger et al. </em>v. <em>Kane's adm'r &amp;c. </em>5 Leigh 606. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>1 Leigh 125, 138. See, among the <em>New York </em>cases, <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>2 Johns. Ch. Rep. 519. <em>Gouverneur </em>v. <em>Elmendorf, </em>5 Id. 79. See also Id. 29. A still greater liberality has prevailed, it is true, in injoining proceedings under deeds of trust; but this rests upon peculiar principles. <em>Gay </em>v. <em>Hancock et al. </em>1 Rand. 72. <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Tidball, </em>Gilmer <em>130. </em>The distinction is adverted to by judge <em>Cabell in Miller </em>v. <em>Argyle's ex'or, 5 </em>Leigh 460. But notwithstand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>ihg these relaxations, I am aware of no case in which . * the rights of the party have been extended in equity beyond his covenants. Until the contract is complete indeed by the execution of deeds, it is fully within the power of the court, which will not decree execution where it would be unreasonable, or where the title is essentially defective. But after a deed has been made and accepted, though our courts have given relief in <em>anticipation </em>of an eviction which is impending, accompanied by the danger of insolvency, they have never gone one jot beyond the covenants, except where the fraud of the vendor gives rise to a distinct cause of action independent of the covenants. Although, therefore, we may injoin a judgment or sale on the ground that the creditor is proceeding under his deed of trust, or that a suit.is threatened and the vendor is in declining circumstances, yet we can never interfere unless the seller has made himself, by some covenant, responsible for the defect complained of, 'or by fraudulent concealment has subjected himself to an action at law for damages, or to relief in equity to rescind the contract for the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Having laid down these principles, they will be found of easy application to this case. It is obvious, that as <em>Beale </em>received and retained for 18 months, without objection, the title sent or delivered to him by <em>Wood, </em>and has enjoyed uninterrupted possession, he cannot succeed unless he shews a fraudulent misrepresentation or suppression on the part of <em>Wood. </em>For, no eviction having taken place, no suit being in progress, none being even threatened, and there being no pretence of <em>Wood\u2019s </em>insolvency, he cannot come into equity, anticipating a probable eviction, and consequent title to recovery under the warranty of his vendor. His only ground of relief is the fraud; and hence his counsel has vigorously endeavoured to maintain that position.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>The fraud which will entitle a purchaser to ask a rescission of his contract in equity, whether the defects complained of are guarded against by covenants of title or not, is that which consists in <em>misrepresentation </em>of facts, or in the <em>concealment </em>of facts, from which a defect of title arises, which facts the <em>vendee had no other means of knowing. 2 </em>Swanst. 287. If then the vendor does not know of a defect, or, knowing it, does not conceal it, or if the vendee does know of it, there is no ground of relief. The vendee then must prove three things: 1st. the <em>defect; 2dly, </em>knowledge and suppression by the <em>vendor; </em>8dly, ignorance on the part of the vendee. And as to the second matter, the <em>scienter </em>is essential, as the case of <em>Bree </em>v. <em>Holbech, </em>Doug. 654. most amply proves. So too in <em>Urmston </em>v. <em>Pate, </em>already quoted, where <em>P. </em>conceiving himself entitled to an estate, though he had no title at all, sold it, reciting the will under which he claimed, and w\u00e1rranting only against himself and his ancestors, it was decided that the purchaser had no remedy, though it appeared that the will conferred no title, and though the defect was overlooked by mistake, by the vendee\u2019s counsel. These cases shew how strict the rule has been held in <em>England.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Let us see then whether <em>Beale </em>has exhibited any defect in the title here. The proof lies upon him : yet he has produced no evidence to question the existence of the patent of <em>Penell </em>the elder; and the will of <em>Pencil, </em>and the deeds from his son and son in law to <em>Jenlcs, </em>and from <em>Jenlcs </em>to <em>Wood, </em>and from <em>Wood </em>to <em>Beale, </em>are all regular. Moreover, <em>Beale </em>has possession of the identical land he bought; for luckily it was located between two well known tracts, with one of which it interlocked. Further, he is located in number 5. of the 18,000 acre tract, and has enjoyed the possession ever since 1825. <em>lie </em>has never questioned the title of the <em>Pencils, </em>but only demanded that <em>Wood </em>should produce the deeds from <em>PenelVs </em>devisees to <em>Jenlcs. </em>Now those deeds have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>been duly recorded in <em>Randolph </em>county, and are exhibited in the record. The title then seems to be comp\u00edete. But then it is said that the true location of the 18,000 acres is not known; that the <em>Sherwood </em>survey is said to be for 104,000 acres, and it does not appear that it embraces this land. <em>Beale </em>should then have shewn that it did not; for the <em>onus </em>is on him, and in twelve years he might have ascertained it. But in fact the evidence is abundant for our purposes. <em>Sherwood's </em>survey seems to have been for 104,000 acres. Each of the two <em>Pencils </em>then would have 52,000; but all of <em>Joseph PenelVs </em>share, except about 18,000 acres, appears to have been sold by him in his lifetime. This <em>Sherwood </em>tract was probably as familiarly known by the settlers around, as their own farms. The habits and interests of the people of that country bring them into intimate acquaintance with, all the lines and locations around them. From their information, rather than from the patent, the identity of the tract was to be established. But the parties had also a survey of the 104,000 acres, as the plaintiff himself has taken pains to prove. With these means of information, the commissioners who laid off these lots cannot have been mistaken in laying down lot number 5. as part of <em>PenelVs </em>18,000 acres, and in considering the 18,000 acres as part of the survey patented to <em>Pencil.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">But <em>Beale </em>complains that the title is not in severalty. This might indeed be an objection to specific performance of a contract, if it were promptly made; but it can be no reason'for <em>rescinding </em>a contract, after the party has received his deed, and continued for years in undisturbed possession. He has, in point of fact, had possession in severalty. He was content to accept that possession. He was present when the lots were being laid off. He had seen the deeds of <em>Pencil </em>and <em>Meredith. </em>He well knew then that the lands were yet undivided by regular partition, and it is not pretended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number><em>Wood </em>ever intimated the contrary. Admit, then, that , . , <em>r </em>. <em>- </em>, . , , this was a deieet; yet was it one o\u00ed which lie was aware, and he ought either to have provided against it, or to have ascertained for himself the real state of the affair. Moreover, it is a defect not necessarily vital to the title. He might at any time have compelled a partition; and upon such partition, if it appeared to the court that he was in possession of no more than a fair proportion, his possession under the circumstances would, according to the usual course of the court, have been respected. The lot on which he settled would have been assigned to him, and he would never have been disturbed. But suppose it otherwise ; suppose him evicted: then he would have redress under his covenant of warranty. But surely a court of equity ought not to have granted him relief by rescission of the contract, upon the anticipation of an eviction, which was not only not threatened, but not even remotely probable. Still less should it have continued the injunction after a partition was actually made by the decree of the superiour court. That decree must be taken to be right. Its errors, if there be any, cannot be collaterally examined. It is unreversed and unannulled, and unless it has been set aside since the dissolution, it is now irrevocable.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Upon the whole, I see no ground for relief in this case. I have not thought it necessary to go into the allegations of fraudulent combinations on the part of <em>Jenks </em>and <em>Wood, </em>to sell lands not their own. The question is not whether they have defrauded others, but whether they have defrauded <em>Beale; </em>and of this there is not the slightest evidence. He is in the enjoyment of what he bought, and his title is not questioned, it is but just however to say, that I think there is nothing fraudulent appearing in the transactions of <em>Wood </em>and <em>Jenks. </em>That <em>Jenks </em>should have purchased from <em>Pencil </em>and <em>Meredith </em>for a valuable consideration, and have sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>with general warranty, upon a credit, when he knew he had no title, and that <em>Wood, </em>a man to whom insolvency is not imputed, should have done the same thing, is hard of belief; and it becomes utterly incredible, when we find that all their imputed combination and fraud, all their supposed machinery and contrivances of partnerships and agencies, have resulted in no extraordinary profit to themselves, and no loss to their vendee.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">I am of opinion to affirm the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b700-5\">Brockenbrough, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ACh\">concurred.
