The administration account of <em>Robert Garter Nicholas, </em>according to his own books, except that he did not extend to his credit, the certificates for the monies deposited in the loan office: This account included the profits of the sons\u2019 estates; but two others, called discrimination accounts, were extracted, from it, by the commissioner, against <em>Edward </em>Cary <em>Ambler </em>and <em>John Ambler, </em>in order to ascertain the respective rights and responsibilities of each of them. 4. The private account of <em>Robert Carter Nicholas, </em>for the money borrowed by him, as entered on his books, to November 1779; and charging him with interest upon the balance from, that year. 5.

But be that as it may, whenever he was creditor upon the administration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>account, the balance ought to be applied at its nominal amount against the private account. The nominal amount, too, of the certificates, of the <em>22d </em>of April, 1779, should be allowed the executor; for the money belonged to the estate, and the security was a proper one. There is not the slightest evidence of any tobacco crop in 1777; and the situation of the country, at that time, affords a strong presumption to the contrary. This is confirmed by the regularity of the account in other respects; which refutes the idea of an omission so important, and leads to the inference, that, if there was such a crop, it was blended with those of other years. Besides the settlement made by the surviving executors, at a comparatively recent period, contains none; and that ought to be adhered to, as Mrs. <em>Ambler </em>intended it for the benefit of all concerned, from an avowed conviction of the injustice that would be done, by any other mode of adjustment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b653-4\"><em>Call, </em>for <em>Ambler.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A29\">The new goods <em>ought not to have </em>been charged at all; for the festator intended them for the indiscriminate use of the family; but, if they were to be charged, Mrs. <em>Ambler </em>should have been debited with a full proportion : for it is probable, that she used most of them, as the greater part was of a description suited to her wants. The appellant ought not to have been charged in money for the whole of the bonds; but for those only which were collected by him, and the rest should be divided. The same commission, too, ought to be allowed him upon his collections, as would have been allowed the executors, if they had performed the service. The appellant was not liable for the stocks destroyed by the British army; for the act of assembly did not change the property in them; but gave him the increase for his care and pains, and rendered him liable for ordinary casualties only; not for those arising from supernatural causes, or -the events of war. The furniture should be divided; and the commissioner ought not to have turned it into money. The appellant was liable for the ae~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>tual value only of two thirds of the lease on the main ; and not for a conjectural estimate, calculated upon the principies of annuities. Interest was not due upon the legacies to t[-ie daughters, until <em>John Ambler </em>came of age; for <em>Mary\u2019s </em>was intended, in case of her death, to be paid at the same time with the other; because it was not wanted for maintenance, as that was provided for by the will, and there is nothing to shew that the testator intended that the surviving sister should receive the former, before her own. Consequently neither was payable, or subject to interest, until the marriage of <em>Sarah ; </em>and then the tender made, by Mr. <em>Nicholas, </em>suspended interest to the time when the money was demanded. The \u00a3200, paid in August 1789, should be applied to the principal; for it was received, <em>in part of the bequest; </em>which meant the <em>corpus, </em>and not the interest.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ae0\">\n<em>Wickham, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaZ\">The money borrowed was specie, and was so regarded by the executor himself; who kept it in a separate account, to denote that it was, in its nature, distinct from the other monies belonging to the estate. This indeed was proper; for he received it in sterling, and could not convert it into paper money for his own convenience, but ought to account for the specie value, under the fifth clause of the act of assembly establishing the scale of depreciation. <em>Chanc. Rev. </em>148. The amount of the certificate, of the 22d of April, 1779, ought not to be charged to the estate ; for the money was probably drawn, upon the former certificates, for some object of the executor, which failed, and then it was returned to the loan office at a great loss, from the intervening depreciation between the first and second deposit. The executor ought to account for a crop of tobacco in 1777; for it is incredible that none was made. The settlement, by the surviving executors, did not bind the appellee, as it was imperfect, and kept open for further con-, sideration. The new goods were properly charged to the sons; for many of them suited their purposes; and there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>is no proof, that they were used by Mrs. <em>Ambler. </em>As <em>John Ambler </em>took possession of the bonds, and kept them for so many years, he must be considered as having collected them, or been negligent; and, in either view, he was liable in money, without commissions, as he was an intromitter, as to our moiety. It was right to charge him also with the stocks destroyed by the British army; for the act of assembly is positive, that they shall be kept upon the plantation, and that the heir shall be liable for losses. <em>Old Virg. </em>laws, 166. The furniture was properly put down at a valuation, as it had been withheld so long, and must have received injury from time. The mode of valuing the lease on the main was unexceptionable; for, as it had not been sold, some reasonable estimate was to be made; and there was probably none better, than that which was adopted. Full interest was due upon the legacies to the daughters; for the devise of <em>Mary\u2019s </em>to her sister operated as an original bequest; which was demandable immediately, asno <em>time </em>of payment was attached to it, 1 P. <em>Wms. </em>478; and the interest was not suspended either by the war, or the alledged tender. Not by the first, for the law is otherwise: nor by the second, because no actual tender was made, and the offer was to pay certificates, and not money. The \u00a3200 was properly applied to the interest, as that was part of the bequest.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The court, consisting of Pendleton, President, Lyons, Judge, and Roane, Judge, made the following decree, without any preliminary remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">This day came the parties by their counsel, and the court having maturely considered the transcript of the record of the decree aforesaid, and the arguments of counsel, delivered the following opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">The various statements of accounts by the commissioner, and the conflicting opinions delivered at different times by the court of chancery, apparent in this voluminous record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>render it extremely difficult, if not impracticable, to pursue decide on each particular opinion : this court will therefore proceed to establish some general principles, according \u00bb to which the accounts are to be adjusted.</p>\n<p id=\"A5s\">The account of <em>Robert Carter Nicholas, </em>commencing in the 22d page of the commissioner\u2019s first report, ought to stand, as far as it goes, with the small corrections made therein, and omitting the several articles of credit for interest which is hereinafter provided for. There appears no satisfactory proof or reasonable presumption, that any further sum of money or quantity of tobacco came to the hands of the said <em>Nicholas, </em>than is accounted for. The claim for an omitted crop of tobacco made in the year 1777, is merely conjectural. The annual crops are estimated, probably near the truth; but of those, part were carried to the warehouses, and part kept at the plantations, without even a guess at the quantity of each, and yet all the latter is admitted to have come to the hands of <em>John Ambler, </em>after being carried to the warehouses. <em>Robert Carter Nicholas, </em>gives credit for tobacco sold <em>Norton </em>in 1778, and in December 1779, without mentioning the quantity or when made; and there seems no reason to doubt but the crop claimed, made prior to both, was included. However, if the appellee, or <em>John Ambler, </em>shall desire it, let an issue be made up and tri\u00e9d whether any and what quantity of tobacco, and of what value, came to the hands of the said <em>Nicholas, </em>more than is accounted for, and if any found, to be added to his debit. The articles of loan office certificates and of cash received at the treasury to be extended and the estate charged with one thousand five hundred and thirty-one pounds, the amount of the certificates received of <em>Ambler </em>and <em>Norton, </em>in January 1778. That what is called the private account, stated in the 38th page, and the annual balances of the Westham account, commencing in the 8th page of the same report, ought to be incorporated with the said general account, in due order of time, and the articles of all to stand as nominally entered, without scaling, as to the said <em>Nicholas, </em>who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>was a debtor during the paper era 5 but to be scaled when carried to the accounts of the estate, and others who were creditors during the same period. That <em>Robert Carter Nicholas, </em>ought to be allowed a commission.of five per centum on all his receipts, including those in the Westham and private account; his account to be closed at the end of each year, and interest charged on the balance : the commissions and interest to be kept in a separate state from the account till its close in June 1780, and then the balance to be carried to that account; and if the balance then due from the said <em>Nicholas, </em>shall exceed two thousand five hundred and ninety pounds, (the specie borrow\u00e9d,) the surplus to be scaled according to the time when such excess occurred : but if the balance shall be that only or a lesser sum, it is to stand as specie, being so much unpaid of a specie debt, and the principal is to bear interest until June 1789, a middle month of that year in which a payment was made, but no particular time ascertained. His estate is also to be charged with a moiety of one hundred and fifty-five pounds thirteen shillings and five pence, the estimated nett profits of the Westham estate for each of the years 1779, 1780 and 1781, with interest from the end of each year, to June 1789, when the seventeen hundred and fifty pounds paid to <em>John Ambler, </em>being deducted, the executors of the said <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>will, are to be decreed to pay the balance, with interest, from that time till payment to the appellee in part of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">It was proper for the commissioner to make the discriminations in the account of <em>Robert C. Nicholas, </em>which was kept generally with the estate of the testator, but the following errors in making it ought to be corrected, besides the sixty pounds for <em>Byrd\u2019s </em>tickets here charged to <em>John Ambler, </em>but afterwards properly charged to the estate, to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">October 1770, seventy pair of shoes charged to <em>John, </em>and none to <em>Edward Cary, </em>when it is presumable that they were for the whole slaves. The commissioner states that <em>Edward, </em>had forty-two, and <em>John </em>ninety. One third part, therefore, should be charged to the former, and two thirds to the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"Aec\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>The same occurs in May 1771, in November 1772, in * November 1773, in November 1774, and in January 1776, and to be corrected in like manner.</p>\n<p id=\"A_2\">January 1778, five pounds eighteen shillings and three pence, paid <em>Harwood </em>for work at Jamestown, and fifty-four pounds nineteen shillings and nine pence, for sundries furnished from Westbam, charged here to <em>John </em>Ambler, but should have been to Mrs. <em>Ambler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">Mrs. <em>Ambler </em>is charged by Mr. <em>Blair </em>and Mr. <em>Jaquelin Ambler, </em>with rent for the land and hire for the slaves at the Cottage. She was therefore to pay the expense of feeding and <em>clothing the </em>slaves, their levies and taxes, and the doctor for attending them, and the taxes on the stock and her chariot, and the plate, if any: <em>John </em>only chargeable for the land tax and his riding horse, with his servant and horse, if he kept such. All other of the foregoing articles, which are here charged to <em>John, </em>are to be charged to Mrs. <em>Ambler, </em>as are also the several articles for corn purchased, for sundries furnished from Westham, and sixty-two pounds ten \u25a0 shillings cash, paid in part of <em>John\u2019s </em>board. She was entitled to the crops, and if any part of them has been credited to <em>John Ambler, </em>it is to be corrected and transferred to her credit. In the' credits of the account, besides the tobacco sold to <em>Norton, </em>here credited to the estate, but afterwards rightly to <em>John, </em>so much only of the money drawn for to <em>Robert C. Nicholas </em>and <em>Jaquelin Ambler </em>on <em>Athaws </em>and <em>Norton &amp; Sons, </em>ought to be credited to the estate, as was due from those merchants to the testator, including the crop of tobacco of 1768, shipped in 1769, the goods imported in 1769, in consequence of orders from the testator, the rings and the premiums of insurance connected with them, and also the money received by <em>Norton &amp; Sons </em>of <em>Hindman and Company, </em>with the annual interest arising therefrom. The residue of those drafts and the interest thereon, ought to be credited to <em>Edward Cary </em>and <em>John Ambler, </em>in proportion to the quantity of tobacco by them respectively shipped, between whom seve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>rally, and the merchants, and not with the estate or executor, the accounts should be stated from thenceforth, giving them credit for the proceeds of their respective tobaccos, and charging each with his proportion of the said surplus drafts.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">It is just to proportion by the ratio adopted by the commissioner, such goods as were imported for the slaves and plantation use, and his charge is so far approved. But though he reports that those cannot be discriminated from what were imported for the use of the children, if the invoices are produced, the nature of the articles will point it out, and the amount ought to be deducted and charged to the estate. If no invoices are shewn, an estimated allowance should be made by a comparison of the total amount with the probable demands of the estate, for it does make a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The accounts of <em>Edward Cary Ambler </em>are to be stated without other interest than his proportion <em>of that </em>which is charged to <em>Robert C. Nicholas, </em>which includes interest on the Westham balances, and without credit for liquors or furniture, and be charged with his mother\u2019s fifth part of the profits to the year 1776, when his account is to be closed, and the balance carried to the credit of Mrs. <em>Ambler, </em>who is to continue to have credit for <em>Edward's </em>share of the interest to September, in the year 1784, when her account ought to be closed, and any balance carried to the account of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\"><em>John Ambler </em>ought to be charged for the thirteen years unexpired in 1775, of the term in the governour\u2019s land, but not by the rule adopted from calculations of the value of an annuity to a person holding it, allowing compound interest yearly. The true rule is, what would this term probably have yielded if it had been sold for ready money in 1775, in which view, the article of interest would operate to lessen and not augment the amount of the annual receipts. But another capital mistake is made in this adjustment, by rating the annuity at thirty pounds. . That sum was not a fixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>annuity, but an estimated value of the yearly rent for the estate, which was charged with an annual rent to the governour, of seventeen barrels of corn, which may be moderately 'rated at ten pounds, and will reduce, the annual charge to twenty pounds, with what might be given for the amount for thirteen years. <em>John Ambler </em>ought, in the ordinary course, to be charged an interest from 1775, but considering the difficulty of the estimate, and that eight years of the thirteen occurred during a war, in which the enemy was, for the greater part, in the neighbourhood of this estate, and the deranged state of the plantation at the close of the war, the court direct that he be charged two hundred and sixty pounds for this article, without interest, till September 1784, at which time he is also to be charged two hundred and thirty-five pounds fourteen shillings and one penny for a moiety of the stocks at <em>Westham; </em>these sums, amounting to four hundred and ninety-five pounds fourteen shillings and one penny, as personal estate of <em>Edward </em>undisposed of, are to be distributed equally to his mother, brother and sister. For the stocks in James City, Mr. <em>Ambler </em>is not to be charged. The act of assembly relied on, contemplates increase or loss of an ordinary nature, and not a total destruction by an invading enemy: nor can Mrs. <em>Ambler </em>be presumed, from the general complexion of her will, to have meant to charge her son with a payment to his sister for what he had not, and to the loss of which he had not contributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The estate of <em>Edward Ambler, </em>ought to have credit for all the outstanding debts which appear to have been received by the executors, and with its proportion of the interest charged to <em>Robert Carter JNicholas, </em>and by <em>John Ambler, </em>for what of them he has actually received, an account of which he is to render upon oath, deducting a commission of five per centum, and on which he is to be charged interest from the end of each year, upon the amount of the receipts of that year, the court being of opinion that he is not further accountable, since it was nophis duty to make the col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>lection, and he probably used proper diligence for the sake of his own interest; at the same time, it is possible many debts may have been saved by his intromission. Any debts remaining outstanding are to be divided equally between <em>John Ambler </em>and the appellee, having regard to such as are sperate and desperate; not, however, including therein the balances due from <em>Athaws </em>and <em>Norton Sons, </em>since they arise from distinct accounts with the sons, and each of them is to receive and risk his own balance, the appellee to succeed to that of <em>Edward Cary, </em>discarding also, from those accounts, the balance due from Mrs. <em>Ambler </em>to <em>Norton Sons, </em>which is to be charged to her. On failure by <em>John Ambler </em>to render an account of debts he has received, he is to be charged as by the commissioner in the 6th page of his third report, only deducting two hundred and sixty pounds due from <em>Jaquelin Ambler </em>for the bills of exchange which belongs to the accounts of the sons, and not to the estate. On this sum, <em>John </em>is to be charged interest from the end of two years from <em>the time he </em>received <em>the </em>accounts, as a medium period in which he had probably received considerable sums, but far from having completed the collections.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The estate is to be charged with its several articles of debit in the accounts of the executors, and with the whole amount of Mrs. <em>Macon\u2019s </em>fortune, and the interest. Any balance due to the estate, is to be equally divided between <em>John Ambler </em>and the appellee, as representing <em>Edward Cary Ambler. </em>And to them also belongs in equal moieties, the loan office certificate of April 22d, 1779, and all interest which hath accrued thereon, except the one hundred and sixty-one pounds five shillings and seven pence, already charged to <em>John Ambler, </em>and for a moiety of that sum the appellee is to have credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The court discover no reason to relieve against the condition annexed in the will of Mrs. <em>Ambler, </em>to the devise to her daughter; she had surely a power to bestow her bounty on her own terms, and her motives appear to have been pure and upright to preserve peace between her children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>and with their connexions, and at the same time, to prevent others from being charged for her free use of the es-fate j the account, therefore, which was stated by Mr. <em>Blair </em>and Mr. <em>Jaquelin </em>Ambler, ought to be taken as the ground work, rectifying such mistakes and omissions as shall be apparent ; of which sort, however, the court doth not consider the charge of forty pounds a year for rent, and forty pounds a year for damages at the Cottage, when the commissioner allows but one forty pounds for both on the testimony of <em>David </em>and <em>Thomas Harris, </em>referring no doubt to their <em>ex parte </em>affidavit, since in their regular depositions taken in this suit in <em>1798, they </em>are explicit for both sums. Mrs. <em>Ambler </em>is to be debited with the stated balance of that account, and with any omissions before noted, and others if apparent! and is to have credit for her fifth part of the profits, her third part of <em>Edward Cary Ambler\u2019s </em>personal estate undisposed of, for what she is entitled to under his will, and <em>for any </em>articles apparently charged her improperly, or plain credits <em>omitted; </em>any articles in the paper period to be scaled, and no interest allowed, except the proportions of that charged to <em>Robert C. Nicholas </em>as before stated; the balance to be carried to the credit of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">At .the close of Mrs. <em>Ambler\u2019s </em>stated account, the gentlemen state one headed, <em>\u201c </em>The estate of <em>Mary Ambler, </em>to the estate of <em>Edward Ambler, </em>Dr. Cr.,\u201d the articles of which ought to be thus discriminated'. In the debits, <em>John Ambler </em>to have credit for the hire of negroes, for cotton, wool, flax, provisions furnished by <em>Clarkson\u2019s </em>and <em>Richardson\u2019s </em>accounts, the rent for and damages done to the Cottage. The other articles respecting him are before directed to be set right in the discrimination of <em>Robert G. Nicholas\u2019s </em>account. The estate to have credit for the cartage of goods, and <em>John Barrett\u2019s </em>account, if it is before charged with those articles, the credits in that account for Mrs. <em>Ambler\u2019s </em>annual allowance of provisions, and for the board of her daughter, are to be charged to the estate, and for <em>John Ambler\u2019s </em>board, to him! from which a deduction ought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>made for the time he was absent, but that the gentlemen seem to have considered that circumstance, and probably on that account, lessened the annual sum, five pounds below that of his brother and sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">No account is to be taken of any new goods which were in the house when the testator died, nor of such as were afterwards imported, in consequence of his orders, such to be considered as used in the family according to his will. There is no reason to charge <em>John Ambler </em>with the furniture which remains in the house where Mrs. <em>Ambler </em>lived and died, merely because that house was his, especially as it was not the seat of his residence; unless he refused to deliver it to the appellee when required. If the parties agreed to refer it finally to the commissioner, they ought to abide by his statement, which does not appear to be unreasonable. But if no such agreement was made, <em>John Ambler </em>cannot be compelled to purchase the furniture, and in that case, he is to account upon oath for what he has removed, and be charged to the appellee for its value, who is to take the residue of the furniture as it is, <em>John\u2019s </em>specific articles of plate excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The slave <em>George </em>is to be considered as the property of <em>John Ambler, </em>and he entitled to the hire, as stated in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\"><em>William H. Macon </em>is to have credit for the one thousand pounds, to which his lady succeeded by the death of her sister, with interest thereon from October-1769, to the time of his intermarriage, and at that time for his lady\u2019s one thousand pounds, but that interest on the.whole ought to be suspended from thenceforth, until September 1784. The certificates offered by Mr. <em>Nicholas </em>were not a legal tender, nor would the offer have been such, if it had been to pay gold and silver. The certificates were of much more value than tenderable paper, since they bore interest, and arrested future depreciation ; but the governing principle is, that but for the offer of suspension made by the appellee, Mr. <em>Nicholas </em>might have procured and tendered legal money, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>subjected the appellee to a loss of nine-tenths at least of his ^ claim; of this, the latter seems to have been aware, and judiciously chose to sacrifice the interest to the preservation \u00ab of his principal, in which he could not fail, since, if he and jsfpr&gt; <em>jhnhler </em>should not compromise, the offer of Mr. <em>Nicholas </em>could not operate as a legal tender to evade a specie payment of the principal. Interest during the war, ought not, in justice and equity, to have been allowed on debts due to domestic creditors, no more than, to foreign; but since it has not been attended to, either in practice or judicial decisions, until so much business has been otherwise adjusted, it would be unjust at this late era, to introduce'it in a particular case, unless in one attended with peculiar circumstances. The court think it reasonable to allow <em>John Ambler, </em>who appears to have been but six years of age when his father died, a year after he came of age to become acquainted with the state of his affairs, and be enabled to judge of any proposed compromise. From that period, to wit, September 1784, the appellee is to be allowed ipterest for his whole two thousand pounds, deducting from the principal the thirteen hundred pounds paid at the respective times of payment ; an application, which, though it might be illiberal in Mr. <em>Ambler to </em>make, it was a legal right of which he cannot be deprived in a court of equity. From the same period the appellee is to be allowed interest on the principal of all his other claims, all which interest, beyond what Mr. <em>Nicholas </em>is charged with, <em>John Ambler </em>ought to pay, since though the accounts were unliquidated he had the use of the money and might have deposited in court a sum to answer the eventual demand. The account of the appellee to be closed October .18th, 1789, and a decree entered for his balance of principal and interest, with interest on the principal from that day till payment; towards which the executors of <em>Robert C. Nicholas </em>are to pay the balance found to be due from him : <em>Wilson Miles Cary </em>to pay his balance and interest according to the decree, and the <em>residue to be </em>paid by <em>John Ambler, </em>as possessing the estate chargeable there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>with. The costs in chancery to be paid in third parts according to the decree. From the foregoing statement, it appears that the decree of the said high court of chancery is erroneous, as contravening in several instances the principles herein established; therefore, it is decreed and ordered, that the said decree be reversed and annulled, and that the appellee pay to the appellants their costs, by them expended in the prosecution of their appeal aforesaid here.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Which is ordered to be certified to the superior court of chancery, directed by law to be holden in Richmond, to have the accounts reformed and a final decree entered, according to the principles of this decree.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The court of chancery, in conformity with the foregoing decree of the court of appeals, referred the accounts back to the commissioner; who mistook the meaning of the decree, and made a different statement from that required by it. The consequence was, that <em>Macon </em>would sustain no loss by depreciation, but the whole of it would be thrown upon <em>John Ambler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Exceptions were filed to the report; but the court of chancery overruled them, and decreed that \u00a3 1836. 3. 6. should be paid by the estate of <em>Robert Carter Nicholas; </em>\u00a3 44. 7. 6. by <em>Wilson Miles Cary; </em>and \u00a3 3859. 19. 9. by <em>John Ambler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\"><em>John Ambler </em>applied to the court of chancery for leave to file a bill to review the last mentioned decree of that court; which being refused, he appealed, to the court of appeals, from the order of refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">The court of appeals made the following decree :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">\u201c This day came the parties by their counsel, and the court having maturely considered the transcript of the record of the order aforesaid, and the arguments of counsel, is of opinion, that, on no sound construction of the decree of this court, pronounced on the twenty-fifth day of Octo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>ber, 1803, was the commissioner justified in charging the appellant, with any loss sustained, or supposed to be sustained, by the appellee <em>Macon </em>in consequence of the principles on which the account was directed, by that decree, to be taken of the transactions of <em>Robert C. Nicholas, </em>or his representatives, in relation either to depreciation, or interest. The decree of the court of chancery, therefore, approving the report of the commissioner, and which in consequence of a departure from the manner of stating the accounts as directed by the decree of this court, improperly resulted in a charge against the appellant of the sum of twenty-five hundred and forty pounds eleven shillings and four pence half penny, on account of this supposed loss, is erroneous; and ought to have been corrected on the bill of review filed in this cause. In consequence of the intricacy and perplexity of these accounts, arising as well from the manner in which they have been stated, as from the great lapse of time and other circumstances, it may happen, that some injustice may be done to some of the parties by confirming the report, except so far as it is above declared to be incorrect; yet it is believed it will be better, at this day, to do so, than to open the accounts for new statements to be made, except so far as may be necessary to correct the error above stated. And that the order aforesaid, for the reasons before stated, is erroneous. Therefore it is decreed and ordered that the same be reversed and annulled,\u201d with costs, &amp;c. \u201c And it is ordered that the cause be remanded to the said chancery court to have the accounts reformed, and a final decree entered agreeably to the foregoing principles. And if the amount of the decree has been paid, as is suggested, to order restitution of the sum which shall be found to have been improperly decreed with interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">The result was, that <em>Macon </em>had to return a very large sum, which had been paid to him, by <em>John Ambler, </em>under the second decree of the court of chancery.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b665-10\"> The foregoing decree was prepared by Mr. <em>Pendleton, </em>and was the last public act of that distinguished judge; who died the following night. \u201c Acvtum <em>sane hominem, et </em>probatum.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
