Though I have given unto my dear wife, the use and profits of my whole estate during her widowhood, for her support, and the support, education and maintenance of my two daughters, yet my will and intention is, that, if either or both of my daughters should marry during the time she remains my widow, she so marrying, shall immediately upon her marriage, be entitled to receive one third of my whole estate, both real and persona], to the use of her and her heirs, as above mentioned.\u201d After which, he desired, that the furniture of his house should be kept together for the use of his wife and family; and, in case of the marriage or death of his wife, he devised the guardianship of his daughters to his executors. He then added, \u201c I furthermore give unto my dear wife, in case she should die my widow, and in case of the death of my two daughters, one thousand pounds, over and above what I have given her, to be at her absolute disposal.\u201d The testator died in that year; and it does not appear that he had any other children than the two daughters above mentioned, <em>Anna, </em>one of the said daughters, died an infant of tender age : then the wife married and died, living the other daughter <em>Susanna; </em>who, afterwards, intermarried with <em>Burwell, </em>by whom she had a child that died ; after which she died herself, without leaving issue. And thereupon, the husband and the surviving children of <em>Elizabeth Taliaferro, </em>together with the husband of one of her deceased daughters, and the children of another, filed a bill in the high court of chancery against <em>Burwell, </em>for an account and delivery of the estate, stating that <em>Elizabeth Taliaferro </em>died after the tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>tator; that she had five children, to wit, two sons and three daughters; that <em>George </em>was the eldest, but died intestate and without issue in 1788, to whom his father claimed to be heir: that one of the daughters married <em>Keith, </em>and died without issue, living her husband one of the plaintiffs; that another of the daughters married <em>Stubbs, </em>and died, leaving two daughters, who were part of the plaintiffs, and sued by their father as their next friend; and that the other daughter married <em>Wedderburn.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-4\">The answer of <em>Burwell </em>claimed to hold the lands as tenant by the curtesy, and the slaves in absolute property, stating that his wife died at nineteen years of age; that <em>George Holden </em>the testator died in debt: and that the rents of the land having been applied, by the agent of the executor, to the payment of the debts, slaves, to that amount, ought to be furnished.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-5\">The high court of chancery \u201cbeing of opinion, <em>for reasons written on a paper deposited with the rolls, </em>that the defendant is entitled to tenancy by curtesy of all the lands devised by the testator <em>George Holden </em>to his daughters, and is entitled, not to the slaves and other chattels bequeathed with those lands, but to so much of their value as is equal to the rents and profits of the said lands, which after the death of the testator\u2019s widow, were applied, if any were applied, to the payment of his debts, and that the plaintiffs hereinafter named are entitled to the surplus of the testator\u2019s slaves, goods and credits,\u201d dismissed so much of the bill as demanded present possession of the lands; and appointed commissioners to make distribution of the slaves, goods and credits, as follows, that is to say; one fourth to <em>William Taliaferro </em>son of <em>Elizabeth </em>Taliaferro; one fourth to <em>Wedderburn; </em>one fourth to <em>Keith, </em>and one fourth to the two <em>Stubbs.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-6\">The paper referred to by the decree is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-7\">\u201c In this cause, upon the question, Whether the defendant be tenant by curtesy of lands devised by <em>George Holden </em>to his two daughters, who were his only children, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>died infants, and of whom one had not been married, and the other was wife of the defendant, and by him had one child, and but one, which did not survive its mother, the court\u2019s opinion was delivered in these terms: In the testament of <em>George </em>Holden, the words, <em>\u2018Igive unto my wife the use and profits of my whole estate during her widowhood ; but if my wife should marry again, then 1 give unto her one thousand pounds and the choice of six slaves during her life, one of the six to be at her own disposal and gift,\u2019 </em>are not pertinent to the question; for they neither augment nor diminish the daughter\u2019s interests otherwise than that their mother, if she married again, would have a certain portion of their estates personal, instead of all the profits yielded by the estates real and personal, for support of herself, and for support, education and maintenance of her daughters during her life, if she remained a widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">\u201cImpertinent too, and superfluous, are these words, <em>\u2018If my two daughters should die before they are of age, and unmarried, I then give unto my ivife, though she should be married again, the use of my whole estate during her life. Though I have given unto my wife the use and profits of my whole estate during her widowhood, for her support, \u00a7-c. yet my will is, that if either or both my daughters should marry, during the time she remains my widow, she so marrying shall, immediately, upon her marriage, be entitled to receive one third of my whole estate, to the use of her and her heirs in manner above </em>mentioned.\u2019 Impertinent, both because they do not alter the daughters\u2019 interests, and because the provisions in certain events became inefficacious by opposite events: Superfluous, because if they had been omitted, the daughters\u2019 interests would have been neither more nor less than they were by these words, \u2018 <em>1 give unto my daughters Anna and Susanna my whole estate both real and personal, not otherwise disposed of, to them and their heirs equally to be divided, share and share alike, hut if my two daughters should die, before they are of age, and without issue of their bodies, then I give and devise my whole estate, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>to them devised, to be equally divided between the children of my sister Elizabeth Taliaferro, except the child that shall be the heir at law of her husband William Taliaferro,' </em>the only words considerable after extermination of those before supposed not to be so. And if that the daughters had estates of inheritance in the lands, to which estates heirs of their bodies might have succeeded, that the husband of the surviving daughter, to whom her sister\u2019s moiety descended, and who by him, seised during the coverture, had a child, although it expired immediately after its birth, is tenant by the curtesy, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel persists in denying, against him, the judge of this court will not dispute, sooner than he would <em>contra negantem </em>principia.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-4\">The plaintiffs appealed to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-10\"><em>Warden, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Anh\">The will was made in 1777, when primogeniture prevailed; but the subsequent act of assembly regulating the course of descents, and abrogating the preference of the eldest son, destroyed the exception in the devise as to the heir of <em>William Taliaferro </em>; for all his children will be- his heirs at his death, and therefore all became entitled upon the passing of the law; because the estate is given to all the children, which fixed the interest; and the exception was to operate at a future day, when the event should be known ; for had primogeniture continued, the heir would still have been uncertain, as it might not have been the eldest son, but some other child. Consequently, as subsequent to the statute, the exception could not take effect, the estate remained absolute, and upon the death of <em>George, </em>his father succeeded to his share. The appellee is not tenant by the curtesy, 1. Because the devise did not confer an estate of inheritance on his wife'; for the different parts of the will should be construed together, and the general complexion shews that the daughters were not to have a fee, unless they attained to twenty-one years of age. The fourth clause, therefore, ought to be considered as predicating a majority; and, consequently, as the contingency never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>happened, the devise never took effect. 2. Because the husband is not entitled to be tenant by the curtesy of a defeasable estate; for the happening of the event puts an end to it; and the limitation taking effect as an original devise, destroys all mesne rights. The decree, therefore, ought to be reversed altogether as to <em>Burwell; </em>the appellant <em>William </em>Taliaferro, in right of his son <em>George, </em>declared entitled to one fifth of the whole estate; and the residue divided among the rest of the appellants in the proportions mentioned in the decree.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-5\">\n<em>Wickham,, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7g\"><em>The </em>appellee has nothing to do with the question of distribution among the appellants. Therefore, I shall not stop to enquire, whether <em>William </em>Taliaferro, is entitled, in right of his eldest son, to a share of the estate after the curtesy ceases, although the case of <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>1 Call, 165, which reprobates the idea of an executory devise being influenced by the enactment of a subsequent law, may perhaps repel him. The construction of the will contended for by the appellants\u2019 counsel, cannot be sustained ; on the contrary, the devise to the daughters of the testator, created a clear vested remainder, to take effect in possession, upon the marriage or death of the wife, without regard to the <em>majority </em>of the devisees. For a fee is given them in the first instance; and is limited to expire only upon their deaths under age, without issue. Upon the death of the wife, therefore, Mrs. <em>Bunvell, </em>who was heir to her sister, became seised of the fee simple in the whole ; and the birth of her child gave her husband a right to curtesy, although her subsequent death, during minority, defeated the estate; for the rights of dower and curtesy continue after the expiration of such determinable interests. 2 <em>Bac, Ab. </em>223. <em>Co.
