And it is further enacted, that if any person or persons whatsoever shall willingly make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>false entry, and be thereof convicted, such person or persons shall forfeit and pay one hundred pounds current money, and also forfeit the goods, recoverable on information in any court within this commonwealth, who shall thereupon enter judgment and award execution for the same, to be applied, one moiety to the use of the informer, and the other to the use of the commonwealth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-6\">By the act of May session 1784, which refers to the last act, and is intituled <em>\u2018 an act for imposing an additional duty of one and a half per centum on certain goods, wares and </em>merchandizes,\u2019 it is'enacted, \u201cthat an additional duty of one and a half <em>per centum ad valorem, </em>be paid on all goods, wares and merchandizes, which are subject to a duty of one per cent, by the act herein before recited ; which said duty of one and a half per cent, shall be paid by the owner or importer of any such goods, wares and merchandizes, and shall be collected and accounted for under the same regulations and penalties as are provided by the said recited act for the one per cent, aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-7\">By the act of October session 1785, entitled <em>an act for better securing the revenue arising from </em>customs,\u2019 it is declared, \u201c that whereas many frauds have been practised and committed, <em>by the owners or commanders of vessels trading to this commonwealth by their failing to enter the same according to law, </em>whereby great loss has resulted to the public on the duties payable <em>on goods, wares and merchandize; </em>for remedy whereof in future, it is enacted, that if the owner or commanding officer of any vessel, trading to this state, shall fail to enter the same together with her cargo, in the manner prescribed by law, and pay or secure to be paid the duties arising thereon, <em>such vessel, </em>together with her rigging, tackle, apparel and furniture, and such part of the cargo as shall not have been duly entered, shall be liable to be seized by any person or persons who shall detect <em>such vessel, </em>to be prosecuted and condemned before the court of admiralty, one half to the use of the informer, and the other half to the use of the commonwealth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4n\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Under <em>the </em>foregoing acts of assembly, <em>Christopher Roan, </em>in May 1786, as well on behalf of himself as of the comrnonwealth, filed a libel, in the court of admiralty, against the brigantine <em>Little Nancy, Nathaniel Bentley, </em>master,' charging that the master of the vessel laden with goods, bricks, a chariot and harness, and other wares, and merchandizes, arrived from Philadelphia at Norfolk about the 20th of April, 1786, and made a false entry, by concealing the chariot and harness, and secretly landing part of her cargo, without paying, or securing the duties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0O\">The answer of <em>Bentley </em>states that the vessel belongs to <em>William Pennock and company, </em>citizens of Virginia. That she left this state in December 1785, and returned to, and entered at Norfolk, on the said 20th day of April, 1786. That the chariot and harness were not entered; but denies that' the failure subjects the vessel and the chariot and harness to forfeiture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-7\">There was a general replication to the answer : And the jury, upon the trial of the issue, found a special verdict; which the court set aside for uncertainty, and awarded a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABfe\">. Upon the second trial, the verdict found, that the respondent imported into this commonwealth, the chariot and harness, as <em>charged </em>in the <em>libel; but </em>did not enter the same with any custom house officer within the state, nor pay, or secure the duties thereon : and that if the law was for the libellant, then they found the brigantine, chariot and harness, for him : but otherwise they found for the respondent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-10\">The court, upon the last mentioned verdict, condemned the brigantine, chariot and harness, as forfeited : and from that sentence, the respondent appealed to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-11\"><em>Baker, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeS\">contended, that the chariot and harness were not within the acts of assembly. For they were not merchandize, which obviously means things to be bought and sold : a definition by no means'applicable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>chariot and harness; because things of that kind are never warehoused and sold, but are always imported for the owner\u2019s own use. That if they had come by land, the duty would not have reached them; and it was not to be conceived, that a distinction was intended. That, in all parts of the act, the mercantile character of the article to be entered, appears; for the marks and numbers of the casks and packages are to be reported, and the invoice produced : all of which are commercial terms, and denote buying and selling. That the dutiable articles are known by their companions ; for, in all the after parts of the act, they are constantly associated with spirits, wine, sugar and coffee: which are all of a commercial nature, and prove that only articles of that description were to be subjected to a duty.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b197-4\">On the other side, it was said, by the <em>attorney general, </em>that merchandize was <em>nomen collectivum, </em>and comprehended every article on board. That chariots and harness might be imported for sale as well as any other goods; and there vyas nothing which shewed an intention to make a distinction in their favour. That it was to no purpose to say, that if they had been imported by land there would- have been no duty; for the same argument would be as applicable to all the other articles, on which it was admitted duties ought to be paid : and it would defeat the law unless every part of the cargo was subjected to duty, as the door would be otherwise open to every species of fraud in the entry. That the chariot and harness probably came in packages; and therefore satisfied the words relied on by the appellant\u2019s counsel. That the term merchandize lost nothing of its comprehensive character, by being associated with the words \u201c spirits, wine, sugar and coffee;\u201d for the reference was general; and was intended to comprize every article, which any of the preceding words would include.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">And of that opinion was the court; and the sentence was affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
