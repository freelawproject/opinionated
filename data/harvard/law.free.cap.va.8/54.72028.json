It sets forth, that on the 1st day of May 1830 a decree had been rendered in the said superiour court of chancery against the said <em>Worthington </em>and <em>Cookus </em>as administrators of <em>John Morrow\", </em>and against other defendants, in a suit wherein the present \u2022complainants were also parties, by which decree the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>administrator of <em>Susan Peyton </em>recovered the sum of 1636 dollars 29 cents, the administrator of <em>Francis A.

The bill then charges, that the said <em>Worthington </em>and <em>Cookus </em>administrators of <em>Morrow </em>have abundant assets to satisfy the said executions. That the said <em>Morrow </em>left considerable personal property, and large and numerous debts due him, all or great part of which came to the hands of his administrators; and in particular, they received large sums on account of a debt which they claimed as due to their intestate from <em>Robert Rutherford\u2019s </em>estate. That the said administrators had disbursed large sums to the distributees of their intestate, and in payment of debts of a dignity inferiour to that of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, which <em>Worthington </em>well knew to be a demand against his intestate as one of the sureties in the bond given by the administrators of <em>John Peyton </em>deceased, and for which a suit against <em>John Peyton\u2019s </em>administrators was pending at the time when <em>Worthington </em>received the assets which are credited in his account as administrator.

Lhe court sustained some of the exceptions of each party and overruled others, and recommitted the report to the commissioner. The only exceptions taken to this account which it is necessary to notice, were, 1. An exception by the plaintiffs, that the commissioner had not charged the defendants with the amount received by them as administrators <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>Robert Rutherford </em>deceased, whose estate was largely indebted to that of their intestate <em>Morrow, </em>and appeared to be chargeable with no other debt. Upon this exception the court decided, that the defendants should be charged with any moneys in their hands as administrators of <em>Rutherford, </em>applicable to the payment of his debt to <em>Morrow; </em>that they render before the commissioner, on oath, an account of the moneys in their hands, or in the hands of either of them, as administrators of <em>Rutherford; </em>and that they be charged with the amount, unless they shew other debts having priority. 2. An exception by defendants to the <em>date </em>of the following entry among the debits of the joint account: \u201c 1828, October. Cash paid on account of <em>Merritt\u2019s </em>debt, $ 629. 41.\u201d For as much as the said money was in truth paid on the 27th day of May 1823, instead of October 1828. Upon this exception, the court directed the commissioner to enquire whether there was any error in the date of the said payment. And then the court, proceeding to give general directions to the commissioner, ordered that the defendants receive credit for all sums paid away in discharge of simple contract debts \u201c before the service of the <em>subpoena </em>in the case of <em>Grayson </em>against Ciarle,\u201d (the suit which resulted in the decree referred to in the plaintiffs\u2019 bill and exhibited therewith).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-7\">The second report returned by the commissioner contained an account of the defendants <em>jointly, </em>as administrators of <em>Morrow, </em>with an account of <em>Robert Worthing</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>ion </em>as administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>Robert Rutherford, </em>and a mass of documents and depositions relating to various items of account. The account of the defendants as administrators of <em>Morrow </em>brought down their transactions to the 1st of January 1833, at which date there appeared a balance in favour of <em>Morroio's </em>estate, amounting to 3483 dollars 95 cents of principal, and 2240 dollars 29 cents of interest. The last item of credit to the estate was entered in the following terms: \u201c By balance in the hands of <em>Robert Worthington </em>the acting administrator of <em>Robert Rutherford </em>deceased, on a settlement of his account with the said estate herewith returned, and which is credited in this account by direction of the court, in part discharge of a balance due from the estate of said <em>Rutherford </em>to the estate of <em>John Morrow; </em>principal 4168 dollars 27 cents, interest 2363 dollars 40 cents.\u201d And without this credit to <em>Morrow\u2019s </em>estate, the account shewed that there would have <em>been </em>a balance due the administrators of <em>Morrow, </em>on the first day of January 1833, of 684 dollars 32 cents principal, and 123 dollars 11 cents interest. In tliis second report of the commissioner, the item of debit for the payment on account of the <em>Merritt </em>debt appeared in these terms: \u201c 1823, May 27. Cash paid <em>George Hageley </em>amount of debt due from colo. <em>Morrow </em>to <em>John Merritt, </em>$830.\u201d By the evidence adduced before the commissioner in relation to this item, it appeared, that on the 16th day of August 1814 <em>John Morrow, </em>the intestate of defendants, executed to <em>John Merritt </em>two notes under seal, each for the sum of 529 dollars 79 cents, the first payable on the 1st day of April 1816, and the other payable on the 1st day of April 1817.

Coolcus </em>administrator of <em>John Morrow </em>deceased $20. being the balance due on <em>John Morrow\u2019s </em>two notes to <em>John Merritt </em>of <em>Ohio.\u201d </em>The deposition of <em>George Hageley </em>was taken, and returned by the commissioner with his report. It is in the terms following: \u201cIn the spring of 1823, <em>John Merritt </em>requested me to collect the money due him from the estate of colo. <em>John Morrow </em>deceased. I accordingly called on <em>John T. Coolcus </em>one of the administrators of said <em>Morrow\u2019s </em>estate, for the payment of said notes, who had promised to pay the said notes whenever called on. When I made this call, he the said <em>Coolcus </em>had not the money at the time. I then told him I had money to spare, and that I would pay the balance due <em>Merritt </em>on colo. <em>Morrow\u2019s </em>notes, provided that he the said <em>Coolcus </em>would refund me my money with interest thereon, when called for by me, which said <em>Coolcus </em>agreed <em>to do. </em>I then, on the promise of said <em>Coolcus, </em>paid to <em>Isaac 'Reynolds </em>of <em>Baltimore, </em>on the 27th of May 1823, the sum of 830 dollars, according to the instructions of said <em>John Merritt.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-7\">The parties filed numerous exceptions to this second report of the commissioner. Among those filed by the plaintiffs was one in these terms : \u201c 4th exception. To item \u2018 1823, May 27. Cash paid <em>George Hageley </em>amount of debt due from colo. <em>Morrow </em>to <em>John Merritt, </em>$ 830.\u2019 Because there was no payment made to said <em>Hageley, </em>and the receipts on the bonds, signed by said <em>Hageley, </em>shew that the payments were made after the service of the <em>subpoena in </em>the suit of <em>Grayson </em>against <em>Ciarle.\u201d </em>This exception the court overruled. The defendants excepted to the manner in which the commissioner had taken the account, because he had made it a joint ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>count, instead of separating the transactions of the ad- . . . . . mmistrators, and ascertaining the account with each of them severally. And the defendant <em>John T. Cookus </em>\u201c excepted to his being charged with any sum of money which appeared to have come to the hands of <em>Robert Worthington </em>from the estate of <em>Rutherford, </em>because the said <em>Cookus, </em>having received no part of that estate himself, could only be charged as surety of <em>Worthington, </em>if chargeable at all; in which case the plaintiffs were bound to convene the other sureties in the bond given for the due administration of <em>Rutherford\u2019s </em>estate, that each might contribute his just proportion of any deficit which might be established against <em>Worthington; </em>but as surety the said <em>Cookus </em>was not liable at all, the bond being void. Upon these exceptions the court said, that the questions presented by them were affected not by the nature of the bond which the defendants gave as administrators of <em>Rutherford </em>(though that too 'was joint) but by the nature of the bond which they gave as administrators of <em>Morrow. </em>That the condition of that bond was, that the defendants should administer the estate according to law: that they were looked upon as the principals, and those who were induced to become bound with them never contemplated their own liability as long as either principal was solvent. Therefore that the administrators must be considered as a unit, responsible for each other\u2019s acts, and as principals bound for the balance due from either, and not as mere sureties. And the court accordingly overruled the exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-8\">Other exceptions taken by both parties were sustained. And the report being recommitted to the commissioner, to be reformed according to the opinion of the court on these last exceptions, the reformed report shewed a balance due the estate of <em>John Morrow </em>from his administrators, on the 1st day of January 1833, of 6123 dollars 81 cents, with interest on 3947 dollars 38 cents part thereof, from that date until paid. The court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>on the 14th of June 1833, rendered a decree against the defendants for the amount appearing due by the reformed report, as aforesaid, to be levied of the proper goods and chattels of the said defendants. And on the petition of the defendant <em>John T. Coohus, </em>an appeal was allowed him.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-4\"><em>Leigh, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-5\"><em>Cooke </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b83-6\">Bkockenbrough, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AMH\">The main question referred to us for decision is the extent of the liability of the administrator <em>Coohus </em>for the <em>devastavit </em>of <em>Worthington </em>the other administrator. They were both administrators of <em>Morrow, </em>and entered into one bond with two sureties, being all jointly and severally bound thereby. The question discussed here was whether <em>Coohus </em>was a surety <em>equally </em>bound with the other sureties for <em>Worthington\u2019s </em>separate acts, and they equally bound with him, or whether he was primarily bound as surety, and the others only secondarily bound, that is, bound only in case <em>Coohus </em>should prove unable to pay for <em>Worthington\u2019s devastavit. </em>If they were all <em>equally </em>bound as sureties, then the other sureties should be made parties and compelled to contribute; otherwise not.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The circuit court decided that \u201c the two administrators are looked on as the principals, and those who are induced to become bound with them never contemplate -their own liability as long as either principal is solvent; and that the administrators must be considered as a unit responsible for each other\u2019s acts, and as principals bound for the balance due from either, and not as mere sureties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">I do not think that this intimate union and identity of the two administrators is countenanced by the law, and the undertaking of the parties. The duties and obligations of administrators are very much the same with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>those of executors; and with respect to them, it has long ago been established that \u201c one executor shall not ke charged with the wrong or <em>devastavit </em>of his companion, and shall be no farther liable than for the assets which came to his hands.\u201d 3 Bac. Abr. 31. In a court of law, the bond which the administrators enter into is the only evidence of the respective obligations of the administrators and their sureties, and will also govern in a court of equity, unless there be some other contract between the parties, by which the relation of the principals and sureties towards each other is varied. What, then, is the obligation of the parties by the administration bond which the statute requires them to give ? We must adopt the rule <em>reddendi singula singulis, </em>and construe the bond distributively, with reference to the joint acts and separate acts of the administrators. The <em>penalty </em>of the bond binds the administrators and the sureties by name, in a certain sum, but the <em>condition </em>names the <em>administrators only. The </em>penalty <em>binds </em>A. B. C. and,D. and the condition is that A. and B. the administrators shall well and truly administer &amp;c. Now, so far as A. and B. <em>jointly </em>administer, they are both bound as principals for their joint acts, and C. and D. are bound as sureties for those <em>joint </em>acts. For those acts, although C. and D. are equally bound with the administrators to creditors, legatees &amp;c. yet, as between themselves, A. and B. shall both and each reimburse to C. and D. whatever these last may have paid on account of their joint mal-administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">But how is it as to their separate administration ? For A.\u2019s separate administration, he alone is bound as principal, because he alone having received the assets, his companion is not chargeable with them by the law. Yet B. is bound by the <em>bond </em>for A.\u2019s administration of all that may come to his hands, and as he is not bound as <em>principal, </em>it follows of course that he is bound as <em>surety. C. </em>and <em>D. </em>are likewise bound by the bond as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>sureties that A. will administer well and truly all that may come to his hands. Then B. C. and D. are all bound as sureties that A. will well and truly administer . those assets which may separately come to his hands. Being all three bound as sureties, they are bound <em>equally, </em>and each is entitled to contribution from the others, according to the principles of equity. So A. C. and D. stand in the relation of cosureties for the separate administration of B. and are entitled to contribution from each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">So far then as <em>Worthington </em>received a large amount of assets, and wasted them without the concurrence of <em>Coolcus, </em>this last is bound for such <em>devastavit </em>as surety only, and is entitled to contribution from the other sureties, who ought to be made parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">On the other questions discussed I also concur in the opinion of the president.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b85-11\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A9c\">I concur entirely in the opinion to be delivered by the president, except that part of it that treats <em>John T. Coolcus </em>one of the administrators of <em>John Morrow, </em>as a cosurety with the other sureties who executed the bond, for the faithful administration of the estate of <em>Morrow. </em>I cannot think that by signing and sealing the bond which was required by the act of assembly, as <em>principad, </em>by a construction of the bond according to the principles of the common law, and not according to the principles of the act, he can be considered a.s a <em>surety </em>for the due administration of the assets. As principal he was not liable for any of the acts of his co-administrator in which he did not participate. 3 Bac. Abr. pp. 30. 31. Executors and administrators. D. and the cases cited in the note. Nor is there any thing in the act under which'the bond was taken, to change the relation in which he stood to his co-administrator at the common law. On the contrary, the administrator is not looked to by the act as surety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>for the faithful' administration of the assets. If he is ... . the next oi km to the intestate, and can give security for the faithful administration of the assets, he is entitied to the administration under the act, though he may he a pauper. The policy of the act does not look to his solvency, but to the relation in which he stands' to the intestate, and his capacity to administer the assets. That he is not looked on as a surety for the administration of his co-administrator, I think is manifest from other provisions of the act. The 37th section of the act, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 104. p. 384. makes the justices liable if they take insufficient security in the administration bond; certainly not regarding the eo-administrator as a surety, to whom, if a pauper, and fit in other respects, and next of kin to the intestate, the justices are compelled to grant the administration. That he is not looked to as surety, is to my mind manifest from other considerations. If <em>CooJcus </em>is to be treated as one of the sureties taken by the justices, and his co-administrator <em>Worthington </em>and the' other sureties in the bond proved insolvent, and the sureties insufficient at the time they executed the bond, <em>Coojms </em>would\u00bb be responsible for the whole amount of the waste of his co-administrator, and if he too, at the time administration was granted to him, was insolvent, the justices would be responsible, though as principal no responsibility attached on him for the mal-administration of <em>Worthington </em>his co-administrator. Ry the 38th section of the act, 1 Rev. Code, p. 384. the co-administrator is certainly not regarded as a cosurety with others. It declares that when sureties for executors or administra\u2018tors conceive themselves in danger, they may apply for counter <em>security; </em>certainly not meaning the principals in the bond. It would be strange if a co-administrator was to come into court, or both together, to require additional security; and yet if they are cosureties by construction of the bond, they might make the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>tion. I think it was not intended by the act to change the relation of one co-administrator to another; not to regard him as surety, but as a principal responsible for i , , . his own acts only, and. the sureties to the bond as responsible for the acts of both or either of the co-administrators. That if sued at law on the bond they must be considered all as principals, according <em>to the </em>com-' mon law is true, but not according to the principles of the statute. According to those principles, if the suit was <em>brought at </em>law on the bond, and one of the administrators, upon the proofs, was found to be innocent of all waste or mal-administration, I think there is nothing so inflexible in the common law as to subject him to a judgment. The common law, on the contrary, is said very wisely to mould itself to the exigencies that arise in the contracts and engagements of persons; and I see no inconvenience, in this case, in adapting its judgment to the case (especially when it accords with the sound .construction of the law under which the bond was taken) and instead of rendering the judgment against all, rendering it against the responsible parties alone.</p>\n<author id=\"b87-8\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Az9\">The question of most importance in this case is the extent of the responsibility of <em>Coohis, </em>one of the administrators of <em>Morrow, </em>for <em>the devastavit </em>of his co-administrator <em>Worthington, </em>who upon the settlement of the estate account proves to be largely in arrears to his intestate\u2019s estate. It is contended that he executed an administration bond jointly with the administrator <em>Worthington, </em>and that he has thereby made himself responsible for his defalcations, without being-entitled to aid or contribution from the sureties in the bond. In the examination of this question, I shall not attempt to follow the counsel in the various arguments which have occupied several days on this new and interesting topic, but shall endeavour to present the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>sons in support of my opinion in as condensed a' form as I find practicable. I shall conduct the enquiry under two heads, into which the subject naturally divides itself: 1st. Is <em>Cookus </em>to be considered in this bond as principal in relation to <em>Worthington's </em>transactions, or only as surety? and 2ndly, if only as surety, are the other sureties to be regarded, in reference to <em>Worthington?s </em>transactions, as sureties <em>for Cookus, </em>or only as co-sureties <em>with </em>him for Worthington?</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">First then, is <em>Cookus </em>to be looked upon in this bond, in reference to <em>Worthington's </em>transactions, as principal, or only as surety ? By the common law, executors and administrators are all considered as having a joint interest in the property of the testator or intestate. They are esteemed in law but as one person representing the testator, and the acts of any one relating to the delivery, gift, sale, payment or release of the goods, are deemed the acts of all; for they have a joint and entire authority over the whole. <em>3 </em>Bac. Abr. 30. Nevertheless it is equally clear that one executor or administrator shall not be charged with the wrong or <em>devastavit </em>of his companion, and shall be no farther liable than for the assets which came to his hands. 3 Bac. Abr. 31. It is thus manifest that while the law recognizes the joint <em>rights </em>of co-executors, it does not recognize a joint <em>responsibility. </em>And this is obviously the case, whether executors qualify jointly or separately; for the joint character of their interest arises out of the will which creates them, and does not merely grow out of their qualification: and in like manner, whether they qualify separately or together, their responsibilities are the same for the acts of each other; for if even the act of the testator in uniting them in the fiduciary character has not the effect of so uniting them as to make one responsible for the acts of the other, the simple act of granting joint letters testamentary cannot have that effect; since the probat consists of nothing but the proof of the will and the oath\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>of the executor, to which by our law the execution of a <em>^ </em>bond is superadded, with a few exceptions. Where no such bond is given, as in England, <em>New York, Pennsylvania </em>&amp;c. there can be no pretence for inferring, from the single act of probat, the creation of a farther responsibility than the acceptance of a joint trust would of itself create; and we know that joint executors are not responsible for each other, unless by their own act they adopt the act of their fellows, or put it in their power to receive and waste the estate. The same principles apply, I conceive, where executors enter into a joint bond, and also to the case of joint administrators, unless in these cases the bond can create a larger responsibility ; which must therefore be the next subject of our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">We have already seen that executors are not farther liable than for the assets which come to their hands: and in the same passage we learn, what every practitioner well knows,-that where an action was brought against two executors, and the jury found that the two and another were made executors, and that the third wasted the assets to the amount of \u00a3600. and died, and only \u00a316. came to the hands of the two others, the court held that they should be chargeable for no more than the \u00a316. and judgment was entered accordingly. It is obvious, then, that as there is only a judgment for \u00a316. against the survivors, an action of debt suggesting a <em>devastavit </em>can only lie against them for that sum, although in point of fact \u00a3600. more of the estate has been wasted. For that sum only, therefore, will the judgment in <em>devastavit </em>be entered. Now until within a few years no action could be brought on the bond until a recovery in an action of <em>devastavit. </em>Suppose then, before the amendment of the law as to this matter, a suit had been brought on the bond. The breach assigned could only have been in not paying the \u00a3 16. An assignment of breach that the surviving executors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>had not paid the <em>\u00a3 </em>600. wasted by the third executor could never have been sustained, because there was no precedent judgment in <em>devastavit </em>against them for that r TT J <em>\u00b0 </em>. . . . &amp; , , _ , sum. Hence it is obvious that as the law formerly stood, the co-executor was not made responsible, <em>qua </em>executor, for the act of his fellow, by the operation of the bond; and I c\u00edo not perceive that the change of the law makes a difference. For even now the judgment on the bond could only be against the two executors for <em>the \u00a316. since the </em>first <em>judgment </em>against them could be for that .sum only, to be levied in their hands. So that it is manifest that the execution and existence of the bond can in no wise add to the responsibility of the executors for each other, or charge them farther than they would be chargeable upon common law principles, for the acts of each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">It has been attempted, however, to shew that to the plea of <em>plene administravit </em>by the executor who is not in default, it would be competent to reply that the parties had executed a joint bond, and were therefore bound for each other\u2019s acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">This position, it must be conceded, is altogether new, and, as it appears <em>to </em>me, is entirely inadmissible. I have never seen the precedent of a replication of this description, nor heard of its introduction into any course of pleading. Had the principle been true, it must long since have been established in <em>Great </em>Britain, where innumerable controversies are hourly arising as to the responsibility of one administrator for another. But in truth it is no answer to the plea, nor is the principle assumed sustained by the true character of the bond. It is no answer to a plea alleging that A. has fully administered, to aver that B. has not fully administered; and hence such a replication would be bad upon demurrer. Nor is the principle of it sustained by the true character of the bond. Admitting that the <em>bond </em>makes each <em>responsible </em>for the other, yet there is nothing in it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>bv which either makes the acts of the other his own. * . . By what strained construction can we make the mere execution of a bond binding the parties to a just administration, an approval, by anticipation, of all the acts of waste, mal-administration and peculation of which either may be guilty ? With what justice can we deduce from the execution of the bond an acquiescence,' and indeed a participation, <em>a priori, </em>in a fraudulent release of a debt made by <em>Worthington </em>without the knowledge of <em>Cookus, </em>or in his fraudulent purchase of the merchandize of his stores with the bonds or the property of the estate? Surely such a principle of construction would not only be in violation of the true character of the contract, but a gross injustice, a violent fiction invented for the purpose of casting a burden upon the innocent and unoffending. On the other hand, if the co-executors are held responsible indeed for each other\u2019s acts, but are not regarded as approving by anticipation and assenting to all the acts of each other, the purposes of justice and the object of the contract are fully answered. Their <em>responsibility </em>for each other, <em>ex vi termini, </em>implies that he who is in no default stands but as the <em>sponsor </em>or surety for the other; whereas if they are held to join by anticipation in all the acts of each other, they are made to stand as <em>principal </em>in acts in which they have had no participation and no knowledge ; and are thus made <em>actors </em>in matters in which they ha.ve ha.d no <em>action, </em>by themselves or their agents. They can only stand in the relation of sureties or of principal; and they cannot be considered as <em>principal, </em>when the whole act is done by another, without their participation in person or by one acting under their authority: for it would be absurd to infer that by executing a bond for the <em>faithful </em>administration of the assets, an authority is given to waste the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">I did not understand mr. <em>Johnson </em>as insisting on this broad principle. I understood <em>him </em>to admit that co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>executors are to be considered as sureties for each other, aild not in the light of principals as to each other\u2019s transactions. This indeed is obvious from what has just been said, and is manifest where the executors alone ^ave signed the bond. There, each stands as the surety of the other, and each is <em>principal </em>in relation to his own transactions. The <em>laio </em>in fact knows no difference between them: <em>equity </em>only recognizes it. And whom does equity look upon as principal ? Upon him who receives the money, \u2014 who does the act, \u2014 who gains the advantage or commits the wrong. The innocent, though responsible, is not considered a principal: he is only a surety. To test this, let us suppose that two executors join in an executorial bond without any other party to the bond, and one wastes the whole estate, and in an action on the bond the other is made liable. It cannot be questioned that he would have relief in equity, upon a bill against his fellow to compel him to reimburse him. Equity would hold him to be a surety only, and would relieve him accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">If, then, two executors executing a joint bond without any other party to the bond are to be considered as standing in\u2019relation to each other as principal and surety, each being considered as principal as to his own acts, and surety only as to the transactions of his companion; there is an end at once to the notion of <em>identity </em>as to their responsibility. There is an end at once to the notion that each is to be considered as fully bound by the acts of his companion as if he had joined in them, or as if they had been his own acts; and there is an end to the notion that in joining in a bond they are to be presumed to have designed to make themselves responsible <em>qua </em>executor, or in any other manner than as surety. And if this be so where they are the only parties to the bond, how can the terms or meaning of the engagement be affected by others uniting in the bond r The co-executors must still stand as sureties for each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>other, but as sureties only. And then we are brought to the consideration of the <em>second </em>question, whether the other sureties are to be regarded, in reference to <em>Worthington's </em>transactions, as sureties for Cookus, or only as cosureties with him for Worthington? And here I am ready to admit that if <em>Cookus </em>had applied to any one of the sureties to join with them in the bond, and he had declined unless <em>Cookus </em>would engage to stand between him and danger, there would be no doubt that <em>Cookus </em>would be bound to indemnify him, since he would thus be surety for <em>Cookus, </em>and not merely cosurety <em>with </em>him. But nothing of this kind appears. It does not appear that the sureties even joined upon his request. <em>Non constat </em>that they did not join at <em>Worthington's </em>request; and however they may have joined, and at the request of whichever party, they must be presumed to have known that <em>Cookus </em>and <em>Worthington </em>stood only as mutual sureties for each other, and could only be bound as such. Knowing this, if they joined in the bond without an engagement that <em>Cookus </em>should stand between them and danger, <em>Cookus </em>does not lose his character of surety, nor is he to be considered as primarily liable, and the sureties only bound in the event of his insolvency. It was admitted, in the argument that this doctrine of contribution is not to be regarded as matter of contract, but as resting on the equitable principle of equalizing a burden between those who are bound to bear it. It is thrown upon those who in justice and right ought to be subjected, and in the proportions in which they ought to be charged. Suppose, then, <em>Worthington </em>in this case had received and wasted 10,000 dollars, and that sum had been recovered, by a creditor, of B. one of the sureties. B. files his bill in equity against <em>Cookus, </em>who is also but a surety <em>quoad Worthington's </em>transactions, to put the whole burden upon him. Both were equally liable at <em>law; </em>where then is B.\u2019s superiour equity? He does not shew that his engagement was on the faith of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>Cookus's </em>promise to save him harmless. His whole ground of equity is that <em>Worthington, </em>for whom he was surety, has wasted the estate, and he claims full indemnity from <em>Coolcus, </em>who like himself is but a surety ; who had no power over <em>Worthington </em>than he had, and who was no more responsible for <em>Worthington\u2019s </em>acts than he ; since the responsibility of both arises from the same source \u2014 the execution of the bond. He does not then &gt; shew superiour equity, except for contribution to the amount of <em>Coolcus\u2019s </em>share of the burden. For this,-and this only, is he entitled to relief. With these views of the question, I am clearly of opinion <em>\\hd,tfJoolcus </em>is responsible only in the character of surety, so far as relates to <em>Worthington\u2019s </em>transactions, and is not primarily bound, but that the burden must be placed in equal proportions upon the shoulders of himself and the four sureties in the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">A doubt has been suggested whether <em>Coolcus </em>is liable at all. I think it very clear that he is liable. There can be no question that he is liable in an action at law on the bond ; and I certainly do not perceive what superiour equity he can have over the sureties, to entitle him to a discharge <em>from </em>a common liability with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The next question in the cause arises out of the <em>Rutherford </em>debt. <em>Robert Rutherford </em>was largely indebted to the estate of <em>Morrow; </em>and <em>Coolcus </em>and <em>Worthington, </em>the administrators of the latter estate, became jointly administrators of the estate of <em>Ruthejford. </em>In that character, <em>Worthington </em>proceeded to collect a large sum out of the property of <em>Rutherford, </em>which it is alleged was properly to have been appropriated to the debt due to <em>Morrow, </em>and which the chancellor accordingly directed to be passed to the credit of his estate, and to be charged not only against <em>Worthington, </em>but against <em>Coolcus </em>also, the co-administrator, who received no part of the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">It has been a subject of controversy in the argument, whether the funds received from <em>Rutherford\u2019s </em>estate were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>derived from his realty or his personalty. But in the view I take of this matter, it is unimportant which. If it was personalty, then the money having been received by <em>Worthington </em>alone, <em>CooJcus </em>was not responsible <em>qua </em>administrator of <em>Rutherford; </em>nor is he responsible as surety for <em>Worthington </em>as administrator of <em>Rutherford, </em>because the administration bond is void, upon the authority of <em>Frazier &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Frazier's ex'ors &amp;c. 2 </em>Leigh 642. If it was <em>realty, </em>then the money was received by <em>WortJdngton </em>as joint trustee with <em>CooJcus; </em>and then, even if they had joined in <em>the </em>receipt of the money, he would not necessarily be liable, since the joining might have been necessary, or <em>pro forma: </em>and at any rate, if paid to his companion without his consent or direction, he would not be chargeable. <em>Monell </em>v. <em>Monell, </em>5 Johns. Ch. Rep. 296. I am therefore of opinion that as a representative of <em>Rutherford's </em>estate, <em>CooJcus </em>was in no wise responsible for the receipt of the money by his co-administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">It is contended, however, that as the funds thus received by <em>Worthington </em>of <em>Rutherford's </em>estate were immediately applicable in his hands to the payment of the debt to <em>Morrow, </em>that application must be intended to have been made. This is an important and interesting question, since upon it depend the respective liabilities of different classes of sureties, where the same person is administrator both of the debtor and creditor estate, and has received of the former sufficient assets to discharge the debt due to the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">In the somewhat analogous case of a person acting in the two characters of guardian and administrator, this court seems evidently to have contemplated the necessity of some act on the part of the administrator, manifesting his election to hold the funds (which he received as administrator) in the character of guardian, in order to charge the sureties in his guardian\u2019s bond. <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>6 Rand. 444. <em>Broaddus &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Rosson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>&amp;c. </em>3 Leigh 12. See also <em>Pratt et al. </em>v. <em>Northam, et al. </em>5 Mason 108. A similar principle had long before been adopted in reference to a husband executor, who is also legatee in right of his wife. Indeed it is the well recognized principle of the common law, that such executor must by some act or declaration manifest his intention to take his wife\u2019s legacy in the character of husband, or he will be construed to continue to hold it as executor. Toller 344. <em>Wallace et ux. </em>v. <em>Taliaferro et ux. 2 </em>Call 447. His first and general authority is as executor, and notwithstanding the union of the two characters of executor and legatee in right of his wife, and though not a single debt be due, his assent to the legacy\u2019s vesting in him as legatee is as necessary to vest it in himself, as it would be to vest it in another. The consequence is that if the husband dies without such election, the legacy survives to the wife. <em>Baker v. Hall, </em>12 Ves. 496. <em>Wall </em>v. <em>Tomlinson, 16 </em>Ves. 413. I cannot perceive any material distinction between these cases and the case at bar. Though <em>Worthington </em>as administrator of <em>Morrow </em>had a right to retain what he received as administrator of <em>Rutherford, </em>for the payment of the debt to <em>Morrow, </em>Toller 296. yet as this right depended upon the situation of <em>Rutherford\u2019s </em>estate, upon the comparative dignity of the demands against it, and (if the funds were derived from the realty) upon the right of the creditor <em>Morrow </em>to charge the realty, and if he had right, then upon the proportion be was entitled to receive, it would be <em>going </em>far to say that the funds as soon as received should be passed to the credit of <em>Morrow, </em>with or without the consent of the administrator of <em>Rutherford. </em>It cannot be denied, I think, that he <em>might </em>have refused so to appropriate the funds. Suppose he had in fact refused: suppose he had in fact applied the funds to the payment of <em>Rutherford\u2019s </em>simple contract debts: would it still have been said that the funds had come to the hands of <em>Morrow\u2019s </em>administrator, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>when in fact he had wasted the estate of <em>Rutherford </em>by failing to pay off a debt of superiour dignity ? Would not <em>Rutherford\u2019s </em>estate still be liable for this debt, and would not the sureties of <em>Worthington </em>in the bond be chargeable (if the bond were valid) for his failure to make a due appropriation of the funds which came to his hands as administrator? I apprehend they would, most assuredly; for he has received funds, and has <em>done no act </em>by which they have been paid over to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">If the fact of refusal to appropriate the funds of the debtor estate to that of the creditor excludes the idea of such actual appropriation, the facts in this case are well nigh decisive as to that matter; for <em>Worthington </em>received all those funds anteriaur to the settlement of his account as administrator of <em>Morrow\u2019s </em>estate, and upon that settlement gave no credit for the amount; and what is yet more decisive of his declining to pass over the funds from one estate to the other, he has not, in his settlement of his account as administrator of <em>Ruther</em>ford, charged that estate with <em>one cent </em>passed over in payment of the debt to <em>Morrow.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">It is said, however, that he <em>ought to have done it, </em>and therefore the law will intend that he <em>has done it. </em>That he ought to have done it, is most true; etnd that for omitting to do it, his sureties (if the bond were good) w'ould be responsible, is not less&lt;,true. But why shall the law <em>intend, </em>against the obvious intentions of <em>Worthington, </em>that he has done that which he not only did not do, but which he obviously <em>intentionally omitted </em>to do; when such intendment can only serve to shift a burden from one set of sureties to another? Intendments of law are often fictions. Fictions are introduced to effect the ends of justice, and the law never will permit them to work injustice: and what injustice would be more gross than, upon a mere fiction, to transfer the responsibility of the acts of an administrator from one-set of sureties to another? The last act of <em>Worthington </em>in relation to these funds (of which we know any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>thing) is the receipt of this money. For this receipt, and the proper application of the money, his <em>Rutherford </em>sureties would have been responsible, and they could not discharge that responsibility except by shewing that in point of fact he had properly applied them. It would indeed be a novelty, if the administrator is to be presumed to have done right, so as to exonerate his sureties, when there is demonstrative certainty that he has not done right, but has wasted and converted to his own use the estate for which he is responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">But it is said, <em>Coolcus </em>is responsible for not having collected the debt from <em>Rutherford's </em>estate. He is responsible, it must be admitted, <em>qua </em>surety; but he is not responsible <em>qua </em>administrator of <em>Morrow. </em>For there has been no negligence. The funds of <em>Rutherford's </em>estate came within the power of the administrator <em>Worthington, </em>and he is indeed responsible for not passing them over to <em>Morrow's </em>credit, and paying <em>Morrow's </em>debt with them; but <em>Coolcus </em>is not; for he had no power, either by suit or otherwise, to compel <em>Worthington </em>to pass the funds to <em>Morrow's </em>credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">In every view, therefore, I am of opinion that <em>Coolcus </em>is only responsible as surety, <em>pari passu </em>with the other sureties, and that the decree which charges him without bringing the other sureties before the court is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">As to the <em>Merritt </em>debt, there can be no doubt, I think, that the administrator should have been credited with it as paid on the 27th of May 1823; and the exception to the item was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">The decree of the court of appeals was as follows : \u201c This court is of opinion that the appellant should not have been held or made liable, <em>qua </em>administrator, for the acts, <em>devastavits </em>or defaults of his co-administrator <em>Worthington, </em>as he does not appear to have contributed to his <em>devastavit, </em>or to have paid over moneys to him, or to have joined in receiving funds which he has permitted him to retain: that as obligor in the joint bond en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>tered into for the faithful administration of the estate of ... ... <em>John Morrow, </em>ho became indeed responsible as surety for the <em>devastavit, </em>default and negligence of his co-ad- ...... ministrator, but was only so responsible m his character of surety, and W'as only chargeable <em>pari passu </em>with the other sureties in the bond. It was therefore premature and erroneous to decree against him in that character for the <em>devastavit </em>of <em>Worthington, </em>without having previously convened the other sureties before the court, that the burden might be equally borne by them all. And the court is further of opinion that the administration bond on (he estate of <em>Rutherford </em>was void, on the authority of <em>Frazier &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Frazier\u2019s ex\u2019ors &amp;c. </em>2 Leigh 642. and that neither <em>Coohus </em>nor the other sureties in that bond were bound by it: and moreover,, as the funds received from the <em>Rutherford </em>estate by <em>Worthington </em>were received in the execution of the trusts of <em>Rutherford\u2019s </em>will, <em>Coohus </em>was in no wise responsible as cotrustee or co-administrator for the receipt and embezzlement of the money by <em>Worthington, </em>inasmuch as there is no evidence establishing such co-operation in his acts as ought to charge him. But the court is of opinion that if it should ultimately appear that the funds so received by <em>Worthington </em>from <em>Rutherford\u2019s </em>estate ought to have been passed over by him to the credit of <em>Morrow\u2019s </em>estate, then the sureties for his administration of <em>Morrow\u2019s </em>estate, including the appellant <em>Coohus, </em>are responsible for his omission so to pass them over, and for his <em>devastavit </em>of those funds. And the court is further of opinion that the chancellor did not err in overruling the plaintiffs\u2019 fourth exception; the court being of opinion that the payment of the <em>Merritt </em>debt by <em>Hageley </em>on the 27lh of May 1823, at the request of <em>Coohus </em>and on his promise of repayment, should be considered as a payment of that date, whatever might be the date of his repayment to <em>Hageley. </em>Therefore it is considered that the decree be reversed with costs, and the cause remanded &amp;c. for new parties and farther proceedings.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
