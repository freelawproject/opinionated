Wright, Samuel J. Boothe </em>and <em>Polly </em>his wife, <em>Ma.rcellus Windsor </em>and <em>Betsy </em>his wife, and <em>Judith Clark. </em>The bill was filed in October 1827. After setting forth the provisions of the testator\u2019s will, and the several events above detailed, it charged, that at the time of <em>Ann Garner's </em>death she had in her possession 12 slaves and 104 acres of land, of the property devised and bequeathed by the will of the testator as aforesaid ; and that, soon after her death, the county court of <em>Westmoreland </em>appointed commissioners to divide her land and slaves among the persons entitled thereto according to the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>visions of the testator\u2019s will; in pursuance of which appointment, and of the supposed intent of the said testator, the commissioners divided the slaves into three equal portions, of which <em>Benedict Lamkin </em>look one, <em>Martha Oldham </em>another, and the plaintiffs, together with the other descendants of <em>Elizabeth Lewis, </em>took the third ; the 104 acres of land being allotted to <em>Jane Wroe </em>as equivalent to a third part of the slaves. That the plaintiffs were now advised, and believed, that this division was contrary to the intent and meaning of the will, according to the true construction whereof the said land and slaves should have been divided into five equal portions, of which <em>B. Lamkin </em>was entitled to one, <em>Jane Wroe </em>to another, <em>Martha Oldham </em>to a third, and the plaintiffs to the remaining two. That at the death of <em>Jane Wroe, </em>she held 27 slaves and a tract of land, of the property devised and bequeathed by the testator\u2019s will as aforesaid ; and that, at the term of the county court of <em>Westmoreland </em>held in March 1827, commissioners were appointed to divide the land and slaves last mentioned, according to the provisions of the said will; in pursuance of which appointment, the commissioners had proceeded to divide the said land and slaves into three equal portions, of which <em>B. Lamkin </em>had taken one, <em>Martha Oldham </em>another, and the plaintiffs between them the third. That <em>Benedict D. Wright, Samuel J. Boothe </em>and wife, <em>Marcellus Windsor </em>and wife and <em>Judith Clark </em>claimed to be entitled to some portion of the said land and slaves, as heirs and distributees of <em>Elizabeth Lewis: </em>whereas the plaintiffs insist that they wrongfully received a portion of the property held by <em>Ann Garner </em>for life as aforesaid, and that they have no title to any portion of that which was held by <em>Jane Wroe, </em>which, last, the plaintiffs contend, should be equally divided among the said <em>B. Lamkin, Martha Oldham </em>and the plaintiffs, a fourth part to each. That the plaintiffs had repeatedly urged on the defendants the propriety of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>redivision of the said property, but they had invariably refused to consent. Wherefore the bill prayed that the said defendants might be compelled to answer the premises; that the court would decree a redivision, as well of the property held by <em>Ann Garner, </em>as of that held by <em>Jane Wroe, </em>according to the true intent and meaning of the testator\u2019s will; that the defendants might be required to account for the rents and profits of the land and slaves improperly withheld from the plaintiffs, and the value of such as had been sold; and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-4\"><em>B. Lamkin </em>and <em>Martha Oldham </em>(the latter in her own right and as administratrix of <em>Jane Wroe) </em>answered, admitting the division of the property held by <em>Ann Garner </em>and the said <em>Jane, </em>respectively, as stated in the bill. But they said, the plaintiff William <em>Wright </em>himself administered on the estate of <em>Ann Garner, </em>and on his motion the county court of <em>Westmoreland, </em>appointed the commissioners to divide the property held by the said <em>Ann; </em>and both of the plaintiffs were present at the division, and consented thereto. And as that division was made in 1820, and these respondents had ever since beld peaceable and adverse possession of the slaves thereby allotted to them, they prayed the benefit of the statute of limitations, so far as respected any claim of the plaintiffs to those slayes. They further stated, that the commissioners for dividing the property held by Jane <em>Wroe </em>were chosen by the parties interested, among whom were the plaintiffs; and the division was made in the presence of the said parties. In proof whereof, respondents exhibited a report signed by those commissioners, which stated, that they made the division of the slaves of <em>Jane Wroe </em>by the <em>request and consent </em>of <em>B. Lamkin, Martha Oldham, Benedict Wright, William Wright, Samuel J. Boothe, Benedict D. Wright, </em>and <em>Samuel Clark </em>who intermarried with <em>Hannah Lewis ; </em>that this division was made on the 28th of December 1826; that on the 22d of January following,' an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>was made by the county court of <em>Westmoreland, </em>directing the said commissioners to divide the <em>land and slaves </em>of <em>Jane Wroe </em>deceased; and that, having already divided the said slaves as above mentioned, they proceeded, in conformity to the order, to make a division of the land. Respondents alleged moreover, that upon the death of <em>Hannah Middleton </em>without issue, <em>Elizabeth Lewis </em>the mother of the complainants received one fifth of said <em>Hannahs </em>estate, which portion, at the death of said <em>Elizabeth, </em>was divided among her children. And they insisted that upon the true construction of the testator\u2019s will, the said <em>Elizabeth, </em>was not entitled to any part of <em>Hannah Middleton's </em>estate; nor, upon the respective deaths of <em>Ann Garner </em>and <em>Jane Wroe, </em>were the children and descendants of the said <em>Elizabeth </em>entitled to any part of the property held by the said <em>Ann </em>and <em>Jane; </em>but the portions of the said <em>Hannah, Ann </em>and <em>Jane </em>ought to have been divided among the other daughters of the testator, and <em>B. La.mkin </em>the grandson (whose mother was a daughter of the testator, and died before him) to the entire exclusion of <em>Elizabeth </em>and her descendants: so that the plaintiffs had in fact received the benefit of one fifth of <em>Hannah Middleton's </em>estate, one fourth of <em>Ann Garner's, </em>and one third of <em>Jane Wroe's, </em>to the prejudice of these respondents. And though the length of time which had elapsed since the division of the two first-mentioned estates might prevent any disturbance thereof at this day, yet respondents insisted that the plaintiffs should be compelled to pay over what they had received from <em>Jane Wroe's </em>estate, if indeed the court would undertake to interfere at all wdth the <em>consent division </em>of that estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-4\"><em>Marcellus Windsor </em>and wife and <em>Judith Clark </em>answered, that the division of the estates of <em>Ann Garner </em>and <em>Jane Wroe </em>was made by consent of all the parties interested, including the plaintiffs; and that, in making such division, the commissioners acted in the character <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>of arbitrators authorized to expound the will of the testator. They denied that the construction contended for by the plaintiffs was <em>the </em>proper construction of the will $ but even if it were, they insisted that the plaintiffs had yielded all their claim to the portion of slaves which had been allotted to these respondents. And as to the slaves received from <em>Ann Garner's </em>estate, they relied upon the statute of limitations as a bar to any claim of the plaintiffs thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-4\"><em>Benedict D. Wright </em>and <em>Samuel </em>J. <em>Boothe </em>and wife failed to answer the <em>bill; </em>and as to those defendants it was taken <em>pro confesso.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-5\">The depositions of the four commissioners who made the division of <em>Jane Wroe's </em>property (two of whom had also acted as commissioners in dividing that of <em>Ann Garner) </em>were taken and filed in the cause. The witnesses concurred in stating that both those divisions were made with the consent of the parties interested, including the <em>plaintiffs; </em>but they further stated that the design and intention, as well of the parties as of the commissioners, had been to, divide the property in accordance with the directions of <em>Benedict Middleton's </em>will, and that the division which was actually made, in each case, was supposed at the time to correspond with the rights of the parties under the true construction of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-6\">At the hearing in October 1830, the chancellor dismissed the bill, with costs.

The division which was made of <em>Jane Wroe's </em>estate is assailed as illegal, so far as respects that part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>of her slaves which she derived from her father, under the limitations of his will. The bill, indeed, demands a repartition of the lands and slaves held by <em>Ann Garner </em>under the will, as well as of those held by <em>Jane Wroe </em>in the same manner. I understand the counsel, however, as confining the question to the case of <em>Jane Wroe's </em>slaves, as the statute of limitations has secured the title under the partition of <em>Ann Garner's; </em>and I shall accordingly consider that question only.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">It is <em>conceded </em>on all hands (hat the limitation over is good, and the true question is whether under that limitation the parties are to take <em>per capita </em>or <em>per stirpes </em>? I am of opinion that they take <em>per stirpes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">There can be no question that the devise in the first clause of the will indicates the intention that the devisees and legatees should take <em>per stirpes. </em>The estate is given to <em>Benedict Lamlcin, </em>the representative of a deceased daughter, and to the five living daughters, each to have one sixth; and it is most distinctly declared that <em>Elizabeth Lewis </em>is to have only one sixth, which sixth is to pass in remainder to her children. As original takers, then, under the will, the children of <em>Elizabeth Lewis </em>took by stocks, and not <em>per capita. </em>Is there any thing in the will from which it is <em>necessarily </em>to be inferred that the testator abandoned this distinctly defined intention of giving <em>per stirpes </em>instead of <em>per </em>capita? I think not. Indeed, such a construction would involve inconsistency in the will. For let us suppose that <em>Hannah, </em>the first decedent among the devisees except <em>Elizabeth Lewis, </em>had died before <em>Elizabeth Lewis </em>instead of after her. In that event, according to the will, <em>Elizabeth Lewis </em>would have taken one fifth of <em>Hannah's </em>portion (either for life or in fee, it matters not which) unless we suppose her to be excluded, or her children to take with her. But she cannot be excluded ; for she is one of the survivors, and the share of the deceased daughter is to be divided among the survivors. Neither can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>it be believed that the testator intended to give her one <em>, ' </em>, portion of <em>Hannah's </em>share, and her four children each one equal portion, which must be the case if they take <em>per capita; </em>for thus one stock, viz. <em>Elizabeth </em>and <em>her </em>family, would take <em>five </em>times as much as either of the other stocks. Had <em>Elizabeth </em>survived <em>Hannah, </em>therefore, it would seem clear that she would have taken one fifth in absolute property, or for life only, with remainder to her children. In either case the construction contended for would be rejected, and the estate would go to the stock, instead of the descendants <em>per capita.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AR5\"><em>If </em>such then would have been the <em>effect </em>of the will if <em>Elizabeth </em>had died <em>after </em>her sisters, can it be seriously contended that it is to receive a different construction, because she died <em>before </em>them ? If We stick to the <em>letter, </em>there is as much reason for applying the partition <em>per capita </em>to the one case as the other. But in truth there is no absolute necessity for its application in either. The will furnishes another among the innumerable instances in which unskilful draughtsmen have used one \u2022set of words to provide'for many shifting contingencies, and have welded together what ought to have been kept separate and distinct. It declares that \u201c if either of the daughters or grandchildren die without issue, his or her share shall be equally divided among the survivors of them and their heirs.\u201d I incline to think that this is to be understood distributively, thus: \u201cif either of my daughters or my grandson <em>B. Eamlcin </em>should die without issue, his or her share [that is, one sixth of the whole] shall be equally divided among my surviving daughters and grandson aforesaid; and if either of my other grandchildren (children of <em>Elizabeth </em>Lewis) die without issue, his or her share [namely, \u00bf of -g-th] shall be equally divided .among the said surviving grandchildren.\u201d If this be the just construction, then if <em>Hannah </em>had died before <em>Elizabeth, </em>the latter would have taken one fifth of her portion, which upon her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>death would pass to her children as distributees, \u2014 not as purchasers; but as she died before her sisters, she and her children took no portion of their estates. This seems indeed the more reasonable, as upon <em>her </em>death her sisters took no portion of hers, but it passed to her children by virtue of the limitation over. The parties, however, have acquiesced in a partition which has treated them as entitled <em>jure </em>representationis, and as they have not sought to set it aside, I am not disposed to disturb <em>it; </em>the less so, as in cases like this it is altogether impossible to devise a <em>projet </em>which is not liable to objection, and I am very sensible there may be objections to this. Perhaps, indeed, the safest ground on which we can rest is, that as the construction is difficult, and the proper interpretation of the will, to say the least, uncertain and obscure, it is best to adhere to that which was placed upon it by the partition of <em>Ann Garner's </em>estate in 1820, and apparently acquiesced in by all concerned until the filing of this bill in 1827. This, of itself, is a sufficient justification of the decree of the chancery <em>court; </em>which should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Cabell and Brockenbko\u00fcg-h, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
