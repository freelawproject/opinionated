That the said <em>Larkin Rogers </em>died under age, and without issue, in April' or May 1779; but that three of the slaves had been allotted to him in the month of March preceding. That the plaintiff <em>Catharine </em>was, in the event which had happened, entitled, by the devise aforesaid, to one-sixth of the said <em>Larkin\u2019s </em>moiety of the lands and of the said three slaves; but the said <em>John Rogers, </em>claiming the said moiety and the said three slaves as eldest brother and heir at law to the said <em>Larkin Rogers, </em>had removed the slaves to Kentucky, where he now resides, and had sold the whole 645 acres of land to the said <em>Thomas Pollard </em>for <em>\u00a3 </em>1200; and that the plaintiffs are willing to confirm the sale, and receive their proportion of the money instead of the land; and, for that purpose, had, after the plaintiff <em>Catharine </em>came of age, tendered a deed of release to <em>Pollard, </em>and requested him to pay them <em>\u00a3 </em>100 out of the <em>\u00a3 </em>200 retained in his hands under the decree of the court of appeals in the preceding case of <em>Pollard </em>v. Ro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>gers and others, </em>until the title of the plaintiff <em>Catharine </em>should be assured to him. That <em>Pollard </em>refused to accept the deed, and payment. The bill therefore prayed, that <em>John Rogers </em>might be decreed to pay, to the plaintiffs, the. \u00bf\u00a3100 aforesaid with interest, and to deliver them a sixth of the said three slaves and their increase. That <em>Pollard </em>might be restrained from paying away or secreting the debts and effects of <em>Rogers </em>until the further order of the court, and that the plaintiff might have general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-9\">The answer of <em>Pollard </em>admitting the sale of the land; the tender, by the complainants, of the release, more than six months after the plaintiff <em>Catharine </em>came of age; and his refusal to pay the \u00bf\u00a3 100, insists, that the issue prescribed by the court of appeals ought to be directed ; and, if found for the plaintiff <em>Catharine </em>that her sixth of <em>Larhin Rogers\u2019s </em>moiety of the land should be assigned her, and another issue directed to ascertain the damages of the defendant in consequence of the eviction of that share of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-10\">This answer is replied to; and a copy of the record in the former suit filed, as an exhibit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-11\">There was \u00e1n order of publication, against <em>John Rogers </em>as an absent defendant, duly executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-12\">The high court of chancery decreed that, upon the complainant\u2019s executing a release of the plaintiff <em>Catharine\u2019s </em>proportion of the land, and the plaintiff <em>Parish Coleman </em>entering into bond with security in the penalty of \u00bf\u00a3 200, conditioned to be void, if upon trial of the issue directed by the decree of the court of appeals, the plaintiff <em>Catharine </em>should appear not to be entitled to any part of the lands sold, the defendant <em>Thomas Pollard </em>should pay to the plaintiffs <em>\u00a3 </em>100, with interest from the time when he was bound by the judgment, to have paid that sum to the defendant <em>John Rogers; </em>and, upon such payment being made, that the injunction should be perpetual as to the said <em>\u00a3 </em>100 with interest; and that the defendants should pay costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-13\"><em>Pollard </em>appealed, from the decree, to the' court of appeals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The appellant\u2019s counsel contended, that it was not competent to <em>Coleman </em>and his wife to substitute themselves in the room of <em>Rogers, </em>and to insist upon the completion of the contract for their own,benefit, although he might choose to abandon it, or submit to the issue. That it might be inconvenient to <em>Pollard, </em>as he might have a discount or equity against <em>Rogers, </em>which he could not apply against the appellees. That the bond prescribed was contrary to the decree of the court of appeals, which had directed a similar one to be delivered up. That the appellees had a remedy at law, as they might bring their action and recover their proportion of the land; which was the correct course, as it would leave <em>Pollard </em>and <em>Rogers </em>to settle their own contract. That <em>Pollard </em>ought not to pay costs for not compounding <em>Rogerses </em>debt; for the latter might not agree to the composition, as he had never authorized it. That this was not like a foreign attachment against an absent defendant; because the appellees had no pecuniary demand against Rogers, but only desired to participate in his contract.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-3\"><em>Duval, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A50\">It does not appear that <em>Pollard </em>has any discount against Rogers/ and, if he gets the title of <em>Catharine, </em>it is all that is important to him, for his possession has never been disturbed, nor has he sustained any other inconvenience, which makes it necessary, as to him, to try the issue : the title is all that he, in conscience, has a right to; and it is immaterial whether he obtains it by the voluntary act of the appellees, or by the procurement of <em>Rogers. </em>The appellees are not, as represented by the appellant\u2019s counsel,\u2019intruders into the contract of <em>Rogers; </em>for the suit is in nature of a foreign attachment, and seeks to arrest the money which he will owe to the appellees, when the release is executed. This answers the objection respecting the bond; for although the decree does not say, expressly, to whom that is to be made payable, it is obvious that <em>John Rogers </em>was meant; and therefore, it is nothing more than the bond which the law requires, in suits against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>absent defendants. The costs perhaps ought to have been directed to be paid out of the residue of the .\u00bf\u00a3200; but the omission is of no consequence, as <em>Pollard </em>will have a right to retain them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b288-8\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b288-9\">Lyons, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ay8e\">delivered the resolution of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">The objection that the appellees cannot intrude themselves into the contract of <em>Rogers, </em>and insist upon the performance of it, is immaterial. For the contract is already confirmed by the decree in the former suit; and, as <em>Pollard </em>made Mrs. <em>Coleman </em>a party to that suit, and <em>Rogers </em>has left the state, she has a right to avail herself of the benefit of those proceedings in the best manner she can : and it is not perceived that <em>Pollard </em>can sustain any injury from the course pursued ; for the release of the plaintiffs will complete his title to the whole of the land ; and it must be unimportant to him who gets the money, provided he is discharged. For this court did not intend, by the decree in the former suit, that there should be an issue directed at all events, if the plaintiff <em>Catharine </em>did not release within six months after she came of age, should circumstances render it proper to dispense with it. The decree, as to that, meant to provide for the safety of <em>Pollard, </em>in case <em>Catharine </em>should appear to be. entitled, and refused to convey: in which event a jury was to ascertain the loss incurred by his having that part of the land taken from him. But, if instead of taking away the land, she conveys it without any addition to the price, his safety is completely attained; and there is no occasion for the issue, so far as respects <em>Pollard.</em>Besides the release offered is, in substance, a compliance with the decree; for the six months term was a limit which a court of equity would have relieved against, as <em>Pollard </em>was in possession, and could sustain no injury by the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">With regard to <em>Rogers, </em>the suit is against him as an absent defendant. The bill charges that <em>Larkin Rogers </em>died under age; and, in consequence thereof, that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number><em>Catharine has </em>become entitled to a sixth part of his moiety of the land; but that she is willing to confirm the sale, aqd to take her proportion of the purchase money. The defendant <em>Rogers </em>has not answered the bill; and therefore it must, as to him, be taken to be true. But, if so, there is no reason why the plaintiffs should not be permitted to ratify the sale, and take their share of the purchase money. For the election can do no prejudice to any body: not to <em>Pollard, </em>because he gets the land he bought: not to <em>Rogers, </em>because he is not entitled to this part of the money, and gets all the rest? without the risque of damages and costs, in consequence of eviction. So that, as to him, it is like the sale of a chattel by the finder; in which case, the true owner may either pursue the chattel, or bring <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>against the vendor for the price. In short, <em>Pollard, </em>upon obtaining the release, will owe the money; and as <em>Rogers, </em>were he to receive it, would owe it to the plaintiffs, the latter have a right to be substituted for him, and to demand it of <em>Pollard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">As to the bond, the answer given by the appellee\u2019s counsel is satisfactory. ' It was intended to indemnify <em>Rogers, </em>and not <em>Pollard, </em>who would be indemnified by the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The order that both defendants shall pay the costs, does not injure the appellant; for there will be a surplus of the \u00a3200, out of which he may retain them.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The decree is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
