At the first trial of the cause, <em>John Banks </em>was examined as a witness for the defendant; but, the jury disagreeing, no verdict was rendered. <em>Lea\u2019s </em>counsel issued subposnas for his witnesses in due time before the next court; but, <em>Banks </em>being absent on a visit to Norfolk, the sheriff had not an opportunity of summoning him. When the cause was called. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number><em>Lea\u2019s </em>counsel moved for a continuance, on account of the non-attendance of <em>Banks ; </em>and, by way of inducement, offered to admit the depositions of the witnesses for <em>Foushee, </em>instead of their <em>viva voce </em>testimony, upon the trial of the cause : But the court refused the continuance, and <em>Foushee </em>obtained a verdict and judgment. On the next day, <em>Lea\u2019s </em>counsel moved for a new trial; but there being only four justices on the bench, one of whom had not sat in the cause, and therefore declined to give any opinion, the court refused to go into the question, and the motion fell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-9\"><em>Lea </em>then filed a bill, in the high court of chancery, stating the circumstances aforesaid; denying that the contract had ever been perfected; and charging that the treaty was entirely off, without completion; and that <em>Foushee </em>afterwards offered to rent the house to <em>Banks. </em>Prayer for injunction, and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-10\">The answer insisted that the contract was complete; and that the offer, to <em>Banks, </em>was after the complainant had refused to perform. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-11\"><em>Banks </em>and others were examined with respect to the contract, as well as to prove the issuing of the subpoenas, the absence of <em>Banks, </em>the refusal of the continuance, and the failure of the motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-12\">Upon a motion to dissolve the injunction, the following order was made : \u201c The court being of opinion that the injunction ought not to be dissolved ; by consent of the parties by their counsel, a new trial is to be had between them in the county court of Henrico, and the verdict of the jury thereupon is to be certified to this court for their information.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-13\">The venue was afterwards upon the motion of <em>Lea\u2019s </em>counsel changed to the district court of Fredericksburg; then, on the motion of <em>Foushee\u2019s </em>counsel, to the district court of King &amp; Queen; and subsequently on the motion of <em>Lea\u2019s </em>counsel back again to Fredericksburg: but, by consent of the parties, none of the landlords or tenants of houses in that town were to be of the jury,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The cause was tried in Fredericksburg without any further objection; and a verdict was found in favour of the defendant, the court ordering it to be certified to the chancellor, That strong testimony was offered on both sides, sufficient \u201c to have established a verdict in a court of law in favour of either plaintiff or defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-4\">In consequence of which, <em>Foushee </em>made affidavit, That he had a little before the trial discovered, that <em>Goode </em>was a material witness for him, but had not spmmoned him, because he had understood that he had received a fall from his horse, which would render him unable to attend: and that he had likewise discovered since the trial that <em>Henry Banks </em>was a material witness for him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-5\"><em>Goode </em>deposed, that upon going into the above mentioned house one day, he found <em>Foushee </em>there with a stranger, and asked him if he had got a tenant for it. That <em>Foushee </em>answered, that that gentleman had taken it; and was when finished to have it for a store. That the conversation was loud enough for the stranger to have heard it; but that he said nothing: and that <em>Foushee </em>told him, at the time, that the stranger\u2019s name was <em>Lea.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-6\"><em>Henry Banks </em>deposed, that before <em>Lea </em>left Richmond, he understood from <em>Beane </em>that the former had rented the house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-7\">The court of chancery made the following decree: \u201c The court approving the said verdict found before the district court, and rejecting a motion made last term and repeated in this, to direct another trial of the issue, doth adjudge, order and decree, that the injunction obtained by the plaintiff to stay the execution of the judgment recovered against him by the defendant in the county court of Henrico be perpetual;\u201d and ordered that the appellant should pay all the costs, except those of the last trial in the county court. <em>Foushee </em>appealed to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-8\"><em>Campbell </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXZ3\">The court of law refused the continuance upon the same evidence as to the attendance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>of <em>John Banks; </em>and the court of chancery could not examine whether their judgment, in that respect, was right. The testimony of that witness, however, was unimportant, and could have had no operation had he been present, as the general evidence was in favour of the appellant: But were it otherwise, it would not help the appellee; for he ought to have moved for a new trial upon the day of the verdict, and if he neglected to do so, it was his own fault. The trial in Fredericksburg was improper; for the consent was confined to Henrico, and the chancellor had no authority to alter it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-9\"><em>Wickham </em>and <em>Lee, contra.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ak5\">The appellee was taken by surprize; for <em>John Banks </em>was a material witness, as he proves that <em>Foushee </em>offered to rent him the house after the time when it is pretended that the contract was perfected ; and, as the efforts to obtain his attendance were defeated by events over which he had no controul, the continuance ought to have been granted. The circumstances prove that the contract was never completed, and that both parties had abandoned it. For <em>Lea </em>did nothing under it, and <em>Foushee </em>both offered to rent the house to <em>Banks, </em>and actuallyleased it to <em>Graves. </em>The appellee therefore was not only improperly ruled into a trial, but the verdict was contrary to the testimony produced; and it is probable that the county court would, upon both grounds, have granted a new trial, if the justices who sat in the cause, had all been upon the bench when the motion for it was made. Consequently, it was the duty of the chancellor to interpose; for the accidental change of the members of the court ought not to injure the appellee, as there was no unnecessary delay in making the motion, and many causes might have led to ihe postponement, such as the lateness of the day, the want of preparation on the part of counsel, and the obtaining further testimony to shew the steps taken to procure the attendance of <em>Banks. </em>Be that as it may, however, no exception to the jurisdiction of the court of chancery is taken in the answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>as the act of 1787 requires, and the new trial was consented to after the injunction was obtained : which circumstances put an end to all controversy upon that point. The change of the venue was not improper. For although the consent was limited to the county of Henrico, yet as an impartial decision was the object of the new trial, the chancellor might, in order to obtain that, direct the jury to be-assembled from any vicinage which' justice required ; especially as it was not objected to, but finally concurred in, by the stipulation, that none of the landlords or tenants of houses in Fredericksburg should be of the pannel, that there might he no bias in the minds of the jurors. The testimony of <em>Goode </em>and <em>Henry Banks </em>is immaterial. For it does not appear that <em>Lea </em>heard the conversation spoken of by <em>Goode; </em>but, if he had, he was not bound to remark upon it: and <em>Banks </em>relates the hearsay declaration of Deane, who, at that time, was'not the agent of <em>Lea.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-4\"><em>Marshall </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzY\">Sufficient cause for setting aside the first verdict was not shewn; and therefore the chancellor ought not to have interfered. In <em>Street </em>v. <em>Cockran, </em>the cause was tried out of course in the absence of witnesses, and a heavy verdict given, yet a new trial was refused upon that point: And, in <em>Hoomes </em>v. <em>Kuhn, </em>a material witness was absent; and, although the defendant had made great efforts to procure his attendance, the right of the chancellor to set aside the verdict was denied. Those cases were stronger than the present; for here all the important testimony was before the county court, and that of <em>John Banks </em>was too slight to have varied the result. But due diligence was not used to procure his attendance, as a subpoena might have been sent to Norfolk. Be that as it may, however, the county court had decided it upon the same evidence that was before the chancellor, and he could not review' their judgment. The contract is proved, and the offers to <em>Banks </em>and <em>Graves </em>were not made until <em>Lea </em>had refused to perform, and then it was done with a view to lighten loss, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>charging him with the difference in the rents only; which proves that the merits are decidedly with <em>Foushee; </em>and that he never abandoned the contract. It was not necessary to plead to the jurisdiction of the court of chancery, there being no ground of equity stated in the bill; for the appellee ought to have moved for a new trial at the time of the verdict, as the change of magistrates might have been foreseen, and neither the lateness of the day, nor the want of preparation, is alledged in the bill, or proved in the cause. There was no consent to a new trial: for it was merely an arrangement to facilitate the execution of a measure which the chancellor had resolved to take. But the consent, whatever it was, extended to Henrico only; and the court could not change the terms without mutual agreement. Such agreement, however, was not obtained ; for the change made was the act of the court, and not of <em>Foushee, </em>who was not bound to take a special exception, as the error appeared upon the record. The stipulation, with regard to the landlords and tenants of houses in Fredericksburg, was merely to guard against the effects of the order which the chancellor had previously made; and therefore it cannot be tortured into a consent either to the new trial, or to the change of the venue. As the judges of the district court have certified that the testimony on both sides was equal, that of <em>Goode </em>and <em>Henry Banks </em>might have weight with the jury; and therefore an opportunity of laying it before them should be afforded the appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b324-4\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b324-5\">Lyons, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AAFn\">delivered the resolution of the court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The first objection taken to the decree was, that the court of chancery could not interfere, as the motion for a continuance had been overruled by the county court, and a verdict found, upon the merits, before a competent tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">This makes it necessary to consider the power of a court of equity to grant relief, where injustice has been unexpectedly done, by a judgment at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The ordinary jurisdiction of the chancellor is confined to fraud, force and accident; but it is sometimes concurrent with the law, and occasionally affords relief, where the law gives no remedy; or judgment has been obtained from inadvertence or surprize. <em>Heard </em>v. Stomford, Cas. T. Talb. 174. <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Bridgman, </em>Prec. Ch. 233. Not that it creates a new right in the former case, or exercises appellate jurisdiction in the latter : But, in the first, it merely gives effect to existing rights which the law would enforce, if its forms permitted; and, in the second, it prevents the party, who has improperly acquired an unconscionable advantage at law, from making use of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Apply these principles to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">It appears that <em>John Banks </em>was a material witness for the defendant, and that due diligence had been used to procure his attendance, as the subpoena had been sent, in time, to the sheriff of the county where he resided, but the attempt to get him failed from his unexpected absence, which prevented the officer from serving it; and not from the fault of <em>Lea, </em>who lived in Philadelphia, and had not an opportunity of taking any other steps. In this situation, the appellee\u2019s counsel moved for a continuance of the cause, and offered reasonable terms to obtain it: But the motion was rejected, and very heavy damages assessed against him by the jury. This was plainly a surprize upon the appellant, arising from an accident, which had not been anticipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">That, however, was not all. The counsel for the appellee, thinking the verdict was contrary to evidence, moved for a new trial, which would have afforded the court an opportunity of revising their opinion with respect to the continuance, but the motion failed from the absence of one of the justices, and not from any unusual, or improper, delay. For, although it was not made at the time of the verdict, yet that was not materia], as it was not foreseen that the members of the court would be changed, and the counsel might have had very just grounds for postponing the motion until the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"A6I\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Under this view of the cause, it is impossible to say, that the trial was fair; or that the verdict ought to have stood. For the ease is much stronger than that of <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Bridgman, </em>where the defendant was relieved, because he had lost the cause by failing to prove a copy of the judgment on which he relied, although it did not appear, that any accident had occurred to prevent it.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The cases of <em>Cockran </em>v. <em>Street, </em>and <em>Hoomes </em>v. <em>Kuhn, </em>do not conflict with this opinion. For the first was so far from being a case of accident, that the court expressly said, that the evidence was too slight to establish the fact of the alledged surprize : And, in the second, the defendant had not only neglected to summon one witness entirely, and sent the subpoena, (by a servant instead of the sheriff,) to the other, so late, that there was not the least probability that he could reach the court in time; but he made no motion for a continuance, and had other witnesses who either did or might have proved the same things.</p>\n<p id=\"AA9\">The next objection taken to the decree was, that the venue was changed from Henrico to Fredericksburg, notwithstanding the parties had consented to a trial at the for- - mer place.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">But the court thinks that objection not material. A fair and impartial trial was the object; and to effect <em>that, </em>the chancellor was as much bound, if circumstances required it, to change the venue, as if he had directed the place himself, and found it necessary, afterwards, to change it. For it would be absurd to suppose, that when he had ordered a new trial for the purposes of justice, he was to suffer it to proceed at a place where it could not be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">There is nothing to impeach the verdict at Fredericksburg. For the parties went, voluntarily, to trial; and the court has certified that the testimony, on both sides, was equal. The chancellor did right, therefore, in declaring himself satisfied, as the jury were the proper judges of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>But it was said, that the affidavits of <em>Goode </em>and <em>Henry Banks </em>laid a sufficient foundation for another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">The court, however, is of a different opinion. For no application was made to continue the cause on account of the absence of <em>Goode, </em>and there is no proof when the testimony of <em>Banks </em>was discovered, except the,affidavit of the appellant. But independent of those circumstances, the testimony of both of them is immaterial. For, if (which does not appear) <em>Lea </em>had heard the conversation between <em>Goode </em>and <em>Foushee, </em>he was not bound to attend to it, as it was not addressed to him: And <em>Banks </em>relates only the hearsay declaration of <em>Beane, </em>who, at that time, had no agency in the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Upon the whole, the court are satisfied with the decree j and it is unanimously affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
