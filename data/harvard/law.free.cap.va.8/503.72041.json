He escaped a second time, and an escape warrant was issued against him by a justice of <em>Nicholas </em>county on the 10th of August 1826, under which he was taken on the 30th of April following, by the sheriff of Greenbrier, and committed to the jail of that county. At the election in <em>Nicholas </em>county in April 1829 for a delegate to the general assembly, an equal number of votes was given for <em>Stuart </em>and the opposing candidate, and the high sheriff giving the casting vote in favour of Stuart, he was returned duly -elected. In November following, being shortly before the session of the general assembly, <em>Stuart </em>presented a petition to a judge of the general court, stating <em>that he </em>was advised that it was his duty to attend the legislature, and praying a writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>The writ was awarded him, and upon the return thereof the judge ordered that he should be delivered from the custody of the jailor, according to the act of assembly. .He failed, however, to return to jail after his privilege as a member of assembly had <em>expired; </em>and on the first of May 1830, a justice of <em>Greenbrier </em>issued an escape warrant against him; but it seems that he was never again taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-4\">After the writ of <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>had been levied, <em>Christopher Stuart, </em>the brother of <em>David, </em>died, having made a will bearing date the 24th of December 1825, by which, after directing that all his just debts should be paid, he gave to his brother <em>David </em>a lot in the town of <em>Summersville. </em>At January term 1826 of <em>Nicholas </em>county court, the will was admitted to record, and <em>David Stuart </em>qualified as executor thereof. Very soon after his testator\u2019s death, <em>David Stuart </em>conveyed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the lot in <em>Summersville </em>to <em>Samuel Neil. </em>The deed bears date the 10th of January 1826, was admitted to record in <em>Nicholas </em>county court at February term, and purports to be for the consideration of 800 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-3\">In August 1833, <em>Hamilton's </em>executors filed a bill in the circuit court of <em>Nicholas </em>against <em>David Stuart </em>in his own right and as executor of <em>Christopher Stuart, </em>and against <em>Samuel Neil, </em>alleging that the testator\u2019s personal estate was more than sufficient to discharge his debts; claiming a lien upon the lot in <em>Summersville </em>by virtue of the proceedings before <em>mentioned; </em>charging that the deed to <em>Neil </em>was fraudulent'in fact, and asking a decree for the sale of the property. The defendants answered, denying all fraud, and alleging that the deed was made to satisfy a <em>Iona fide </em>debt which <em>Neil </em>had discharged as the surety of <em>Stuart. </em>They denied that the plaintiffs had any lien by virtue of their decree or execution, but insisted that if any such lien existed, it was only on a moiety. Depositions were taken by the plaintiffs, proving that the debt could not be made out of <em>Stuart </em>except by a sale of the property sought to be subjected ; that no one occupied the premises; and that the lot was cultivated by a tenant, whose rent was only 3 or <em>5 </em>dollars a year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-4\">The circuit court was of opinion, first, that although the <em>ca. sa. </em>had been levied, yet as the debtor had escaped, the executors might again resort to an <em>elegit; </em>and secondly, that there was a lien still remaining by virtue of the levy of the <em>ca. sa. </em>\u201c To hold,\u201d said, the judge, \u201c that the creditor has lost the <em>ca. sa. </em>lien, would be permitting the debtor to take advantage of his own wrong, and depriving the creditor of a right which the law gives him, and which is a perfect right, so far as any action is required from him ; for on procuring his <em>ca. sa. to </em>be served, his power is at an end. It is true that he cannot ordinarily enforce the lien the law has thus given him, until the happening of a certain event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>depending on the will of the debtor, that is, until the act of insolvency; but if that act of insolvency is prevented by the unlawful escape of the debtor, the creditor should not be prejudiced by it. He has done all that the law requires of him. The postponement of the consummation of his lien, so long as the debtor chooses to remain in custody., is intended for the benefit of the debtor alone ; and this he waives by his escape.\u201d The circuit court therefore adjudged the deed to <em>Neil </em>to be null and void, and decreed a sale of the house and lot. From this decree an appeal was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b526-4\">Reynolds, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b526-5\"><em>Price, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b526-6\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ADh\">I cannot think with the superiour court, that the escape of a debtor from execution at once invests the creditor with a right to charge his lands in equity, in the same manner as if he had. remained in custody and taken the benefit of the insolvent act. So to decide is to legislate, not to adjudicate. The provision might indeed be very just and very salutary, but the legislature alone can give it existence. Hitherto it has not done so. It has declared the conveyance of the debtor\u2019s lands, indeed, to the prejudice of the creditor, to be null and void; but while the debtor remains in custody, he is not liable to be proceeded against in equity.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It has moreover declared that the lands shall be bound from the date of the levy; but they nevertheless cannot be charged by bill in equity, until the debtor takes the insolvent oath. They are indeed so far bound, that no subsequent sale of them can divest the right of the creditor to charge them whenever his rights become consummate by insolvency. But until then, they are only bound in like manner as goods are bound by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>delivery of a <em>ji. fa. </em>to the sheriff, to which it is obvious the statute had reference. The levy therefore of the <em>ca. sa.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>constitutes a lien <em>sub modo </em>only, which can never be available until it is consummate by insolvency. If ihe defendant dies in execution, the creditor is then remitted to his new execution, and even in that case cannot, I conceive, resort to the lien of the <em>ca. sad </em>Still less can he do so in case of the escape; for the very proceeding against the land is a waiver of the right to take the <em>body, </em>and is therefore a waiver of the <em>ca. sa. </em>For if the debtor were to surrender himself, or to be taken by the jailor on an escape warrant, he must be discharged, unless we admit the monstrous hypothesis that the creditor may hold the body and yet proceed against the property. Indeed it is obvious that if the creditor <em>waives </em>his <em>ca. sa. </em>he cannot avail himself of its lien: and if he does <em>not </em>waive it, then the debtor may return to custody, or be taken by the officer, who has a right to sue out an escape warrant himself; and thus the bill of the creditor must either be defeated, or he must be recognized as having the double remedy against the lands and body. This cannot be conceded. I am therefore of opinion that the decree of the circuit court is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">We come next to enquire whether the creditor had a right to waive his <em>ca. sa. </em>upon the repeated escapes of <em>Stuart, </em>and to apply to a court of equity to relieve him as\" an <em>elegit </em>creditor. And I think he had. I am of opinion that upon the escape of a debtor, the creditor had at common law, and independent of the statute of Will. 3. a right to proceed against the sheriff, or to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>take the defendant, or to bring'an action of debt or <em>scire facias </em>upon the judgment, and thereupon have any execution whatever. Now if he has the <em>capacity </em>to issue a <em>scire facias quare executionem, non, </em>a <em>court of </em>equity consj\u00bfers-that sufficient, without the actual prosecution of the <em>scire facias, </em>provided it would have jurisdiction over the subject if the <em>scire facias </em>had been proceeded in, and the <em>elegit </em>actually issued and executed. This has been expressly adjudged in the case of a judgment which had been out of date many years. <em>Burroughs </em>v. <em>Elton, </em>11 Ves. 29. And the same principle was recognized and adopted by the whole court in the case' of <em>Fox\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Rootes and others, </em>4 Leigh 429. in note. In this case it appears clearly that the realty, which would be taken by an <em>elegit, </em>is altogether inadequate to pay the interest of the debt. Had it been issued, then, a court of equity would direct the sale of the moiety; and as there is a capacity to issue it, such sale may now be directed, unless the intervening rights of <em>Neil </em>forbid. Whether the transaction with him was <em>bona fie </em>or not, is, to say the least, so questionable, that it should not be respected until cleared of every fraudulent imputation by the verdict of a jury. This however will be unnecessary, as his rights must yield to those of the appellees, even though the transaction be perfectly fair. The right of the creditor, upon the escape of his debtor, to waive his unsatisfactory <em>ca. sa. </em>and to be remitted, upon suing out a <em>scire facias, </em>to his original right to sue out any species of execution at his election, revives in its full force the power and effect of his judgment. It resuscitates its lien upon all the lands the debtor had at the time of the judgment or which were subsequently acquired by him ; and the language of the <em>elegit, </em>and its command to the sheriff, will be precisely the same as if the <em>ca. sa. </em>never had issued. It will command him to deliver \u201ca moiety of all the lands and tenements whereof the debtor at the day of obtaining the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>ment was seized, or at any time afterwards,\u201d and thus will overreach all mesne conveyances to purchasers with notice, according to the opinion of this court in the case of <em>Fox's adm'r </em>v. <em>liootes and </em>others, before cited. And though the purchaser <em>Neil </em>denies nolice, it makes no difference, for in truth his conveyance was void by law, as it was made when the <em>ca. sa. </em>was in full force, and its lien unimpaired. He could not in good faith buy what the law declared that <em>Stuart </em>should not sell; and the deed to him being altogether inoperative, because it was avoided by Jaw <em>uno jlatu </em>with its creation, it cannot stand in the way of the <em>elegit </em>creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion to reverse the decree, and to send the cause back for further proceedings, leaving to the creditor the election of dismissing his bill and proceeding by <em>scire facias </em>and <em>elegit, </em>or of taking a decree in this case for the sale of a moiety of the lands in the proceedings mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Brooke and Parker, J. concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The decree of the court of appeals was in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">\u201c The court is of opinion that there is error in the decree of the circuit superiour court, in this, that it was not competent to the creditor to proceed in equity to subject the lands of the defendant to sale in like manner as if he had taken the benefit of the act for the relief of insolvent debtors, in which, case alone the lien of the <em>ca. sa. </em>can be made available. But the court is of opinion that upon the escape of the defendant, it was competent to the creditor either to retake him by an escape warrant, or to waive his <em>ca. sa. </em>and sue out a <em>scire facias quare executionem habere non debet, </em>and so proceed by <em>elegit </em>to extend the lands and tenements which were of <em>the </em>defendant at the date of the original judgment: and the court is further of opinion that having a capa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>city to sue out the <em>scire facias </em>and revive the lien, the creditor was entitled to come <em>into </em>equity to enforce a sale of the <em>moiety </em>extended (but no more); and that in this cause such decree should be rendered, in case the party should elect to take it, and it should appear that the rents and profits will not discharge the debt in a reasonable time. Therefore it is considered that the said decree be reversed and annulled, and the cause sent, back for further proceedings according to the principles above declared.\u201d</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b526-7\"> <em>Jackson </em>v.
