That the damages in the writ were laid in tobacco. 2. That no declaration was filed. 3. That, if the warrant of attorney had contained an express release, the release would have been void; because it was made prior to the judgment, and therefore had nothing to operate on. 4. That before the statute of jeofails, 4 <em>Ann. cap. </em>16, a judgment by confession might be reversed for defects which the prior statutes had cured, after verdict; and that, since that statute, judgments by confession stand upon the same ground as those upon verdicts : which cures informalities, but not substance; and consequently that the want of a declaration was still fatal: especially, as the declaration is the foundation of the judgment, and the act of assembly prohibits any proceedings without one; for, when a statute prescribes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>particular mode for conducting any business, no other can be pursued: and consent can never be implied to control the operation of a positive law.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b142-8\"><em>Marshall </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApR\">The want of a declaration was cured by the confession of judgment; for the rule is, that there should be a declaration; and not that a confession of judgment will be unavailing to supply the want of it. All pleading is founded in reason, and the object is to promote, not to prevent, the attainment of justice: but that principle will be subverted, if a solemn agreement like this, where the parties liquidate their disputes, and one grants time in consideration that the other will confess a judgment, is to be disregarded. The usual argument, of surprize, has no weight upon the present occasion; for the defendants stipulated the sum for which judgment should be entered against them; and, therefore, could be at no loss for information with regard to the nature of the demand. If a release of errors had been entered, at the time of the judgment, it would have barred the writ of <em>supersedeas </em>from the general court; and there is no difference, in principle, whether the release be of record, or, <em>in pais, </em>only; for, in both cases, it is nothing more than an agreement, not to bring a writ of error. But a release in law is as effectual, in all cases, as a release in deed. Thus a feoffment by one jointenant to his companion will not pass the estate, but it may operate as a release. So a covenant not to sue upon a bond, does not extinguish the bond; but the agreement releases the remedy. <em>Holt, </em>170. And so, in the present case, the warrant of attorney amounted to an undertaking to relinquish all errors in the rendition of the judgment; and barred the defendants from alledging the want of a declaration; for the meaning was, that there should be an effectual judgment, in order to settle the .claim, finally, on both sides: and, with that in view, it would have been absurd, if the parties had intended, that either of them should have it in his power to elude the agreement, by taking advantage of an oversight to destroy the judgment, and set all to sea again.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\n<em>Duval, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlH\">The warrant of attorney did not imply a release of errors; and the plaintiff has no cause to complain of the conduct of the defendants; for he had it in his power to make the record right before he took his judgment ; and, if he neglected it, the fault is his. A judgment by default confesses the action, but it does not imply a release of errors; and yet the implication would be as justifiable in that case, as in this. A declaration is in all cases essential to the safety of the defendant; for otherwise he may be sued again for the same thing, without having it in his power to plead the former recovery in bar, as the identity of the claim will not appear of record; and it is upon that principle, that the act of assembly requires a declaration. <em>Virg. Laws, </em>172. The English cases are express, that confession of judgment does not cure error, 2 <em>Cro. </em>32<em>: </em>where a judgment confessed upon a bond was reversed for want of a <em>profert; </em>and in 2 <em>Black. Rep. </em>780, it was held, that consent to confess judgment upon terras did not imply consent not to bring a writ of error. Which applies expressly to the case under discussion, and sustains the judgment of the general court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-4\"><em>John Taylor, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdY\">Upon reason and principle, consent takes away <em>error; </em>'for <em>volenti non fit injuria. </em>The statutes of jeofails cure defects in substance, as well as form; and the spirit of them is, to support the proceedings, whenever the defendant has been fairly heard, passes over defects, or assents to the judgment. Pleading is nothing more than a representation of the case upon one side, and a denial, or confession of it on the others and, if the plea confesses the action either in whole, or in part, the plaintiff is entitled .to judgment, whatever defect may appear in the proceedings. 3 <em>Black. Com. </em>304. An express release would certainly have cured the errorj and the agreement amounts to the same thing 5 for an implied release is as effectual as an express one; thus if the lord disseises the tenant, and then enfeoffs him, it is a release of the seignory, without any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>words for that purpose. Co. <em>Litt. </em>262, b. Upon the same . . , , , , principie, the warrant ot attorney, m the present case, was equivalent to a release of errors : for, by confession of judgment, the defendant consents to all those means, without which, the judgment cannot be effectual; and, in support of that idea, the law will supply whatever is requisite to sustain it, as the want of an original writ, 1 <em>Wms. </em>411; or an express renunciation of errors, where the consent would otherwise become abortive, as where there was a consent to try the title to lands in a different county from that in which they lay, and it was held to take away the error. <em>T. Raym. </em>372. The conduct of the appellees was fraudulent, as the plaintiff relying upon the agreement was at no pains to strengthen his judgment; and it is a rule, that errors, created by fraud, shall not be taken advantage of by the author of the fraud. 1 <em>Dom. </em>237. The only object of a declaration is to prevent surprize; \"but none could exist where the claim was adjusted, and judgment consented to, with a full knowledge of the circumstances. The supposed difficulty of identifying the claim, should another suit be brought for it, is imaginary; for it lies in averment; and the objection would apply to all general counts in <em>assumpsit. </em>A faulty declaration would have been cured by the confession; and the case is stronger as it is : for, if a faulty declaration had been filed, it might ha-ve been supposed, with some plausibility, to have applied to the matter set forth in it; and, if that were insufficient, that the defendant was not chargeable. But here was no declaration at all; and therefore the agreement must be understood, as extending to every thing necessary to sustain the judgment.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Pendleton, President, delivered the resolution of the , court:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The practice of the general court has been to consider the want of a declaration fatal in every case, whether the judgment was adversary, or confessed; and that practice was applied to the present cause. But the judges of that court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>have retracted their opinion, and concur, with the rest of us, in the judgment now to be delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The time was when there were no forms, or pleadings; but the parties were heard <em>viva voce, </em>and judgment dered in a summary way, upon the oral declarations of the plaintiff and defendant. This however was found inconvenient ; and therefore written forms were introduced, that, the case being described with precision on both sides, surprize and inadvertence might be prevented. But this, like other things liable to perversion, was soon abused ; and special pleading with all its train of subtilties and new inventions succeeded, to the infinite delay of justice. This evil called forth the statutes of jeofail; which equally extend to judgments by confession and default; and, in both cases, were intended to prevent captious exceptions, where the defendant acknowledged, that justice had been done, or left it to be presumed, from his silence. Accordingly they provide, in substance, that such judgments shall not be reversed for any defect, or omission, which does not go to the right of the cause. A principle which seems to embrace the . case before the court, as the objection is to the form, and not to the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The use of a declaration, in an adversary suit, is, to inform the defendant of the nature of the charge : and, with that view, the act of assembly prescribes a nonsuit, where the declaration is not filed, at the first calling. But this is a privilege, which, like others of a similar nature, the defendant may waive, as it concerns himself, and not the public. Thus, if the declaration is not filed, and the defendant consents to a continuance, he is presumed to waive his right to a nonsuit, and the cause remains in court. So, if the defendant wishing to save the expense of pleading and to gain time, agrees to confess a judgment, he ought to be understood, as consenting to relinquish all exceptions to the want of a declaration, or to any other matter of form.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">In the present case, not only was the expense of the declaration and consequent pleadings saved, but the defendants were allowed to appear without bail, and obtained further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>time to pay the debt. All, but particularly the two last, considerable advantages gained by confessing the judgment: which ought therefore to bind them.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">It was objected however, that a declaration was necessary, in order to bar a future suit for the same thing, as <em>the </em>identity of the claim could not be made to appear without one. But that objection would apply, as was observed by the counsel, with equal force to all general counts in <em>assumpsit; </em>which.are scarcely more explicit. Besides, if to such new suit, the recovery, in this, were to be pleaded, the plaintiff would be <em>bound to qhew </em>two subsisting debts at the time of the former judgment, or he would not be able to sustain his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">Upon the whole, the court are unanimously of opinion that, as a declaration in this case would have served no other purpose than to swell fees and papers, the judgment of the general court ought to be reversed, and that of the county court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
