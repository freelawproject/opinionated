The statute creating the penalty uses the words \u201c to be recovered by bill, plaint or information,\u201d but the term <em>bill </em>covers the action of debt. <em>2 </em>Chitty\u2019s Pleading 13. Besides, it is <em>a </em>general rule that if an act imposes a penalty and prescribes no particular remedy, debt will lie. <em>13 </em>Petersdorff's Abr. <em>281.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b501-7\"><em>William Smith </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>for defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkI\">said, that even if it should appear that in <em>England </em>the term <em>bill </em>covered the action of debt, that was not enough. The question would remain as to the intention of the legislature of <em>Virginia. </em>They called the attention of the court to the act in 1 Rev. Code, ch. 51, \u00a7 28, p. 163. and to the 31st section of the act of 1831. Supp. to Rev. Code, ch. 88. p. 112. It would be seen by these sections, that debt is <em>expressly </em>given wherever it is meant to be given at all. And the 31st section of the act of 1831 shews that the words bill, plaint or information were not considered to embrace the action of debt. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>those words were insufficient, by themselves, to give debt for the penalties created by the 31st section, they must be equally insufficient in a case arising under the 33d section. The same words, used in two clauses of a statute, must have the same meaning in each clause. But if debt could be maintained, the declaration is still radically defective. All the circumstances necessary to support the action must be laid. Mere recital is not enough: there must be express averments. The first count does not <em>aver </em>that there was an election, nor that the defendant conducted the election. The words <em>being fyc. </em>are mere recital. Nor is there any averment that the defendant knew the rejected voters to be qualified. This is vital. <em>Newell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Wash. 88.

That the action of debt may be brought on the statute, it being comprehended in the word <em>bill. </em>2. That the count first laid in the declaration is good on general demurrer, though I do not believe it could have withstood a special demurrer. It is defective in details, but does not, I conceive, \u201c omit any thing so essential to the action as that judgment according to law and the very right of the' case cannot be given.\u201d 3. I am of opinion that we ought not to send the case back for a decision on the motion for a new trial; that motion being, as I think, waived by the errors in arrest, and <em>rendered </em>impracticable by the other circumstances which have taken place. I refer to the more extended views of the president in this case, of which I entirely approve, and to the authorities he cites, which I have examined.</p>\n<author id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AkIM\">This is an action brought against the ..... sheriff of <em>Fayette </em>under the statute, for partiality m conducting an election to the prejudice of the plaintiff, who was a candidate at the August elections in 1831. The defendant pleaded not guilty, and a jury of the country have negatived that plea, and found him guilty of partiality in the conduct of the election, against the form of the statute. Having failed to acquit himself before his peers of this serious charge, he now seeks to arrest the judgment for the penalty, on the ground that the declaration is defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The first objection goes to the foundation of the action. It is contended that the action of debt is not within the provisions of the statute, which only authorize the recovery of the penalty by <em>bill, plaint, </em>or <em>information ; </em>that we have no proceeding by bill or plaint; that the remedy provided thereby is that by information alone; and that where a specific remedy is pointed out by the statute for the recovery of a penalty, that remedy only can be pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">It might perhaps be questioned whether this last position, true as it may be as a general principle, would govern this case. For it is laid down in the most ancient authorities, that \u201cthough the statute which gives the action for an escape limits the recovery by <em>writ of debt, </em>which imports an <em>original, </em>yet debt by bill against him <em>in custod. mar. </em>will lie; for it is within the equity of the statute.\u201d 1 Roll. 536, l. 50. cited 1 Com. Dig. 438. <em>A fortiori, </em>as debt is the peculiarly appropriate action in these cases (2 Bac. Abr. Debt. A. 13 Petersdorff\u2019s Abr. 281.) it is fair to conclude that if the action given is by bill, the action of debt will lie, by the equity of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">I shall not, however, rest upon this ground. I am of opinion that the act of assembly intended the action of debt, by the language which it has used. That language has been handed down from century to century, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>having found its way into the early statutes giving actions for the recovery of penalties. This is obvious from the use of the word <em>plaint, </em>which is not designed to refer to proceedings in inferiour courts, but to the court of king\u2019s bench; for we ar\u00e9 told that \u201canciently the process of trespass in the king\u2019s bench was founded on a <em>plaint </em>or <em>queritur </em>entered on the records of the court.\u201d 1 Tidd 166, 167. But although this proceeding is no longer in use, yet the old formula of enactment as to proceedings under penal statutes, seems to be still retained in <em>England, </em>as well as with us. With respect to the term <em>bill, </em>that term, in law language (as here used) distinctly indicates an action by bill of <em>Middlesex </em>in the court of king\u2019s, bench. This bill of <em>Middlesex </em>was equally applicable to actions of debt, <em>assumpsit </em>&amp;c. but as the action of debt is, as has been shewn, the most approved action for a penalty, where another is not pointed out, so the word <em>bill </em>here would be construed to mean <em>bill in debt, </em>or, in other words, an action of <em>debt </em>in the king\u2019s bench. Now if, in an english statute, debt in the court of king\u2019s bench would be understood by the word <em>bill, </em>how are we to understand it here ? Are we to reject it entirely, or are we not rather to interpret it to mean debt in our courts of record ? It is very well known that in our proceedings we have rather followed the forms of the king\u2019s bench than those of the common pleas; and hence it is that in our courts, as well as in our legislature, we often use phrases which belong to the former rather than to the latter. This very word <em>bill, </em>\u2014 though we have no bill of <em>Middlesex, </em>\u2014 is used in the same way in our entries as in the king\u2019s bench. Thus when judgment is entered for the defendant, <em>the </em>entry is that the plaintiff take nothing by his <em>bill, </em>but for his false clamour be in mercy &amp;c. The entry in the common pleas would be, \u201c that the plaintiff take nothing by his <em>writ;\" </em>a form which perhaps was not followed with us because we do not commence with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>original writ, bat begin the suit with a <em>capias, </em>according to the course of the king\u2019s bench where the defendant resides in <em>Middlesex, </em>1 Tidd 167.</p>\n<p id=\"AqH\">It is said, however, that in this very statute, in another section, debt and bill are both mentioned. Supp. to Rev. Code, ch. 8S. \u00a7 31. The same thing is to be seen in english statutes, 4 and <em>5 </em>Philip and Mary, cited 6 Co. 19, a.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> And the case already cited from <em>Rolle </em>shews that where <em>.debt </em>is mentioned in the statute, it means peculiarly debt by <em>original, </em>that is, debt in the common picas, though by the equity of the statute the court extended it to the <em>bill of Middlesex, </em>that being, in effect, debt by bill in the king\u2019s bench.. There is therefore no incongruity in the english statute, where it gives the remedy both by action of .debt and by bill; since tbe former means debt in the. common pleas, and the latter, debt in the king\u2019s bench, Our statutes indeed, enacted at an early day (in 1784 and 1785) and which ore the prototypes of-tho act in Supp. to Rev. Code, ch. SS. follow this language with no very great propriety; but it is obvious that it was taken, by the learned persons who then drew our statutes, from the familiar phraseology of the british statutes, under the impression that it was safest to follow the established formula. Be this as it. may, we must take it that as the word <em>bill </em>meant <em>debt </em>in the english statute, it must have been designed to mean the same in o.urs. And as to the different phraseology in the two sections, it is easily explained when we attend to the fact, that one of them was enacted in 1784 and the other in 1785. Upon the whole, therefore, I think that the action was properly brought.</p>\n<p id=\"AqIj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>I am not less satisfied that the first count of the declaration is <em>good upon </em>general demurrer. It would not have stood the test of a special demurrer indeed, because the defendant might have demanded, if he chose, more certainty and preciseness in the plaintiff\u2019s charge. He might have called upon him for specifications which would have enabled him better to understand the grounds upon which he was to be assailed. This is precisely the object of a special demurrer. It is the mode furnished the defendant, on the one hand, of compelling his adversary to give him fair, full and distinct notice of what, is to be proved against him; and it is the protection furnished the plaintiff, on the other, against objections not going to the gist but only to the form of the action, which the defendant, in all fairness, should disclose, that they may be amended, instead of concealing and withholding them for the purpose of securing him against a judgment, in the event of a decision against him by his peers. This I take to be the true spirit of the statute of jeofails, in providing that upon demurrer \u201cthe court shall regard no other defect or imperfection in the writ, return, declaration or pleadings, than what shall be specially alleged in the demurrer as causes thereof, unless something so essential to the action or defence be omitted, as that judgment according to law and the very right of the case cannot be given.\u201d In this case every essential to the action is stated; and whether imperfectly or not, is unimportant ; for the distinction is between an imperfect or informal statement of a good cause of action, and the statement, however formally made, of a defective cause of action. The plaintiff sets forth that he sues <em>qui tarn; </em>he demands the precise penalty imposed by law ; he states that at the August elections for <em>Fayette </em>in 1831, he was a candidate for the house of delegates, and that the defendant, <em>being </em>sheriff and conductor of the election, did interfere and shew partiality in favour <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>of other candidates and against him, \u201cby advising and urging persons to vote against him, and by refusing to receive votes of persons known to be favourable to him, though duly qualified, and urging their right to be heard in the said election, and to have their votes received and recorded in his favour.\u201d What is there omitted in this declaration, so essential to the action, as that judgment according to law and the very right of the case cannot be given ? I do not perceive. The facts of the election being held, of <em>Sims </em>being a candidate, and of <em>Alderson </em>being sheriff are indeed set forth by way of recital, as they might well be '; but the fact that the defendant <em>did interfere and shew partiality, </em>which is the <em>gist </em>of the action, is set forth directly and not by way of recital ; and the cases agree that this is sufficient. <em>Fulgham </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>1 Call 250. Moreover, this allegation is in the very language of the act, and it is followed by the specification that the defendant interfered <em>by advising and urging persons to vote against the plaintiff. </em>I say nothing of the other specification, as wanting perhaps some ingredients to render it complete. But the first is sufficient; and though on <em>special </em>demurrer it would be considered too general, as the defendant had a right to know what particular persons he was charged with advising, in order to enable him the better to defend himself, yet as he did not choose to demur specially, he cannot be received to make the objection on general demurrer. I am therefore of opinion that the court properly overruled the demurrer, and <em>a fortiori, </em>most improperly arrested the judgment. It must therefore be reversed, and judgment entered for the plaintiff, without regard to the motion for a new trial, which the defendant must be considered as waiving by moving in arrest of judgment. It is well settled that a party cannot move for a new trial after a motion in arrest (4 Barn. &amp; Cres. 160.) and though in this case the motions were probably simultaneous, yet as the party has, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>his motion, actually had the judgment arrested erroneill* . <em>r </em>ously, he cannot now go back to his motion lor a new trial. It is not perceived how this consequence can be avoided. This court, in reversing the judgment in arrest, must give judgment for the plaintiff, which at once occludes the motion for a new trial; nor do I see how we could reverse and send the cause back for the court to consider that motion. Such a practice would lead to embarrassing difficulties and serious consequences, particularly, as it respects the county courts,'since the same court that tried the -cause could rarely be assembled to pronounce on the motion ;\u2022 and indeed it would- be mischievous'in the.extreme, if even-the same judge, after a lapse-of years, was called upon to decide it, and to sign a bill 'of exceptions setting forth the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">I am therefore, on the whole, of opinion to reverse the judgment, and enter judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The other judges concurring, judgment of circuit court reversed, and judgment entered for the plaintiff</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\"> <em>Note by the president. </em>See also 21 James 1. ch. 4. where the terms used aro \u201caction, bill, plaint or information;\u201d and Id. ch. 22. \u00a7 46. where the words used are <em>\u201cdebt, </em>bill, plaint or information.\u201d These statutes are quoted 4 T.
