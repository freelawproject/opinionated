Then the creditor files a bill in equity against those administrators a.nd the heirs of the surviving partner, and the representatives of the deceased partner. The bill seeks a decree for <em>the </em>sale of lands of which the surviving partner died possessed, some of which belonged <em>to </em>himself and some to the firm; and when the funds from this source shall be exhausted, then it seeks to charge the representatives of the deceased partner. Held, equity has jurisdiction of the case; and the representatives of the deceased partner are properly made defendants.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b709-8\"><em>Bolton Jackson </em>recovered the following judgments in the court of the <em>United States </em>for the fifth circuit and eastern district of <em>Virginia, </em>to wit: on the 31st of May 1811, a judgment against <em>Conally Findlay </em>surviving partner of <em>Conally Findlay Sp Company, </em>and <em>Richard Hazlerig </em>and <em>John Donahey </em>the sureties for his appearance, for 1690 dollars 15 cents, together with 154 dollars <em>21 </em>cents damages, and costs: on the same day, another judgment against the same persons for 1690 dollars 14 cents, and costs, to be discharged by the payment of 690 dollars 14 cents, together with 253 dollars 90 cents damages, and the costs: and on the 29th of May 1812, a judgment against <em>Conally Findlay </em>surviving partner as aforesaid, and <em>Richard Hazlerig </em>and <em>Benjamin Eslill </em>the sureties for his appearance, for 1690 dollars 14 cents, together with 354 dollars 90 cents damages, and the costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b709-9\">To obtain payment of these judgments, <em>Jackson </em>on the 3d of January 1825 instituted a suit in the superiour court of chancery then holden at <em>Wythe </em>courthouse, in which suit the bill set forth that <em>Conally Findlay </em>died <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>intestate without having paid the amount due upon the judgments; that <em>Alexander Findlay </em>and <em>Abraham B. Trigg </em>administered upon his estate, but the plaintiff was informed that they had exhausted the whole amount \u00b0f assets which had come to their hands, in the payment of other claims; that moreover they had been discharged from their office, and there being no other personal assets in <em>Virginia, </em>no person had been since appointed to represent the estate. It was then stated, that the plaintiff had been informed that <em>Conally Findlay </em>was at bis death possessed of some real estate in the county of <em>Washington </em>in his own right, and some belonging to the firm of <em>Conally Findlay Co. </em>all of which was liable, as the plaintiff was advised, for the payment of his claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b710-4\">The bill alleged that the firm of <em>Conally Findlay Sf Co. </em>was composed <em>of Conally Findlay </em>and <em>William </em>King; that <em>King </em>died in 1808, and <em>James King </em>and <em>William Trigg </em>qualified as his executors, of whom <em>Trigg </em>was the survivor; that upon the death of <em>Trigg, Lilburn L. Henderson </em>became his executor, and consequently the representative of <em>William King, </em>a large part of whose estate was still unsettled; and that <em>Henderson </em>was after-wards displaced, and the estate of <em>William King </em>committed to the sheriff' of <em>Washington </em>county. <em>King's </em>estate, it was charged, was amply sufficient to have paid all his debts, and those for which he was liable ; but it was stated to have been so managed by his executors, that very little had come to the hands of <em>White </em>the sheriff', as administrator. It was alleged, however, that there were ample funds in the hands of <em>White, </em>as a receiver, appointed by the court, of the rents and profits of the salt works belonging to the estates of <em>James King </em>and <em>William Trigg, </em>under the will of <em>William King, </em>which funds, it was charged, were liable for the plaintiff\u2019s claim, inasmuch as the assets of <em>William King's </em>estate were wasted by his executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>After alleging that <em>Donahey </em>had gone to <em>Ireland, </em>and that <em>Hazlerig </em>resided in <em>West Tennessee, </em>the bill made defendants thereto the heirs of <em>Conally Findlay, James White </em>as the personal representative of <em>William King </em>and also as receiver, and the devisees of <em>James King </em>and <em>William Trigg: </em>and it prayed that the personal assets of the estates of <em>Conally Findlay </em>and <em>William King, </em>if any, might be subjected to the payment of the debts due the plaintiff the real estate of <em>Conally Find-lay </em>and of the firm sold for the payment of the same, and the profits of the salt works belonging to the estates of <em>James King </em>and <em>William Trigg </em>appropriated to the same purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b711-4\">At the time of filing this bill, writs of <em>scire facias </em>were pending to revive the judgments at law against <em>Alexander Findlay </em>and <em>Abixiham 13. Trigg </em>as administrators of <em>Conally Findlay; </em>and on the 8th of Juno 1827, judgments were rendered upon these writs of <em>scire facias, </em>awarding executions on the original judgments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b711-5\">The representatives of <em>William King </em>referred, in their answers, to the writs of <em>scire facias </em>which were so pending, and insisted that the plaintiff could not come into equity against <em>King's </em>estate until he had first exhausted the legal assets in the hands of <em>Findlay's </em>administrators. They also relied upon the lapse of time, and upon other circumstances set forth in the answers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b711-7\">In the progress of the cause, the court directed a commissioner to settle the accounts of <em>Alexander Find-lay </em>and <em>Abraham 13. Trigg </em>as administrators of <em>Conally Findlay; </em>and also to exhibit a statement shewing the quantity and description of lands belonging to <em>Findlay </em>and to the firm, and how they had been disposed of, together with the kind of title <em>Findlay </em>had therefor. By the report of the commissioner it appeared that there was nothing due on the administration account from the administrators, hut a small balance due to them; and the lands of <em>Findlay </em>and the firm, which could be sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>jectec^ to debt due the plaintiff, appeared to be of small value compared with the amount of the debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AUb6\">The cause being transferred, by virtue of the act of assembly, to the circuit court of Wythe, that court deGlared its opinion to be that the plaintiff, by his negligence, had lost his equitable claim against the representatives of <em>William King, </em>and decreed that his bill as to them be dismissed, and that they recover from the plaintiff their costs. From this decree, on the petition of <em>Jackson, </em>an appeal was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b712-4\"><em>Baldwin, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b712-5\"><em>C.

He then proceeds to state that <em>Findlay </em>at his death was in possession of some <em>social </em>real estate, which was liable for his debt, and also 'of real estate in his <em>own right, </em>which was also liable, and he prays that it may be sold for the payment of his demand. Thus far it is clear, though the bill is inartificially drawn, that the plaintiff had a right to come into equity against <em>Conally Findlay\u2019s </em>representatives, to enforce his demand against the social real estate, if he could shew that it was chai\u2019geable ; because it is very certain he could not reach that estate at law. The bill, then, is properly in court; and the true ques-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>lion is, whether the plaintiff had a right to make the representatives of <em>William King </em>parties in the suit, he being the deceased partner, and not liable to be charged until the remedies against the surviving partner have been exhausted. The bill charges that <em>William King </em>was a partner in the concern of <em>Conally Findlay Sf Co. </em>and that his estate was amply sufficient to have paid all his debts, and those for which he was liable, but that only a small portion had come to the hands of <em>White </em>his administrator, though he had received ample funds from the profits of the salt works, which the plaintiff seeks to charge. Now here, I imagine, are ample grounds for bringing <em>King\u2019s </em>representatives into court; it being conceded or shewn that those of <em>Findlay </em>are properly hero. For, in the first place, as <em>King\u2019s </em>liability will depend upon the exhaustion of the funds which wore in the hands of the surviving partner of <em>Conally Findlay Co. </em>real as well as personal, and as the bill against the <em>Findlays </em>necessarily involved a settlement of the personal estate, it was right and proper that the representatives of <em>King, </em>who were the parties most interested in that question, should be before the court, to afford them an opportunity of contesting the settlement of the accounts of <em>Findlay\u2019s </em>administrators. For if they would be <em>hound </em>by that settlement, it would be unreasonable that they should have no opportunity of contesting it; and if they would not be bound, it would be equally unreasonable to require the plaintiff to proceed with a settlement against the surviving partner, which would not avail him as evidence against the deceased partner. It is like a bill in equity to fix a <em>devastavit </em>on an executor. His sureties are proper parties, though they are not chargeable until his default has been established. Yet equity has never refused to convene them also, in a suit against the executor, on the ground that the default must be established before they can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>sued; because it is obviously for their benefit to have an opportunity of being parties to the audit of the accounts. So here, the deceased partner\u2019s estate stands as surety for the debt, and <em>those </em>who are interested in ^ have a corresponding interest in being parties <em>to </em>the settlement; in having a chance to contest the alleged payments of the administrator, and to surcharge his credits. Nay more, they have an interest in seeing that there is a due account of the <em>real </em>funds of a social character ; and it is proper, for all these purposes, that they should be parties. The creditor may be uninformed; he may be ignorant of the existence of an available fund; and if he proceeds against the deceased partner\u2019s estate, he will, according to the doctrine contended for, be dismissed from this forum, provided the defendants can find some fragment of the surviving partner\u2019s estate, of which he knew nothing. Indeed, as they are ultimately liable to the creditor, he has a right to demand their assistance in discovering and charging the funds of the surviving partner. But secondly, as the object of this bill is to charge the social real funds, the representatives of the deceased partner are <em>necessary </em>parties. The legal title is presumed to be in them; and if it be, not, still they have a right to assert their equity to the real estate as their ancestor\u2019s separate property, and to contest the allegation of its social character. , And both the creditor and the representatives of the surviving partner ai-e <em>interested </em>in those rights being settled and adjusted, since the social funds must encounter sacrifice, if they are outstanding and unascertained. Indeed, as it is in equity only that <em>the social </em>real estate is considered as personalty, and can be sold as such, it would seem essential that the heirs at law should be made parties to any proceeding, the object of which is to fix that character upon it, and to subject it to sale. The court then having jurisdiction of the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>against <em>King\u2019s </em>representatives, as dependant upon the proceeding against <em>Findlay\u2019s </em>representatives, it was premature to hear the cause and to dismiss the bill as to the former, before it was ready as to the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The opinion of the court of appeals was in the following terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">\u201c The court is of opinion that there is error in dismissing the bill of the complainant as to <em>King\u2019s </em>representatives. The court of chancery having complete jurisdiction of the cause as against <em>Conally Findlay\u2019s </em>representatives, the pending proceedings upon the <em>scire facias </em>being no bar to the bill in equity (2 Mad. Ch. 315. Mitf. Plead. 204.) and the plaintiff coming into that court for a settlement of the account of assets, fdr a discovery of the <em>social </em>real estate, and for the purpose of subjecting the real estate <em>proper </em>of the said <em>Findlay </em>to sale, as the value of it is so disproportionate to the demand, this court is of opinion that the representa,tives of <em>William King </em>the deceased partner were properly made parties, because they were ultimately chargeable in the event of <em>Findlay\u2019s </em>funds proving inadequate, unless the equitable rights of the plaintiff against them were lost by his neglect or misconduct; and also because they were interested in the settlement of the administration account of <em>Conally </em>Findlay, and in surcharging and falsifying the same; and also because the plaintiff has a right to demand of them, as parties in interest, their aid in discovering and subjecting to payment the social funds, whether real or personal ; and lastly because the real funds of the said firm could not properly be trealed as personalty, without making the heirs of <em>King </em>parties, for the purpose of contesting the right to do so. The court is further of opinion that <em>King\u2019s </em>representatives being properly before the court, and their liability being dependant upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>the issue of the proceedings, and the result of the enquiries, in relation to <em>Findlay </em>the surviving partner, it was premature to proceed to hear and dismiss the bill as to them, before it was matured as to <em>Findlay\u2019s </em>representatives ; and that such dismission was therefore erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">Decree reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
