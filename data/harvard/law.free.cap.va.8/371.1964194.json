The verdict ought to be set aside, and a repleader awarded down to the declaration.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-11\">\n<em>Duval, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYi\">The plea of payment does contain a traverse; for the declaration avers that the defendant has not paid the debt; and, consequently, the plea affirming payment, is an express denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation; and perhaps, payment is the g\u00e9neral issue in this country; but, at most, however, it is only a misjoinder of issue, which is cured after verdict.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Ayt5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\n<em>Per Cur.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A_8G\">The court is unanimously of opinion that th\u00e9 plea of payment is responsive to the negation of non-payment in the declaration; and that the act of assembly, by allowing a general plea of payment in all cases, with a right to prove all anterior payments, in fact, makes it a general issue, in this country.
