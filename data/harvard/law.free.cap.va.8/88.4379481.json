B then applies to the County court for leave to build a mill and dam, and when the inquest meets on the land A attends, and when the jury propose to level the stream to ascertain how high B may be permitted to build his dam, A tells them he had leveled it, and that B may be permitted to build a dam twelve feet high without flowing the water back on the land of any person but A. That such a dam will hurt no one but himself, and he does not believe it will hurt himself. The jury act upon his opinions and information, and allow B to build a dam twelve feet high, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>report that it will inflict no damage on any person: and this inquisition is confirmed by the Court and leave is given to build the dam. B builds his dam ten feet high. Afterwards he raises the water about six inches by putting boards on the top of the dam ; and of this A complains, and B takes them oif; and in the ten years B keeps the mill he does not attempt to raise the dam. A becoming embarrassed B determines to sell the property to relieve him ; and A adds twenty acres to that owned by B and they join in the conveyance of the whole to C. After C takes possession of the mill he ascertains that the inquisition authorized the dam to be built twelve feet high, and he elevates it 8 inches, which seriously injures the land of A which lies immediately above on the stream, whereupon A sues B for the damages occasioned by the raising of the dam.

Palmer, in the Circuit court of Augusta county. The injury complained of was that the defendant who owned a mill on the Middle river immediately below the land of the plaintiff, had raised his dam, so that the land of the plaintiff was overflowed, and the health of his family injuriously affected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AxY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>On the trial of the case the plaintiff proved that the defendant purchased the mill and milldam mentioned in the declaration, in 1844; at which time the dam did nQt excee\u00bf ten feet jn height. That after his purchase pe had raised the dam; but that it was not yet more than twelve feet in height. And he proved that his land had been seriously injured by the increased height of the dam. The defendant then offered in evidence a deed by which the plaintiff conveyed the land on which the mill and dam was situate, to his two sons, William B. and James W. Calhoun ; and also a deed in which the plaintiff and his said two sons and their wives united to convey to the defendant the land conveyed to the sons, and about twenty acres more adjoining, taken from the land of the plaintiff. And the defendant then offered in evidence the record of the proceedings upon a writ of <em>ad quod damnum </em>in the County court of Augusta, upon the application of William B. and James W. Calhoun, to have permission to erect a dam for a mill, it being the same which was the subject of controversy in this case, by which the jury authorized them to raise the dam twelve feet from the foundation ; and found by their inquisition that it would not injure any person: and upon the return thereof tne Court had authorized them to build the mill and dam in accordance with the inquest of the jury. To the introduction of this record the plaintiff by his counsel objected, on the ground that as the record shewed that the damages which he had sustained had not been foreseen and estimated by the jury, that proceeding could not be a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s action. But the Court overruled the objection, and admitted the evidence, not as constituting of itself a bar to the recovery of damages by the plaintiff, but as a link in the chain of evidence which the defendant\u2019s counsel alleged they were prepared to adduce, and by which they expected to establish that the plaintiff was personally present when the inquest was taken, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>fully apprised of said inquest and order of Court, and acquiesced in and assented to them ; and that William B. and James W. Calhoun had proceeded within one year to erect their dam and mill, and had finished it within three years. And that the defendant after he had purchased the property finding that the dam was not twelve feet high, had proceeded to raise it to a height not exceeding twelve feet. To this opinion of the Court admitting the evidence, the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-4\">The defendant then offered parol testimony to prove that the plaintiff was present when the inquest was taken, and assented to the action of the jury, and aided them in their examinations; that he suggested twelve feet as the height of the dam, and when they proposed to ascertain by actual levelling, how far the water would be flowed back by the dam, he stated that he had himself leveled it, and that the dam would flow back the water to a particular point, which he shewed to the jury; and he said that it would not back the water on the lands of any one but himself, and that nohody but himself would be injured, and that he was satisfied he would not be injured by it. To the introduction of this evidence the plaintiff objected, but the Court overruled his objection, and he excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-5\">After all the evidence had been introduced, the plaintiff moved the Court to instruct the jury as follows, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-6\">1st. If the jury shall believe from the evidence in the cause, that the milldam in the declaration mentioned, was established by an order of the County court of Augusta, upon a writ of <em>ad quod damnum, </em>and an inquisition and verdict thereupon, had upon the petition of William B. Calhoun and James W. Calhoun, who were at the time the owners in fee simple of the mill seat; and that the plaintiff William Calhoun was not in any manner interested in the property, and was not a party to the said proceedings, then the said writ, ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>diet, and order of Court, cannot operate as a bar to this action, unless the damages now claimed by the plaintiff were actually foreseen and estimated by the jury upon the said inquest. And any acts or declarations of the pla.intifF at the time of the inquest, indicating his assent to or approbation of the act of the jury, but constituting no part of the record and proceedings upon the said writ, could not operate as a bar to any subsequent action by him for damages sustained, unless such acts or declarations amounted to a contract with the said William B. and James W. Calhoun, founded upon a consideration, whereby the said plaintiff bound himself not to claim such damages: And in considering such acts and declarations of the plaintiff, the jury must take them all together as fixing the terms, conditions and limitations of such contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-4\">2d. And if the jury shall believe from the evidence in the cause, that after the said writ, inquisition and order of Court, and after the supposed contract so made by the acts and declarations of the plaintiff, the said William B. and James W. Calhoun went on to erect the said dam to a height short of the twelve feet allowed by the inquest, viz. to the height of ten feet; and shortly afterwards attempted to raise it still higher; that the plaintiff objected to such increase of elevation on the ground that it would injure him to an extent not foreseen by the jury, or by any of the parties at the time of the inquest; and that the said William B. and James W. Calhoun, in consideration of such injury, agreed with the plaintiff that they would not further increase-the elevation of said dam; and that in fact the said William B. and James W. Calhoun did not afterwards, during their ownership of the property, which was about ten years, attempt further to elevate said dam, and that the dam in its then condition was sold and conveyed to the defendant with the mill and its appurtenances, then the said William B. and James W. Cal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>houn had no right at the time of the said sale and conveyance, to increase the height of said dam, so as to damage the lands or other property of the plaintiff, and could not convey such a right to any other person; and no such right could pass by a deed conveying the mill with its appurtenances, nor could the plaintiff by uniting in the deed and warranty, upon such conveyance, grant any such right without express words to that effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-4\">These instructions the plaintiff by his counsel moved the Court in the first place to give as a whole, and that being refused he offered each of them separately ; and the Court having refused to give either, he excepted to both opinions of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-5\">The plaintiff by his counsel then moved the Court to instruct the jury as follows, viz :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-6\">1st. If the jury shall believe from the evidence in the cause, that the milldam in the declaration mentioned, was authorized in 1831 by an inquest and order of the County court of Augusta, regularly and legally made, authorizing it to be raised to the height of twelve feet from the foundation, that the parties applying therefor began to build the same within one year, and finished it within three years after such leave of the Court obtained, so that it was in good condition for the public use, but to a height much less than twelve feet, say nine or ten feet; that within a few years after such leave obtained, the said parties applying for leave, undertook to raise the said dam five or six inches over the height to which it was first finished, as aforesaid, but yet under the height of twelve feet; that the plaintiff objected to said last mentioned raising, on the ground that it would injure and damage his lands, and that, thereupon, and in consideration thereof, the said parties being still the owners of said mill and dam, ceased from their undertaking, and never again attempted to raise said <em>dam; </em>that said parties applying for leave, held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>and owned said mill and dam until the year 1844, when they in conjunction with the plaintiff sold and conveyed and warranted said mill and dam, with other lands, to the defendant, and that the defendant afterwards, viz. some twelve or eighteen months after his said purchase, and before this suit was brought, without any new writ of <em>ad quod damnum, </em>or leave of the Court, proceeded to raise said dam, and did raise it higher, thereby causing damage to the plaintiff, over and above any damage resulting to the plaintiff from the dam as it originally stood, then the jury must find for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-10\">2d. If the jury shall believe from the evidence in the cause, that the plaintiff was present with the jury of inquest, who acted in 1831 and rendered a verdict, authorizing the erection of the dam in the declaration mentioned, which verdict was the foundation of the leave afterwards given by the Court to build the dam ; that he aided and directed the jury in their action and examination on that occasion; that he had previously leveled the water above said dam, and told the jury he had done so; and that he dispensed with such examination by them; that he said to the jury that no one could be injured but himself, and that he did not believe he would be injured by raising said dam; that he then and there consented that the jury should fix the height of the dam-in their verdict at twelve feet; that after said leave was granted, the parties applying therefor went on to begin, and finished the same within the time allowed by law, to the height of only nine or ten feet; that afterwards they raised the dam some inches higher, being still owners thereof, whereupon the plaintiff remonstrated and forbade them; that they at once yielded, abated the additional height, and continuing owners of said mill property and dam for many years afterwards, viz., until the year 1844, never afterwards attempted to raise the dam higher: That the defendant purchased said mill property and dam in 1844, which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>together with several acres of adjacent land of the plaintiff, was conveyed to the defendant by a joint deed from the parties who had applied for leave to build the dam, and the plaintiff, with general warranty of title; and that the defendant, after the lapse of twelve or eighteen months from the date of his purchase, and before the institution of this suit, raised the said dam to an additional height of five or six inches, without any new leave of Court granted ; whereby the plaintiff suffered damage; then from the foregoing state of facts, the jury are well warranted in inferring that any consent if proven to have been given by the plaintiff at the time of the inquest, only extended to the raising of the dam to the height to which it was originally raised as aforesaid ; and does not bar his right of action for damages for raising it to an additional height.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-4\">But the Court refused to give either of the said instructions, and the plaintiff again excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-5\">After the Court had refused to give the instructions set out in the foregoing exceptions, the defendant moved the Court to instruct the jury as follows, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-6\">If the jury believe, from the evidence in this cause, that the plaintiff advised and prompted the application by his sons, one (if not both,) of whom was an infant at the time of the application for the writ of <em>ad quod </em>damnum, and other proceedings on the petition for the establishment of the mill and dam in the declaration mentioned ; and that the plaintiff was present when the jury were acting in regard to the assessment of damages, and aided them, and suggested the height of the dam twelve feet: and when the jury were about to level the water, to see how far it would be dammed back on the land of plaintiff, the plaintiff then said he had himself levelled the water, and ascertained that it would flow it back to a particular point, which he then shewed to the jury, and said that it would not injure any one but him, and that he claimed no damages, and that by rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>son thereof the jury found their verdict, awarding him no damages; to which the plaintiff assented; such assent and agreement to said verdict, is sustained by the consj\u00bferatjon 0f benefit to plaintiff\u2019s sons, who were tbe objects of his bounty, and whose interests were intended to be promoted by the establishment of said mill and dam, and will be sufficient to bar the plaintiff from obtaining damages incurred by reason of the erection of said dam; which instruction the Court gave, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-4\">The plaintiff then moved the Court to give to the jury the following instruction :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-5\">The writ of <em>ad quod damnum, </em>verdict, and order of Court, authorizing a milldam to be raised to a certain height, named and designated in the verdict, only confers the right upon the applicant and his assigns, to erect the dam to the height thus designated, subject to the right of adjacent tenants to their action, for all damages occasioned thereon, not actually foreseen and estimated by the jury of inquest; and such right to raise the dam, becomes appurtenant to the land on which leave is given to raise it, subject to the said right of the adjacent tenants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-6\">If, therefore, such land is sold by the party acquiring such right to erect a dam, with general warranty of the title and appurtenances thereto, and the purchaser subsequently elevates the dam to a height within that authorized by the verdict and order of Court giving leave, so that damages not actually foreseen and estimated by the jury of inquest, are suffered by an adjacent tenant, who sues for, and recovers the same, the covenants of such deed are not thereby broken, and no action thereupon accrues to such vendee against such vendor on said covenants. But the Court refused to give the instruction ; but instead thereof instructed the jury, that the jury of inquest having estimated and allowed no damages to the plaintiff, upon the writ of <em>ad quod dam</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number><em>jium, </em>their verdict presents no bar to the recovery of damages in this action, unless the plaintiff be precluded from their recovery upon other grounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-4\">If the jury shall be satisfied from the evidence, that the plaintiff was the real owner of the land, on which leave was asked to erect the mill, and the real applicant for the writ, and that his sons were only nominally the legal owners, and only nominal or ostensible applicants for the writ of <em>ad quod </em>damnivm, and that no damages were allowed by the jury of inquest, not only because none were claimed, but because on the contrary, damages were disclaimed or waived, whether by parol, by writing or by deed, and that after the privilege to erect the dam and build the mill was established by the inquest or verdict of the jury and the judgment of the Court thereupon, the plaintiff united in selling, conveying and warranting the premises with its appurtenances to the defendant, received the cash payment of the purchase money, and receipted for it in his own name, and took bonds for the deferred instalments payable to himself ; the plaintiff by reason of such ownership, and disclaimer or waiver of damages, and by reason of his sale, and conveyance by deed with warranty to the defendant, is precluded from any recovery against the defendant for any damages resulting to himself from the dam of the height not exceeding twelve feet, that being the height ascertained by the verdict of the jury of inquest ; and any private understanding or agreement between the plaintiff and his sons, before their sale to the defendant, limiting or restricting their rights and privileges under the inquisition, of which the defendant had no notice at the time of the purchase, cannot impair or derogate from his right to a dam of the altitude fixed by the jury of inquest, however valid and obligatory such agreement or understanding may have been between the father and the sons before they united in selling and conveying to a purchaser without notice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>To the opinion of the Court refusing the instruction asked, and giving the instruction given, the plaintiff again excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVh\">After the Court had refused the instruction asked by ^g p]aiatiff, and given its own instruction as mentioned in the last exception, the plaintiff \u2019s counsel moved the Court to give the following instructions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-6\">The fact that the plaintiff united in selling and conveying and warranting the mill, the dam and premises in the declaration mentioned with the appurtenances to the defendant, standing by itself will not preclude him from recovering in this action. If the jury believe from the evidence, that the plaintiff was not at the time of the verdict or judgment by the County court, giving leave to erect the dam in the declaration mentioned, the real owner of the land on which said dam was to be erected, but that he had made a <em>bona fide </em>advancement thereof to his sons William B. and James W. Calhoun, and that the plaintiff did not before the jury disclaim or waive damages, or that if he did he received no consideration therefor; then, though the plaintiff after-wards united with his said sons in a conveyance to the defendant of said lands with general warranty of title and appurtenances, he is not thereby barred of his right <em>to </em>bring this suit. But the Court refused to give the said instructions, and the plaintiff again excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-7\">The jury then found a verdict for the defendant, and there was a motion by the plaintiff for a new trial, which the Court overruled, and gave a judgment on the verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff again excepted, and applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-8\">From the facts stated in the exceptions, it appears that in October 1831, the plaintiff gave and conveyed to his two sons, William B. and James W. Calhoun, twenty acres of land, including the site of the mill and dam which was the subject of the suit. One of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>these sons was about eighteen or nineteen years old, and the other a few years older. In November 1831 they applied to the County court of Augusta for leave to build a milldam across the Middle river; and a writ of <em>ad quod damnum </em>was directed. When the jury of inquest met upon the premises, the sons being young, the plaintiff was present and managed the business, shewing the premises and making explanations to the jury; and he suggested twelve feet as the height of the dam. It being proposed by some of the jury that they should level the water, the plaintiff stated that he had levelled it as for a nine foot dam, and that dam would not flow the water back off his own land ; and he shewed the jury the point to which he said the water would flow back, which satisfied them. Plaintiff said he thought no one would be injured; that if any one was injured it would be himself, and that he did not believe he would be injured. The jury accordingly retured a verdict that the erection of the dam would injure no one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-4\">Soon after the County court made the order granting leave to erect the dam, William B. and James W. Calhoun went on to build the mill and dam, with means furnished them by their father; the dam being raised about nine or ten feet high.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-5\">In the first year of the operation of the mill, which was in 1834 or <em>1835, the sons </em>desired to raise the dam a little higher, and made the experiment by placing boards on the top of it to the height of five or six inches. This was done without consulting the plaintiff, but he soon discovered it, and complained that he was injured by the raising of the dam, and required them to pull it down; which was accordingly done. And from that time until 1844, when the property was sold to the defendant, these parties made no attempt to raise the dam.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ArE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>In the year 1844 the plaintiff was seriously embarrassed in his circumstances, and as his embarrassments arose in a great measure out of his expenditures in fitting up the mill property for his sons, they determined to sell it and apply, the proceeds to his relief; and this, though the plaintiff at first refused it, he after- . wards consented to accept; and the property with twenty acres of the land of the plaintiff was sold to the defendant, and it was conveyed to him by a deed in which the plaintiff and his sons united, with a general warranty. Some twelve or eighteen months after his purchase the defendant ascertained that the order establishing the mill authorized the erection of the dam to the height of twelve feet; and he thereupon elevated it about eight inches, which occasioned serious damage to the plaintiff\u2019s land.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-4\"><em>Michie </em>and Baldwin, for the appellant, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-5\"><em>Stuart, for </em>the appellee, submitted the case.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b124-6\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Anu\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">It seems to the Court that by the express provision of the 9th section of the statute concerning mills, &amp;c., 2 Rev. Code, p. 222, no inquest taken by virtue of that act, and no opinion or judgment of the Court thereupon is a bar to any action which could have been had or maintained if the said act had never been made, other than actions for such injuries as were actually foreseen and estimated upon such inquest: And therefore, and inasmuch as the inquest in the record set forth, finds that no person will be injured by the erection of the dam therein mentioned, that the plaintiff in this action, who was no party to the proceedings in which said inquest was had, is not thereby barred from the recovery of such dam\u00e1ges as he may have sustained by the reflow of the water upon his land, occasioned by such dam.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>And it further seems to the Court, that inasmuch as the said dam, and the mill to which it pertains, were established upon the application of William B. Calhoun and James W. Calhoun, as the owners of the land upon which the same are situate, and the defendant in this action asserts in his defence the regularity of the proceedings by which said mill and dam were established, and claims the protection thereof under the title derived by him from the said applicants, it is not competent for him to deny the ownership of the said land by the said applicants at the time of said proceedings, or to assert the continued ownership thereof by the plaintiff, from whose conveyance to said applicants they derived their title.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">It further seems to the Court, that the record of the proceedings by which said mill and dam were established, cannot be aided or supplied by parol evidence of what passed before the jury at the time of their inquisition, for the purpose of shewing that the plaintiff assented to the establishment of said dam at the height fixed by the jury, and thereby renounced any claim which he might thereafter have for damages unforeseen and unestimated by the <em>jury; </em>and that although the plaintiff may have attended the inquisition of the jury, and given them information as to the height to which it would be proper the applicants should have leave to erect their dam, and expressed to them his opinion and belief founded upon observation and actual levelling, that a dam twelve feet high would not back the water upon the lands of any person but himself, and that as to himself he was satisfied that he would not thereby be injured; still that such conduct and declarations of the plaintiff would only serve to shew that any injury thereafter actually occasioned him by said dam was not foreseen and estimated by himself any more than by the said <em>jury; </em>and that such conduct and declarations of the plaintiff cannot be treated as a contract with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>said applicants giving them leave to erect such dam and thereby occasion injury to the plaintiff; for as a contract so far as it allowed them to erect a dam upon their own land, it would be idle and nugatory, and so far as authorized them to injure the plaintiff by backing the water upon his land, it was voluntary, executory and personal to the said applicants, amounting at most to nothing more than a parol license to them, indeterminate in point of time, and revocable at the pleasure of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">And it further seems to the Court, that if, as the evidence at the trial tended to prove, the said William B. and James W. Calhoun complied with the condition imposed by the statute, requiring such applicants to begin to build their mill and dam within one year, and finish the same within three years after the leave of the Court obtained, so as to be in good condition for the public use, but that the height to which the dam was so finished by them was not greater than about nine or ten feet, yet that their so stopping short of the full height fixed by the inquest aforesaid, did not have the effect of precluding them, or their assignees, from after-wards raising the said dam to the full height of twelve feet allowed by the inquest, provided by so doing they should not occasion injury to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">And it further seems to the Court, that if, as there was evidence at the trial tending to prove, after the mill was finished and in operation, and when the dam was at the height of about nine or ten feet, the said William B. and James W. Calhoun desired to raise the latter somewhat higher, and did so by placing boards on the top to the height of several inches, which was done without consulting the plaintiff, who however soon discovered it, and complained that he was injured by such elevation, and required them to pull it down, and they being satisfied upon examination that the plaintiff was really thereby injured, consented, and took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>off the increased height, then that this was a revocation of any such parol license as above supposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">And it further seems to the Court, that if, as the evidence at the trial tended to prove, the said dam was erected and finished by the said William B. and James W. Calhoun as above mentioned only to the height of about nine or ten feet, at which height it was not complained of but acquiesced in by the plaintiff, until their sale and conveyance of the property on which it is situate, to the defendant in the year 1844, and was standing at that height at the time of such sale and conveyance, then that inasmuch as the plaintiff united in said sale and conveyance, the said dam as of that height must be considered as passing to the defendant by the terms and true intent and meaning of the deed of conveyance, and the plaintiff cannot recover damages against the defendant for any injury done him by any reflow of the water to the extent to which it existed at the time of said sale and conveyance; this Court expressing no opinion as to any injury from the reflow of the water, not existing at that time; the declaration only claiming the damages occasioned by the defendant\u2019s raising the dam since his purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">And it further seems to the Court, that the instructions and opinions of the Circuit court at the trial, so far as the same conflict with the principles above declared, are erroneous. It is therefore considered that the said judgment of the Circuit court be reversed and annulled, and the verdict of the jury set aside with costs to the plaintiff in error; and the cause is remanded to the Circuit court for a new trial of the issue between the parties; which new trial is to be governed, so far as applicable, by the principles above declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
