That the cask of shoes was duly entered, and that there were no boxes of that article. That the porter was part of the stores of the vessel, and included in the victualling bill. That the herrings and barley were the private sea stock of the mariners; and that there were no goods, wares or merchandize liable to the payment of duties, on board the said vessel, which were not duly entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-6\">There was a general replication to the answer; and as there could be no jury, the respondent being a foreigner, the court proceeded to examine the witnesses and record the testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-7\">The naval officer states, that, by the cocketts, there were two casks of shoes on board; and no more. That there was one hogshead of sugar, which, through the mistake of the clerk, was not properly entered in the permit. That the victualling bill contained four groce of beer and porter; and he thinks the quantity of stores, therein expressed, moderate for a ship of that burthen; and as such was allowed at the office. That it is not usual to demand duties on seamen\u2019s stores, unless intended for sale. That barley and herrings are commonly brought in as sea stores, but be should have insisted on an entry of them, if he had known there were forty-two kegs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-8\">Another witness states, that he saw two boxes, which he was told contained shoes, sent, from the vessel at City Point, on Friday, to Norfolk or Portsmouth, in a small sloop commanded by' one <em>.Allen; </em>and, on Monday morning, the searcher found another hogshead, which was not in the permit. That he saw the three hogsheads of porter; the herrings and <em>barley; </em>and a small box, 16 or 18 inches square, which the captain told him contained lace; and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>naval officer had omitted to enter it. That the captain took no receipt for the boxes of shoes sent, by Allen, to Norfolk; and that he heard him acknowledge they were not entered. That he heard the master offer to sell herrings to Mr. <em>Eppes. </em>The latter gentleman was afterwards examined, but merely spoke of having seen a hogshead of shoes and some coal on board, saying nothing of the herrings, nor was he asked any question concerning them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-7\">The mate of the vessel says, there were but two casks of shoes; one of which was sent to the consignee in Petersburg, and the other being consigned to the master, was still on board. That there was one hogshead of sugar only, which was also sent to the consignee at Petersburg. That there were only four groce of porter and beer; which were put on board as part of the captain\u2019s sea stock: two of which were started into the lockers to be used in the cabin, and the other two were in the three hogsheads now on board. That those four groce were all the beer and porter that was shipped. That the mariners were nine in number; and had, among them, forty-two small casks of herrings, oatmeal, and barley, brought on board, as common sea stock, for their own use, and not as part of the cargo agreeable to the constant usage at Glasgow: that the herrings cost about four shillings sterling, and the barley and oatmeal, eighteen pence sterling per cask. That he saw the two boxes delivered to <em>Allen, </em>but does not know their contents, and thinks they were directed to one <em>Boyd. </em>That there was one box on board.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-9\">The cocketts, victualling bill, and permit are filed; but do not materially vary the case, except that a box is mentioned in one of the cocketts and permit, as well as some haberdashery and women\u2019s calimanco shoes. Neither <em>Allen, </em>nor <em>Boyd </em>was examined; and the sales by the marshal make no mention of the supposed box of lace, nor of the two boxes delivered to <em>Allen </em>for <em>Boyd.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-10\">The court' condemned the vessel, the kegs of herrings and barley, and the supposed box of lace; and ordered them to be sold: which being done, and the proceeds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>sale distributed, the respondent appealed to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-9\"><em>Baker, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEm\">contended that there was no false entry, as all the cargo was reported, except the supposed box of lace, which existed only in the imagination of the witness; for one box was actually entered in the cocketts and permit; and no other was ever seen or heard of, except by him. That the herrings and barley were not part of the cargo, but stores merely for the use of the crew.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b396-10\">To which it was answered, by the <em>attorney general, </em>That the witness stated, that the master said the box of lace was not entered; and the naval officer, that he would have insisted on the entry of the herrings and barley, if he had known they amounted to forty-two kegs.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">But the court thought there was no evidence of fraud, or improper omissions in making the entry. That the barley and herrings were not more than the seamen\u2019s common stores, which are never entered; and that the supposed box of lacc was probably that mentioned in the permit. That the proceeds of the sale ought therefore to be restored to the owners; but at the costs of the respondent, as there was probable cause of seizure; and the following judgment was entered on the order book : \u201c This day came the parties by their counsel, and the court having maturely considered the transcript of the record, and the arguments of the counsel, are of opinion that the said sentence is erroneous : Therefore it is decreed and ordered, that the same be reversed and annulled, and that the appellee pay to the appellant his costs, by him, expended in the prosecution of his appeal aforesaid here: And the court proceeding to give such sentence as the said court of admiralty ought to have given, do decree and order that the libel be dismissed; that the sum of two hundred and thirty pounds three shillings and three pence, the amount of the sales of the vessel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>cargo, be restored to the respective owners, retaining there-out seventy-two pounds seven shillings and eight pence penny, the costs in the court of admiralty, the court being of opinion that there was probable cause of seizure: and the money raised by the sale of the brigantine, being subject to the seamen\u2019s wages, if any be due, in lieu of the ship, that such wages be secured previous to the payment of lliatmoney, as the district court, directed, by law, to be holden at Williamsburg, shall direct. All which is ordered to be certified to the said district court.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
