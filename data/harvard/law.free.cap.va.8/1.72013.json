It states the death of the said <em>Susanna, </em>the marriage of the complainants, the demand upon <em>Bonner </em>for the unexpended balance of the 2200-dollars, his refusal to pay, and the subsequent institution of an action of covenant upon the deed against <em>Henry Wyche </em>sheriff of <em>Greensville </em>county, to whom the estate of the said <em>Susanna </em>had been committed, in which action there . was a judgment <em>quando acciderint. </em>And then the ground is taken, that though at law the deed constituted a mere covenant, yet in equity it is an actual gift, and <em>Bonner </em>is to be regarded as a trustee for the female complainant, of the property of his wife to the amount of the sum given by the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-4\"><em>Bonner </em>answered, admitting that the instrument was executed previous to the marriage, with his privity and consent, and that after the marriage he received the personal estate of the said <em>Susanna, </em>amounting to between four and five thousand dollars. He mentions that his deceased wife was possessed of a tract of between 840 and 1000 acres of land, worth at the time of her death about five dollars per acre, which had descended to the female complainant as her only heir at law, and suggests that it would be as equitable to consider the plaintiffs as trustees holding the land for the payment of the gratuity of 2200 dollars, as to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>him a trustee of any part of the personal estate for that purpose. His advancements to the female complainant he states to have amounted to about 150 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-9\">Depositions were taken proving the case more strongly than it was stated in the original bill; and then the plaintiffs had leave to amend. The amended bill charges that after it had been agreed between the said <em>Bonner </em>and the said <em>Susanna </em>before their intermarriage, that a sum of money should be given to and settled on the female complainant, the said <em>Bonner, </em>at the request of the said <em>Susanna, </em>had an instrument of writing prepared to carry the said intended settlement or donation into effect, and brought it in blank to the said <em>Susanna ; </em>but on account of some informality in the instrument thus first prepared, the same was not executed, and then <em>Bonner </em>said to the said <em>Susanna </em>that he would have an instrument drawn by a lawyer, which would answer the intended purpose; and afterwards, on the day of and' shortly before his marriage, he presented to the said <em>Susanna </em>the very instrument or deed of gift which was then executed by his intended wife, being the same exhibited with the original bill. And on this state of facts the ground is taken, that as <em>Bonner </em>undertook to have a deed prepared by a lawyer which would answer the intended purpose, and the purpose intended being to settle 2200 dollars of the wife\u2019s property on the female complainant, in such manner as to assure the same to her on her attainment to full age or marriage, he <em>Bonner </em>cannot object to any defects in the instrument, but is bound to make good the same according to the true intent thereof and of the agreement which it was intended to execute, in like manner as if he himself had been a party thereto and had executed the same, and as if the settlement had been made by a deed in due form to accomplish the purpose which he as well as his intended wife designed. This amended bill was taken for confessed as to the defendant <em>Bonner; </em>and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>allegations were besides fully proved by the depositions taken in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AD\">The chancellor, by his decree, declaring that the defondant <em>Bonner </em>ought not to be held any further bound than strict law would bind him, since no intentional fraud was committed by him, adjudged and ordered that the bill of the plaintiffs be dismissed. From this decree the appeal was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-5\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-6\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b25-7\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AL\">The original bill in this case states that upon the intended marriage of the appellee <em>Bonner </em>with <em>Susanna W. Atkinson, </em>it was agreed that a provision should be made out of her estate for her half sister, who afterwards intermarried with the complainant <em>Brown. </em>The sum <em>fixed </em>upon was <em>2200 </em>dollars, and the personal estate of the intended bride was ample for its payment. In this bill the transaction is considered as having amounted to a gift, and as having operated to intercept the marital rights of the appellee. This view of the case was, I think, obviously incorrect; and as the evidence afterwards taken abundantly shews, it did not present the rights of the female complainant in their proper aspect. An amended bill was afterwards filed, in which it is stated, in strict conformity with the facts as proved by the depositions taken anteriour to its exhibition, that <em>\u201c </em>after it had been agreed between the intended husband and wife that a sum of money should be given to and <em>settled </em>upon miss <em>Tatum </em>(now mrs. <em>Brown), </em>the appellee, at miss <em>Atkinson\u2019s request, </em>had an instrument of writing prepared to carry the intended settlement into effect, and brought it in blank to miss <em>Atkinson, </em>who did not execute it for some supposed informality; whereupon <em>Bonner the </em>intended husband said to his intended wife, that he would have an instrument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>drawn by a lawyer which would answer the intended purpose, and afterwards produced the.instrument now deemed incompetent to bind him, which was executed accordingly.\u201d These allegations are-beyond controversy, because the. bill has \u2022 been taken for confessed against the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">Upon these facts, I cannot hesitate about the conclusion to be drawn in that tribunal which considers that as done which ought to have been done, \u2014 which holds itself bound to rectify mistakes, \u2014 and which looks upon fraud with no grains of allowance. I can have no doubt that the benevolence of the deceased sister must be effectuated in favour of the survivor, and that the appellee is justly chargeable with the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"AGW\">It'is objected\u2019however, in the first place, that it does not appear that- the design was that the money was to be paid to miss <em>Tatum </em>out of the personalty of 'her sister, and that the intent to provide for her might as <em>effectually have </em>been executed by a covenant binding her heirs, and thus charging.her realty. Such, in my view, was obviously not the design of the parties. An engagement to make a provision in money would naturally refer itself to the personalty, in the absence of positive evidence,\u2019 even if the circumstances did not strongly prove that the personalty was looked to. But when we take\u2019into view that miss <em>Atkinson </em>had a large sum in the hands of her guardian, besides a personal est\u00e1te of f\u00f3ur\u00f3r.five thousand dollars which <em>Bonner </em>received after the-marriage; when we see <em>him </em>procuring, an instru-ment to be dr\u00e1wri, having not the remotest reference to the realty, and not even binding the heirs for payment; when we see him also, during the coverture, making advances in part of this gift, which \u00e1re not pretended to have been raised out of the realty, and which he does not even now seek to charge upon it; credulity itself cannot believe that the real estate was looked to by the parties as the fund from which payment was to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Taking then the agreement to be that 2200 dollars should be given to and settled upon miss <em>Tatum </em>out of her sister\u2019s personalty, and that the intended husband i,, \u2022 iii undertook to have an instrument drawn by a lawyer which should answer the intended purpose, but in fact produced, and had executed, an instrument of writing wholly <em>inadequate </em>to the purpose; there can be no doubt, I think, that such agreement should now be set up against the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Piad the husband fraudulently procured a defective instrument, knowing it to be such, and in the confidence and agitation of the moment procured its execution, to the prejudice of the half sister, no language could have been too strong in denouncing his iniquity. It is not believed that he could have done so. Yet it was justly said in the argument, that the fraud is not less great to endeavour now to take advantage of his own blunder and mistake, however innocent. No principle is in equity better established than this, that though there may have been <em>no fraud </em>in the original transaction, yet the attempt to enforce it may become a fraud. Where one is not even originally <em>party </em>to the transaction, yet if it was cllected through fraud, he <em>becomes </em>a party to the fraud by seeking to have advantage of it. Such was the case of <em>Huguenin </em>v. <em>Baseley, </em>14 Ves. 273. and <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>7 Wheat. 556. And surely the case is not less strong of one through whose mistake another has been severely injured, and himself in an equal degree benefited, and who afterwards seeks to avail himself of that mistake to the prejudice of his adversary.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">Had the transaction originated in fraud, there can be no doubt that the appellee would be chargeable. In the ordinary case of an estate suffered to descend, the owner being informed by the heir that if the estate is permitted to descend he will make provision for a third person, there is no doubt the court of equity would compel the heir to discover whether he did make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>promise, notwithstanding the statute of frauds, and would force him to comply with it, notwithstanding the third party is a volunteer. See <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Aldridge, </em>9 Ves. 519. <em>Luttrel </em>v. <em>Olmius, </em>quoted and approved in <em>Mestaer </em>v. <em>Gillespie, 11 </em>Ves. 638. 2 Freeman 34, 285. <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Agar, </em>2 Ves. &amp; Beames 262. In the case of <em>Luttrel </em>v. <em>Olmius, </em>the party claiming was a volunteer, and yet he had relief. Why ? Because he was not seeking relief against the <em>giver, </em>whom a court of equity will not compel to part with his property upon a naked promise without consideration, but because he sought it against a party who received the property upon the express consideration of applying it to his use.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Who ever heard of a trustee setting up against his <em>cestui que trust </em>the defence that the latter was a volunteer ? It cannot be; because although the <em>cestui que trust </em>may be a volunteer, there is a sufficient consideration to justify a decree against the trustee. So in the case of <em>Luttrel v. Olmius, though the </em>claimant was a volunteer, yet as the tenant in tail could not in conscience take advantage of the iniquitous act, the obligation of conscience stood in lieu of a consideration, and the estate was considered precisely as if the act had been done which ought to have been done. And so here, though miss <em>Tatum, </em>is a volunteer, and could not have filed a bill against her <em>sister to rectify </em>the settlement, she may well maintain her demand against <em>Bonner, </em>to whom his wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>had given her whole personalty by marriage, upon the consideration of his agreeing to make a valid settlement upon the sister. I consider that settlement as if duly made, and the appellee of course as bound for the balance of the sum remaining unpaid; and am therefore of opinion to reverse the decree and send the cause back for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"Afpa\">Decree reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b28-7\"> <em>Note by the president. </em>The doctrine that equity will not enforce an executory contract in favour of a volunteer, rests upon the obvious principle that no court can <em>compel </em>a man to give away his property, and if the contract does not <em>amount </em>to a gift, it will not be <em>converted </em>into one. And so if the contract be <em>incomplete ; </em>for if it be so, the gift is not <em>perfect, </em>and no court has power to make it so. But where A. gives property to B. for the use of C. or in consideration that B. shall pay to C. a certain sum, the gift is complete from A. the owner, and it is in equity as much a gift to C. <em>pro tanto, </em>as it is to B. for the residue, and though C. is a volunteer as to A. yet there is a good consideration for a demand of payment from B. as to whom he is no volunteer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
