The pleas were, first, that the defendant doth not detain the negro <em>Amy </em>in the declaration mentioned, and secondly, that the cause of action did not accrue within five years; upon both of which pleas issues were joined. At April term 1822 a jury was im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>panneled, who brought in the following verdict: \u201c We find for the plaintiffs the slave <em>Amy </em>in the declaration mentioned, of the value of 300 dollars, if to be had; if not, we find for the plaintiffs the sum of 300 dollars, her aforesaid value, and one penny damages for her detention. We likewise find that <em>Amy </em>has issue, now living and in the possession of the defendant, three children, <em>\\v\u00bf. </em>a boy by the name of <em>Wilson, </em>aged about four years, of the value of 200 dollars, born after the defendant acquired the possession of <em>Amy </em>and after the plaintiffs\u2019 right of action accrued, but about three months before the <em>date </em>of the writ in this cause; another boy by the name of <em>Washington, </em>aged about two years, of the value of 150 dollars, born since the institution of this suit; and a girl of the name of <em>Charlotte, </em>aged-months, of the value of 75 dollars, likewise born since the institution of this suit. If the plaintiffs have a right to recover in this action the children of <em>Amy </em>born as aforesaid, then we find for the plaintiffs the boy <em>Wilson, </em>of the value of 200 dollars, if to be had; if not, the sum of 200 dollars, his value: likewise the boy <em>Washington, </em>of the value of 150 dollars, if to be had; if not, the sum of 150 dollars, his value: and likewise the girl <em>Charlotte, </em>of the value of 75 dollars, if to be had; if not, 75 dollars, her value. But if the court shall be of opinion that the plaintiffs must bring another action for the children of Amy born as aforesaid, then we find for the plaintiffs the said slave <em>Amy </em>only.\u201d The day after this verdict was found, it was set aside on the motion of the plaintiffs, and they had leave to amend their declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">At April term 1825 a second trial was had, and the jury found a verdict for <em>Polly </em>of the value of 200 dollars, <em>Wilson </em>of the value of 200 dollars, <em>Washington </em>of the value of 125 dollars, <em>Delphia </em>of the value of 90 dollars, and <em>Amy </em>of the value of 50 dollars, together with one penny damages; and judgment was rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>accordingly. From this judgment the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ATBb\">There were three bills of exception. The first set forth that on the 3d of March 1803, <em>Amy </em>the mother of the slaves mentioned in the declaration was the property of <em>Philip Hodnett </em>of the county of <em>Buckingham, </em>and on that day was brought on loan to the house of <em>Absalom Baker </em>in <em>Bedford </em>county; that she was so brought by <em>Absalom </em>himself, a young unmarried man, whose father and mother lived with him on his the said <em>Absalom\u2019s </em>own Hand, and plantation; that the father of <em>Absalom </em>Was named <em>Samuel Baker, </em>and the loan was from <em>Hodnett </em>te <em>Absalom </em>upon trust for the benefit of the wife of <em>Samuel Bcflcer, </em>and revocable at the pleasure of said .\u00edfod?ze\u00ed\u00ed,rthcjd\u00abedl evidencing which loan was unrecorded, but the purpose, as stated by the said <em>Absalom, </em>was to aitl in the support of his mother, who was the sister of <em>Philip Hodnett, </em>during her life, and after her death the said slave was to go to him the said <em>Absalom; </em>that in November 1803, <em>Absalom </em>married, after which he lived for a time in a house near to that in which his father lived, which before had been used by bis father as a kitchen, and then, after some time, he removed to a house distant about 150 yards from his father\u2019s, being on the same tract of land and plantation, where he continued until February 1809, when he died, being at his death the agent and trustee of <em>Philip Hod-nett </em>in relation to the said <em>Amy; </em>that from the 3d of March 1S03 until the death of said <em>Absalom, Amy </em>continued at the house occupied by the said <em>Samuel Baker, </em>and in his possession in manner before stated ; that after the death of <em>Absalom, Any </em>continued in the possession of <em>Samuel Baker </em>until April 1811, at which time she was taken by the sheriff \u2019of <em>Bedford </em>to satisfy an execution of <em>Brown $$ Co. </em>against <em>Samuel Baker; </em>that on the 28th of May 1811, which was after the levy of the execution, <em>Philip Hodnett </em>appointed <em>Henry Baker, </em>another son <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>of the said <em>Samuel, </em>to make demand and obtain possession of <em>Amy, </em>and <em>Henry Baker, </em>being so authorized, had several interviews afterwards with the agent of <em>Brown Sf Co. </em>in relation to <em>Amy; </em>that the agent of <em>Brown Sf Co. </em>persisting in his determination to hold <em>Amy </em>subject to the debt for which the execution issued, <em>Henry Baker, </em>on the 9th of June 1811, being the' day appointed for the sale, executed his own bond to <em>Brown Sf Co. </em>for the money (a credit being given for the same) and <em>Amy </em>was thereupon surrendered to him, for the pujmose of being restored to his father, from whoarpmt\u00ed^i\u00edivs&amp;^jh ad been taken; that <em>Henry </em>Baker^liS&amp;not restored\u00ae to his father, but retained possess!oJLof .L\u00edttJirthe agent of <em>Philip Hoilnetl, </em>or hiijfmTier to others; 1that from the 9th of June 1811 uriil tif dime 1816, <em>Amy </em>was in the possessionsfsome of thj&amp;jdiis of <em>Samuel Baker, </em>sometimes in the possesSSi^of one and sometimes of another, or of persons to whom she had been hired by them, the said sons being, at different periods, appointed by writing the agents of <em>Philip Hod-nett; </em>that <em>John Pate </em>having obtained a judgment against <em>Samuel Baker </em>upon a bond executed in the year 1786, issued an execution upon that judgment on the 3d of June 1816, which execution, on the 7th of that month, came to the hands of the sheriff of <em>Bedford, </em>in which county the said <em>Amy </em>then was, being in the possession of a person to whom she had been hired by the plaintiffs as agents of <em>Ilodnett; </em>that <em>Amy </em>was taken by virtue of that execution, and on the 27th of June 1816 was sold under it, and purchased by the defendant. It did not appear that from the 3d of March 1803 until the 28th of May 1811, any demand was ever made by the said <em>Philip Ilodnett </em>of the said <em>Amy, </em>otherwise than that two instruments of writing were executed by the said <em>Philip Ilodnett, </em>one in 1808 and the other in 1810, appointing some one of the sons of the said <em>Samuel Baker </em>as his <em>Hodnett\u2019s </em>agent, and trustee, to keep the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>slave for the' use of their mother, at the pleasure of said <em>' Rodnett; </em>neither of which instruments was admitted to record. And it did not appear that any deed declaring the said loan and the purpose thereof had ever been made and admitted to record in any county in which the said <em>Amy </em>was, until the year 1814, at which time, viz. on the 17th of November in that year, said <em>Philip Hodnett </em>executed his deed to the plaintiffs, which at February term 1815 was admitted to record in the county of <em>Botetourt, </em>in which county <em>Amy </em>then was. Upon these facts the defendant moved the court to instruct the jury, that if it should appear to them that <em>Samuel Baker </em>the elder had been in possession of the slave <em>Amy </em>for the space of five years, without demand being made and pursued in due course of law by the said <em>Philip Hodnett </em>for the recovery of the possession of the said slave, then in such event the defendant had a right to levy his execution upon the said slave. J\u2019he court gave the instruction asked for; but further instructed the jury, that if it should appear to them that <em>Philip Hodnett, </em>or his agents other than <em>Samuel Baker </em>the elder, had been five years in possession from the time the said slave was taken under the execution of <em>Brown Sf Co. </em>against <em>Samuel Baker, </em>such possession of five years would revest the title to the property in the said <em>Philip Hodnett. </em>The counsel for the defendant then moved the court to instruct the jury, that the possession of the said <em>Philip Hodnett </em>ceased on the 7th of June 1816, when the execution by virtue of which <em>Amy </em>was sold came to the sheriff\u2019s hands, and that it could not have commenced sooner than the 9th of June 1811, when she was surrendered to <em>Henry Baker. </em>But the court instructed the jury, that the possession obtained by <em>Henry Baker </em>on the 9th of June 1811, for <em>Philip Hodnett, </em>ought to have relation back to the 28th of May 1811, at which time he was, by the deed of the said <em>Hodnett, </em>appointed his agent to demand and recover the slave. To this opinion the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The third bill of exceptions set forth that the plaintiffs, at the trial, offered in evidence a paper -writing in these words: \u201c Be it known to all whom it may concern, that I, <em>Philip Hodnett </em>of the county of <em>Buckingham, </em>did on the 3d day of March 1805 lend unto <em>Absalom Baker </em>of the county of <em>Bedford </em>a negro girl named <em>Amy, </em>about seven years old, which said negro girl I do by these presents again lend unto the said <em>Absalom Baker, </em>which <em>he </em>is <em>to keep </em>until I shall demand her in person or by my lawful representatives, and on such demand being made, he is to deliver <em>the </em>said girl.

This bill of exceptions proceeded <em>to </em>state, that it appeared that previously to this time, viz. in the year 1802 or 1803, <em>Hodnett </em>loaned the said negro to <em>Absalom, Baker, </em>and it did not appear that from the year 1802 or 1803 the said negro had ever been in the possession of <em>Hodnett, </em>or that he had ever made any declaration of a loan to the said <em>Absalom Baker </em>by writing sealed and recorded according to the provisions of the act of assembly, and this declaration of a loan not being so recorded, the reading thereof was objected to by the defendant, but his objection was overruled by the court; and the witness proving that the said writing was executed as evidence that the said <em>Absalom Baker </em>was authorized by <em>Philip Hodnett </em>to hold the said negro according to the terms of said writing, the court permitted the said writing, together with the testimony of the witness, to go to the jury, as evidence to avail in this cause as much as the jury should believe the same to prove. To which opinion the defendant also excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AEA\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AcN\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AcU\">If we confine ourselves to this record as we find it, and do not improperly draw the inference from \u00e1 verdict which has been set aside, that the record contained another declaration, very little difficulty occurs as to the pleadings. The record shews a declaration for the five slaves, the children of <em>Amy, </em>filed four years anteriour to the first verdict. It is very possible it might have been originally for <em>Amy </em>the mother alone, and that, upon the leave to amend, her name was stricken out and those of the children inserted. But this does not appear, and we are not at liberty to conjecture that this was done. As the record stands, we can only infer that the leave to amend was waived, and of course the cause stood upon the first declaration. Then, as to the pleadings. The first plea might and ought to have been demurred to, for it makes <em>defence </em>as to the whole, yet denies detention only of one. But this defect, it is said, is cured after verdict. Stephen on Pleading, p. <em>233. </em>And even if it were not, the appellant could not object to his own bad plea; for a repleader is never awarded to him who has committed the fault. Doug. 396. <em>Kirtley </em>v. <em>Deck, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 388. Tidd\u2019s Pract. 830. The judgment therefore must stand, unless there appears to have been error in the conduct of the trial. This, I think, clearly appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">We are to remember that this case is not that of a demurrer to evidence. We give no opinion, therefore, on the question whether the resumption of the possession before the lien or levy of the execution, the debt having been contracted many years anteriour to the loan, revested in the plaintiff all his rights or not. The naked'question is presented here, whether the possession resumed by the attorney in fact is to be considered as commencing at the time of the resumption, or at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>date of his power. I can see no ground for the posi-~ tion that the resumption relates back to the date of the power. Until the levy of <em>Brown Sf Co.\u2019s </em>execution in April 1811, the slave <em>Amy </em>was in the possession of <em>Samuel Baker. </em>From that date until the surrender by the agent of <em>Brown Sf Co. </em>she was in custody of the law. She could not be at the same time in the possession of the sheriff and of <em>Hodnett\u2019s </em>agent. She was therefore not actually in <em>Hodnett\u2019s </em>possession, through his <em>agent, </em>until the surrender on the 9th of June 1811. Nor after the surrender could she be construed to have been in his possession from the date of the power. For <em>Brown Sf Co. </em>did not surrender their lien; they took <em>Henry Baker\u2019s </em>bond for it, and the possession acquired was a purchased possession, which must be counted from the time of the purchase. Again, the sheriff\u2019s property in goods taken by execution is a special property, and when the execution is discharged or the lien is removed, the property and possession reverts to him from whom it was taken; that is, in this case, it reverted to <em>Samuel Baker; </em>and it was indeed delivered to <em>Henry Baker </em>for him. And although <em>Henry, </em>by virtue of his power, became instantly invested by remitter in right of <em>Hodnett, </em>he could not be so invested till he came into possession, for remitter presumes, <em>ex vi termini, </em>an actually acquired possession. Indeed the supposition that the possession taken on the 9th of June could relate to the 28th of May is only a fiction by relation, and this fiction cannot be admitted to the prejudice of the rights of creditors. The <em>demand, </em>itself does not appear to have, been made previous to the 9th of June. And though an actual demand followed by acquisition of the possession may be considered as breaking the continuity of the loanee\u2019s possession, it would be going too far to say that the <em>authority </em>to demand shall have that effect from its date.</p>\n<p id=\"A4J\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>I think, therefore, that there was error in the instruc^orl giyen to the jury, that the resumption of possession was to be reckoned from the date of the power. I am also of opinion that the deed of loan mentioned in the third bill of exceptions, not having been recorded, and not having been accompanied by a public, open and notorious return and reloan of the slave (see <em>Boyd &amp; Swepson &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Stainback &amp;c. </em>5 Munf. 305.) was improperly admitted to go to the jury. I am therefore of opinion to reverse the judgment, set aside the verdict, and send the cause back for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Judgment reversed and new tidal awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
