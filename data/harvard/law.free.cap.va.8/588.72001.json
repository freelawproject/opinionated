The record disclosed in substance the following case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0Sy\"><em>Robert Draffin, </em>the owner of certain land on <em>Ivy </em>creek in the county of <em>Albemarle, </em>conveyed it in the year 1S05, in trust to secure the payment of certain debts, amongst which was a debt to <em>William Brown Sf Co. </em>The land was sold by the trustee, purchased for the firm of <em>Brown &lt;y Co. </em>and conveyed to <em>Brown. Draffin </em>however retained possession, and contested the sale. In this state of the matter, <em>Brown </em>having died, an arrangement was made in the year 1815 between <em>Boyd Miller </em>the surviving partner of <em>Brown 8{ Co. </em>of the one part, and <em>James Douglass \u25a0 </em>and <em>Crenshaw Fretwell </em>of the other part, of the <em>following </em>nature. <em>Douglass </em>and <em>Fretwell </em>became the ostensi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>ble purchasers of the land at the price of 2550 dollars, \u25a0*- # 1 to be paid in two instalments, the one of 1200 dollars payable in 1816, the other of 1350 dollars payable in 1817. They were to indemnify <em>Miller </em>against certain responsibilities which his firm had incurred for <em>Draffm; </em>to execute their bonds for the two instalments of the purchase money; and to receive a conveyance or release of the title to the land. This arrangement was made for the benefit of <em>Drafin, </em>who was to pay the purchase money, and protect <em>Douglass </em>and <em>Fretwdl </em>from loss on account of their engagements. They executed their bonds pursuant to the arrangement, and <em>Miller </em>executed to them a deed of release for the land ; but his deed was not delivered. No written evidence was preserved of <em>Drafjin's </em>interest in the contract, but he was left in possession of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-5\"><em>Draffm </em>paid the bond of 1200 dollars in 1816, and afterwards paid 800 dollars, part of the bond for 1350 dollars. Then he went to Kentucky, leaving <em>James Douglass </em>in possession of part of the land, and his son <em>Thomas Draffm </em>in possession of the residue, with funds at command sufficient to pay the balance of the purchase money. <em>Thomas Draffm, </em>in his father\u2019s absence, put into the hands of <em>Fretwdl </em>the balance due upon th\u00e9 last bond, but <em>Fretwdl </em>failed to pay over this balance to <em>Miller. </em>Suit was brought at law against <em>Fretwdl </em>and <em>Douglass, </em>and judgment recovered against them. An execution issued on this judgment, and a forthcoming bond was executed by <em>Frctwell, </em>with <em>Thomas Draffm </em>as his surety, upon which bond execution was afterwards awarded. An appeal was taken from the judgment on the forthcoming bond, and that judgment affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-6\">On the 17th of November 1820, while <em>Robert Dra.ffn </em>was yet in <em>Kentucky, Fretwdl </em>filed his bill in the court of chancery at <em>Staunton, </em>making <em>Boyd Miller </em>the sole defendant thereto. In this bill <em>Fretwdl </em>claimed to be the sole purchaser of the land, alleging that he had paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the first bond and 800 dollars of the second; that he had sold one half of the land to <em>Douglass; </em>that he had made a compromise with <em>Robert Draffin, </em>and had received no title, it being in the heirs of <em>Brown, </em>and <em>Miller </em>being consequently unable to make it. An injunction was prayed for to the judgment, which was granted, and <em>John Fagg </em>became <em>Fretwell's </em>surety in the injunction bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-4\"><em>Sometime </em>afterwards, in November 1828, <em>Douglass </em>having discovered what measures <em>Fretwell </em>was pursuing, filed his bill also in the court of chancery at <em>Staunton, </em>disclosing the character of the purchase by himself and <em>Fretwell, </em>the interest of <em>Draffin, </em>and the obligation of <em>Fretwell </em>to pay the balance of the money, without any right to the land; concluding his bill with a prayer ' that <em>Fretwell </em>should be restrained from getting the title, and that his injunction should be dissolved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-5\">While these suits were pending, <em>Robert Draffin </em>returned from <em>Kentucky, </em>and in May 1825 filed his bill in the <em>Sta,unton </em>chancery court, making <em>Brown\u2019s </em>heirs, <em>Boyd Miller, Fretwell </em>and <em>Douglass </em>defendants, setting forth the whole case, and praying that <em>Fretwell's </em>injunction might be dissolved, that he might be compelled to pay the balance of the purchase money, and that the title to the land might be conveyed to him the complainant. <em>Fretwell </em>answered this bill, as he had previously answered that of <em>Douglass, </em>insisting that he had \u2022 an interest in the purchase of the land ; that 200 acres thereof were to be secured to him ,* that he had paid a small part of the first bond ; that he, and not <em>Draffin, </em>had paid S00 dollars of the second bond; and that <em>Thomas Draffin </em>had never put into his hands any money to pay the balance of the second bond ; though he admitted that he had become indebted to <em>Thomas Draffin </em>about the amount of that balance, and executed his note therefor. <em>Douglass </em>answered, admitting the statement in <em>Draffin's </em>bill to be true, but alleging that before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number><em>Drajjin </em>went to <em>Kentucky, </em>respondent had advanced to him 2000 dollars, on his promise to secure it upon the land in question ; that he had made him further advanees, and after his return, had settled with him, ascertaining the whole amount of the advances to be 5280 dollars, for which he had agreed to purchase of <em>Draffin </em>440 acres of the land, the whole tract being between 600 and 700 acres. He exhibited <em>Drajjin?s </em>receipt, bearing date the 21st of August 1826, and acknowledging the purchase. Among the proofs in this cause was the deposition of <em>Thomas Drajjin, </em>declaring that the whole of the first bond, and 800 dollars of the second, had been paid by <em>Robert Draffin, </em>and that he the deponent had paid into the hands of <em>Fretwell </em>the balance of the purchase money, upon his promise to pay it over to <em>Boyd Miller.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-4\"><em>DraffiFs </em>bill was brought to a hearing the 13th of December 1827. Whereupon the court pronounced as its opinion, \u201c that the defendants <em>Douglass </em>and <em>Fretwell </em>have no claim whatever to the lands mentioned in the bill, arising under their contract of purchase, they having interested themselves ifa the purchase for the benefit of the plaintiff, and having agreed to release, in case the plaintiff' should thereafter pay the purchase money which they had undertaken to pay.\u201d The court was \u201cfurther of opinion, from the evidence in this cause, that the plaintiff faithfully complied with his contract, by discharging to the agent of <em>Miller </em>all the money which <em>Douglass </em>and <em>Fretwell </em>had undertaken to pay for him to <em>Miller, </em>except the sum of \u00bf\u00a3166. <em>3. 1. </em>with interest thereon from the 2d of July 1817 till paid, and that this balance, though not paid over to the defendant <em>Miller, </em>as it ought to have been, by the defendant <em>Fretwell, </em>has been paid by the plaintiff to the defendant Fretwell.\u201d After further stating its opinion as to the right of <em>Douglass </em>to the 440 acres of land, and the lien of <em>Miller </em>upon all the lands for the balance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>the purchase money, the court adjudged, ordered and decreed that <em>George Eskridge, </em>the marshal of the court, be appointed a commissioner to convey to the plaintiff the title of <em>Brown's </em>heirs, and also to execute a release to the plaintiff of all the interest of <em>Boyd, Miller </em>in the lands, \u201c so soon as it is ascertained that the defendant <em>Miller </em>has obtained payment of the said sum of &lt;\u00a3166\u00b0 3. 1. with interest from the 2d of July 1817 till paid, from the defendant <em>Fretwell </em>or his securities, or from any other person.\u201d <em>Draffin, </em>after thus obtaining the legal title, was decreed to convey to <em>Douglass </em>the 440 acres.

The marshal of the court did not answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-4\"><em>William Harper, </em>on his motion, was admitted a defendant, and claimed 200 acres of land, the residue of the tract after satisfying the claim of <em>Douglass </em>for 440 acres. In September 1827, after the dissolution of <em>Fretwell\u2019s </em>injunction, <em>Harper, </em>with knowledge of that dissolution, lent 1500 dollars to <em>Draffm, </em>and took a deed of trust on the 200 acres of land to secure the payment. At a subsequent sale under the deed, made in 1831, he purchased the land for 1700 dollars, and took a deed from the trustee. He therefore resisted the claim of <em>Fagg, </em>and insisted that if it should be established, the burthen should be thrown on <em>Fagg </em>for his indemnity, or if that could not be done, that <em>Douglass </em>should contribute ratably with him in proportion to the relative value of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-6\">Among the exhibits in the cause were the following.\u2014 A copy of a record from <em>Albemarle </em>county court, shewing that in November 1823, <em>Thomas Draffin </em>had brought an action of debt against <em>Fretwell </em>on a single bill dated July 4th 1817, for \u00bf\u00a3163. 17. 3. and obtained a judgment by confession, on which a <em>fieri facias </em>issued in June 1824, which was never returned.

It is evident that the dissolution of the injunction of <em>Fret-well </em>against <em>Miller </em>decided nothing as to the payment of the .-\u00a3160. 3. 1. <em>by Draffin </em>to <em>Fretwell. </em>That matter was not put in issue by the pleadings, and the injunction ought to have been dissolved, and no doubt was dissolved, upon the ground that <em>Fretwell </em>had no right to the conveyance of the title which he sought. The same order must have been made, if <em>Fretwell </em>had proved the payment by himself to <em>Miller\u2019s </em>agent, of the \u00bfC166. 3. 1. because it was clearly established that the purchase of the land was made by <em>Fretwell </em>and <em>Douglass </em>for the benefit of <em>Robert Draffin. </em>So too the decree in the case of <em>Draffin </em>against <em>Miller </em>and others, so fox as it directs the title to be made to <em>Robert Draffin </em>for the land in the bill mentioned, and a release of <em>Boyd Miller\u2019s </em>right, <em>\u201c </em>so soon as it is ascertained that <em>Miller </em>has obtained payment of the said sum of o\u00a3 166. 3; 1. with interest &amp;c. from the defendant <em>Fretwell </em>or his securities, or from any other person,\u201d \u2014 without directly decreeing that <em>Fretwell </em>should pay that sum, \u2014 seemed to me not to conclude the question of the liability of <em>Fretwell, </em>so as to bind <em>Fagg; </em>because such a decree might have been properly made, whether <em>Fretwell </em>had received from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>Draffin </em>the <em>\u00a3 166. 3. 1. or </em>not; and the fact that the decree fixed the liability of <em>Fretwell </em>for that sum, was perhaps rather matter to be inferred by argument from the decree, as having constituted one of its grounds, than <em>directly </em>adjudicated. See 1 Starkie on Evid. 183. <em>et seq. </em>Id. 202, I was therefore inclined at first to think that the question of <em>FretwelVs </em>liability had not been conclusively settled by the decree actually made, because the opinions expressed by the chancellor in the first part of it were rather the annunciation of the grounds and reasons for making the decree, than the decree itself. But further reflection, and conference with my brethren, have satisfied me that this impression was incorrect. The fact of the payment of the balance of the purchase money for the land, by <em>Robert Draffin </em>to <em>Fretwell, </em>who had given his bonds to <em>Miller, </em>is expressly alleged in the bill, and denied in the answer. It was therefore a matter directly in issue; and upon the evidence adduced on that point, the chancellor, in the first part of the decree, expresses the opinion that this balance of \u00bf\u00a3166. 3. 1. \u201cthough not paid over to the defendant <em>Miller, </em>as it ought to have been, by the defendant <em>Fret-well, </em>has been paid by the plaintiff to the defendant <em>Fretwell.\u201d </em>This opinion I must regard as a judicial decision of the fact between <em>Draffin </em>and <em>Fretwell, </em>not to be afterwards drawn in question between <em>them. </em>It is a matter directly determined, upon an issue formally made between the parties; and public policy requires that it should not be again brought into litigation, unless fraud in obtaining the decree is alleged and proved. So too it is binding upon the surety of <em>Fretwell, </em>and upon all other persons, as an adjudicated fact j that is to say, no person, in any controversy, can be permitted to deny that <em>Fretwell </em>received the \u00bf\u00a3 166. 3. 1. from <em>Draffin, </em>and is bound for it. They may deny <em>their own </em>obligations to pay as surety or otherwise, but not <em>his. Munford &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Overseers of the Poor, </em>2 Rand. 313. <em>Craddock </em>v. <em>Turner's adm'x, </em>6 Leigh 116. <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Clemens, Id. </em>600.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>It is unnecessary to decide how far this principle might be affected by the proof of a. fraudulent combination to charge <em>Fretwell. </em>There is no such evidence in this cause, and the most that can be said is, that the decree was obtained on the testimony of an interested or discreditable witness. <em>Fretwell\u2019s </em>attention was called to the evidence of that witness, and he might have shewn his interest or want of credit, if he had used ordinary diligence, by the same proof that the appellee subsequently produced. Even the discovery of new evidence, which merely goes to impeach the credit of witnesses examined in the original suit, or of cumulative witnesses to a litigated fact, is not sufficient to impeach a decree. <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>JBvFbs and others, </em>3 Johns. Ch. E.ep. 124. Moreover there was other evidence strongly corroborative of <em>Thomas D raffin\u2019s, </em>and in the present case itself there is no testimony outweighing the positive denial of the several answers, corroborated by circumstances, or disproving the receipt by <em>Fretwell </em>of the balance of the purchase money from <em>Draffm </em>to be paid to <em>Miller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Taking, then, the fact to be that <em>Fretivell </em>did receive this money, and ought to have paid it to <em>Miller, </em>the only-other question is as <em>to </em>the right of <em>Fagg </em>to be substituted to the remedies <em>o\u00ed Miller </em>against the land of <em>Draffin, </em>He claims this right, because be has paid <em>Miller </em>a debt binding <em>Draffim\u2019s </em>land; and although he has paid it as surety for <em>Fretwell, </em>who received the money from <em>Draffin, </em>and ought to have paid <em>Miller, </em>yet he contends that as <em>Miller </em>could charge the land, he, on the principle of subrogation, may charge it, as standing in the creditor\u2019s shoes, and entitled to all his remedies, not only against his principal <em>Fretwell, </em>but all others liable for the debt; and for this he cites 1 Pothier on Obligations, part 2, ch. 6, art. 3, [427,]</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">.It is obvious, I think, that <em>Pothier, </em>in this passage, lays down the doctrine too broadly; and that in part 3. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>ch. 1. art. 6. \u00a7 2. [520.] he states it more accurately, when he says \u201c that <em>all </em>those who are bound for a debt for others, or with others, <em>by whom they ought to be discharged either wholly or in part, </em>have a right, upon paying, to demand a cession of the actions of the creditor against the other debtors.\u201d If, in equity and justice, <em>Draffin </em>or the holders of the land under him be bound to discharge this debt or any part of it to <em>Fagg, </em>then, and not before, he may ask a court of chancery to substitute him in the place of the creditor <em>Miller. </em>The doctrine of subrogation, it must be remembered, is the offspring of natural justice., and is not founded in contract. It is the creature of equity, and is so administered as to attain real essential justice, without regard to form. \u201c He who, in administering it, would <em>stick in the letter, </em>forgets the end of its creation, and perverts the Spirit which gave it birth.\u201d Judge <em>Carr </em>in <em>Enders &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Brune, </em>4 Rand. 447. Now here it is attempted <em>to charge Draffin, </em>because some of the books lay down the broad proposition that a surety paying may require the creditor to subrogate him to all his rights, actions and hypothecations against all persons liable for the debt. But the courts, in applying the doctrine, have taken care to make it subserve the ends of justice. Thus they always enquire who is the principal debtor, and if any one comes into his room as to the creditor, they absolve previous sureties; holding that the supplemental surety comes also into the room of the principal debtor, <em>as to these previous sureties. </em>On this principle the case of <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Briddock, </em>2 Vern. 608, was decided, which is recognized in <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Morley, 11 Ves. 12. </em>and in all the subsequent cases. <em>There, the </em>original sureties, who paid, were substituted to the rights of the creditor against the bail: but certainly if the bail (the supplemental sureties) had paid, <em>they </em>could not have had a cession of the action of the creditor against the sureties in the bond. Yet they were liable to the credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>tor, and on the principle contended for by the counsel for the appellee, they ought to have been placed in his shoes. '</p>\n<p id=\"Ail\">The principal debtor, the <em>real </em>debtor in this case, is <em>Fretwell. Douglass </em>was an original surety, and the land of <em>Draffin </em>was also bound. When the judgment was obtained against <em>Fretwell, </em>and he gave a delivery bond with <em>Thomas Draffn </em>as his surety, <em>if Robert Draffin </em>had paid the debt, he would have been subrogated to the rights of the creditor, not only against <em>Fretwell, but </em>against <em>Thomas Draffin, </em>who had interposed, himself between the principal debtor and the original sureties. Afterwards, when <em>Fagg </em>became the surety in the injunction bond, although but a surety himself, yet he came in the room of <em>Fretwell </em>as to all sureties who would have had a right to call on <em>Fretwell </em>for payment, either directly, or by subrogation to the actions of the creditor; This is precisely the principle of the case of <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Bridiock; </em>and it is the correct principle; since, but for bis interference, the debt might have been made out of the principal debtor, or his first supplemental surety <em>Thomas Draffin, </em>and <em>Robert Drajfn </em>and those claiming under him might have been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">If this be so, it would be an absurdity to hold that <em>Fagg, </em>paying for the real debtor, can be entitled to all the remedies of the creditor against <em>Draffn </em>or <em>Draffn''s </em>land, or against his grantees <em>Douglass </em>and <em>Harper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">I am of opinion to reverse the decree, and dismiss the bill with costs.</p>\n<author id=\"b619-7\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aj_\">I take as the foundation of my opinion in this case, the fact that <em>Draffin </em>had, through his son <em>Thomas, </em>paid to <em>Fretwell \u00a3 </em>1G6. 3. 1. the balance due to <em>Miller, </em>for the purpose of being paid over to <em>Miller. </em>This fact is settled as between <em>Fretwell </em>and <em>Draffin, </em>and cannot <em>be </em>contested by any third person. <em>Fagg </em>is no more entitled to contest it, than the surety in an admi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>nistration bond can contest the justice of the judgment of a creditor against the estate. He is conclusively bound' by what is decreed against his principal, for his obligation is to pay if the injunction be dissolved, and without any reference to the justice or injustice of that dissolution. He can neither appeal from it, nor call it in question, nor renew the contest by a new bill of injunction ; for that would be infinite, as every successive surety in the successive injunctions would, upon the same principles, have the same right. <em>Fagg </em>then is conclusively bound by the several decrees, unless he has successfully impeached them. This he has not done, \u2014 if it had been even competent to him to do it upon any ether ground except confederacy between <em>Fretwell </em>and <em>Drafin, </em>which cannot be pretended. The only ground \u2022upon which his bill rests is the peijury of <em>Thomas Drafin, </em>which is not a sufficient ground for this anomalous proceeding. It is not a sufficient ground for a new \u2022trial or relief in equity (1 Johns. Ch. Rep. <em>322, 324, 6 </em>Johns. Rep. 248.) and certainly would not be so in -this case, where the character of the witness was thoroughly sifted in the former suit; where the evidence was sufficient, without his testimony, to sustain the decree ; and where the material fact, that <em>Fretwell received, </em>the money, is proved by his own note, filed in the cause at law in which judgment was rendered against him for the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Taking then as unquestionable the facts established by the decrees, that the purchase from <em>Miller </em>by <em>Fret-well </em>and <em>Douglass </em>was made for <em>Drafin, </em>and that he has paid <em>Miller </em>the whole purchase money except <em>\u00a3 </em>166. <em>8. </em>1. which he has paid to <em>Fretwell, </em>to be paid over to <em>Miller ; </em>how stands the case ? The creditor, not having received the balance due to him, and being, satisfied that <em>Drafin </em>had honestly paid it to <em>Fretwell, </em>sues upon the bond of <em>Fretwell </em>and <em>Douglass, </em>instead of endeavouring to throw the charge upon the land. This was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>both equitable and prudent; forbad he attempted to charge the land, <em>Fretwell </em>must have been a party, and the court would, in that suit, have <em>\u201c </em>put the saddle upon the right horse,\u201d or if it decreed against <em>Drajjin </em>in favour of <em>Miller, </em>would have decreed over against <em>Fret-well </em>in favour of <em>Drajjim,.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Judgment having been recovered against <em>Fretwell </em>and <em>Douglass, </em>and a <em>Ji. fa. </em>levied on <em>FretwelVs </em>goods, he gave a delivery bond, in W'hich <em>Douglass </em>did not join, but <em>Thomas Drajjin </em>became his surety. Judgment was rendered on the delivery bond, and affirmed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Then comes the injunction ; and <em>Fagg </em>becomes surety in the injunction bond. The creditor still pursues <em>Fret-well </em>by suit on this bond, and obtains judgment and sues execution against him and <em>Fagg. </em>By this lime <em>Fretwell </em>is insolvent, and <em>Fagg, before he pays off the execution, </em>files this bill, seeking subrogation to all <em>Miller's </em>rights \u2014 not against <em>Fretwell, </em>but against <em>Drajjin </em>and his land!</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The execution against <em>Fagg </em>being unsatisfied when he filed his bill, he can only be looked upon in the light of a surety who is liable for a debt and is demanding subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">It is contended, however, that he is to be considered as a stranger who lias volunteered <em>to </em>pay off the debt. If so, it may well bo questioned whether he has title to relief, since by our law no man has a right to pay another\u2019s debt, for which he is not bound, except in the case of a bill of exchange, by the law merchant. It is conceded by <em>Fothier, </em>as a general rule, that a cession of actions cannot he compelled by a stranger, who pays a debt for which he is not liable. 1 Pothier, part 3, ch. 1, art. 6, \u00a7 2, [520,] He states truly, that in strictness, where a debt is <em>paid, </em>it is <em>extinguished, and there is no longer an action to cede; </em>hut for the purposes of justice, by a fiction of law, the payment is looked upon as a purchase by the party who pays, and a sale by the cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>ditor. And so in our courts of equity, though the judgment is in fact extinguished by the payment, yet it is kept alive in contemplation of equity, for the benefit of the surety. <em>Per </em>Marshall, C. J. in 2 Brock. Rep. 254. But this fiction will not be adopted where it will effect injustice, and particularly to the prejudice of those having strong claims to exoneration. A stranger, it would seem, is denied the benefit of it, and cannot demand subrogation. Such at least is the suggestion of the late chief justice. 2 Brock. Rep. <em>ubi supra. </em>But even admit that as bonds in <em>Virginia </em>are assignable, <em>the </em>stranger who pays off a bond is to be considered as entitled to be subrogated to the creditor\u2019s rights; the principle would still not avail the appellee. For he paid as <em>surety, </em>and as surety for <em>Fretwell; </em>and the utmost limit of <em>his </em>rights was subrogation to the creditor\u2019s rights against <em>Fretwell, </em>and against all who were bound for <em>FretweWs </em>debt, and whose right of exoneration was not equal or superiour to his own. If their equities were equal, the court would not interfere; and still less, if his were inferiour.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Let us then examine the claims of the respective parties more closely. \u201c The benefit which the law allows to the surety is, that when he pays, he may require of the creditor to subrogate him to all^ his rights, actions and hypothecations, as well against the principal debtor for whom he has become <em>surety, as </em>against all other persons who are liable for the debt.\u201d Now he who \u00e1ctually owes the money is the principal debtor; and here <em>Fretwell </em>was, both in form and sqbstance, principal; in <em>form, </em>as he was bound in the bond to <em>Miller, </em>and in <em>substance, </em>as the money was due from and to be paid by him. <em>Draffin, </em>on the other hand, being bound for the money indeed, as his land was bound for it, but owing not a cent of it, stands in the character only of surety for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">What was the effect of this relation of the parties ? Why, as <em>Draffirtis </em>land was bound if <em>Fretwell </em>did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>pay, he had a right to demand that the creditor should either proceed (and that diligently too) against the real debtor, or should permit him to do so. This is a common equity. See 4 Desauss. Ch. Rep. 44, 227. And upon this proceeding, a judgment being obtained against <em>Fretwell </em>and <em>Fagg </em>upon the injunction bond, <em>Fagg </em>would be compelled to pay the money for the exoneration of <em>Draffn. </em>Now the creditor has done precisely that which <em>Draffm </em>had a right to demand that he should do. He has sued <em>Fretwdl </em>and <em>Fagg, </em>instead of enforcing his claim against the land. He has preferred to recover his debt from <em>Fretwell, </em>who he well knew did owe it, rather than from <em>Draffm, </em>who he well knew did not owe it. And <em>Fretwell </em>being insolvent, he enforced payment from <em>Fagg, </em>as he was bound in equity to do, for <em>Draffn\u2019s </em>indemnification. And yet, as soon as this is done, \u2014 as soon as <em>Draffm\u2019s </em>land is freed from the incumbrances, \u2014 it seems to be supposed that the tide is to be rolled back upon <em>Draffm, </em>and he is to be overwhelmed by the reflux of the principle which had but just given him relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">IPad <em>Draffn </em>actually paid the money to <em>Miller, </em>ho would have been entitled, according to the letter and spirit of the principle quoted from <em>Fothier, to </em>a subrogation to all <em>Miller\u2019s </em>rights against <em>Fretwell, </em>and against all other persons bound for him. One of these was <em>Fagg. </em>If, then, upon the payment of the money, he would have a right to substitution against <em>Fagg, </em>it is impossible that <em>Fagg </em>can have a right of subrogation against him. The two pretensions are antagonizing and incompatible. The former I hold to be unquestionable, and the latter therefore can have no existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">There is another view of this subject, which seems to me conclusive. <em>Draffn </em>is certainly entitled, upon payment of the money, to subrogation against <em>Fretwdl </em>and <em>Thomas Draffn. Thomas Draffm </em>the surety in the delivery bond, on the principle of <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Briddock, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>was entitled to subrogation against <em>Fagg. </em>Therefore <em>Robert Draffin </em>was entitled to subrogation against him, and of course he cannot have it against <em>Draffin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ag0H\">With these views, I am of opinion to reverse the decree, and to dismiss the bill with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Brockenbrotjgh, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b624-6\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AvV\">concurring in opinion to reverse the decree, <em>it </em>was reversed accordingly, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
