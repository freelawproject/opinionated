But, if <em>Robert Morris </em>was compelled to pay that judgment, then he the said <em>Morris </em>was to be credited with so much as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the payment should-exceed the said <em>\u00a3 </em>1950. 14. 1. And that when the tobacco transactions of <em>Lory, Plumbard &amp;f Co. </em>were settled, <em>Braxton </em>was to have credit, 1. For any money that <em>Morris\u2019s </em>share of 'the proceeds should fall short of <em>\u00a3 </em>246. 2. <em>2-f </em>the amount of balances on the sloop Union, and the merchandize at Cape Francois. 2. For half of any loss which might appear upon the final settlement of the adventure with <em>Pleasants, Shore &amp;/\u25a0 Co. </em>But, if the amount of half the proceeds of the said tobacco should exceed the \u00a3246. 2. <em>2%., Morris </em>was to have a-further credit for the same. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-6\"><em>Braxton </em>appealed to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASB\">For the appellant, it was insisted that the agreement respecting the commercial transactions ought not to be interpreted according to the letter; but should be expounded, under the express stipulation in the last article, by the principles of equity; and consequently, whenever justice required, that it should be disregarded, it ought to be departed from. That, in various instances, the commissioners had not observed the true <em>dates} </em>and that the exceptions which had been disallowed by the chancellor, were sustained by <em>the </em>evidence. That <em>Braxton </em>ought to have been allowed the price of the Westpoint land, as the monies due him upon the accounts would discharge all the incumbrances on it, and the getting in of the legal estate was matter of form, which might be provided for at the time of the final decree. <em>Langford </em>v. <em>Pitt, </em>2 Wms. 629. <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>1 Atk. 12. That the commission account was not rightly settled; and that the affair of <em>Whitesides &amp;/\u2022 Co., </em>was improperly adjusted, as <em>Braxton </em>ought to have credit at an <em>earlier date. </em>That <em>Braxton </em>was entitled to the full amount of <em>Cowjper\u2019s </em>bill; and that the issue directed by the county court, to ascertain the loss sustained by the nonpayment of <em>M\u2019Call\u2019s </em>debt, was improperly framed, as it did not embrace the intended object; and therefore, that a new issue ought to be directed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>For the appellee, it was said, that the agreement ought to be construed according to the letter, except where particular instances, not in the ordinary course of the transactions, could be shewn j for the provision, in the last article, did not extend to all cases indiscriminately. That the debits and credits stood at their proper dates in the report 5 and that the exceptions which the chancellor had disallowed were properly disregarded. That <em>Braxton </em>was not able to make a clear title to the Westpoint land; and therefore, was not entitled to credit for the price, as the incumbrances would exceed the purchase money, and there was not the least probability that <em>Braxton </em>would be a creditor upon any view which could be taken of the account. <em>2 </em>Wms. 198. 1 <em>Bro. Ch. </em>75. That the commission account, and the affair of <em>Whitesides &amp; Co., </em>were rightly settled; and that <em>Braxton </em>was not entitled to the full amount of <em>Cowper\u2019s </em>bill, as the latter retained it for the unpaid balance. That the issue directed by the county court embraced the object that was contemplated, form being disregarded in such cases j and, as it had been found for the defendant, the verdict was conclusive, as to the damages pretended to have been sustained by the non-payment of <em>M\u2019Call\u2019s </em>debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-4\">In reply it was insisted, that the provision in the last article of the agreement was general, and applied to all cases, where justice required that the rules laid down in the body of it should be disregarded. That <em>Morris </em>was apprized of the incumbrances upon the Westpoint land at the time of the contract, and only stipulated for a removal of that of <em>Love, </em>which <em>Braxton </em>had a right to do at any time, as no period short of the final settlement of the accounts was fixed; and therefore, if the state of accounts was in his favour, the price of that estate ought to be brought to his credit; for the stipulation was that it should be liquidated in the settlement, which amounted to an agreement that the whole intervening time was to be allowed to get in the incumbrance, so as to make its price a debit in the account. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>That the issue directed by the county court was misconceived, as it did not raise the question-of the special damage; and therefore one more suitable to the nature of the case, and better calculated to satisfy the conscience of the chancellor, ought to be directed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b336-9\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult. '</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b336-10\">Pendleton, President,</author>\n<p id=\"AJ2\">said that the court had framed a decree in the cause; which he directed to be read by the clerk in open court, and entered on the order book, as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">The court having maturely considered the transcript of the record, the several exhibits therein referred to, and the arguments of the counsel, is of opinion upon the several heads of discussion stated in the interlocutory decree of the said high court of chancery, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\"><em>On head the first. </em>\u2014 \u201c The claim of <em>Carter Braxton </em>to be allowed the difference in depreciation of money between the time of payment, as stated by the commissioner, and the date of the contracts on which the money became due.\u201d That the court are not precluded from this discussion by the third article of the agreement, No. 1, but are at liberty under the last article of the said agreement, to depart from the principles of the said third article, if right and justice between the parties shall require it. That the connection between the parties was not that of a general copartnery, but particular speculations, in which the joint stock was to consist, not of money, but of commodities, to be purchased and collected by <em>Carter Braxton, </em>from time to time; and when received by bim, became joint property, who was alone answerable to the vendors for the price, and <em>Willing &amp; Morris </em>and <em>Robert Morris </em>accountable to him for a moiety thereof when the commodity came into the joint stock; and, therefore, in all contracts made by <em>Braxton, </em>which were executed by delivery of the commodity at the time, the date of the contract ought to regulate the scale of depreciation, without respect to the time of payment; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>that in all executory contracts for purchases made by him, except so far as money was really paid in advance, the time of delivery of the article to him, ought to be the rule; and not the date of contract or time of payment; and that in the case of tobacco, the time of delivery shall be that on which the inspectors\u2019 notes were put into the hands of <em>Braxton, </em>or orders, entitling him to call on the inspectors for tobacco inspected, and this rule shall be reciprocally applied in cases of purchases made by <em>Willing &amp; Morris </em>or <em>Morris, </em>and in this application, it appears that an error is committed in entering to the credit of <em>Willing &amp; Morris, </em>the costs of the brigantine <em>Braxton, </em>as in January one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, instead of November in the same year, since, although the said brigantine was purchased and paid for in January, she was bought as the property of <em>Willing &amp; </em>Morris, and remained so until the said month of November, when it was agreed that she should become joint property. If other instances occur, they are to be corrected according to the principle before established. Under this head, there would appear an error in entering to the credit of <em>Carter Braxton, </em>six thousand eight hundred and twenty-three pounds fourteen shillings and nine pence, as paid <em>Nicholas </em>and <em>Jacob Faulcon, </em>as of April one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, which, by the testimony of <em>Alexander Love </em>and <em>Charles Irving, </em>appears to have been paid in the month of February preceding, and ought to stand at <em>Carter Braxton\u2019s </em>credit in that month, but it being suggested that this error hath been wholly or in pari corrected in the accounts, the parlies are to be at liberty to have that error and its correction examined, and properly adjusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><em>On head the second. </em>\u2014 \u201c A claim of <em>Carter Braxton, </em>of short allowance for loss by depreciation on money unused.\u201d That there appears no error in this part of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><em>On head the third. </em>\u2014 \u201c The claim of <em>Carter Braxton, </em>to be allowed for the difference between specie and paper money on the amount of <em>Bingham\u2019s </em>bill on <em>Morris.\u201d </em>That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>with this bill, <em>Willing &amp; Morris </em>were no otherwise concerned than as drawees and acceptors, and as such, were chargeable with the money in April, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, but as by <em>Carter Braxton\u2019s </em>consent, the money was to remain in their hands, as a deposit to answer <em>Wroe\u2019s </em>expense in the outfit of the sloop <em>Spitfire, </em>the application of the money to that use, as stated in the accounts, does justice in that respect between the parties, and that the money received by Mr. <em>Griffin of Wroe, </em>is rightly' charged to <em>Carter Braxton, </em>at the time Mr. <em>Griffin </em>received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\"><em>On head the fourth. </em>\u2014 \u201c The claim of <em>Carter Braxton to be </em>allowed the difference in depreciation on the money paid for <em>Dixons &amp; Page\u2019s </em>bills, between the date of the bills and the time of their payment.\u201d That this claim depending on the state of advances at the time the bills were drawn, according to the third article of the agreement, No. 1, there is no error in this part of the decree, unless the state of those advances shall be changed by the corrections made in consequence of this decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\"><em>On head the fifth. </em>\u2014 \u201c The claim of <em>Carter Braxton </em>to be allowed the difference between seventeen shillings and six pence, and twenty shillings per hundred, on one hundred and sixty-six thousand three hundred and eighty.-two pounds of tobacco, paid <em>Beale </em>for salt.\u201d That by the contract with <em>Beale </em>for the purchase of the salt, amounting in paper to thirteen thousand two hundred and twenty-three pounds, twelve shillings and six pence, part was to be paid for in money, and part in tobacco, and by the final settlement between <em>Braxton </em>and <em>Beale, </em>the above quantity of tobacco appears to have been allowed in specie, at seventeen shillings and six pence per hundred, and the residue of the money scaled at five for one. The twenty shillings per hundred for tobacco, which <em>Beale </em>speaks <em>of, </em>respects the tobacco on account of vessels, and not that paid on the salt account. The credit which Mr. <em>Braxton </em>is entitled to for this article, is two thousand four hundred and forty-four pounds fourteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>shillings and six pence specie, (not two thousand six hundred and forty-four pounds fourteen shillings and six pence, stated by Beale, by an error of two hundred pounds in reducing the money,) and if it is not so stated to his credit in the accounts, it ought, by correction, to be made so.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><em>On head the sixth. </em>\u2014 \"The claim of <em>Carter Braxton </em>to be allowed the difference between specie for which the green beef was received, and the depreciation at the time it was sold.\u201d That on the principle now established, <em>Braxton </em>was entitled to a credit for the beef when it tvas received, and to be debited the same sum when it was sold. The times of receipt or sale are not ascertained with precision, but probably both happened in the month of March, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, so as to make no difference either as to the scale of the depreciation or state of advances; and therefore,' there is no error in this head of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\"><em>On head the seventh. </em>\u2014 \u201c The claim for allowances respecting <em>Pleasants, Shore and Company, </em>and <em>Lory, Plomiard and </em>Company.\u201d That there is no error in this part of the decree, suspending those claims as therein stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\"><em>On head the eighth. </em>\u2014 \u201c The claim of <em>Carter Braxton </em>to be allowed for <em>Corbin\u2019s </em>tobacco at the date of contract.\u201d That there is no error in that part of the decree, as it is supposed the tobacco was delivered at the time of the contract, since the contrary doth not appear. The next claim under this head, is, \u201c a claim of <em>Carter Braxton </em>for short credit in money paid <em>Ingram </em>for the <em>Portsmouth </em>and <em>Pamunlcey, </em>by reducing the paper money at five for one, instead of three for one.\u201d That the contract between <em>Braxton </em>and <em>Ingram </em>for the purchase of these sloops, was for paper money, and a reference to the price of tobacco at three pounds per hundred, was only made to establish a scale between them for the real value of the paper compared to specie, and this to be adjusted, as was usual in contracts about that period, by the price of twenty shillings specie per hundred, evincing that in their ideas, three for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number><em>one </em>was <em>the </em>real scale of depreciation, at that time; and, according to that idea, in their final settlement of accounts, they adjusted the paper money by the ratio of twenty shillings per hundred for tobacco, not with intention of favour on either side, but in pursuit of their real contract. That, under the third and last articles of the agreement, the. ideas of the parties,at the time of contract ought to controul the legal scale of depreciation, and entitles <em>Braxton </em>to a credit for specie, on the three thousand six hundred and seventy pounds paper, reduced by a scale of three for one, and on four thousand two hundred pounds at five and an half for one, on account of the money paid <em>Ingram </em>for these vessels. And, .therefore, there is error in so much of the decree as establishes the credit for the specie value reducing the whole by a scale of five for one.</p>\n<p id=\"ATu\"><em>On head the ninth. </em>\u2014 \u201c The claim of <em>Carter Braxton </em>respecting half the purchase of <em>Ball\u2019s </em>estate.\u201d That the <em>agreement </em>of the parties in Henrico court, in the month of August, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, to annul this contract, will operate as a final discharge of <em>Morris </em>from every item of charge on that occasion, but if at a former period <em>Braxton </em>had advanced money for that purchase, the same ought to stand allowed him in the table of advances, from the time of payment to that of annulling the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\"><em>On head the tenth. </em>\u2014 \u201c The claim of <em>Carter Braxton </em>for the damages he sustained in consequence of <em>Morris\u2019s </em>not having paid the debt due from <em>Braxton </em>to <em>Archibald M\u2019Call, </em>according to promise.\u201d It appears, that November the sixteenth, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-eight, <em>Braxton </em>having accepted <em>Cooper\u2019s </em>bill, for sixteen thousand pounds,-drawn by <em>Morris </em>on his private account, requests <em>Morris </em>to pay this private debt to <em>M\u2019Call, </em>expressing his hopes that there are in the hands of <em>Whitesides and Company, </em>sufficient effects to answer it. <em>Morris, </em>in a letter to <em>Braxton, </em>of December eighth, following, speaking of the acceptance of <em>Cooper\u2019s </em>bill, says, \u201c it is well, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>your obligation to <em>M\u2019Call </em>shall be discharged.\u201d The deposition of <em>M\u2019Call </em>proves, that he wrote to <em>Braxton </em>in the beginning of one thousand seven hundred and seventy-nine, demanding payment of this debt, evincing that he would have received it, yet it doth not appear that <em>Morris, </em>throughout that year, offered to pay <em>M\u2019Call, </em>nor until early in one thousand seven hundred and eighty, when a kind of loose offer of payment was made by <em>Whitesides, </em>and refused by <em>M\u2019Call; </em>and this court is of opinion, that <em>Morris </em>having undertaken to pay this debt, and prevented <em>Braxton </em>from discharging it then by other convenient means, is bound, however the state of advances between the parties might then be, to recompence <em>Braxton </em>for his damages sustained by the <em>default; </em>to ascertain the quantum of which damages should have been referred to a jury instead of the issue tried, which was so made up as to depend upon the state of advances; the verdict upon that issue, therefore, is unsatisfactory, and ought to be set aside, and a new issue directed to be tried to ascertain the quantum of damages for the nonpayment ; which being tried and certified to the satisfaction of the said high court of chancery, the amount thereof ought to be allowed the said <em>Braxton </em>in account.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\"><em>On head the eleventh. </em>\u2014 \u201c The claim of <em>Carter Braxton </em>to be allowed for the difference to his prejudice in his being charged with ten thousand dollars by <em>Morris, </em>which he alledges was sent him on account of the public.\u201d That there is no error in this part of the decree, which appears supported by the correspondence.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\"><em>On head the twelfth. </em>\u2014 \u201c The claim of <em>Carter Braxton </em>for short credit in commissions.\u201d That from the correspondence between the parties, it appears that <em>Braxton </em>claimed a commission of five per cent, on the amount of purchases, and five per cent, on the amount of sales. <em>Morris </em>objects to it as too high, but seems to yield, if <em>Braxton </em>insists on it, threatening him, however, with contracting the business, or changing his agent: upon which, <em>Braxton </em>leaves it entirely to <em>Morris </em>to settle as he pleased; and so it rested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>until December the thirty-first, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-nine, when <em>Braxton </em>resumes his claim, and states his great fatigue, trouble and expense, in support of it. Morris, in answer, February the third, one thousand seven hundred and eighty, agrees it may be as <em>Bpaxton </em>thinks <em>right; </em>which is considered as an acquiescence in <em>Braxton\u2019s </em>charge of commissions, and so <em>Morris </em>appears to have understood it, from the testimony of <em>Charles Irving; </em>that therefore <em>Braxton </em>is entitled to five per cent, commissions on the amount of all purchases, and on the amount of all sales, accountable himself to his sub-agents for their commissions or reward : and there is error in this part of the decree, and the error in the accounts is to be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">On <em>head the thirteenth. </em>\u2014 \u201c <em>Braxton\u2019s </em>claim for a specific execution of the agreement as to the Westpoint lands.\u201d That although <em>Braxton </em>was not able, at the time of the contract, to make a complete title to <em>Morris, </em>on account of <em>Love\u2019s </em>incumbrance, yet by the principles of equity, he was entitled to a specific performance, if he was able to do so at the time of the decree, or within a reasonable time thereafter, usually allowed ; and for this a precedent is furnished in this court, in the case of <em>Pollard </em>against <em>Rogers, ante. </em>239; and therefore, there is no error in either the interlocutory or final decree on this subject, which are affirmed with this addition, that the time allowed <em>Braxton </em>to perform the condition be extended by the final decree, so as to comprehend the same time as formerly allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\"><em>On head the fourteenth. </em>\u2014 \u201c The claim of <em>Braxton </em>to be allowed the difference between allowing <em>Bonus\u2019s </em>bill at the date instead of the time of payment.\u201d That this bill, drawn by <em>Braxton\u2019s </em>sub-agent upon him, doth not come within the third article of the agreement No. 1, respecting bills drawn between the <em>parties; </em>but when the bill was paid, was an advance of so much money by <em>Braxton, </em>and to be then charged: therefore no error in this part of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">On <em>head the fifteenth. </em>\u2014 \u201c The claim of <em>Braxton </em>to be allowed for <em>Cooler\u2019s </em>whole bill at the time of acceptance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>instead of being allowed for his several payments at the time they were made.\u201d That if Braxton,had, by accepting this bill, discharged <em>Morris </em>from all liability to <em>Cooper </em>for the money, he would have had a right to charge the whole at that time, independent oPthe state of advances; but as <em>Cooper </em>retained the hill, and <em>Morris </em>was liable to him till actual payment, <em>Braxton </em>can only be allowed those payments when made, unless a change in the state of advances shall entitle him to charge the money from the date of the bill, according to the agreement No. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><em>On head the sixteenth. </em>\u2014 The claim of <em>Braxton </em>to be allowed for a moiety of <em>Hudson's </em>bad debt.\u201d That there is no error in this part of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"><em>On head the seventeenth. </em>\u2014 \u201c The claim of <em>Braxton </em>on account of <em>Webb and </em>Company.\u201d This being a joint demand against the company, of which no part has been paid by either, but both sued for the recovery of it, the item of one thousand nine hundred and fifty pounds fourteen shillings and one penny sterling, charged by <em>Braxton </em>for a moiety thereof, ought to be wholly discarded from the account, and the eventual charge made to depend upon the recovery, and the discharge thereof by both or either parly: and this part of the decree ought to be so modelled as to effect that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\"><em>On head the eighteenth. </em>\u2014 \u201c The claim of <em>Braxton </em>for the difference in being allowed, at an improper time, credit for the balance of the money due from <em>Whitesides and Company </em>to him.\u201d That <em>Whitesides and Company </em>were accountable to <em>Braxton </em>for the balance of eight thousand three hundred and eighteen pounds five shillings and six pence, in July, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-nine, when the account of sales was closed, and not before; and in like manner for the sales of the remaining goods, when the account of them was rendered. At the same periods, <em>Robert Morris </em>ought to be chargeable to <em>Braxton, </em>not as a partner of that house, but as having had <em>Braxton's </em>order, in one thousand seven hundred and seventy-eight, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>receive the money, and was entitled to a credit for it with that company, at the periods when they became answerable, and the rather, as <em>Whitesides and Company, </em>in their letter to <em>Braxton </em>of July the thirteenth, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-nine, stating the bidance, say, \u201c which sum we shall account for with Mr. <em>Morris, </em>whom you will please to charge therewith.\u201d How this money is credited, the court are not able to discover; but if it be not credited according to the foregoing principles, is to be corrected and made conformable thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqx\"><em>On head the nineteenth. </em>\u2014 \u201c The claim of <em>Carter Braxton </em>to be allowed for a supposed error in the state of the sterling bond.\u201d That this court do not lake upon them to decide whether this bond, bearing an interest of six per cent., be usurious and void at law or not, the decision of which belongs properly to a court of law; but if it was there adjudged to be so, this court would relieve against that judgment, on the ground of its being a fair transaction, and decree just compensation. The items of the account for which the bond was given, appear to be wholly unexceptionable, provided that there was either deducted previous to taking the bond, or <em>Morris </em>is otherwise charged in the accounts for his proportion, according to his share in the privateer, (independent of the defaults of other partners, for which he is not to be accountable,) of the money paid for the Portuguese vessel. The papers do not enable the court to decide whether this has been don\u00e9 or not: if not, the decree is to be changed, so as to correct that error.</p>\n<p id=\"Ats\">Upon the whole matter, it is decreed and ordered, that such parts of the interlocutory and final decrees as are before stated to be without error, be affirmed; that such parts as are stated to be erroneous be reversed; and that the appellees pay to the appellant his costs by him expended in the prosecution of his appeals aforesaid here, and the cause is remanded to the said high court of chancery to have the directory and eventual parts of the said decrees enquired of, and proceeded on according to the principles respectively laid down as to each part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
