It appeared that <em>Elliott Blake </em>by his will, after certain specific legacies, gave the residue of his property to his brothers and sisters; that the wife of <em>John Richards </em>was the sister of <em>Elliott Blake, </em>of whom <em>William Blake </em>was executor; and that she was still living. The plaintiff thereupon moved the court to exclude the witness from giving testimony, as incompetent from interest, upon which the defendant\u2019s attorney, in the absence of the defendant, offered to enter upon record a release to the witness of all liability to the administrator for costs for which the intestate\u2019s estate was liable, and of all other liability to the said administrator; and the witness also offered to release all his interest in the estates of the said <em>William </em>and <em>Elliott Blake, </em>if any he had; which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel refused to accept, and thereupon the court refused to permit the witness to give testimony; to which opinion the defendant excepted. A verdict being found for the plaintiff, judgment was given on it; and then a <em>supersedeas </em>was obtained from the circuit court. The circuit court, being of opinion that the county court should not have refused to admit the evidence of <em>Richards, </em>reversed the judgment with costs, but failed to give such judgment as the county court ought to have given. Instead of proceeding to give such judgment, it ordered that the cause be retained in the circuit court; and it did not appear on the record that it was so retained by consent of parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-4\">To the judgment of the circuit court a <em>supersedeas </em>vras awarded by a judge of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-11\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the plaintiff in error, cited, on the subject of the interest of the witness, 2 Starkie on Ev. part 4. p. 770. and note 2. <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Elliott, 2 </em>Munf. 452. <em>Rowt </em>v. <em>Kyle, </em>Gilm. 201.

BlaJce </em>deceased, and the county court decided that he was an incompetent witness. Suppose the wife had been offered as a witness; would she have been incompetent? The first objection is that she was the <em>sister </em>of <em>W. BlaJce. </em>If the objection had been that she was a distributee of the estate of <em>W. BlaJce, </em>the objection would have been good, because by her evidence she would have prevented the diminution of the fund to be distributed, and as she was to share in that fund, she was interested in preventing the diminution of it: but she is not stated by the bill of exceptions to be a distributee; she was only a sister, and <em>W. BlaJce </em>might have left children.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The next objection to the competency of the wife of <em>RicJiards </em>as a witness is difficult to comprehend. She was the sister, as <em>W. BlaJce </em>was the brother, of one <em>Elliott BlaJce </em>deceased; he by his will made <em>W. BlaJce </em>his executor, and the said <em>W. BlaJce </em>and mrs. <em>RicJiards </em>were two of the residuary legatees of <em>Elliott BlaJce. </em>What has this to do with the question of mrs. <em>RicJiards\u2019s </em>interest in the case before the court? Is it supposed that she.is interested to prevent a diminution of the individual funds of <em>W. BlaJce, </em>lest he should be thereby disabled from applying the funds of <em>Elliott BlaJce\u2019s </em>estate to the discharge of her residuary legacy ? This seems to me to be a far-fetched notion, and that the interest is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>as -uncertain and contingent as can well be imagined. The court ought not to have presumed that the individual funds of <em>W. Blake </em>would have been mixed up -with the funds of <em>Elliott Blake\u2019s </em>estate, so that the diminution of the former would have affected the amount of the latter, or, at any rate, of mrs. <em>Richards\u2019s </em>share of the <em>residuum. </em>I see no ground on which mrs. <em>Richards </em>could have been excluded as a witness, and therefore her husband ought not to have been. The county court, I think, erred in this particular. The judgment of the circuit court, therefore, reversing that of the county court, is right and ought to be affirmed. That court, however, omitted to set aside the verdict and direct a new trial of the issues, which ought to have been done. This error is not complained of by the appellant, and is in no wise prejudicial to him. In affirming the judgment, I think it will be right to remand the cause to the circuit court, with directions to that court to set aside the verdict and award a new trial, to be had at its own bar, according to the former order of that court.</p>\n<author id=\"b111-10\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A-n\">I am satisfied, upon examining the statute and the authorities, that the <em>supersedeas </em>was not improvidently awarded in this case. See <em>Cowling </em>v. <em>Nansemond Justices, </em>6 Rand. 349. The case of <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Tomlin &amp;c. 2 </em>Munf. 336. is badly reported, and is no authority for the doctrine there laid down. In the present case the reversal of the judgment of the county court by the superiour court was of necessity a final judgment. It settled the only question which that court was called upon to settle. It adjudged costs to the party prevailing, and it could never have been altered or set aside by the same court at a future term. Moreover the court had only power to pronounce a final judgment, and if that judgment was a judgment of reversal, it was bound to send the cause back to the county court, there being no power in the superiour courts of law to retain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>a cause for further proceedings after reversing the jtidg<em>n . </em>, <em>r </em>ment of the county court, except by consent ot parties. The judgment, it is true, is erroneous, not only in retaining the cause, and in omitting to enter such judgmen(. ag county court should have entered, which it ought to have done upon reversing the judgment; <em>Darby </em>v. <em>Henderson &amp;c. </em>3 Munf. 115. <em>Mantz </em>v. <em>Hendley, 2 </em>Hen. &amp; Munf. 308. <em>Blane </em>v. <em>Sansum, 2 </em>Call 496. 1 Rev. Code, ch. 69. \u00a7 60. p. 240. but it is also erroneous in reversing the judgment of the county court. The testimony of <em>Richards </em>having been objected to expressly on the ground of <em>interest </em>in the estate of the decedent, who died intestate, the wife of the witness being the decedent\u2019s sister, and the objection being met by the defendant not by proof that the intestate left children, but by an offer to execute mutual releases, the superiour court ought to have inferred that he died without children; it ought to have inferred an admission of that fact from the defendant\u2019s conduct; it ought to have inferred that.the witness was interested as a distributee, sincq the defendant conceded it by the offer of a release. And as to the releases, they were clearly insufficient; for the release ought to have been from the distributee to the defendant, and <em>Ms </em>acceptance of it, and not the <em>plaintiff\u2019s, </em>was- necessary to make it valid. But it appears by the bill of exceptions that because the <em>plaintiff </em>refused to receive it, nothing further- was done, and the release never was completed by delivery and acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">I am therefore of opinion that the judgment of the superiour court should be reversed with costs, and that of the county court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Judgment of circuit court reversed, and that of the county court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
