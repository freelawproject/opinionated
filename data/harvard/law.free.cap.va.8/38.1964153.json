The declaration contained three counts, 1. For \u00a3 300. 18. 4. due for goods, wares and merchandizes, sold and delivered by the plaintiff to the defendants\u2019 testator, and for money had and received by him to the plaintiff\u2019s use. <em>2. </em>A <em>quantum valebat </em>for the same sum and articles. 3. An <em>insimul computassent, </em>between the plaintiff and the defendants, concerning divers sums of money due from the testator to the plaintiff; upon which the defendants were found in arrear \u00a3 300. 18. 4. Plea <em>non assumpsit, </em>with leave to give the special matter in evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-9\">Upon the trial of the cause, the defendants filed a bill of exceptions to the court\u2019s opinion, stating, that they \u201cproduced in evidence a deed,\u201d which bears date the 11th of June, 1771; is set forth <em>in h\u00e6c verba; </em>and purports, that the testator had conveyed his property to the plaintiff to secure payment of a debt of \u00a3 533. 6. 8. sterling, and as an indemnity against suretyships. That the defendants objected \u201c to the submission of the same to the consideration of the jury, alledging that the action was founded on a letter, dated December 9th, 1772, and a settlement made, between the plaintiff and the defendant <em>William, </em>on the 24th day of August, in the year of our Lord, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-three, in the following words, \u2018Dr. uncle : I am extremely sorry to bear of your estate being under execution for want of the money due you from my father; and must beg leave to inform that as soon as it lays in my power to collect the discounts that ought to ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>pear against your claim, that I shall immediately call on you for a settlement, and contrive ways and means to replace your principal, as well as interest. You cannot be insensible of the perplexity and confusion attending the affairs of a deceased gentleman, who was much engaged in the world; and, of course, of the uncertainty and danger of loss that would attend a precipitate settlement of his affairs, or part of them. Therefore hope you\u2019l be kind enough to give me such length of time as will enable me to do that justice to the estate which is its right. I have not, as yet, had an opportunity to know of Mr. <em>R. Chamherlayne, </em>whether he paid your order to my father, nor of enquiring of <em>Baine </em>or <em>Ross. </em>Col. <em>Burwell </em>says that the balance on his books against you is justly due, the amount I told you when up. Mr. <em>Richard Chapman </em>told my brother <em>Richard, </em>that he paid you, on account of my father, during his sherifalty, forty pounds. I shall esteem it as a particular favour if you will know of Mr. <em>Chriswood, </em>your neighbour, whether I am to look to him, or to you, for the \u00a320 my father let him have, and write me by the first opportunity what he says. I am, dear uncle, your most obedient nephew, <em>W. Johnson. </em>\u2014 New Castle, December 9th, 1772. \u2014 P. S. <em>Dukens, </em>the man you sent with the beaves, borrowed 20s. of me, on the strength of your order on my uncle <em>William Johnson, </em>for that sum. If he does not produce to you a discharge from me for it, you must charge him with it, his conduct, in returning, I don\u2019t like. <em>W. J. </em>\u2014 To Maj. <em>Thomas Johnson, </em>in Louisa.\u2019 \u2014 (The settlement referred to, is an account in the hand writing of the defendant, <em>William; </em>is dated on the 24th of August, 1773; and debits the plaintiff to the testator with \u00a3 257. 0. 8. as sundries per account; and credits him with various sums amounting to \u00a3 543. 12. 6., leaving abalance in favour of the plaintiff of \u00a3286. 11. 10., and one year\u2019s interest \u00a3 14. 6. 6., amounting together to \u00a3 300. 18. 4.) \u2014 and that the said deed ought not to be permitted to go to the jury in opposition to the said settlement : whereupon the court gave it as their opinion, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the said deed should not go in evidence to the jury: To \u2022 which opinion the defendants excepted, fee.\u201d There is nothing in the record to shew, that the plaintiff ever admitted the account to be correct, other than the commencement of tjj\u00a1s su\u00a1t. 0f tjjat there was no other evidence, than that above mentioned, in the cause. Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for <em>\u00a3 </em>467. 12. 9.; to which the defendants obtained a writ of error from this court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-7\"><em>Randolph, </em>attorney general,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOJq\">contended that the deed ought to have been received. For the whole evidence is not stated in the bill of exceptions ; and the presumption is, that it was introduced for the purpose of inducement to, or explanation of, credits claimed by the defendant, as nothing is said to the contrary. That there was other evidence, is manifest, as otherwise the plaintiff could not have supported either count in his declaration; for there was no buying and selling shewn; and much less any proof of an accounting, as the letter establishes, that all was unadjusted in 1772, and the account filed is nothing but the defendants\u2019 statement, without the slightest testimony that it was ever admitted by the plaintiff. Of course, it was not such an accounting as was necessary to bar anterior debits.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-8\">\n<em>Duval, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ac_\">The court did right in refusing to let the deed go to the jury. For the settlement shut the door to all enquiry into preceding debits, and was a tacit admission, that the parties had no further charges to make. It is in vain to endeavour to confine the motive for the introduction of it to inducement and explanation; because the bill of exceptions states, that the submission of the deed to the jury was excepted to, upon the ground, that the action was founded on the letter and settlement, without shewing that it was, in any manner, intended to sustain subsequent discounts; of which there is not the slightest proof: and therefore the appellant is reduced to the single enquiry, whether a deed, which, upon the face of it was for other and indefinite pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>poses, and of an elder date to the settlement could be offered as a discount to it? For if there was other evidence, which made it proper to use it for the purposes of inducement and explanation, the defendants ought to have inserted it in their bill of exceptions; but having failed to do so, the court must take the record as they find it; which shews no such feature, in the cause; but submits the dry question, whether the deed was proper evidence in an action upon the settlement? For a settlement it was, as the account was delivered to the plaintiff;' never objected to by him; and the action brought upon it. Both propositions are therefore clearly for the plaintiffj namely, that there was an accounting; and that the deed was not admissible against the settlement.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Of which opinion was the court; and the judgment was, accordingly, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><em>Mem. </em>\u2014 Johnson was a member of the assembly at the time the cause was tried; but he waived his privilege, and thereupon the court proceeded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
