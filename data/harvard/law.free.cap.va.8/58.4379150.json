Mann against Lock-ridge Gwinn and others. The warrant of the justice directed the justices and the jury to be summoned to meet on the 14th of November 1849. Accordingly the justices met and constituted the Court on that day, and then on the motion of the defendants, the cause was continued until the 29 ih of March 1850, to which day the Court was adjourned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-10\">The Court did not meet on the 29th of March ; but at the regular term of the County court in June the cause was tried, and there was a verdict and judgment in favour of the plaintiff. The defendant then applied to the Circuit court of Fayette county for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment, which was granted ; and on the hearing of the cause in that Court, the judgment of the County court was reversed on the ground that the failure of the special Court to meet on the 29th of March operated as a discontinuance of the <em>cause; </em>and therefore that the County court had no jurisdiction to try the case at the June term of the Court. Mann then applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>Price </em>and <em>Caperton, </em>for the appellant, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-4\"><em>Reynolds, </em>for the appellees, submitted the case.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b83-5\">Allen <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ACb\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The Court is of opinion, that as by the act of 3rd January 1834, p. 76, it is provided that whensoever the justices summoned to form a Court for the trial of any case of forcible entry, shall fail to meet, and no Court be formed on the day appointed, such failure shall not operate a discontinuance of the cause, but the same shall stand continued until the next regular Court of the county or corporation, whether monthly or quarterly; the act by a fair construction, applies as well to a failure of the Court to meet on the day to which it stood adjourned, as to a failure to meet on the day appointed in the warrant; and in either case the cause stands continued to the next County court, and no discontinuance is operated. It therefore seems to the Court here, that the judgment of the Circuit court reversing the judgment of the County court is erroneous; and the same is reversed with costs to the plaintiff in error. And this Court proceeding to render such judgment as the Circuit court should have rendered, it is considered that the judgment of the County court be affirmed, with costs in the Circuit court expended.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
