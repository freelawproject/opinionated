This being consented to upon all sides, <em>Scott </em>drew two bills of exchange, endorsed by <em>Field &amp; Call, </em>that is to say, one for \u00a3 1000 sterling, and the other for \u00a3 187. 15. sterling, upon <em>Camming &amp; Son, </em>of Edinburgh; and <em>James Field </em>drew a bill on <em>Home, </em>of Edinburgh, in favour of <em>Field &amp; Call, </em>who endorsed it to <em>Bland, </em>of London. All the bills came back protested; and <em>Field &amp; Call </em>finding themselves liable to <em>Bland, </em>as endorsers of <em>James Field\u2019s </em>bill; and, to <em>James Field, </em>as endorsers of the bills drawn by <em>Scott, </em>whose original debt consequently remained unsatisfied, obtained, from <em>Scott, </em>a deed of mortgage in order to secure them against future events. <em>Field &amp; Call </em>took up the bill for \u00a3187. 15. sterling, and <em>Call, </em>as surviving partner of <em>Field &amp; Call, </em>brought suit in the high court of chancery, to foreclose the mortgage; and praying that <em>Scott </em>might be decreed to pay to <em>James Field, </em>the amount of the bill for \u00a3 1000 sterling; and, to <em>Field &amp; Call, </em>the amount of that for \u00a3187. 15. sterling. The answer of <em>Scott\u2019s </em>representatives alledged, that the money was tendered to doctor <em>Field; </em>and that the bills were given for an usurious consideration. The court of chancery dismissed the bill upon a hearing; and the plaintiff appealed to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b443-4\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiV\">The contract was not usurious ; for it was a fair purchase of a bill of exchange; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>there is no proof of any corrupt agreement for a loan. It is not material that <em>Scott </em>had no property in Scotland, <em>Price &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>2 Call, 110: That was a stronger case than this; for, there, a deed of mortgage was taken, at the time to secure the bills; which created a presumption of a belief that they would be protested; and yet the objection did not prevail. <em>Scott </em>never pretended that the bills were usurious; but endeavoured to get rid of them by other means; which is a strong circumstance to shew, that there was nothing corrupt in the transaction. <em>Field Call were </em>clearly liable to doctor <em>Field; </em>.for, by their blank endorsement, they put it in the power of the holder to superscribe what he pleased ; and they afterwards acknowledged their responsibility. <em>Russel </em>v. <em>Langstaff, </em>Dougl. 514. But, if the transaction had been usurious, <em>Field &amp; Call </em>were not concerned in it; and therefore, the deed ought to stand as a security for the sum originally due to <em>Field Call, </em>from<em>Scott.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b444-4\">\n<em>Hay, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEs\">The whole transaction shews a deliberate intent to evade the statute of <em>usury; </em>and a contrivance between <em>Field &amp; </em>Call, and doctor <em>Field, </em>to effect it; which constitutes usury. <em>Cowp. </em>114, 115. 5 <em>Co. </em>69. The case of <em>Price Sfc. </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>proceeded on <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>being ignorant, that <em>Braxton </em>had no money in Scotland; but, here, all the parties knew that <em>Scott </em>had none. <em>Field Call </em>were not rendered liable by their endorsement of the bill, 4 <em>Term Rep. </em>470. <em>Pow. Contr. </em>341; and therefore could not have recovered against <em>Scott: </em>But, if they could, his estate ought not to be sold, before they have paid doctor <em>Field; </em>whose representatives are barred by the statute of limitations, and the tender.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b444-5\"><em>Randolph, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARF\">Usury must be proved and cannot be presumed. When the party can prevent excessive interest, the transaction is not usurious, <em>Burton\u2019s </em>case, 5 Co. 69. <em>Cowp. </em>112. <em>Fonbl. Eq. </em>126. <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Wash. 118: and, here, <em>Scott </em>might have avoided the 10 per cent., by providing a fund for payment of the bill, when it became due. The case of <em>Price &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>is much stronger than this; for there <em>Braxton </em>gave a mortgage, at the time, to secure the bills; whereas, here, the deed was not taken, until after the protest; and then it was, voluntarily given, without any complaint of usury; which amounted to a confirmation of all the prior transactions. The 4 <em>Term Rep. </em>470, instead of shewing that <em>Field &amp; Call </em>are not liable by their endorsement, proves the contrary : for two of the judges said, that a case might be so framed as to render the endorser liable. <em>Field &amp; Call, </em>by their blank endorsement, put it in the power of doctor <em>Field </em>to superscribe an obligation : and the deed admits, both, their responsibility, and that they endorsed at the request of <em>Scott; </em>which is decisive that <em>Scott </em>is liable to them. <em>Buckner </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Wash. 296. <em>Hoomes </em>v. <em>Smock, </em>1 Wash. 389. The deed should stand as a security for <em>Scott\u2019s </em>original debt to <em>Field Call; </em>and a decree may now <em>be </em>made for a sale of the property, without having doctor <em>Field\u2019s </em>representatives before the court. <em>Prec. Ch. </em>99.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-4\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b445-5\">Roane, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ0I\">By the transaction which preceded and accompanied the drawing the bills of exchange by <em>Scott </em>on the 27th October, 1773, <em>Field &amp; Call </em>assigned to doctor <em>Field </em>the debt due to them by <em>Scott. </em>As to the amount of the smaller bill, however, it does not appear that any consideration was paid therefor by doctor <em>Field. </em>It must be considered therefore as taken for the benefit of <em>Field Call, </em>and given merely to settle the whole sum due, and to round the transaction. As to the <em>&amp; </em>1000 for which the larger bill was drawn, another bill was given by doctor <em>Field </em>therefor, payable in Scotland: That bill was assigned by <em>Field &amp; Call </em>to <em>Bland\u2019s </em>trustees, I presume for a full consideration, and thus <em>so far Field &amp; Call </em>got paid the debt due to them by <em>Scott: </em>But the matter rested not there: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>That bill was protested, and <em>Field &amp; Call </em>are liable as endorsers. They have recourse however against doctor <em>Field; </em>and in that view (upon this transaction taken singly) may, in the event of doctor <em>Field\u2019s </em>solvency, be considered as indemnified, and substantially holding the payment they have received, on the assignment of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">But this transaction must not be taken singly; it must be taken in connexion with another, viz. The drawing and enr dorsing <em>Scott\u2019s </em>bills. If <em>Field &amp; Call </em>shall be obliged to pay them (or at least the large one) and be unable to get reimbursement from <em>Scott\u2019s </em>representatives, it is evident they would, in that event, be wholly unpaid, and lose the advantage they had gained by their transfer of doctor <em>Field\u2019s </em>bill to <em>Bland\u2019s </em>trustees. They are apprehensive of danger from this source, and bring their bill on the principle of <em>quia timet&gt; </em>founded on the circumstances of the original transaction, and on the mortgage executed by <em>Scott. </em>They bring their bill as sureties apprehending danger from the insolvency of the <em>principal; </em>and on the just ground for the interposition of equity,' that a man has a right to put an end to an impending danger or incumbrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\"><em>Field &amp; Call </em>then, standing merely in the character of sureties (at least as to the large bill) any vice in the original transaction, or any discharge of the principal or interest of the debt would equally enure to their benefit: Any defence to be made by the drawer might equally be made by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">The complainants thus standing on a common ground with the defendants in relation to the validity, or discharge of the bill, and being wholly incompetent to represent the holder in respect thereof; however it might be prior to the coming in of the objections to the bill on the part of the defendants, should, when those objections did appear, by making the representatives of doctor <em>Field </em>parties, have put the matter in train for a fair and final adjustment between all parties. Equity delights in doing ultimate and complete justice at once, and preventing a circuity and multiplicity of actions. But whatever might be the decree in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>this suit and between the now parties, it is clear that it would not affect <em>James Field. </em>He might, in a subsequent action against <em>Scott\u2019s </em>representatives, be defeated on the ground of an original vice in, or a subsequent discharge of, the bill in question, while in the mean time the complainants might have sold <em>Scott\u2019s </em>property, to quiet an apprehension thus turning out to be groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">On these grounds, I think the case was not ripe for a decision. The complainants ought to have made doctor <em>Field\u2019s </em>representatives parties, so that their real liability being ascertained, and the court having all the parties to the transaction before them, might be enabled to render complete and final justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">I think therefore that the chancellor erred in deciding the case in that stage of it. He ought to have given the complainants leave to make the additional parties, on failure of which, within a reasonable time, his bill ought to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">This view renders it premature, and perhaps improper to say any thing on the merits of the cause. But as the question of usury has been much laboured, and it may tend to prevent future litigation on this score, I am free to say, that under my present impressions, and upon the now testimony, I do not think that usury can be fairly inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Fleming, Judge. Although usury has not been proved, and it is perfectly clear that <em>Field &amp; Call </em>were bound by their endorsement, I am of opinion, that the plaintiff is not entitled to an immediate decree against the present defendants, as he has not made necessary parties to the bill. For a court of equity delights in doing complete justice; and therefore requires, that all persons having an interest in the controversy should be made parties to the suit, in order that the proper decree may be made between them, and an end put to litigation. Consequently, I am for reversing the decree, and sending the cause back again to the court of chancery, that the proper parties may be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Carrington, Judge. <em>Thomas Scott, </em>on the 27th of October, 1773, being indebted to <em>Field &amp; Call </em>in <em>\u00a3 </em>1187. 15. sterling; and being desirous of borrowing money to satisfy the demand, applied to <em>James Field, </em>(who supposed he had money in Scotland,) requesting a loan, to the amount of his debt to <em>Field &amp; Call. </em>To which <em>James Field </em>assented, provided <em>Scott </em>would give him a bill of exchange for the sum to be lent, upon some house in Great Britain, and procure an endorser as security, in case the bill should be protested. <em>Scott </em>being satisfied with the terms, applied to <em>Field &amp; Call, </em>(who wanted money in England,) to become endorsers: which they agreed to do, if <em>James Field </em>would give them a bill upon Great Britain, for <em>\u00a3 </em>1000 sterling, and be answerable to them for the balance of <em>Scott\u2019s </em>debt. This being consented to on all sides, <em>Scott </em>drew, in favour of <em>James Field, </em>two bills, endorsed by <em>Field. &amp; Call, </em>that is to say, one for \u00a31000 sterling, and the other, for \u00a3 187. 15. sterling, upon <em>Camming &amp; Son </em>of Edinburgh: and <em>James Field </em>drew a bill on <em>Home </em>of Edinburgh, in favour of <em>Field &amp; Call, </em>who endorsed it to <em>Bland </em>of London. All the bills came back protested: and <em>Field &amp; Call </em>finding themselves liable to <em>Bland, </em>as endorsers of <em>James Field\u2019s </em>bill; and to <em>James Field, </em>as endorsers of the bills drawn by <em>Scott, </em>whose <em>original debt, </em>consequently, remained unsatisfied, obtained from <em>Scott </em>the deed of mortgage in the bill mentioned, in order to secure them against future events. <em>Field &amp; Call </em>took up the bill for \u00a3 187. 15. sterling, and <em>Call, </em>as surviving partner of the firm, brought this suit to foreclose the mortgage, praying that <em>Scott </em>might be decreed to pay to <em>James Field, </em>the amount of the bill for \u00a3 1000 sterling. The court of chancery, being of opinion that the bills drawn by <em>Scott </em>were founded in usury, dismissed the suit, upon a hearing, with costs: and the plaintiff has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">The first question is as to the usury. I discover nothing of that character in the transactions: which were fair and open, and agreeable to the constant usage with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>bills of exchange. Any man is at liberty to draw a bill; but he does it at his own peril; for he knows whether it will be paid, or not, and the payee has nothing to do with that enquiry. Therefore, if a corrupt agreement be not proved, nothing will be imputed to the payee, <em>Price, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>2 Call, 110; and there is no such proof in the present case; which, in effect, is no more than this; <em>Scott </em>wanted money to pay <em>Field &amp; </em>Call; and <em>James Field </em>agreed to lend it by a bill on Scotland, provided <em>Scott </em>would replace it there, by another bill. All this was perfectly fair; and if <em>Scott </em>had either had money in Scotland to meet his bills, or had taken care to provide it, they would have been paid, and he discharged of his original debt, without any additional bur-then. But how can that transaction be called usurious, which permits the debtor to relieve himself from the excess by payment of the principal and legal interest? On the contrary, the law is settled, that, whenever he has such power of relief, there is no usury. <em>Burton's </em>case, 5 Co. 69. <em>Cro. Jac. </em>509, <em>per Doderige, </em>J. It was said that the case was like that of <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Fristoe, </em>1 Call, 62: but it has no resemblance to it; for that was the case of a fixed <em>premium </em>for forbearance; but here it was contingent, whether <em>Scott </em>would have to pay the 10 per cent, or not, as it was in his power to exempt himself from it, by procuring his bills to be honoured. I am therefore clearly of opinion that the transactions in the present case, were not usurious; that <em>Field &amp; Call </em>are liable as endorsers of <em>Scott's </em>bills; and that <em>Scott </em>is bound to indemnify them.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">The next enquiry is as to the relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">It is clear that the primary object of all the transactions was payment to <em>Field &amp; Call </em>of a just debt due to them from <em>Scott; </em>and that the same has never been paid, either by him, or by any other person. <em>Scott, </em>indeed, during the month of December 1781, caused \u00a34000 paper money to be tendered to <em>James Field, </em>who refused to receive it: in consequence of which, the money was carried back to <em>Scott, </em>without being deposited any where for safe keeping, so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>it could not be used, but might always be forthcoming. The tender, then, had no effect even at law, <em>Downman </em>v. <em>Downman\u2019s executor, </em>1 Wash. 28; and much less in equity. I think, therefore, that the representatives of <em>Scott </em>should be decreed to pay <em>Field &amp; Call, </em>the amount of <em>Scott\u2019s </em>two bills within a reasonable period ; and, if they fail to do so, that the mortgaged subject should be sold to satisfy them, upon the appellant\u2019s entering into bond with security in the court of chancery, to indemnify <em>Scott\u2019s </em>representatives against the bill of <em>\u00a3 </em>1000 sterling, drawn by <em>Scott </em>in favour of <em>James Field, </em>and endorsed by <em>Field &amp; Call; </em>who will have <em>James Field\u2019s </em>bill, which they endorsed to <em>Bland, </em>as an offset against it; and thus substantial justice will be done all round.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">This view of the subject renders it unnecessary to bring the representatives of <em>James Field </em>into the present case, as complete justice can be attained without It, and. delay, with an increase of interest and costs, prevented. But a majority of the court think, that those persons ought to have been made parties, and that the following decree should be made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-11\">\u201c The court is of opinion that the said decree is erroneous in this, that the said high court of chancery, instead of pronouncing that decree, ought to have given leave to the appellant to amend his bill, by making the representatives of James <em>Field </em>parties; which, if not done within a reasonable time, the bill ought to stand dismissed; therefore, it is decreed and ordered, that the decree aforesaid be reversed and annulled, and that the appellees pay to the appellant his costs by him expended in the prosecution of his appeal aforesaid here.\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
