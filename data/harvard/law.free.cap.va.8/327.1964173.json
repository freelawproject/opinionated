That, sometime after the probate, the slaves and personal estate were divided, whereby <em>Philip's </em>share became vested in possession in his own right, and not as executor : notwithstanding which, he paid more than his proportion of the debts. That the defendant <em>Chapman, </em>brought suit and obtained judgment in 1787, against <em>Robert Alexander, </em>the surviving executor; which was afterwards revived, and the execution levied upon one of the slaves who had fallen to <em>Philip, </em>in the division ; which a jury, summoned by the sheriff to ascertain the right, had improperly decided to belong to <em>Gerrard Alexander's </em>estate, although <em>Robert, </em>the surviving executor, had property enough in his hands to satisfy the demand, and the slave taken by the sheriff was not liable for it. That the debt had been paid. The bill prayed an injunction, and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-7\">The answer admits the division of the estate; but denies that <em>Philip's </em>share was vested in possession after the division, and insists that it was liable to the execution. That the defendant knew of no other property belonging to the testator; but knows that the slave taken belonged to him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Denies that the debt has been paid ; and avers, that <em>Robert Alexander, </em>the surviving executor, had frequently told him that it had not been paid, and promised payment; which declaration he repeated on his death bed, alledging that the debt must be paid. Does not admit that <em>Philip </em>paid debts to other people, as mentioned in the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-10\">The bill was amended, and charged that the slave taken upon the execution, did not belong to <em>Gerrard, Alexander, </em>but was otherwise acquired: which the answer to the amended bill denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-11\">A great number of depositions were taken ; and the plaintiff attempted to prove payment of the debt, and that the slave did not belong to <em>Gerrard Alexander: </em>But his whole testimony, as to the payment, consisted of the declarations of <em>Robert Alexander, </em>the executor, that he had paid it, in the lifetime of the preceding administratrix, to <em>Hunter, </em>who did not appear to have been authorized to receive it. One witness, (whose testimony was loose, and whose character was a good deal assailed,) said that the defendant told him that he believed it had been so paid to <em>Hunter, </em>but that he had no authority to receive. That the slave belonged to <em>Gerrard Alexander's </em>estate at the time of the division, was not only not disproved, but the weight of the evidence went to establish it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-12\"><em>Gerrard Alexander's </em>will was proved in 1762. Both judgments were, upon verdicts, against <em>Robert Alexander </em>as surviving executor. The first was obtained by the administratrix of the obligee in 1787; and the second by the defendant, in 1792, in a <em>scire facias </em>upon the first. The execution, under which the slave was taken, issued on the 12th of September, 1792.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-13\">The high court of chancery first dissolved the injunction upon the first answer, in consequence of which the slave was sold under the execution; but, after the depositions were taken, the following decree was made : \u201c In this cause, which came on to be heard on the bills, answers, exhibits and examinations of witnesses, the court, having considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>allegations by parties, and arguments by counsel, doth adjudge, order and decree, that the defendant do pay unto the plaintiff the present value of the slave <em>Dick, </em>in the bills and answers named, if be be living, and of his hire since he was sold by virtue of the writ of execution therein mentioned; and for ascertaining such value, doth direct a jury to be impaneled, and charged to try an issue to be made up between the parties, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-4\"><em>Chapman </em>appealed to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-5\"><em>Randolph </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axc\">There is nothing to shew that the debt has been discharged. For the witnesses merely relate what they heard <em>Robert Alexander, </em>the executor, say, or what others heard him say. One of them indeed says, that the defendant told him that he believed the debt had been paid, in the lifetime of the former administratrix, to <em>Hunter; </em>but that he had no authority to receive it: which, if true, amounts to nothing : but the witness is discredited. Consequently, I assume it as a fact that the debt has not been paid. There is not the slightest foundation for the suggestion, that <em>Philip Alexander </em>derived the slave from any other source than his father\u2019s estate : On the contrary, the original bill admitted, both answers confirmed it, and the depositions prove that he belonged to that estate. The only important question therefore is, Whether, as there had been a division of the testator\u2019s slaves, this one could be taken in the hands of the administrator of <em>Philip Alexander, </em>to whom he was allotted at the partition? The division could not make any difference; for it can never be true, that the.executor has it in his power, by accelerating the division, to vary the rights of the creditors, and oblige them to encounter the delay of a chancery suit. The property, in the hands of the executor, is still assets, until the debts are all paid. The case differs from that of <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Burnley, </em>1 Wash. 308, in which it was decided, that the creditor should not proceed against one of the legatees only, but that all should contribute; for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>the executor\u2019s representative having the property in his hands, the creditor was not bound to look any further; and therefore was under no necessity of seeking redress against the legatees; for it was the business of the representative of the executor, and not of the creditor, to compel contribution. But the decree is erroneous under another point of view; for the plaintiff could not be entitled to the whole value of the slave; but was bound to deduct <em>Philip Alexander\u2019s </em>own proportion of the debt.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b370-10\">\n<em>Warden, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afj\">Although there is no positive proof of the fact, there is some reason to believe that the debt was paid to <em>Hunter, </em>and that he had authority to receive it. But be that as it may, the slave could not be taken under the execution, as there had been an actual division of the estate, and he had been allotted to <em>Philip Alexander; </em>which was clearly an assent of the other executor, and vested <em>Philip </em>with the possession in his own right, and not as executor. Of course <em>Burnley </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>1 Wash. 308, is a complete authority to shew that the legal property could not be divested, afterwards, at law, even had he been still living. But, as <em>Philip </em>was dead at the time of the judgments, and the plaintiff no party to either of them, the conduct of the defendant was doubly reprehensible; for as the slave had lawfully come to the plaintiff\u2019s hands as legal assets, his possession ought not to have been disturbed, without affording him an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b370-11\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b370-12\">Lyons, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AYWJ\">Delivered the resolution of the court, that the decree of the high court of chancery was to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
