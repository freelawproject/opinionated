That she died in 1773; and, by her will, after some specific bequests, devised several slaves to the said <em>John Cooper </em>her husband for life, with power, at his death, to divide them among the children of <em>Thomas </em>and <em>John Cowles </em>in such manner and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>proportion as he might think proper.

For there is a confidence, in such cases, that the property will be distributed with some regard to equality; and, consequently, any other distribution is an abuse. If, indeed, the person exercising the power stands in the relation of parent to the objects, and finds that, either from his own bounty, or from other sources, some of them are better provided for than others, he rnay make such inequalities as may tend to bring them <em>to </em>a level. <em>But </em>that is the only instance in which any very considerable preference is permitted. And the objection is greater, if the fiduciary receives any benefit from the transaction $ for that is entirely adverse to the intention of the author of the power. These observations apply with irresistible force to the exchange of the four slaves for the land, as it is proved that the slaves were worth <em>\u00a3225, </em>and the land <em>\u00a3 </em>63 only j so that there was a difference of <em>\u00a3 162, </em>which went to the benefit of <em>Cooper, </em>or of <em>Brown, </em>(who had married his niece,) and not to <em>Thomas Cowles, </em>who appears, by his answer and letter to <em>Brown, </em>to have been forced into the bargain, and probably yielded, at last, through fear that <em>Cooper </em>would not make the appointment upon any other terms. The sale of the negroe woman and her child, stands upon no better footing | for no other account of the value and disposition of them is given, than what <em>Brown </em>says in his answer, namely, that <em>Cooper </em>sold them with some of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>own, and directed him to pay <em>Cowles </em>the moiety of a bond for <em>\u00a3 </em>80; which is very unsatisfactory; and the deed to <em>Cowles, </em>after the sale, shews that a shift was thought necessary to bolster qp the transaction. The pretended ap\u00bf pointment to <em>Wallcer </em>is equally exceptionable; because the deed says it was for \u00a3240, as well as in pursuance of the power; and one of the witnesses proves that the four slaves received by <em>Cooper, </em>were equal in value to the eight: so that, instead of an appointment to Mrs. <em>Walker, it </em>was in fact a sale of the eight, as <em>Cooper </em>kept the four as his own property, and <em>Walker </em>insisted on a warranty, which was given. The alledged appointments therefore, instead of being individual and distinct, are confounded with other transactions, which leaves the whole enveloped with darkness, and puts it out of the power of the court to decide upon the motives : a circumstance sufficient, of itself, to destroy them. If it be said that <em>Cooper </em>afterwards confirmed them by his will, the answer is, that the will was bottomed on the same motives with the deeds, and is affected in the same manner. The appointments, therefore, being void, they ought to be set aside, and the property divided according to the case of <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>2 Call, 520.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-9\">\n<em>Wickham, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahl\"><em>Cooper </em>had a life estate in the slaves, and that might have regulated the money part of the transactions ; which removes the objection of profit to himself. The mixture of the appointments with other matters, does not vitiate them, as no bad motive for it appears. <em>Cooper </em>had full discretion, and was at liberty to exercise the power as he pleased, even upon motives of affection. No inequality appears; for the number and value of the slaves are not shewn; but were it otherwise, the reasons assigned by <em>Cooper </em>in his will, for the preference, (although he was not bound to assign any,) were sufficient to justify it. If the exchange of the four slaves for the land was unfair, and gave an advantage to <em>Brown, </em>that would be for the benefit of <em>Thomas Cowles, </em>(who may set it aside,) and not of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>other legatees. But no compulsion is proved, and the probability is, that his dissatisfaction arose afterwards ; for there is nothing to shew that <em>Cooper </em>would have altered his will, if he had not consented. The woman and child were probably sold for the bad behaviour of the woman ; and <em>Cooper </em>took the burthen of accounting for the value; which he professed himself willing to do to <em>Thomas Cowles, </em>to whom he had given her. Of course, there is nothing improper in that transaction; and the appellants ought not to be allowed to object the want of information now, as they did not except to the answer, and demand it in the court below. <em>Walker </em>has no counsel; and therefore, as to that part of the case, the decree may be left open.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-9\"><em>Call, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq7P\">The appointments ought not to have been mixt with any other affairs. For the commixture puts it in the power of the fiduciary so to disguise the transaction, that the guilt, or innocence, of it, can never be made to appear: and therefore, the only safe rule is, by proscribing it altogether, to shut up the avenues to fraud. There was gross inequality; for ten slaves were given to <em>Thomas Cowles; </em>who was made one of the residuary legatees also, without any proper motive, for the preference, assigned: for his good or bad behaviour to <em>Cooper </em>ought not to have entered into the consideration. It is not correct to say, that if the appointments to <em>Cowles </em>and <em>Walker </em>were fraudulent, the appointees only can take advantage of it: for the fraud vitiates the transactions, and the deeds convey no right, as <em>Cooper </em>had not an arbitrary discretion; but was bound to observe something like equality; and, as the number and value of the slaves, were known to the appellees, and not to the plaintiffs, the former ought to have produced the proof necessary to justify the conduct of the trustee. There is no evidence that the woman and child were sold on account of the bad qualities of the woman: and the presumption is, that it was to suit the purposes of <em>Cooper </em>himself.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b524-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Roane, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A45v\">said that, upon a view of the whole case, he was for affirming the decree; but that he did not mean to decide any thing as to the right of persons having power to appoint, to give unequal portions, in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Fleming, Judge, said that, he thought a general power was given ; especially as the testatrix did not use the words \u201c <em>equally to be divided; </em>and that upon the whole, he was of opinion, that the decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Carrington, Judge, said that, as <em>Cooper </em>had a general power to give the slaves among the-children, and had given some to each, the decree ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Lyons, Judge. Power is given to the husband to distribute the slaves among the nephews and nieces of the testatrix \u201cin such manner and proportion as he shall think properand there is nothing in the will to shew that an equal division was intended. Of course it was left to him to make the appointments according to his own discretion ; and then, what right has the court to control the execution ? The latitude which has been sometimes taken by chancellors in England, has been reprobated, and a different course is beginning to manifest itself there, 2 <em>Fonbl. Eq. </em>201; which meets with my own approbation. Consequently, as the power was general in the present case, and the husband has given part of the slaves to each of the legatees, without any proof of fraud, I concur, with the rest of the judges, that the decree ought to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
