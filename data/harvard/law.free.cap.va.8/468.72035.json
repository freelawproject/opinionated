Taylor </em>sued out of the circuit court of <em>Harrison </em>a writ of <em>prcecipe quod reddat </em>against <em>John Rightmire, </em>in the form prescribed by the statute. On the return of the writ, the demandant filed his count, and the tenant having been summoned and not appearing, the court made an order, according to the statute, that unless he appeared at the next court, judgment should be entered against him. Nevertheless the cause was continued at the two following terms; and at May term 1835, the death of the demandant was suggested on the record. Subsequently, to wit, at October term 1835, <em>Holden Rhodes </em>and <em>Archer L. Wooldridge, </em>devisees of the demandant, moved the</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>court to award a <em>scire facias </em>against the tenant; and the tenant appearing by his attorney, and waiving the necessity of issuing the <em>scire facias </em>as prayed for, the parties agreed that the right of the devisees to revive the cause might be then decided. The devisees produced the will of the demandant, duly executed and admitted to probat, devising to them the land in controversy; and the motion was thereupon argued. The circuit court held that the cause could not be revived in the name of the devisees; and to that judgment a <em>supersedeas </em>was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b489-3\">P. <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Johnson </em>for the plaintiffs in error, and <em>W.

It was brought by <em>Taylor </em>against the tenant. In the progress of it <em>Taylor </em>died, and <em>Rhodes </em>and <em>Wooldridge </em>applied to the court to be permitted, in the character of devisees, to revive the action. The other side waived the necessity of the <em>scire facias, </em>provided the court should be of opinion that the applicants could, as devisees, maintain the suit. They produced the will, duly proved, and shewed that the land in controversy was devised to them. The court below decided that the suit could not be revived in their names; in other words, that a devisee cannot maintain a writ of right, on the seisin of his devisor; and this is the question which we have to decide. It is new in our court, and interesting and important in itself. I will state very briefly the conclusions I have come to.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">It is clear law in <em>England, </em>that a right of entry or of action is not devisable; they being comprehended neither by the words of the statute 32 Hen. 8, ch. 1, nor of 34 and 35 Hen. 8, ch. 5, \u00a7 4. The words of the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>are, <em>\u201c </em>any person <em>having </em>manors, lands, tenements or hereditaments, may\u201d &amp;c. The words of the last are, <em>\u201c </em>any person <em>having </em>a sole estate or interest, in fee simple, of and in any manors, lands, tenements, rents or other hereditaments, in possession, reversion or remainder, may\u201d &amp;c. It is decided in <em>Goodright </em>v. <em>Forrester, </em>8 East 552. that these words do not comprehend land of which the devisor is disseised at the date of his will, though he may still have a right of entry. Lord <em>Eldon </em>also, in <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Vigor et al. </em>8 Ves. 282. says, \u201c in order that an estate should pass by will, the devisor must have the estate when he devises, and he must continue to have the same estate at the time of his death. If he was disseised before the execution of his will, it would not pass the land; for he is not seized at the date of his will, having only a right of entry.\u201d Many other cases shew <em>this; and </em>shew, too, that a devisee cannot maintain a writ of right upon the seisin of his devisor. It must be on his own seisin, if he be a purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The words of our statute of wills are much larger than those quoted above. \u201c Every person &amp;c. shall have power &amp;c. to devise all the <em>estate, right, title </em>and <em>interest, </em>in possession, reversion or remainder, which he hath &amp;c. of, in or to lands, tenements or hereditaments, or annuities or rents charged upon or issuing out of them,\u201d &amp;c. The words <em>estate, right, title or interest in lands, </em>must surely embrace the case of a right of entry or of action. A man has a perfect title; he is disseised : for 20 years he has a right of entry into this land, and may bring ejectment. After that time he has lost his right of entry, but still he can bring a writ of right and recover the fee. Surely this is both a title (though an imperfect one) and an interest; and he may devise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">But of what service will this devise be, if we say that the devisee shall not be received to vindicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>his right by action ? He may, to be sure, bring ejecta . 11 ment, if 20 years since the disseisin have not elapsed ; hut if they have, and we refuse him a writ of right, his <em>J </em>\u2022 <em>\u25a0 </em>right is gone, \u2014 utterly extinguished : lor the devise has taken it from the heir, who could have counted on the seisin of his ancestor. By this course we refuse a remedy to him to whom our law has given a right, and we perfect the title of the wrongdoer. 1 feel exceedingly reluctant to be an agent in producing such results. Tt is a general maxim, that whore there is a right, there must be a remedy. Our law says, such an interest as this may be devised. The testator here \u00f1as devised it. Would it not bo a reproach to the law, to say that it furnished no remedy? Is it not the duty of its ministers to be astute in finding a remedy? Is it not a case to which lord <em>Coke's </em>maxim applies, <em>est boni judi\u00e9is ampliare jurisdictionem? </em>Rights are the ends of justice,\u2014 remedies the means; and we must not, in our caution, sacrifice the end to the means. If the english statutes had enabled the testator to devise such an interest, \u2014 if their courts had once come to the conclusion that such was the legislative will, \u2014 I feel little doubt that they would, have said, without hesitation, that a devisee might count on the seisin of his devisor: and. this is made the more clear by the case which the industry of my brother <em>Tucker </em>has found. There, the court said that a right to bring a writ of entry (a real action) was transferred to the assignees of a bankrupt, by the usual words of a deed of assignment; an action in which, equally with a writ of right, it is necessary to count on the actual seisin either of the demandant or his ancestor, as is seen by the count set out in that case. And when it was objected, in a very learned argument by serjeant <em>Williams, </em>that a right of action to recover real property was not, upon the settled doctrines of the common law, such an interest as could pass to the assignees, what was the answer of the court ? They put the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>wholly upon the spirit of the bankrupt laws. Lord <em>J </em>. <em>1 . L </em>chief justice <em>Eyre </em>said, <em>\u201c </em>This case has been very elaborately and ably argued by my brother <em>Williams; </em>but his argument goes against the most express and plain Sp[rjt 0f bankrupt laws, which is, that every beneficial interest which a bankrupt has shall be disposed of for the benefit of his creditors.\u201d So I say, it is the spirit of our statute of wills, that a man may devise every beneficial interest which he has in lands; and as the court <em>there, </em>to attain the object of the statutes, put .aside the common law rule, so in our case, to obtain the object of our law, I am willing to say that a devisee may count on the seisin of his devisor. I am of opinion to reverse the judgment and remand the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Cabell, J. concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b492-7\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aftv\">This case presents the question whether a writ of right can be maintained by a devisee, unless upon his own seisin. The demandant in this case having died pending the suit, his devisees came into court, and moved for a <em>scire facias </em>in their names, to revive the, action against the tenant. The tenant waived the necessity of a <em>scire facias, </em>and by consent the court was called upon to decide whether the devisees were entitled to revive by <em>scire facias. </em>The court-decided that they were not; to which judgment the devisees obtained a <em>supersedeas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Whether the devisees were entitled to a <em>scire facias, </em>depends upon the question whether a devisee can maintain a writ of right upon the seisin of the devisor; for the <em>scire facias </em>is given by law in all real or mixed actions when the same are maihtainable by or against the heir of the deceased party; so that the question essentially is, whether these devisees can maintain a writ of right on the seisin of the devisor, since <em>this </em>action was brought upon that seisin.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>This question would not, in <em>England, </em>be considered as debatable. It is there the established and uncontroverted doctrine, that a devisee cannot maintain a writ of right, unless upon his own seisin. He must actually enter, where his entry is congeable, and then, if disseised, he <em>can </em>bring <em>the </em>writ <em>upon his own seisin, for </em>he is then in the same situation as other persons who have been in the seisin. But until he enters, he can only sue in ejectment; and if the right of entry is taken away, his remedy is gone forever. These doctrines are sustained by many authorities. Co. Litt. 111. a. 293. a. 2 Sch. &amp; Lcf. 104, 623, 2 Preston on Abst. 300, [301,] 352, [354,] Blanshard on Lim. 23, [43,] 3 Tho. Co. Litt. 224, 230, 7 Wendell 250, 2 Wms. Saund. 45. From those authorities it appears that the demandant in a writ of right must shew an actual (with us a constructive) seisin in himself or his ancestor; that a purchaser cannot maintain the action unless upon his own seisin, and that the seisin of the person from whom he claims will not avail, since seisin in the ancestor means seisin in a person from whom there is a descent; that the devisee is a purchaser; that it is, to say the least, questionable whether a right of entry is devisable, and that even if it be so, it confers only the right to enter without action, or to recover by the common remedy of ejectment. <em>Preston </em>(of whose profound knowledge of the law of real property the fullest evidence is afforded even by a single argument of his in <em>Goodright </em>v. <em>Forrester, </em>1 Taunt. 578.) says in his book upon abstracts of title, \u201c In short, a devisee cannot maintain a real action grounded on the seisin of a testator. In the first place a right of entry or action is not devisable ;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>condly, a devisee does not represent a testator in the <em>. </em>. same manner as an heir represents an ancestor, so as to enjoy the privity of all actions,\u201d &amp;c. In this pas<em>s</em>age we see two lataL objections to the devisee s power to maintain the writ of right. The first of them, \u2014 whether a right of entry is devisable by the english law,\u2014 was learnedly discussed in <em>Goodright </em>v. <em>Forrester, 8 </em>East 552. where the decision was explicit against it. The judgment was afterward^ affirmed in the exchequer chamber, 1 Taunt. 578. though it appears from the opinion of <em>Mansfield, </em>C. J. that the court of exchequer decided the cause upon a point which had not been touched in the king\u2019s bench. They expressly declare, however, that the judgment of that court is not in any respect impeached by their decision, and accordingly it seems to have been considered the received law, that a right of entry is not, in <em>England, </em>devisable. This indeed would seem to have been a necessary inference from the language of the statute of wills, and the construction which was always given to it, that without seisin no man can devise. See 3 Co. Rep. 30. 1 Roberts 223, 2 Black. Com. 378, 379. Cowper\u2019s Rep. 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">We come next to enquire how the law on this subject is with us. By the statute of wills, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 104, \u00a7 1, p. 375. it is provided that every person aged &amp;c. may by last will \u201c devise all the <em>estate, right, title </em>'and <em>interest, </em>in possession, reversion or remainder, which he hath,\u201d &amp;c. This language, as we all know, is altogether variant from the english statutes authorizing the devise of lands; and as our legislatures have usually had an eye to the phraseology of existing british statutes, we may conclude that where there is a marked and material difference in phraseology, a difference in 'enactment was designed. Here there is such marked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>difference. The british statutes provided that any person <em>having </em>lands, tenements or hereditaments, or <em>having </em>a sole estate or interest in fee simple in any lands, may &amp;c. which words have been always construed to mean (in reference to the legaL title) <em>being seized of a fee simple,; </em>fori according to the learning in reference to real property, a disseisee <em>had </em>no estate, but only a <em>right, </em>and be was not therefore a person <em>having </em>lands in fee. But our statute provides that any person may devise ail the estate which he hath, \u2014 all <em>the right </em>which he hath, \u2014 all the <em>title </em>which he hath, \u2014 and all the <em>interest </em>which he hath. Now a disseisee, though he hath technically no estate in the lands, yet hath a right of possession, if the disseisin is within 20 years, and a right of property, if the disseisin was more than 20 years before the date of his will. Moreover, though be has not complete title to the laud, since seisin is essential to it (2 Black. Com. 3 99.) yet he has, before his right of entry is barred, two of the ingredients of a complete title, to wit, a right of possession and a right of property; and even after the right of entry is barred, the right of properly remains to him. He has then an incomplete <em>title; </em>and as the statute authorizes him to devise <em>all his title, </em>it follows that he may devise this incomplete title.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">What is the effect of these provisions upon the law of remedies ? First, it is plain that although an ejectment can in <em>England </em>be maintained by a devisee, only in those cases where, the devisor having been seized, the freehold is cast upon the devisee, yet in <em>Virginia </em>a devisee of a right of entry may maintain ejectment. This is abundantly clear, without more saying. See <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Cole and wife &amp;c. 2 </em>Leigh 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">But secondly, I think it must be allowed upon reflection, that the necessary consequence of the extended power of devise which is conferred by the act of assembly, is the power of the devisee to maintain a writ of right upon the seisin of the devisor, or even of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>ancestors of the devisor. This position involves two enquiries. First, is the principle of the law which requires that the demandant must shew an actual or con- ^ \u2022 structive seisin in himself <em>or his </em>ancestor, and which den\u00a1eg t0 a purchaser the power to avail himself of the seisin of his vendor, so unbending that it cannot give way or be moulded by circumstances ? 2. If it may be moulded or varied by the courts so as to subserve \u2022 the purposes of justice, does this case require it so to be modified ?</p>\n<p id=\"Ahv\">As to the first of these points I should have little doubt, if we were even without authority. The remedies of the law are perpetually moulded and varied and modified, to suit the necessities of justice, and to meet the requisitions of new legislative enactments. It will be unnecessary to consume our time in the various instances of this, which reflection might abundantly gather from the great body of the law; for happily an instance is afforded us among the adjudications of the british courts themselves, on the very subject of the rule we are considering. It is a part of that rule, that <em>\u201c </em>a purchaser cannot maintain the action unless upon his own seisin, and that the seisin of the person from whom he purchased is of no avail.\u201d 2 Wms. Saund. 45. f. Now, by the bankrupt laws, all the estate, right, title and interest of the bankrupt passes to the commissioners of bankruptcy, who convey the same to the assignees. How then is it, if the bankrupt be a disseisee, with good right of property in lands and tenements, but without either possession or right of possession? Thus situated, the estate can only be recovered from the disseisor by real action. Can the assignees maintain this real action ? In the case of <em>Smith and others </em>v. <em>Coffin and </em>wife, 2 H. Black. 444. it appears that <em>Thomas Eustace, </em>the original owner, died seized, leaving <em>Thomas </em>(the bankrupt) heir at law. <em>Hannah Eustace </em>\u201c unjustly abated into the land,\u201d and devised to <em>Edmund Cofin </em>and <em>Sarah </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>his wife, who held possession for twenty-two years (in-eluding <em>Hannah's </em>possession in her life) and thus the right of entry or suing eiectment was barred, and the . J , . &amp; , . . . \u2019 assignees were driven to their writ oi entry, lhequeslion was debated, whether the assignees could maintain a real action for the lands; and it was decided that they might. Now in this case it will be seen from the count, that in this writ of entry <em>sur abatement, </em>the assignees counted upon the seisin of <em>Thomas Eustace </em>the father of the bankrupt, and on the descent to the son. So that here is a case of a real action in which the demandants, <em>who are </em>purchasers, count upon the seisin of the person under whom they claim, and upon the seisin of his ancestor. And yet this was allow\u2019ed; and most properly; for as the statutes had vested <em>all </em>the bankrupt\u2019s <em>rights </em>in the assignees for the benefit of his creditors, it must have designed to transfer all his remedies. To transfer a right, and to design to withhold the remedy, is a solecism not to be imputed to parliament by the courts. On the contrary, as the remedy is but the satellite of the right, wherever the right is permitted to be transferred, the true construction of the law is that the remedy is to go with it; shaped indeed according to the exigencies of the new situation in which the parties arc placed, but made effectual to the purposes of justice. Were it otherwise, the authority to transfer would only operate to annihilate. Thus if the transfer to the assignees of the right of <em>property </em>in this case was not accompanied by a right to sue, the transfer itself would destroy the right of property, by passing it out of one who could assert it, into assignees who could not assert it. So too under our insolvent laws; <em>all </em>the insolvent\u2019s right, title and interest in real estate is <em>vested by </em>the law in the sheriff, or is directed to be conveyed to him before the prisoner is discharged. Among these is the mere right of <em>property, </em>which can only be asserted by writ of right. Now if, according to the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>above mentioned, the sheriff, who is a purchaser, cannot bring a writ of right, and count upon the seisin of the insolvent, or of the insolvent\u2019s ancestor, the right of property is in effect gone and destroyed; for it has pasge(j out 0f tjje insolvent and cannot be asserted, by him. So that the effect of the statute would be to strip the insolvent without benefiting the creditors; it would be to annihilate the right, while it authorized its alienation. So too in the case of a devise. The act of assembly authorizes the devise of a mere right of property. If such mere right be devised, the heir can never assert it, for it is gone from him. And the devisee must assert it in the writ of right, or not at all. If he cannot assert it in that writ, then the right is gone forever ; the title of the wrongdoer is rendered indefeasible, and the effect of the statute is only to <em>annihilate </em>that which it authorized to be transferred. To such conclusions I cannot come, and am clearly of opinion that we must recognize the right of the devisee to maintain the writ of right upon the <em>seisin of the testator or his </em>ancestor.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">It remains but to observe that judge <em>Green, </em>in <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Cole and wife &amp;c. </em>has strongly expressed the contrary opinion; but as it was not a question in the cause, the ease furnishes no authority. And yet he admits that a devise of a right of entry is good, and gives the right to sue in ejectment. Now a devise of a right of entry does not cast the freehold or possession on the devisee, as it does where the devisor is seized. The plaintiff in ejectment therefore must avail himself of the devisor\u2019s possession. And hence it seems to me, that if the devise of a right of <em>entry </em>gives the remedy by ejectment, the devise of the right of property carries along with it the power of maintaining a writ of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">1 am of opinion to reverse the judgment, and award the <em>scire facias.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The other judges concurred. Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b493-10\"> <em>Note by the president. </em>It is conceded that a devisee may maintain ejectment before entry; but this is not upon any right of entry devised to him, but upon the right of entry which the law gives him, whore the testator, being in seisin, lias devised his land to him. For in the case of a devise where the devisor is seized, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the freehold is in the devisee before he enters. Co. Litt. 111. a. And if any one enters to his prejudice, he may turn him out by ejectment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
