The city of Richmond having been incorporated for municipal purposes, a majority of her citizens qualified to vote for members of the common council desire that the corporate authorities should subscribe for a large number of shares in this joint stock company, and the legislature, in accordance with their desire, pass laws authorizing the common council to make such subscription. By these laws, the common council is authorized to borrow money to effect the object, and to levy, assess and collect such taxes as in their opinion will be necessary for the purpose of paying the interest and redeeming the principal of any loan which may be effected. This authority to borrow money and levy taxes is carried into effect by an ordinance; and under the ordinance the collector takes the property of a citizen, against whose will the laws authorizing the subscription were passed, who refuses to pay the taxes levied under authority of these laws, upon the ground that they are unconstitutional.

This subscription is made by virtue of an act of assembly giving to the president and directors of the bank, with the assent of the stockholders in general meeting, authority to make the subscription. It is objected by a citizen of Richmond, that the city has no authority to borrow money or levy taxes to pay her subscription, unless the company has become a body corporate, and that it is not legally incorporated, because its incorporation is effected by the subscription of the bank of Virginia, <em>and </em>the law authorizing that subscription is a violation of the bank charter, and unconstitutional.

They admitted that the ordinance afores\u00e1id, and the acts of assembly on which it was founded, were passed against the wishes of the plaintiff and of many other inhabitants, voters and owners of property in the city, and without their assent individually given to those acts. But they stated that the acts of assembly, though opposed by a minority of the inhabitants, were passed on the petition and with the approbation of the common council of the city, and of a large majority of the house keepers, freeholders and voters of the said city. And they insisted that the acts were constitutional and valid acts, and therefore the ordinance lawful and proper to be enforced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-4\">The various acts of assembly referred to in the bill and answer, the other acts of assembly concerning the <em>James river company, </em>the <em>James river and Kanawha company, </em>the city of <em>Richmond </em>and the <em>bank of Virginia, </em>and such other acts of assembly as either party might think pertinent to the matters in issue, were by agreement of the parties allowed to be read from the statutes, without being copied into the record.

That the acts authorizing the common council of the city of <em>Richmond </em>to subscribe 650,000 dollars to the stock of the <em>James river and Kanawha company, </em>to borrow the money, and to levy taxes on the city to pay the interest and redeem the principal, <em>are </em>unconstitutional.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-8\">II. That the <em>James river and Kanawha company </em>is not a constitutionally incorporated company, because the incorporation has been consummated only by the subscription of the <em>bank of Virginia, </em>and the law authorizing that subscription is a violation of the bank charter, and unconstitutional.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-9\">III. That the company is not a constitutionally incorporated company, because its incorporation has been effected by a series of enactments altering the charter of the company and changing the contracts of those who subscribed for the stock, which enactments are in violation of that provision of the constitution of the <em>United States, </em>and of the constitution of <em>Virginia, </em>which inhibits the legislature from passing any law impairing the obligation of contracts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-10\">In the view which the court took, the third objection, not being made by the parties themselves whose contracts were said to have been altered, could not avail the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>appellant here.

The acts of the 13th of February 1833 and 24th of January 1835 are not consi stent with the two first articles of the bill of rights of <em>Virginia. </em>If the court shall, be satisfied of this, it is its duty to pronounce the acts void, as was done by the general court in <em>Kamper </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>1 Va. Cas. 20. and by this court in <em>The Attorney General </em>v. <em>Broaddus &amp; wife, </em>6 Munf. 116.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-6\">There must be some limit to the power of the legislature to impose taxes on the property of citizens of the state. And there must be a constitutional control to keep the exercise of the power within that limit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-7\">It would be manifestly an inva.sion of the principle of property, and in the highest degree unjust, to tax property in one part of the state and not in another, for the support of government. It would be equally an invasion of the principle of property, to impose a tax of any kind on the property in one city or county, to be applied to the support of the police in another city or county. The support of the government or of the police should be drawn from the citizens of the state, city or county for whose protection and benefit that government or police is established.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-8\">By the acts in question, the legislature has authorized the common council of <em>li/ichmond, </em>to tax the property of the appellant and the other citizens of <em>Richmond, </em>to the amount of 650,000 dollars, to dig a canal or make some other line of transportation from the western boundary of <em>Virginia </em>to the city of <em>Richmond. </em>That the legislature could not itself impose a tax on the property of the citizeus of <em>Richmond </em>alone, to be applied to the <em>James </em>river and <em>Kanawha </em>improvement, is supposed to be clear. And is it not a solecism to assert that the legislature can confer on others a power with respect to a third person, which it does not itself possess ? <em>Nemo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number><em>dat qui non habet. </em>Besides, this is in violation of a prin- ^ ciple that lies at the foundation of all free government. The legislature is not itself the supreme power of the state. It has only a <em>delegated power to act for the con</em>stituent body; and that power it cannot, in the whole or in part, delegate over to others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-8\">The only ground on which it can be attempted to support the acts in question, is the legal fiction that a corporate body is a moral person, that may in many respects be considered as an individual, and the acts of the majority as the acts of the whole. The question then presents itself, what authority can the legislature confer on an incorporated town ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-9\">In <em>Virginia, </em>as in every other country at all extensive, there must be local divisions, as counties and cities. And from the necessity of the thing, there must be public bodies with limited jurisdictions over these districts, for the purpose of ordinary police, attending to roads and bridges, providing for the poor &amp;c. and (in towns where the population is crowded) the regulation of markets, the paving and lighting the streets, guarding against fires and putting them out &amp;c. But all these powers being against common right, the legislature, from the nature of the thing, are limited to the objects for which such corporations or limited jurisdictions are necessarily created. The inhabitants of counties and towns are still citizens of <em>Virginia, </em>and cannot, by any act of the legislature, be deprived of their rights as citizens.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-10\"><em>Richmond </em>was a town and had many inhabitants, before it was incorporated. The charter confined the corporate powers strictly to objects that were obviously corporate, and gave no authority to tax the citizens a single dollar, but for those objects. Suppose the charter had given authority to the common council to lay down railroads or dig canals, hundreds of miles off, or even a single inch beyond the limits of the corporation; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>or to engage in speculations within it, such as mills, manufactories, and the like: can it be doubted that such a power ought to be considered as beyond the legitimate objects of incorporation, as against common right, and as depriving those who choose to reside in the city, of their rights as citizens ? But the legislature of that day had no idea of granting such powers. The first attempt to grant them was made by the acts in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-6\">It will however be said, the majority must govern. What majority? The majority of the people in <em>Virginiai </em>No: the majority of individuals <em>in Richmond. </em>Suppose a majority of the common council and of the freemen of the city concur in the opinion that the property of all the citizens be taxed, but most unequally and unjustly taxed, for the <em>James </em>and <em>Kanawha </em>improvement ; could not those who were unjustly and oppressively taxed complain that the bill of rights of <em>Virginia </em>had been violated in their persons ? To the benefit of this bill of rights every citizen is entitled, and he cannot be deprived of it by the legislature, or a majority of the common council, or a majority of the freemen of the city, nor by all together. Yet injustice such as this has been committed, not between the citizens of <em>Richmond, </em>but between them and the owners of property on the line of the <em>James </em>and <em>Kanawha </em>improvement. The property of the citizens of <em>Richmond, </em>the willing and the unwilling, has been taxed, while the property of the citizens of <em>Goochland, Fluvanna, Albemarle, </em>and other counties on the line of the improvement (which must bo improved in value, if the property in <em>Richmond </em>shall be) has not been taxed. Who can bear the injustice of these acts ? The power of mortgaging the property of a minority, to its utmost extent, is given to a majority, who may act as they suppose for the best, in regard to what is not their own, and who, if the speculation turns out a ruinous one, can only cry out, \u201c we are sorry for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>It may be said, this adventure will be profitable. The appellant and others think not. At best, however, it is mere matter of speculation, and the property of the appellant should not be placed, against his will, on the hazard of a die.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-5\">II. The act of assembly of the 16th of February 1833, giving authority to the banks to subscribe, is unconstitutional and void, and the subscription made under it is void. This act violates the 10th section of the first article of the federal constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-6\">The act incorporating the bank is a contract entered into between the state and the stockholders. <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>6 Cranch 87. <em>The State of New Jersey </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>7 Cranch 164. <em>Terrett </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>9 Cranch 43. <em>Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>4 Wheat. 518. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Biddle, </em>8 Wheat. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-7\">The charter of the bank is not only a contract between the state and the stockholders, but between the state and each stockholder. The 10th article of the 8th section provides that the corporation shall not be at liberty to purchase any public stock whatever, except their own bank stock. 2 Rev. Code, ch. 193. p. 73. The exception proves what is meant by the term public stock, and shews it is any stock created by act of assembly. The same article also prohibits the bank from dealing in any thing except bills of exchange, gold or silver bullion &amp;c. plainly shewing that the capital of the bank was to be confined to banking operations only. The 11th article of the same section shews the power which the legislature meant to retain, and the only power that they meant to retain, which is to authorize the bank to make loans to a state or government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-8\">If the legislature can infringe fundamental articles in the charter of the bank, against the will of a minority of the stockholders, why was the power retained by the legislature to authorize the bank to make loans to a state or government ? The legislature surely did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>mean, at any time or under any circumstances, to coerce the stockholders, against the will of a majority, to make a loan to any state or government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alx\">The injustice of this subscription, in relation to many of the stockholders, is great and manifest. The widow and orphan, and others who have vested their money in the stock of this bank, depending on the dividends for their support, have their income diminished by those who think the investment will be profitable, or whose property in <em>Richmond, </em>or on the line of the improvement, they think will be enhanced in value by its being made.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b157-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASA\">I. He cited the act of 1742 establishing the town of <em>Richmond, 5 </em>Hen. Stat. at large, p. 191, and went into a history of the town and the powers of the corporation. He said, the corporation now has power to build wharves, \u2014 put up cranes for unlading vessels, \u2014 make streets, \u2014 cut down hills,\u2014 lay taxes for such purposes, \u2014 lay partial taxes on the owners of lots contiguous to streets, to defray the expense of improving such streets, \u2014 and under the act of 1829, power to bring water from without the limits of the city. It is to this corporation that the power to subscribe has been given at the instance of a majority, and it is objected that ibis is not properly a corporate power. It has not been denied that the legislature may give the power to make and improve streets, \u2014 to tax owners of lots, \u2014 to regulate buildings, \u2014 to appoint magistrates,\u2014 or to bring water into the city; and yet it is said that the legislature cannot give the corporation power to contribute to a work more important, to the prosperity of the city than every thing which can be effected by all the other powers. The argument is, that any new power must bear affinity to the other corporate powers, and that the power to subscribe is not germane to the other corporate powers. But there can be no test of this kind. Every power given by the charter is a cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>porate power. It may however be shewn that the <em>^ f J </em>... power is germane. 1 or what purpose was the city mcorporated ? To enjoy the natural advantages held out by its peculiar location. Navigation is closely allied to corporate purposes. To bring water, which increases the comfort of the inhabitants, is admitted to be a corporate power; but to bring trade, which enhances the prosperity and wealth of the town, it is argued is not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-6\">From the earliest period of our history, the general assembly has been engaged in legislation similar in principle to. that in question. Thus, the expense of roads through counties is borne by each county, though the benefit is not peculiarly or principally to the county. So in relation to bridges across water courses dividing counties. So as to navigable streams: the counties are authorized by law to clear out streams, and sometimes required by law to do so, for the public benefit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-8\">Suppose an act of incorporation of the town were now first to be made, containing all the powers formerly given, and power to improve all navigable waters in which the city is interested, and to lay taxes for that purpose. This could not be said to be an object in which the inhabitants of the town had no common interest. Among the objects for which towns are incorporated, which are those most obvious, \u2014 most ancient,\u2014 best established by authority? Towns are intended for purposes of commerce; and whatever has connection with commerce, domestic or foreign, has direct connection with corporate towns. Willcock on Corporations, p. 17. Law Library, vol. 14. p. 10. With the commercial prosperity of <em>Richmond </em>the improvement of the <em>James </em>and <em>Kanawha </em>is directly connected. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-9\">It is objected to the power, that taxation is necessary for its purpose, and that the purpose is not confined to a local district. No ,one questions the power to erect-warehouses, scalehouses, markethouses, wharves &amp;c. yet the benefit of these is not confined to the people of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the town. The benefit of the <em>James </em>and <em>Kanawha </em>improvement, it is admitted, is not confined to the city, but the city will be chiefly benefited by it; at all events it has a deep interest in it. Suppose power had been given to the corporation to construct so much of the improvement as lies within the limits of the town; could it have been objected that the object was not one of a corporate nature ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-3\">The 1st and 2d articles of the bill of rights do not exempt holders of property from taxation. They are not exempt from contribution either to general or local taxation. An attempt has been made to prove that the power to tax, in this case, could not be conferred on the common council. The argument is, that the legislature could not itself impose this tax on the city of <em>Richmond, </em>and that it could not give power which it had not. But does it indeed follow that because the legislature could not impose a tax on the city, it could not give power to the city to tax itself? Could the legislature impose a lax on the citizens of <em>Richmond </em>for ordinary corporate expenses ? If they could, they might impose this tax. If, however, for the ordinary expenses of the city, they could not impose a tax on the city, but only authorize the city to tax itself, then in this case they could not impose the tax, but only give the authority. The legislature had full power to alter the charter of the city with its assent. As an original charter of incorporation is valid by the acceptance of a majority of the persons incorporated, so an amendment of the charter is equally valid with the assent of a majority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-4\">The following legal propositions are insisted on:</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-5\">1.

See <em>Case of the County Levy, </em>5 Call 139.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-6\">2. It is not essential to the validity of such delegation of power, that the object for which the tax is laid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>should be exclusively interesting to those who pay the tax. It is sufficient that there be such common interest in the community to be taxed, as to induce that community to pursue the object at the expense of the tax.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABW\">3.

The same objection might have been made to the act of 1813 extending the charter and altering its provisions. No inference can fairly be drawn from the 10th and 11th articles of the Sth section, that there is any interdict upon the power of the legislature to alter the charier with the assent of the stockholders. The authority given by the legislature was jealously guarded; more so than was necessary on common law principles. The subscription has notwithstanding been made by a large majority: and the bank has sold additional stock, admitted new stockholders, and obtained a profit on the stock.

The bill of rights, art. 1. ranks among the inherent indefeasible rights of men in a state of society, the right to the means of acquiring and possessing property. What is property P It is \u201cthat sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in total exclusion of any other individual in the universe.\u201d <em>2 </em>Black.

What is mine, is mine to keep, mine to give, mine to dispose of according to my own will and pleasure; so mine that none other can dispose of the whole or any part of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-6\">There are three exceptions to this exclusive, uncontrollable right of individual property. 1. Private property may be taken for public use, upon making just compensation to the owners. <em>2. </em>Private property is bound to contribute to defray the expense of government; in general terms, is liable to be taxed. But how taxed.? It is liable to taxation by general laws, for general purposes, passed by our representatives in the ge<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>neral assembly, (bill of rights, art. 6.) not by our fellow-citizens in county or town. When public taxes are laid by representatives in general assembly, there is this security against unjust and oppressive taxation, \u2014 that the taxes are laid for a purpose common to all, upon property held by all, and an equal burden imposed on all in proportion to their means. But this security is gone, if partial taxation on a part of the community, for general purposes, be allowed ; since in such case, instead of all having an interest to protect each and every part, some have an interest to oppress and despoil others, in order to relieve themselves from the burden which ought to be borne in common, or to appropriate what is exacted from the sufferer to the benefit of the oppressor part of the community. Therefore, all partial taxation laid on particular individuals or a set of individuals, for general public purposes, is contrary to the bill of rights, and unconstitutional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-4\">The 3d exception consists in the delegation, <em>by the </em>legislature, of power of taxation over particular districts and communities, to local municipal governments, for local municipal purposes; such as, to county courts to lay county levies and poor rates, and to the corporate authority of towns to levy town taxes for purposes of municipal government and police. And the question is, whether the acts under consideration fall fairly within this 3d exception, or whether they delegate to the common council of the city of <em>Richmond </em>power to lay a partial tax on the city for a general public purpose ? If the former, the delegation of power is constitutional, bow-\u25a0ever unwise; if the latter, it is unconstitutional, though it were as reasonable as it is in truth cruel and monstrous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-5\">What are local municipal purposes for which the power of taxation may be delegated, can only be ascertained by immemorial usage. The county courts have been, from time immemorial, authorized by law to levy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>poor rates for support of the poor of their own county; and to lay county levies in order to defray the expenses of building courthouses, clerks\u2019 offices, jails and bridges, and of opening roads and keeping them in repair. These are levies for local county purposes, ascertained by usage and practice to be so. But suppose the legislature should authorize the court of any one county to lay poor rates for the support of the poor throughout the commonwealth, including its own; to defray the expense of building all courthouses &amp;c. including its own; <em>to open </em>and <em>keep in </em>repair all roads in the state, its own among the rest. Here would be a tax for general purposes, which only the general assembly can constitutionally impose. So the county courts have been sometimes authorized to levy money to defray the expense of clearing out obstructions in rivers running through or bounding their respective counties. But suppose the court of any one county on <em>Janes </em>river should be authorized to lay a tax on the people of that county to improve <em>James </em>river from its source to the great falls; here would be a tax for a general purpose, which only the representatives of the people in assembly can constitutionally impose, making the tax as general as the purpose. The local governments of corporate towns have been, from time immemorial, authorized to levy taxes on the corporators and their property, for local municipal purposes of their own. And the city of <em>Richmond, </em>among the rest, has been authorized to levy taxes to support its own poor, \u2014 to build courthouses, market houses, scalehouses, wharves and cranes, \u2014 to open and pave streets, \u2014 to regulate buildings, \u2014 to defray the expense of municipal government and police, \u2014 to bring water into the town for the daily use of the citizens. All these are local municipal purposes. But suppose an act authorizing the common council to levy taxes for purposes of the same kind, difibring only in making the money applicable to such purposes in every town in the state: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>here would be a tax for general purposes, tbe power of imposing which the legislature cannot delegate, <em>The Case of the County Levy, 5 </em>Call 139. sustains all this reasoning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afg\">It is said, the direct and main object of the incorporation of towns is to promote trade and commerce, and (therefore) navigation, ,1s it supposed that it would be constitutional to authorize the common council to borrow money to subscribe to a company incorporated for establishing a trade between <em>Richmond </em>and <em>Liverpool, Calcutta, </em>or <em>Canton </em>? Yet to this length must the principle be carried, to justify the authority given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AG3\">. It is said that every thing is a corporate purpose which the charter makes so, and the legislature may amend the charter. Suppose a law authorizing the common council to levy a tax on the city to defray the expenses of the general assembly (and such an idea has been started in other 'states): would it be contended that the city is interested in the object ? that it is peculiarly interested because the session of the legislature is an advantage to its citizens, and therefore that this would be a constitutional law ? If there is no restraint in the bill of rights on the power of the legislature to impose or authorize partial taxation on the city for general public purposes; if the legislature may make any thing a corporate purpose, for which the city may be taxed, that it thinks proper to declare to be a corporate purpose by law, \u2014 what is there to restrain the legislature from partial legislation for the city in other respects ? Why may not the legislature, on like principles, authorize the common council to repeal the statute of wills or descents, within the city, \u2014 or to establish a community of goods, \u2014 if a majority of the corporators shall desire it? The doctrines which must be upheld to support these laws, and the precedent they establish, strike at the very principle of property in corporate towns.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>The King </em>v. <em>Amery, </em>1 T.

Raym. 29. was relied on to sustain the proposition that the majority of the corporators may assent to and accept alterations of the charter. The first case arose on a charter incorporating a town, and containing only the most ordinary and unimportant provisions of charters of that kind; and the other case was the case of an alteration of a town charter in a very trivial particular, respecting the election of sheriffs of the town. But has it ever been held in <em>England, </em>that a majority of the citizens of a town could accept a charter, or an amendment of a charter, authorizing the majority to lay a partial tax for a general purpose on the whole town, or to mortgage the property of the whole for a debt contracted for a general purpose, against the will of the minority ? in other words, that the majority of the corporators may accept an amendment of the charter, by which they shall be authorized to dispose of the private individual property of the minority against their will? Such a thing has never been pretended in <em>England. </em>And if, by the omnipotence of parliament, it might be done <em>there, </em>the Gth article of our bill of rights forbids it <em>here. </em>The legislature alone is my representative to tax me for general purposes, and can only tax me in common and equally with others. It cannot make a majority of my fellow corporators of <em>Richmond, </em>nor the common council of the city, my representative so to tax me, \u2014 so to mortgage my property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-7\">If these laws be sustained, the security of property is taken away.

II, The, charter of the bank is a contract between the commonwealth and the whole bank company, \u2014 between the commonwealth and each and every stockholder,\u2014 between each stockholder and the whole body of stockholders, \u2014 and between each and every stockholder and each and every other stockholder. And of this institution; the sole, end and purpose, the very essence, is that its capital shall be employed in bank operations for bank profits. With that view, and upon that understanding, every original subscriber' took shares of the stock,, and every purchaser of stock vested his money in the stock. They subscribed and purchased, upon the guaranty of the charter that their money should be employed in bank operations for bank profits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-6\">Accordingly we find that by the 10th and, 11th articles of the constitution of the. bank, 2, Rev. Code, ch. 193, \u00a7 8. art. 10. 11. p. 73. the bank is, expressly inhibited from dealing in the stock of any other company, even with the legislative assent, and that it can only lend money to a government, state or federal, with s-uoh assent, Why and. for whose, benefit, was the restriction imposed ? Certainly, for the benefit and security of the stockholders; that they might have positive express assurance, and the public faith pledged, that thei.r money should only be employed in bank opera,tions for bank profits., o,r in loans to government made with the assent of the legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-7\">Let it be conceded that the main end and purpose of the incorporation of the bank was to institute a public company to make loans of money: the difference is wide and obvious between making loans of money, on which interest is to be paid and of which the principal is to be. returned, and subscribing money to the stock of the <em>James river and Kanawha company,, </em>where there is to be no. return of principal, where neither dividend, nor interest is certainly to be received, where the principal is to be vested in an enterprise of hazard, and the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>fit is to be reduced, deferred or wholly disappointed, according to the success, speedy or tardy, or the total failure of the enterprise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agx\">The question therefore is, whether it is competent to the legislature to authorize a majority of the members of this bank company to change the contract of its charter in its essence, without the consent and against the will of a minority ? to authorize the majority to divert a large portion of their own stock, and of the stock of their unwilling fellow stockholders, from banking operations for bank profits, to a fund for wholly different and incompatible purposes ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-5\">It is immaterial to enquire whether a majority has power, or may be authorized, to bind the whole company for any purpose connected with its bank operations, \u2014 so that the e.ssence of the charter is still preserved Inviolate; so that it shall still remain a bank company, employing its capital in banking for bank profit : which was all that was done when the assent of the bank was given to the extension of its charter and to the terms of such extension, and to the other petty alterations which have been made in the original charter. All this may be admitted; and yet it may be perfectly true, and indeed obvious, that the majority cannot bind the minority to a change of the charter in its very essence, \u2014 in that employment of the bank capital which the charter expressly assured to each and every stockholder, and in expectation of which, and upon the assurance of which, every stockholder vested his money in the bank stock. For this wmuld be to authorize one man or set of men to dispose of the property of others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-6\">It is obvious that if the legislature be competent to authorize a majority of the stockholders of the bank thus to divert one sixteenth part of the capital from banking operations to canal making, it would be just as competent to authorize the majority of the stockholders, in despite of the minority, to divert the whole capital of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>the bank from bank operations to the works of the <em>James river and Kanawha company. </em>Had the legislature authorized the majority of the stockholders to do this, W'ho would have thought such a law constitutional \u2014 no violation of the contract of the bank charter \u2014 no invasion of the chartered rights and property of the minority ? Yet the difference between this and that which has been done is only a difference in degree. The legislature has only authorized the majority to dispose -of 15 or 16 out of every 100 dollars of the property of the minority, against their will. ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-4\">It is obvious too, that if the legislature was competent to authorize a\u2019 majority of stockholders of the bank to subscribe to the stock of this <em>James river and Kanawha company </em>against the will of the minority, it would be just as competent to authorize the majority to subscribe for any other stock in any other company, public or private, foreign or <em>domestic; in </em>a company incorporated to work the coal mines of <em>Chesterfield </em>or the gold mines of <em>Louisa, </em>\u2014 to make a railroad in <em>Marxjland, </em>\u2014 to make a canal or railroad across the isthmus of <em>Darien </em>or of <em>Suez. </em>There is no limit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-5\">There is no difference in this regard between this, banking company and any other public company. Now apply the principle to the <em>James river and Kanawha com- ' pawy. </em>Suppose the legislature shall authorize a majority of .the stockholders of this company (the commonwealth herself owning more than half the stock) to subscribe the whole or any considerable part of its capital . to a bank company: and then see the gross violation of public faith, the atrocious injustice, the plain invasion of the rights of all the subscribers to the company, other than the commonwealth. The subscribers to the company have advanced their money for a work of internal improvement, of which they are not only, as stockhol-. ders, to enjoy the profits, but from which they are to derive benefit as land owners: the city of <em>Richmond </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>has subscribed 650,000 dollars for a work which the citizens are told is to enhance the value of the city property, and promote their peculiar prosperity: and the money of these individual subscribers and of the city is diverted to objects in which they have no manner of peculiar interest! The injustice and oppression would be palpable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-4\">Even this is justified, because (it is said) a corporation has a right to surrender its charter. But it cannot give up the property of the minority acquired under the <em>charter; </em>it can only surrender the chartered privileges, that is, the power of acquiring more property under the charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-5\">It is said, the bank company has received a full consideration in the authority to enlarge its capital; it has taken the consideration; it has sold the new stock, and the sale was in fact much above par. But this is no benefit to the old stockholders; for it brings all the new stockholders to divide with them the dividends resulting from the bank operations on the old stock, since an amount equal to the amount of the new stock is diverted from banking and employed in internal improvement: and as for the price above par at which the new stock has been sold, it is plain that if the new stock had been kept out of the market, the whole of that advanced price would have been distributed among the old shares of stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-6\">There are circumstances of aggravation of the injustice of this proceeding that must not escape notice. The commonwealth being a large stockholder in the bank, and exercising through the treasurer an overwhelming influence upon every vote of any general meeting of stockholders (an influence that has never failed to be decisive) and owning more than half the whole stock of the <em>James'river and Kanawha company, </em>\u2014 proceeds in her legislative character to authorize herself, in her character of stockholder of the bank, to advance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>money to herself in her character of stockholder in the <em>James river and Kanawha company. </em>She might have appropriated the whole of her bank stock to the purpose, but she chose to apply the stock of her citizens as well as her own. She might have left the question of subscription to the sense of the private individual stockholders, but she chose to give her own vote to dispose of their interests, knowing that if she voted, they in fact had no choice. It is an aid, a benevolence, a forced loan exacted from-the bank stockholders, if ever there was one. No matter what the form of the transaction, its substance cannot be disguised.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b170-4\">Brooke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azg\">This is a case of great interest as regards the commonwealth and individual stockholders in the <em>James river and Kanawha </em>company, and on principle is deeply interesting to every citizen of the state. That it is the province of the judiciary to decide on the constitutionality of the laws, cannot now be doubted. That the bill of rights is the basis of the constitution, is a proposition sustained by the authority of the judiciary and of the legislature. In the case of <em>Custis </em>v. Lane, 3 Munf. 590. judge <em>Roane, </em>speaking for the court, said, \u201cThe declaration of rights is stated to have been made by the representatives of the good people of <em>Virginia, </em>and it is declared that these rights do pertain to them and their posterity, as the <em>basis </em>and foundation of government.\u201d And we have the legislative construction of the bill of rights, in the act of the 24th January 1799, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 32. a. p. 78. to repeal certain acts and to declare the construction of the bill of rights on the subject of religion; thereby acknowledging its authority as a part of the constitution. The first article of the new constitution acknowledges the bill of rights as the basis and foundation of government, requiring, in the opinion of the convention, no amendment. That it has been repeatedly referred to as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>rule of judicial decision, see <em>The Case of the County Levy, </em>5 Call 139. and <em>Currie\u2019s adm\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Mutual Assurance Society, </em>4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 315. Nor is its authority impaired by the few modifications of it to be found in the former and last constitutions. And although a clause in the new constitution subjects the judges to removal from office by a vote of two thirds of the general assembly, without cause, if it shall so please the general assembly, whereby the independence of the judges is greatly impaired, yet it is still their duty to decide on the constitutionality of the laws passed by the legislature. In the discharge of this office, I know that this court will not be influenced by any other considerations than those of duty: and it is therefore with great deference that I differ from a majority of the judges. It must be admitted that at the institution of civil government founded on the rights of all, the will of the majority must prevail over the opinions and interests of the minority: but when such government is established, its great object is to protect the rights of the minority from the tyranny of the majority; a tyranny more inflexible and implacable than the tyranny of a single despot. In the one case the majority feels no sympathy for the minority. In the other case the sufferers have the sympathy of the majority of their fellow subjects, and the force of public opinion may redress their wrongs. To effect this relief against the tyranny of majorities, written constitutions were devised by the american people. So also, where a corporation is to be created, the majority of the community to be incorporated must decide on the acceptance of the charter; otherwise the smallest minority would defeat the will of the largest majority. When the charter is accepted, the minority are bound by all its regulations, and protected by those which limit the power of the majority; and to give effect to this protection, the minority are not bound by regulations not within the provisions of the charter, and in the case of an abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>power by the majority, the courts decide between the corporation and the party injured. This is the case before us. The property of the appellant has been taken by the authority of the common council of the corporation; and the inquiry is, first, whether the tax imposed on the. appellant was authorized by the charter, or, if not by the charter, by the two laws authorizing the subscription of two sums amounting to 650,000 dollars by the corporation to the <em>James river and Kanawha company. </em>It must be admitted, I think, that the charter did not confer the power in question, or no application would have been made to the legislature to pass the laws authorizing the subscription. Those applications were made to the legislature by a majority of the property holders in the city; and it is said that the majority had a right to control the minority. I admit, as before remarked, that the majority may accept a charter, and may also surrender a charter, or refuse an amendment to it. But <em>the trae </em>question is, did <em>this </em>power of <em>the </em>majority extend to the case before us ? If so, the minority, by becoming members of the corporation, are no longer within the protection of the bill of rights, unless it can be shewn that the laws in question were authorized by the bill of rights and the constitution. As it is not contended that the power to impose the tax was given by the charter of the corporation, let us test the authority of the laws passed to give <em>the </em>power,, by supposing a majority of the people of any of the counties or districts of the state to make application to the legislature for a law imposing a tax on that portion of the people of the state, to be applied to public purposes and not local: would such a law be constitutional ? I think not. Nor would some portion of interest in the object of the tax make it so. Otherwise .the state, by the means of local majorities, might practise the most oppressive tyranny upon local minorities. It would violate the 6th article of the bill of rights, by taking pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>vate property for public purposes without compensation. It would violate natural justice, and be in conflict with the theory and the principles of the constitution. It would violate the 15th article of the bill of rights, which declares that no free government or the blessings of liberty can be preserved lo any people, but by a firm adherence to <em>justice, </em>moderation and temperance, and by a frequent recurrence to fundamental principles. That the legislature may delegate its power to any of the local authorities established by the constitution or the laws, there can be no doubt: but this delegated authority must be for local purposes, and not a public purpose. On this point I refer to judge <em>Pendleton's </em>opinion in <em>The Case of the County Levy, </em>5 Call 139. And all the laws referred to by the counsel are of this character. But if it were not so, and some of those laws went further, still, when a question is made as to the constitutionality of a law, it is not to be decided by the repeated acts of the legislature on which no question has been raised and adjudged, but by the bill of rights and the constitution. That a corporation may accept an amendment to its charter at the will of a majority of the corporators, is readily admitted. But the amendment ought to be by a law not temporary and for a single object in which a majority may have an imposing interest for the time; it ought to be by a law organic in its character and permanent in its operation, and providing for a common interest: and that, I think, is not the character of the laws in question. They were intended to effect a particular object, temporary only, in which there could not be a common interest. That the inhabitants might derive some benefit remote in prospect, though the object was a public object, is no answer to the objection. This benefit cannot be pretended to be the object of the laws. The improvement of the <em>James </em>and <em>Kanawha </em>rivers was a great state adventure, begun many years before, during which the corporation had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>never been called on to contribute more than the rest of the state; while the state itself had contributed more than a million of dollars of the public money, not for the benefit of <em>Richmond </em>only, but for the benefit of all the people of the commonwealth, and especially of those who lived in the region of the improvement and along its line. It is absurd to say that a great national objeot like this was a local object as regarded <em>Richmond. </em>If so, other local interests in the region of the improvement ought to have been called on, as well as the minority in the city of <em>Richmond.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Taking this view of the twokws in question, I shall not say any thing on the law authorizing the subscription by the <em>banlcof Virginia, </em>with the consent of a majority of the stockholders of the bank. I think the decree dissolving the injunction ought to be reversed, and the injunction perpetuated.</p>\n<author id=\"b174-9\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Amp\">The power of the judiciary to <em>decide on </em>the constitutionality of a law is too firmly settled to be now questioned. It is equally clear to my mind that if the legislature have <em>power </em>to act, the judiciary cannot control the manner of its exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">In this case it is contended that the legislature had no constitutional power to authorize the subscription by the corporation to the <em>James river and Kanawha company. </em>Yet it is admitted that the legislature has the power of incorporating a town with certain corporate powers, and it cannot be denied that this power may be exercised without the <em>unanimous </em>consent of the inhabitants. It would annihilate the power, if the fiat of one man or ten men could arrest its exercise. Some number, then, less than the whole must suffice to render valid the acceptance of the act of incorporation. And if a number less than the whole will suffice, who is to decide upon <em>the plus or minus f </em>Certainly not the judiciary; andas certainly it must fall within the legislative province. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>But the legislature has declared the assent of a majority sufficient. We must therefore take it that an original charter accepted by a majority of the inhabitants is valid; and <em>pari ratione, </em>a charter giving new powers and privileges at the instance of a majority, or accepted by them, is also valid. These principles are more than sustained by the english cases; for even a charter of the crown is valid if accepted by a majority, and a <em>legislative </em>or statutory charter is binding without any consent whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">But it is said, the grant of new powers must be of such as are corporate in their character. Be it so. But who is to decide that question, and by what is it to be tested ?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">It has been argued that corporate powers must be confined to the limits of the corporation. This I think a most imperfect test; for, confessedly, the limits of the corporation may be extended, so that, by this mode of reasoning, you extend the power by extending the boundaries of the city. Moreover, it is not denied that a corporation may bring water into the city from a point beyond it; and it may erect its works for that purpose without its own jurisdiction. This affords us a better test. The <em>interest </em>of the corporation is the true test of the corporate character of the act: for every by-law, says lord <em>Holt, </em>by which the benefit of the corporation is advanced, is good for that reason. Thus in the case of the water works, though the source be ten miles off, the act for introducing the water is fairly a corporate act, because the want is experienced in the heart and through all the wards of the corporation, and the benefit is experienced <em>within </em>the limits, though the operations by which it is introduced are carried on <em>without. </em>So too, the removal of the bar in <em>James </em>river above <em>Warwick </em>would be fairly a corporate act, since it would greatly redound to the advantage of <em>Richmond, </em>would benefit its trade, and diminish the charges which now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>encumber and embarrass it. For though the <em>work </em>would be done beyond the limits of the city, the consequences or effects of it would be felt throughout its borders.</p>\n<p id=\"A9K\">If then the test of the corporate character of an act is the probable benefit of it to the community within the corporation, who is the proper judge whether a proposed measure is likely to conduce to the public interest of the city ? Is it this court, whose avocations little fit it for such enquiries? Or is it the mass of the people themselves, \u2014 the majority of the corporation, acting (as they must do if they act at all) under the sanction of the legislative body ? The latter, assuredly. The principles of good sense, not less than those of our institutions, inculcate the general propriety of leaving to individuals and to communities the right to judge for themselves what their interest demands, instead of fettering and controlling them, under the false notion that we the governors know what is good for them better than themselves. Without, therefore, entering into the enquiry whether the subscription was for their benefit or notj I am of opinion that they were the proper judges, subject nevertheless to that control which necessarily exists in the charter-granting power.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">I come next to the law authorizing the subscription by the bank. From what has been already said, it is clear that if the subscription be germane to the business of the bank, and was so deemed by a majority of the stockholders, the authority to subscribe was valid. Now the bank is an institution whose object is to make gain by dealing in money. It trades in notes, bonds, bills and other securities for money, and unless restrained by charter, it deals in stocks of other companies of whatever description. In the subscription to a newly organized company, it in fact advances its money on the faith of the company itself, and relies for profit and reimbursement on its probable prosperity and success. The scrip which it receives is the obligation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the company, as completely as if the money had been formally loaned and a negotiable note taken for the amount; and so perfectly was this sort of dealing understood to be within the ordinary current of banking transactions, that the legislature, who did not choose to engage in stockjobbing, expressly provided that the bank should engage in the purchase of no stock but its own. This is a legislative exposition (as far as that can have any weight) of the intimate connexion subsisting between the business of banking and the purchase of stocks. And this legislative inhibition was removed at the instance or with the assent of a majority of the stockholders of the bank, and the institution was thus left free to act as if the restriction never had been imposed. For my own part, I can see no employment of bank capital that is more germane to its business, than the purchase of stocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">These two points being settled, I do not find it necessary to touch upon the various minor topics that were most ably discussed by the counsel for the appellant. They all resulted in the attempt to shew that under the circumstances developed in the course of legislation upon this subject, both the bank and the corporation had a right to withdraw; as also a variety of private individuals who are supposed to have been equally wronged. Be it so. But none of them have asked to be absolved. All are paying up, and harmoniously proceeding with the business of the company. If they who have been wronged make no complaint, can the plaintiff assert their rights, to their prejudice and against their will ? And even if we were unreasonably to decide that the whole charter was void because of one unconstitutional provision, shall we so decide when he who is injured eschews such a decision ? The corporation might have withdrawn. It may have been unconstitutional not to provide that it might do so. But it has acquiesced : it has paid 20,000 dollars. If it withdraws, it dissolves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the charter and may lose its advance. It therefore declines to withdraw. Shall a mere integer in the corporation compel a dissolution of the company, against the will of the Corporation ? I think not. I am therefore of opinion to affirm the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b178-4\">Cabell and Brockenbrough, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A_Zs\">concurred in affirming the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
