Robert </em>and <em>Zachary Taliaferro </em>proved their father\u2019s will; but, dying soon afterwards, the administration of the estate was chiefly conducted by <em>Lawrence Taliaferro, </em>and <em>John Battaile, \u25a0 </em>who had married the testator\u2019s daughter <em>Sarah.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-7\">On the 20th of November, 1720, <em>Lawrence Taliaferro </em>and <em>John Battaile </em>purchased <em>Zachary Taliaferro\u2019s </em>share in the said residue of his father\u2019s estate, for the consideration of three slaves, to wit, <em>Prince, Peg </em>and <em>Rock. </em>On the 21st of February, 1721, <em>Zachary Taliaferro </em>made his will, and thereby devised his lands to his youngest brothers, <em>Richard </em>and <em>William, </em>and the rest of his estate to his said nephew and niece, <em>Kemp </em>and <em>Mildred Taliaferro, </em>leaving his brother, <em>Robert Taliaferro, </em>executor. The will was carried to Essex court, for probate; and was actually proved by the oath of the executor and two of the subscribing witnesses ; but <em>Lawrence Taliaferro, </em>the heir at law, was allowed time to contest it; and the court gave no judgment for, or against, its validity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-l\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>On the 29th of September, 1725, <em>Robert Taliaferro, </em>gave a bond, in the penalty of \u00a3 76, to <em>John Battaile, Richard Taliaferro </em>and <em>William Taliaferro, </em>conditioned that, if the slaves sold, by <em>Lawrence Taliaferro </em>to <em>Zachary Taliaferro, </em>November 20th, 1720, should be recovered, from <em>Lawrence Taliaferro, </em>by <em>Kemp </em>and <em>Mildred Taliaferro, </em>the obligor would pay half the bond : and, on the 18th of March, 1727, <em>Richard Taliaferro </em>gave a bond in the penalty of \u00a3 62, to <em>John </em>and <em>Francis Taliaferro, </em>sons and executors of <em>Laivrence Taliaferro, </em>conditioned that, if <em>Kemp </em>and <em>Mildred </em>should, by virtue of <em>Zachary Taliaferro\u2019s </em>will, recover the three slaves, <em>Prince, Peg </em>and <em>Roc\u00ede, Richard Taliaferro </em>would pay half of that bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-7\">In 1729, <em>William Strother </em>married <em>Mildred Taliaferro, </em>then under age; and sold the right of herself and <em>Kemp, </em>at that time, also an infant, for \u00a3 40 sterling, giving bond, to <em>John Battaille, Richard Taliaferro, William Taliaferro, </em>and the two sons <em>(John </em>and Francis) <em>o\u00ed Lawrence Taliaferro </em>in the penalty of \u00a3250 sterling, conditioned that <em>Strother </em>should indemnify the obligees and <em>Kemp Taliaferro.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-8\">In May 1745, <em>Richard Taliaferro </em>had the will of <em>Zachary Taliaferro </em>proved by the third witness, and admitted to record. By which means <em>Kemp Taliaferro, </em>first became acquainted with his rights; and thereupon <em>William Strother, </em>for \u00a3 20 sterling, assigned his wife\u2019s right to him the said <em>Kemp.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-9\">In July 1749, <em>Kemp Taliaferro </em>brought suit, in the county court of Spotsylvania, for the shares of himself and <em>Mildred, </em>on repayment of the \u00a3 40, in <em>Strother\u2019s </em>bond, with interest: soon after which he died, and the suit was revived in the name of <em>Mary Taliaferro, </em>his widow and administratrix, and of <em>Barry Taliaferro, </em>his son and heir. The answer of <em>Francis Taliaferro </em>says, that the slaves <em>Prince, Peg </em>and <em>Rock, </em>had been purchased by his father, and were no part of his grandfather\u2019s estate. That he and his brother were not parties to <em>Strother\u2019s </em>bond : but took bonds of indemnity, in 1727, from, <em>John Battaile, Richard Taliaferro </em>and <em>William Taliaferro.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Several unimportant depositions were taken: and the county court, March 2d, 1752, decreed that <em>Francis </em>and <em>William Taliaferro </em>should deliver up the slaves mentioned in the answer, and account for their profits: and that the plaintiffs should pay the <em>\u00a3 </em>40, in <em>Strother\u2019s </em>bond, with interest : but should not recover the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-4\">The suit remained upon the docket, until April 1762; when it was removed into the general court. <em>William Taliaferro </em>and <em>John Taliaferro, </em>both died intestate, and without issue : and, upon their deaths, their estates entered into the family of <em>Francis Taliaferro; </em>who had died, in the mean time, leaving his son <em>Lawrence Taliaferro, </em>jr. his executor: and the latter was made defendant to the suit, as well as <em>Haye Taliaferro, John Taliaferro, Francis Taliaferro, Wiliam Taliaferro </em>and <em>Rickard Brooke, </em>who had married the daughters of <em>Francis </em>Taliaferro; and to whom distributive shares of his estate, in right of their wives, had been allotted. Some depositions of no great importance were taken: and upon a hearing of the cause, the general court dismissed the bill with costs : From which decree, the plaintiffs appealed to the king in council: which appeal was, after the revolution, transferred to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-5\">For the appellants, it was contended, that the decree of dismission by the general court was erroneous, as the whole transactions shewed manifest fraud; for the suspension of the probate of <em>Zachary Taliaferro\u2019s </em>will was premeditated, and done with a view that, through lapse of time, it might be forgotten; or a belief established, that it had been rejected by the court. That this was, to a great degree, effected too; for <em>Strother </em>evidently acted under the impression that the validity of the will was doubtful; and that it would be better to take a trifle, for a questionable right, than to lose it altogether. But this mistake, which arose from the misrepresentations of the other parties to the bargain, ought not to prejudice him, or his wife; and much less <em>Kemp Taliaferro, </em>whose claim he had no right to sell. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>That the subsequent establishment of the will, and the accidental discovery of their rights excused all the delays which had taken place; and entitled the appellants to the property, which was still in the hands of volunteers, who had n0 rl'ght to hold it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-6\">For the appellees, it was insisted, that there was no proof of fraud. That <em>Lawrence Taliaferro </em>had, as heir at law, a right to contest the will; for which purpose a continuance of the application for probate in Essex court was absolutely necessary; and, if the executor did not think to urge the-matter afterwards, the heir was not to blame, as he was not <em>bound to </em>strive to promote his own disherison, and he might reasonably suppose, from the neglect of the executor, that the establishment of the will was given up, as desperate. That <em>Strother </em>was fully apprized of the will, and might have brought the case to a decision himself; but instead of entering into the controversy, at a time when the matter was yet recent, and the defence would have been effectual, from testimony which might then have been procured, he chose to sell the claims : for which, in fact, he obtained full value. That the sale, by <em>Strother, </em>was good,' as to himself and wife, at least; and, after so great a lapse of time, it would <em>be </em>unreasonable to open the transactions, with which the parties appeared, for so long a period, satisfied.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The court was of opinion that whether the delay with respect to the probate of the will was fraudulent or not, was unimportant; for, in either case, <em>Kemp </em>and <em>Mildred Taliaferro </em>were equally unapprized of their rights. Yet, as <em>Strother </em>the husband of <em>Mildred </em>had notice, and might by consulting the records of Essex court have obtained full information, he could not allege mistake; and, as he had power to sell his wife\u2019s claim to personalty, the sale, as to her share, was effectual: but, as he had no authority to sell that of <em>Kemp, </em>who was then a minor, and had not notice of the circumstances until the final probate of the will in 1745, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>and had done nothing to confirm the sale, the same was void as to him, and the plaintiffs entitled to his moiety upon payment of the <em>\u00a3 </em>40, with interest as offered in his bill. And the following was the decree which was entered :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">\u201c The court, having maturely considered the transcript of the record, and the arguments of counsel in this cause, are of opinion, that so much of the said decree, as dismissed the bills of the plaintiffs <em>Mary Taliaferro </em>and <em>Harry Taliaferro, </em>ought to be reversed and annulled; and, proceeding to give such decree as the said date general court ought to have given, do decree and order, that the plaintiffs <em>Mary Taliaferro </em>and <em>Harry Taliaferro </em>do recover of the defendants one moiety of the slaves mentioned in the answers of the defendants, together with their increase and profits since the year 1726, including the profits of those who are dead, down to the times of their respective deaths, if any such there be, to be ascertained and adjusted, either by commissioners, who shall make a reasonable allowance for the raising and maintaining children, and supporting those which were unprofitable, or by a trial at law, as the high court of chancery shall think fit to direct, and also their costs by them expended, as well in the said late general court as in the prosecution of their appeal here; and that the residue of the said decree, as to the plaintiff <em>Mildred Strother, </em>be affirmed. All which is ordered to be certified to the said high court of chancery.\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
