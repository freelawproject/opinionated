Callaway, John Callaway </em>and <em>George Callaway </em>qualified as executors. <em>Lucy Callaway, </em>by writing under her hand and seal, assigned her legacy of \u00bf\u00a3500. to <em>Elizabeth Alexander; </em>who, on the 15th of January 1828, instituted a suit in the superiour court of chancery for the district of <em>Lynch-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>burg, </em>against <em>Christopher Clark </em>and <em>John Callaway, </em>the only surviving executors of <em>James Callaway </em>deceased, and against the surviving sureties bound in the bond given by the executors, and the representatives of the deceased sureties, for a settlement of the accounts of the executors, and payment of the legacy of <em>\u00a3 </em>500,. assigned by <em>Juay Callaway </em>to the plaintiff. The <em>subpoena </em>was executed on <em>Christopher Clark </em>the 25th of February 1828, and on <em>John Callaway </em>the 9th of June following. <em>The .bill </em>was filed <em>at </em>July rules 1828; <em>and </em>by an amended bill, filed in October 1829, <em>Lucy Callaway </em>was made a party defendant. <em>Christopher Clark </em>died pending the suit, and his death was suggested on the record at September rules 1829. At October term 1829 (the process appearing to have been duly served on all the defendants, except one of the sureties, who was returned <em>no inhabitant) </em>the suit was dismissed by the plaintiff as to all the defendants, except <em>John Callaway </em>the surviving executor, and <em>Lucy Callaway. </em>Whereupon, the cause coming on for hearing \u201c upon the bill, answer of <em>Lucy Callaway, </em>exhibits, and the <em>subpoena </em>executed on <em>John Callaway,\u201d </em>the court ordered that one of its commissioners should take and report an account of the administration of <em>James Callaway's </em>estate. The commissioner\u2019s report stated, that under this order he had issued his notice to the parties, appointing the 25tb. of March 1830 for taking the account; on which day the plaintiff by her counsel attended: and that no evidence being adduced except the deposition of <em>Peter Saunders, </em>who testified that he had, at various times, paid to <em>John Callaway, </em>as one of the executors of <em>Jam.es Calla-way, </em>sums of money amounting to about 4800 dollars, towards the discharge of bonds executed for the purchase money of real property belonging to the testator\u2019s estate, and sold by the executors, \u2014 the commissioner, upon .this evidence, had debited <em>John Callaway </em>the executor with 4800 dollars, and credited him with 240 dollars commission on that amount, leaving a balance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>in the hands of the executor, due the estate of his testator, of 4560 dollars. It appeared that notice to the executor <em>John Callaway, </em>of the time and place of taking the deposition of <em>Peter Saunders, </em>had been given by publication for four successive weeks in a newspaper printed in the town of <em>Lynchburg.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-6\">The court of chancery, on the 14th of May 1831, approving the commissioner\u2019s report, decreed that the defendant <em>John Callaway </em>should pay to the plaintiff the sum of 2066 dollars 67 cents, with interest on 1666 dollars 67 cents, part thereof, from the 31st of December 1829 until paid, and costs; but the plaintiff was not to have the benefit of the decree, until she should execute to the said defendant a refunding bond in a penalty equal to double the amount decreed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-7\">In May 1832, <em>John Callaway </em>filed a bill in the circuit superiour court of law and chancery for the town of <em>Lynchburg, </em>against <em>Elizabeth Alexander </em>the plaintiff, and <em>Lucy Callaway </em>his codefendant, in the suit above mentioned, setting forth the proceedings in that suit, and that an execution had issued upon the decree, which had been levied on his property. The bill stated that the complainant was, at the time of the institution of the former suit, and ever since had been, an inhabitant of <em>North Carolina, </em>and when the process was served on him, was on a visit to <em>Virginia: </em>that shortly after the service of the process, he wrote to <em>Callohill Mennis </em>esquire, an attorney practising in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Lynchburg, </em>requesting him to attend to the suit for him, and to file his answer therein, which the complainant supposed could be done without his personal presence: that not having heard from mr. <em>Mennis, </em>nor learned the fact that he had died pending the suit, the complainant never doubted that his answer was filed and his business properly attended to, and therefore gave himself no farther trouble about the suit, of the state and progress of which he had no knowledge until he learned that a decree had been rendered against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>him: that had the complainant been apprised of mr. <em>Mennis's </em>death, or that he had failed to file the answer, or attend to the case, he would have employed other counsel: that, as the case was, he was wholly sented in the suit, and the decree was rendered against him by default: that he had no notice or knowledge, either of the taking the deposition of <em>Peter Saunders, </em>filed in the cause, or of the settlement before the commissioner; for though notices were published in the <em>Lynchburg </em>newspapers, yet the complainant, not taking any of those papers, never saw the notices: that if complainant had been present when the account was taken, he could have shewn that the money paid him by <em>Saunders </em>was duly applied to the payment of the testator\u2019s debts: that upon a full and fair settlement, the complainant would be found in advance to the estate, or indebted to a very small amount, if indebted at all: that claims against the estate were still outstanding, and if a particular claim of one <em>Langhorne, </em>which was in suit, should be recovered, the estate in complainant\u2019s hands would be wholly inadequate to the payment of the debts. Complainant further charged that the proceedings in the former suit were irregular, and that it was not competent to the plaintiff to dismiss her suit (in the actual state of the cause) as to some of the defendants, and forthwith take it up for hearing as to the others. Wherefore the bill prayed, that <em>Elizabeth Alexander </em>might be restrained from proceeding on the decree and execution aforesaid, until the matter could be heard in equity; that the injunction might be finally perpetuated; and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-4\">The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-5\">With his bill, the complainant exhibited his letter to <em>Callohill Mennis, </em>dated the 2d of September 1828; which contained <em>(inter alia) </em>the following instruction: \u201c There is a suit brought against the executors of <em>James Calla-way, </em>and their securities, in the superiour court of chan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>eery holden in <em>Lyn\u00f3hburg, </em>by <em>Elizabeth Alexander, </em>which you will attend to, and answer her bill.

The appellant cannot be entitled to relief after his gross neglect. The process was served upon him in June 1828; the bill being filed before the return day. The decree for account was not entered until October 1829; so that \u00a9 . he had 15 months to file his answer. His counsel could not file one for him. But it is said, an answer was not necessary; a defence before the commissioner was all that was necessary. Admit it: but how was the counsel to make this defence, unassisted by his client, and unsustained by a single voucher? The sickness or death of mr. <em>Mennis </em>was not then the true cause of the appellant\u2019s being undefended. Had he been in health, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>and before the commissioner, he could have made no defence for him, since it is not pretended that he was furnished with information or vouchers. It would be going farther than we have ever gone if a rehearing were awarded to a party who has so grossly neglected his defence. I consider the case as analogous to injunctions to judgments at law, alleged to have been obtained by accident or surprise; and I am not of opinion that the practice of the court would, when most loose, have justified an interference in a case like this. Averse as I am to too much rigour in the application of the rule which denies relief to a party who has neglected his defence, we should fall, I think, into the opposite error, if we were to indulge a party who has utterly neglected his case for three years, having in the whole course of that time neither seen or communicated with counsel, nor supplied him with a voucher or an account. And although it may be true that he never heard of the notices to take the account or the deposition, yet as he knew of the existence of the suit, it was his duty, either to enquire as to its progress, or to take that newspaper which was likely to give information. The provision of the act which declares such notices valid and sufficient would be altogether nugatory, if parties were after-wards permitted to deny notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">As to the form of this proceeding, I see no objection (see <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Aland, </em>3 P. Wms. 110.) and still less to the principle of the cases of <em>Erwin </em>v. <em>Vint, </em>6 Munf. 267. and <em>Kemp </em>v. <em>Squire, </em>1 Ves. sen. 206. Those cases appear to me to sustain the true principles of equity, which relieves against accident and surprise, and is more solicitous to come at justice between the parties than to adhere to a harsh and rigorous rule, which in very many instances subserves the views of the sharper, rather than make a grain of allowance for omission or neglect. In this case I am consoled by the hope that this ample estate was sufficient to pay the legacy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>testator\u2019s daughter, and that the appellant is in no danger of ultimate loss. At least he will merit it, if it be incurred. I am of opinion to affirm the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"AEl\">Brockenbrough, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"APb\">I concur in the opinion of the president.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The other judges concurring in the opinion that the decree should be affirmed, it was <em>affirmed </em>accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
