After which, it charged, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>defendant, in consideration of the injury done the plaintiff, \u201c promised to pay him whatsoever the same would reasonably amount to which it averred was \u00a3-; and that the defendant had notice of it; but refused to pay, to the plaintiff\u2019s damage \u00a3500.

That the declaration was not precise enough to constitute any specific charge ; or, if any, it was of a double aspect, and might be taken, indefinitely, upon the <em>tort, </em>or the <em>assumpsit. </em>That, if it was the first, the action was misconceived, as it should have been <em>tres</em>pass; and, if it was <em>assumpsit, </em>then the issue was immaterial, as it did not apply to the charge in the declaration, and consequently did not decide the question in controversy.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b492-12\">Pendleton, President.</author>\n<p id=\"AA5\">May not <em>tort </em>be a sufficient ground whereon to found <em>assumpsit f</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">By the appellant\u2019s counsel.
