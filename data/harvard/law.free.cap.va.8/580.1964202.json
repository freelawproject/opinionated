That the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>said <em>Daniel Morgan </em>and <em>Temperance </em>his wife, on the 15th of November, 1784, assigned the demised premises to the said <em>Stephen Self. </em>2.

Garner, William, Middleton.\u201d </em>To the introduction of which award, the defendant objected : <em>\u201c </em>Because it appeared in evidence (among other reasons) that bonds were entered into before the day of making the distress by the parties mutually to submit to the arbitration of <em>George Garner, </em>esq. and capt. <em>William Middleton, </em>and also because of the particular reasons set forth in such award of the parties aforesaid. Which said award was, by one of the arbitrators delivered to the said <em>John, </em>and by him, sometime after, returned to one of the referees, after the death of the otherbut that the objection was overruled by the court; <em>because, as one reason among others, the charges upon such account upon which the award was grounded was prior to the distress, although the award was subsequent. </em>The defendant <em>Turberville </em>also filed another bill of exceptions to the court\u2019s opinion, stating, that the plaintiff \u201c offered as a set off to the avowant\u2019s claim, for rent, a receipt of the avowant\u2019s for-libs of tobacco, which the avowant had received some years before to pay to a <em>certain-Smith, </em>in discharge of a bond of said <em>Self </em>due to said <em>Smith, </em>(it appearing to the court that <em>Self </em>was still liable to <em>Smith </em>for the said tobacco by a suit in court,) the defendant\u2019s attorney moved the court to prevent the said receipt from going to the jury as evidence; which motion was overruled by the court. And further the attorney for the defendant offered, a bond of the plaintiff\u2019s, given to <em>George Fairfax Lee, </em>for three or four thousand pounds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>tobacco, and assigned, as appeared on the back thereof, in 1785, to the avowant; notice of the assignment to the plaintiff, and the time when the assignment was made, not having been proven. And also a receipt of <em>John Augustine Washington </em>for a hhd. of tobacco, paid by the avowant on behalf of the plaintiff, for the use of the aforesaid <em>Smith, </em>as evidence to the jury; which the court refused.\u201d The record afterwards proceeds thus: \u201c <em>The jury then returned a verdict for twenty-four pounds sixteen shillings and eight pence one farthing damages, besides his costs by him about his suit in that behalf expended.

That there is no issue joined in the cause. 2. That the court admitted as evidence on the part of the said <em>Self, </em>an award, as an offset against your petitioner\u2019s demand. 3. That they refused to admit offsets of your petitioner to encounter those offered by the said <em>Self.\"</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-5\">On the 9th of April, 1794, the district court entered the following judgment: \u201cThis day came the parties, by their attornies, and thereupon the transcript of the record of the judgment aforesaid being seen and inspected, it seems to the court here, that there is no error in the said judgment. Therefore it is considered by the court, that the same be affirmed, and that the defendant recover against the plaintiff damages according to law for retarding the execution thereof, and his costs by him about his defence in this behalf expended.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-6\">To the latter judgment, <em>Turberville </em>petitioned for, and obtained, a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>from the court of appeals, assigning for error, 1. \u201c That no issue is joined in the cause.\u201d 2. \u201c That upon the plea of <em>owe nothing, </em>the plaintiff was permitted to give in evidence an award to offset your peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>tioner\u2019s claim of rent, whereas he is advised, that if the plaintiff had meant to avail himself of the benefit of that award, he should have pleaded it specially, and thereby given your petitioner an opportunity of impeaching it.\u201d 3. \u201c That the court refused to admit offsets of your petitioner to encounter those offered by the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b624-10\">Washington, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN33\">There was no issue joined in the cause, and therefore there could not have been a good trial: because every issue ought to be certain and single; should be joined upon the most material part of the cause; and contain an absolute affirmation upon one side, and an express negation on the other. But this did not occur in the present case; for the plea avers that eighty-five pounds, exclusive of interest, was arrear for rent; and the replication is that the plaintiff did not owe the money, at the time of the distress: so that the affirmation and negation do not meet each other. For it is not like an action of debt upon a note; because the declaration, in that case, affirms that the defendant owes the debt; and then the plea of <em>owe nothing </em>meets it expressly; which makes an issue without any <em>similiter </em>: but here the affirmation and negation not meeting each other, made a rejoinder necessary : which is the more obvious, as the record shews, that further pleading was intended; for the entry is, that there was <em>\u201cleave to amend the avowry at the costs of </em>Turberville.\u201d And yet the trial was precipitated immediately, without any waver of the right to amend. It is, therefore, impossible to consider this as a fair joinder of issue, and a consequent trial, agreeable to the mutual intention of parties. The award, in effect, contradicts the replication, and ought not to have been received in evidence to repel the defendant\u2019s claim to the rent. For it shews, that the accounts were not adjusted until seven months after the distress; and, consequently, it ought not to have been admitted to destroy a process, which was rightly begun, as it cannot be pretended, with any shew of reason, that the uncertain balance of so many conflicting claims arising out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>of transactions of fourteen years standing, and to the amount of largely upwards of two hundred pounds, could have been so clearly foreseen, as to have required the defendant to delay the pursuit of four years arrearage of rent, amounting <em>to </em>a much larger sum than the awarded balance, and upon which the arbitrators were not to pass by the express terms of the reference. But independent of that, the award, if it was intended to have been relied on, should have been pleaded, that the defendant might have had an opportunity of contesting it; especially, as it does not appear to have been formally delivered by the arbitrators; for, although it was put into the hands of the defendant by one of them, it was for inspection only, and was afterwards taken back, and never jointly delivered to either of the parties. The failure to plead it, therefore, was a surprize upon the defendant; who had no opportunity, for want of notice, to meet it with the proper objections. The defendant\u2019s offsets ought to have been allowed. 1. The bond; for it was the plaintiff\u2019s own bond, regularly assigned to the defendant, and therefore due to him; since the act of assembly treats it as his own property, and gave him an action of debt upon it. Consequently, it was a fair discount under the act of 1748, and the defendant had a right to apply it against the claims of the plaintiff, <em>Old Virginia laws, </em>249; for it was within the letter, as well as equity of the act: and notice of the assignment was not necessary upon the present occasion; for it was a debt due to the defendant without, and the only use of notice was to protect the plaintiff if he had paid the bond before he knew of the assignment; which was not pretended. 2. The receipt for the payment to <em>Smith; </em>because if the plaintiff owed the debt, and the defendant paid it, he was entitled to reimbursement, and might discount it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b625-7\">\n<em>Marshall, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApE\">There was no necessity for a replication, or any other formal act to constitute an issue : for the pleadings substantially amounted to a joinder, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>was sufficient. <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Tarpley, </em>1 Wash. 363. But, at worst, it was only a misjoinder, and cured by the verdict. The award was a proper discount under the act of assembly; for although it was made after the date of the process, the balance was a debt which existed, at the time of the distress ; for it was founded upon anterior transactions, and was due when the defendant distrained : which made it a just discount under the act; because it did not create a new debt, but only ascertained the amount of the prior obligation of the defendant. The objection, that the award was not delivered, is not sustainable. For the bill of exceptions states, that it was delivered to the defendant: not for his approbation; but as the concurrent act of the referees : and although the same arbitrator' afterwards took possession of it, that was to deliver it to the plaintiff, who exhibited it upon the trial. For as soon as it was signed, the power of the referees ceased, and they could make no alteration in it afterwards. There was no necessity to plead the award, as the defendant knew it existed; and, therefore, must have foreseen, that it would have been offered as a discount: so that if he had had any objections to make to it, he had full opportunity to prepare himself to sustain them; and as he offered none, the presumption is, that he had none to offer. The defendant had not a right to introduce his offsets. Not the bond; for the date of the assignment was not shewn : and it might have been procured, subsequent to the time of seizing the goods; but, in that case, it would not, by relation, have supported the distress; which was tortious in its inception, as the defendant had, at that time, no right to apply the amount of it, against the claims of the plaintiff; which exceeded it. Besides, there was no proof of the assignment offered; and, until that was done, the defendant shewed no title. Not <em>Washington\u2019s </em>receipt. For it was not shewn that the plaintiff still owed the debt to <em>Smith ; </em>much less, that he ever authorized the defendant to pay it: And the latter could not by making a voluntary payment, create an obligation upon the plaintiff to return him the money. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>But that is not all; for the date of the receipt is not shewn; and it appears, by the record, that so far from its operating a discharge to the plaintiff, <em>Smith </em>had actually a suit then depending against the plaintiff, to recover the money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b627-3\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b627-4\">Lyons, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AaL\">delivered the resolution of the court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The court thinks, that there was an issue substantially joined between the parties; and that the first point, made by the appellant\u2019s counsel, is settled by the case of <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Tarpley, </em>1 Wash. 363. For as to the leave to amend the avowry, it was probably waved, as there was no motion for a continuance, and the parties seem, voluntarily, to have gone to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The court is also of opinion, that the objection, made by the same counsel, to the county court\u2019s having received the award in evidence, is not sustainable. For, although the date of the award was posterior to <em>the time of the </em>distress, yet the items, upon which it was founded, were anterior; and the award only ascertained the amount of the balance in favour of the appellee: It was, therefore, a fair discount against the rent; and, consequently, proper evidence for a plaintiff <em>in replevin, </em>to repel the avowant\u2019s demand for rent, upon the trial of the cause. For no exception was taken to the validity of it, nor suggestion made, that it was, in any respect, unjust: which proves, that there was no other objection to the introduction of it to the jury, than what is stated in the record : and, that, the court thinks insufficient, for the reasons already given. Nor was there any occasion to plead the award, as the appellee knew it existed; and as he must have foreseen, that it would be offered as a discount, he ought to have been prepared to contest it, if he had any thing to alledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The refusal of the appellant\u2019s offsets was not error. For the act of assembly confines the right, of offering discounts, to the defendant in a suit, and does not extend to the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>in general cases, <em>Old Virginia laws, </em>249; which, in effect, excludes the avowant\u2019s claim to discount: For the plaintiff, in cases of <em>replevin, </em>is in fact the defendant, as he is put upon the same footing with the defendant in other actions, and may plead <em>\u201c </em>as many matters as he may think necessary for his defence,\u201d <em>Old Virginia laws, </em>172, 299; which gives him a right to offer his discounts, and excludes those of the avowant, who is turned into a plaintiff, <em>Bacon\u2019s Replevin, </em>A.; but not embraced in the statute of discounts, without notice. And it was, upon these distinctions, that I said just now, that the appellee\u2019s claims were proper evidence, to repel the avow-ant\u2019s demand, upon the present occasion. But the argument of the appellant\u2019s counsel goes to reverse the rule; and to allow the avowant, (who, as to the main subject in controversy, was, in fact, plaintiff,) to defeat his adversary; and, by an unexpected discount offered without notice, to obtain judgment for double rent. <em>Chan. Rev. </em>6. Which will scarcely be thought a fit case, for bringing the interpretation within the equity of the statute of discounts, as was contended for by that counsel; especially, when such an enormous distress was made; for it appears by the declaration, that seven slaves and twelve head of cattle were seized for eighty-five pounds current money only, although there were subsisting accounts between them, upon other subjects, then under arbitration, and which finally resulted in a balance in favour of the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">Such a proceeding does not call for an equitable construction of the statute of discounts in favour of landlords; who have already advantages enough over the tenant, without arming them with greater. For the landlord is his own judge, and executes his own judgment; which ought therefore to be precisely right; and not liable to controversy and deduction, with an impotent adversary, in a perilous suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">To prevent the tenant, in the present case, from exposing himself to the danger of double rent, the appellant ought to have given him notice of the bond, and of all his other claims, so that the tenant might have acted understandingly, and avoided the risk, by paying the rent, or such part of it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>if any, as was actually due. But this was not done; and therefore the court did right in rejecting the evidence. Otherwise, a landlord may, by concealing his claims, surprize the tenant, and obtain judgment for double rent, although the latter may, all the while, suppose he is acting fairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">But the evil does not stop there j for the principles, contended for by the avowant\u2019s counsel, would not only enable a landlord to recover his offsets by process of distress, but would expose the tenant to still greater hardships; for the offsets, by destroying the discounts, will leave him liable to judgment for the whole rent, to be doubled. But no man ought to be put to such hazard; especially as some may not be able to give security, and obtain redress in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">I mention these things to shew to what inconveniences the argument of the avowant\u2019s counsel would lead; and, although there is no proof that any thing, of that kind, was meditated on the present occasion, yet, in laying down a rule of practice, the court ought to take care, that no opportunity, for abuse, should be afforded.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">But, independent of what has been said, the offsets were properly rejected, upon the other grounds mentioned by the appellee\u2019s counsel; for neither the assignment of the bond, nor <em>Washington's </em>receipt, was proved ; without which the avowant could have no pretence to introduce them.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">It is not easy to conceive, why the offsets were not claimed before the arbitrators, as they might have been allowed there, if they could have been established; which might, possibly, have led to some adjustment, between the parties, upon equitable principles; but as that was not done, no relief can be granted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Upon the whole, the court thinks the judgment right; and that it ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>N. B. Mr. <em>Washington's </em>account of this case is very short, and affords little <em>information; </em>but the above report, extracted from Mr. <em>Marshall's </em>notes, shews it to' have been a very important decision, particularly as to the statutes of discount and replevin.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">It is remarkable, that although the county court, in fact, gave no judgment upon the verdict, the district court affirmed it, with the ten per cent, damages; and that the court of appeals did the same thing. Which probably arose from oversight, as it does not appear to have been mentioned by the counsel, on either side.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
