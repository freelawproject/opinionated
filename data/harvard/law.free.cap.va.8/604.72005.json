The action will only lie at the suit of the trustee.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-11\">After the decision by the court of appeals, in December 1825, of the case of <em>Poage </em>v. <em>Bell and others, </em>reported in 3 Rand. 586. <em>Samuel Clarke, </em>acting under the deed of trust made on the 7th of January 1817, by <em>Frederick Imboden </em>and wife to the said <em>Clarke </em>and <em>Dabney Shelton, </em>for the benefit of <em>William Poage, </em>proceeded on the '23d of September 1S26, after advertising according to the provisions of the deed, to sell the 20 acres of land therein described, and all the personal property embraced therein that he could find. The proceeds of this sale, amounting to 500 dollars, were applied as a credit against the debt due from <em>Imboden </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>to <em>Boage; </em>but there was a balance, it seemed, exceeding 3000 dollars, which still remained unsatisfied, Thereupon, on the 20th of April 1827, <em>Boage </em>brought an action of <em>assumpsit </em>against <em>James Bell, </em>to recover the proceeds of a wagon and team of five horses, which he insisted were embraced in the deed from <em>Imboden </em>to <em>Clarke </em>and <em>Shelton </em>for his benefit, and which he alleged had been sold by <em>Bell </em>with a fall knowledge of the claim thereto under that deed. Issues' were joined on the pleas of <em>non assumpsit </em>and <em>non assumpsit </em>within five years. At the trial, the plaintiff introduced a witness who proved that in the year 1819 he drove for <em>Imboden </em>a team with five horses, loaded with whiskey, from <em>Waynesborough </em>in the county of <em>Avgusta, </em>to the city of <em>Richmond; </em>that <em>Imboden </em>directed him to dispose of the whiskey and also of the wagon and team, and pay over the proceeds to the defendant <em>James Bell, </em>who was bound for him in some suretyship; that the witness reminded <em>Imboden </em>that the wagon and. team were covered by <em>Boage's </em>deed of trust, to which <em>Imboden </em>replied that ho <em>know </em>such to be the fact, but he would supply another team for <em>Poage </em>before he executed his trust; and that <em>Imboden </em>further instructed the witness, in the event of his failing <em>to </em>make a sale of the said property on his way to <em>Richmond, to </em>surrender up the wagon and team to <em>Bell </em>in <em>Richmond </em>to be sold, and pay to him the pro ceeds of the whiskey. The witness stated that he did not dispose of the wagon and team and whiskey on his way to <em>Richmond, </em>and upon his arrival there, the defendant <em>Bell, </em>who was then in <em>Richmond, </em>applied to him for the proceeds of the whiskey, which he paid to him, and also applied for the wagon and team. The witness stated that when this application was made, he asked <em>Bell </em>whether he was not apprized that the wagon and team were covered by <em>Boage's </em>deed of trust, upon which <em>Bell </em>replied that he was apprized of the fact, but that the money for which he was bound as surety for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>Imboden </em>must be immediately satisfied, and that either he or <em>Imboden </em>would supply another w\u00e1gon and team for <em>Poage\u2019s </em>deed to operate upon, by the time it was required. Thereupon the witness delivered <em>the </em>wagon and team to Bell, who sold the same, and applied to his own use the proceeds thereof, amounting to 675 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-3\">The counsel for the defend\u00e1nt read to the jury his answer in the former case, to prove that at the date of that answer, -he set up an adversary claim to the wagon and team, or its proceeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-4\">Upon this state of facts, the plaintiff contended that after the trustee <em>Clarice </em>had executed the deed of trust as far as he could, and after the defendant <em>Bell </em>had converted the wagon and team by a sale thereof, the right to the proceeds of the said wagon and team resulted to the plaintiff, precisely in the same way that it would have resulted in case the trustee <em>Clarice </em>had made sale and received the proceeds, and failed to pay to the plaintiff the balance due him. The defendant, on the other hand, contended that the action could not be maintained by the plaintiff, he being a mere <em>cestui que trust. </em>And so the circuit court of <em>Augusta </em>held, being of opinion that in a court of law the action was only maintainable by the plaintiff\u2019s trustee. To this opinion, and also to an opinion given by the circuit court as to the effect of the statute of limitations, the plaintiff filed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-5\">The jury having found a verdict for the defendant in conformity with the court\u2019s opinion, judgment was rendered thereupon, and <em>Poage </em>obtained a <em>supersedeas.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b626-6\"><em>Peyton, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b626-7\"><em>Johnson </em>and <em>Baldwin, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b626-8\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AG-\">In this case we are of opinion that there was no error in the opinion of the court instructing the jury that the action was not maintainable by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>plaintiff upon the case made by him, he being only a <em>cestui que trust, </em>but was only maintainable in a court of law by the plaintiff\u2019s trustee. Though an action has in many cases been entertained at law by a <em>cestui que trust </em>against his trustee, where the trust is no longer continuing, but is <em>functus officio, </em>and a balance is in the trustee\u2019s hands, yet we know no case in which an action has been maintained by a <em>cestui que trust </em>against a third person, who has either wrongfully converted the property of the trust to his own use, or has received the trust funds without paying them over. Apart from the technical objection that he only can maintain an action at law, who has the legal title, there is the vital objection that the trustee is bound to execute the trust in all regards, and in doing so the rights of other <em>cestuis que trust </em>may be involved, who are not and cannot be made parties to the suit. Thus in the case before us, an essential point in the plaintiff\u2019s case is the indebtedness of <em>Imboden </em>to him. But how is this matter to be tried, when <em>Imboden </em>is no party ? This shows the propriety of confining the <em>cestui que trust </em>to a court of equity, (when that jurisdiction is proper for him) where all persons interested may be made parties, and of requiring the action to be brought by the trustee, when the remedy is only at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The cases of <em>Garlands </em>v. <em>Jacobs &amp;c. 2 </em>Leigh 651. <em>Tolson </em>v. <em>Elwes, </em>1 Leigh 436, and <em>Burnett et al. </em>v. <em>Harwell et al. </em>3 Leigh 89, apply strongly to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Waiving a consideration of the instructions respecting the statute of limitations, we are of opinion to affirm the judgment on the other point, which goes to the foundation of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
