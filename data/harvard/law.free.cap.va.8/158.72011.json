On the 10th of October following, a patent was issued to <em>Charles Martin </em>for 400 acres in the same county; which included the greater part of the land previously granted to <em>Ilughley. Charles Martin </em>dying not long afterwards, devised the tract of 400 acres to his son <em>Spencer Martin. </em>Under this devise, <em>Spencer Martin </em>claimed the whole tract, and actually cleared and improved a part; but that part did not interfere with <em>Hughley,s </em>patent, nor (as it seemed) did <em>Spencer Martin </em>ever have the actual possession of any of the land which had been granted to <em>Ilughley, </em>until within a short time previous to the institution of this suit. Meanwhile <em>Ilughley </em>had left the state and become a resident of <em>Kentucky ; </em>where, hearing of the adverse claim to a part of the land included in his patent, he executed a deed constituting <em>Alexander Ilughley </em>his attorney to sue for and recover the land, or to sell the same, or to make any compromise respecting it which he might deem expedient. This power of attorney bears date the 3d of October 1818. <em>Alexander Ilughley, </em>as attorney in fact for <em>Charles Ilughley, </em>entered into an agreement with <em>Flowers, </em>by which the land patented to <em>Ilughley </em>was to be conveyed to <em>Flowers, </em>and <em>Flowers </em>was to refund the purchase money he had received from <em>Ilughley </em>for the assignment of his claim under the certificate of the commissioners, with interest thereon, and the expenses of surveying and patenting the land. In pursuance of this agreement (which was in substance a rescission of the contract made in 1786 between the parties, and was so considered by the court of appeals) <em>Flowers </em>paid the amount of the said purchase money, interest and expenses to <em>Alexander Ilughley, </em>and received from him a deed for the land, bearing date the 17th of October 1818. This deed purports to be an indenture between <em>Alexander Ilughley </em>attorney in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>fact for <em>Charles Hughley, </em>of the one part, and <em>Lambert Floioers </em>of the other part; witnessing, \u201cthat the said attorney in fact, <em>Alexander Hughley, </em>in consideration of 120 dollars, doth release and to the said <em>Lambert Flowers </em>doth quitclaim\u201d the same tract of 304 acres which was patented to <em>Charles Hughley; </em>.and concluding, \u201cIn testimony whereof the aforesaid <em>Charles Hughley </em>hath hereunto set his hand and seal.\u201d The signature, however, is \u201c <em>Alexander Hughley;\u201d </em>to which a scroll is annexed by way of seal. The deed was recorded on the 15th of March 1819, in the county court of <em>Harrison; </em>and moreover, <em>Spencer Martin </em>had actual notice of the deed, and of the agreement in pursuance of which it was executed. Nevertheless he procured from <em>Charles Hughley </em>a conveyance of the same tract of land which had been sold to <em>Flowers </em>by <em>Alexander Hughley; </em>and this conveyance, dated the 6th of July 1821, and purporting to be made in consideration of 80 dollars paid by <em>Martin, </em>was also recorded in <em>Harrison </em>county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-4\">In December 1821, <em>Flowers </em>exhibited a bill in the superiors court of chancery holden at <em>Clarhsburg, </em>against <em>Spencer Martin, Charles Hughley </em>and <em>Alexander Hughley, </em>setting forth the above facts; charging that <em>Martin </em>had full notice of plaintiff\u2019s purchase of the land from <em>Alexander Hughley </em>the attorney in fact of <em>Charles Hughley, </em>and had fraudulently combined with <em>Charles Hughley </em>to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s recovery thereof, by procuring a conveyance from the said <em>Charles Hughley, </em>anti taking and maintaining possession: and praying a decree for the recovery of the land or the value thereof, and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-5\"><em>Charles Hughley </em>and <em>Alexander Hughley </em>failed to answer the bill, and as to them it was taken <em>pro confesso.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-6\"><em>Martin </em>answered, denying notice of the plaintiff\u2019s prior purchase of the land; denying the fraud charged in the bill; insisting that he had a right to secure his title by the purchase of <em>Hughley\u2019s </em>interest; and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>tending that by the plaintiff\u2019s own shewing, he was the purchaser oi a <em>pretensed title. </em>.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ArF\">In May 1827 the cause came on to be heard; and the chancellor decreed that <em>Martin </em>convey, relinquish and release to the plaintiff the land in controversy, or so much thereof as he held at the commencement of the suit; that he be attached by his body until he should comply with the order; and that the marshal deliver possession of the land to the plaintiff. <em>Martin </em>appealed from the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-4\"><em>Johnson, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-5\"><em>W.

The first is that the court of chancery had no jurisdiction of the case; that if the appellee has any title to the land in controversy, it is a legal title, which ought to be enforced in a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The validity of this objection depends upon the force of the deed of the 17th of October 1818, executed by <em>Alexander Hughley to Lambert Flowers. </em>If it did not convey the legal title of <em>Charles Hughley, </em>the objection is without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">That deed purports to be a deed \u201c between <em>Alexander Hughley, </em>attorney in fact for <em>Charles Hughley, </em>of the one part, and <em>Lambert Flowers </em>of the other part.\u201d It witnesseth \u201c that the said attorney in fact, <em>Alexander Hughley, </em>for and in consideration &amp;c. doth release &amp;c.\u201d and concludes, \u201c In testimony whereof the said <em>Charles Hughley </em>hath hereunto set his hand and seal.\u201d It is then signed by \u201c <em>Alexander </em>Hughley,\u201d with a scroll annexed by way of seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">The legal title to land cannot pass from him who has it, but by his deed. Such deed may be executed by his attorney duly authorized for the purpose. But it must be so executed as to be the deed of the principal. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>is not sufficient, therefore, that it shall be executed by the person who was authorized to make it; but it must. be done by him as attorney. For this purpose it is necessary that the attorney shall either sign the name of the principal, with a seal annexed, stating it to be done by him as attorney for the principal; or he may sign his own name, with a seal annexed, stating it to be for the principal. In either of these forms, the deed becomes the deed of the principal; and if every thing else be correct, it conveys the title of the principal. But if the deed be signed and sealed by the attorney, neither in the name of the principal, nor in his own name as attorney for the principal, it is not the deed of the principal. This was decided as early as the 6th year of the reign of queen <em>Elizabeth </em>(Moore\u2019s Rep. 70.) and has been uniformly recognized ever since. ComSes\u2019s case, 9 Co. Rep. 75. 4 Bac. Abr. Leases. I. pl. 10. p. 140. <em>Frontin </em>v. <em>Small, 2 </em>Ld. Raym. 1418. <em>White </em>v. <em>Cuyler, </em>6 Term Rep. 176. Similar decisions have been made in the courts of <em>Massachusetts </em>and of <em>New York, </em>and also in the supreme court of the <em>United, States. </em>I would refer particularly to the case of <em>Lessee of Clarke et al. </em>v. <em>Courtney et al. </em>5 Peters 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The deed in this case, having been signed and sealed in the individual name of <em>Alexander Hughley, </em>is not the deed of <em>Charles Hughley, </em>and therefore did not convey his title to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">But although the deed did not pass the legal title, it is evidence of a contract on the part of <em>Charles Hughley, </em>by his attorney, to convey the land to the appellee, and gives an equitable right to call for the legal title. And as the subsequent conveyance of the land, by \u25a0 <em>Charles Hughley </em>to <em>Martin, </em>was made with full knowledge on the part of <em>Martin </em>of the previous contract with <em>Flowers, </em>it cannot impair the equity of <em>Flowers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">It is contended however, in the second place, that this contract was in violation of the act against conveying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>or taking pretensed \"titles, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 103. p. 375. I cannot think so. <em>Flowers </em>and <em>Hughley, </em>before this contract, held towards each other the relation of vendor and vendee; for <em>Flowers </em>had previously sold the land to <em>Hughley. </em>When <em>Martin </em>set up an adversary claim to a part of the land, under his patent, <em>Flowers </em>apprehended that in case <em>Hughley </em>should lose any portion of the land, an effort would be made to make him liable for it. Thus situated, it was proposed that he should lake back the land, repaying the purchase money, interest and costs, and probably some small amount in addition. These terms were acceded to; and although, in executing them, it became necessary to take a conveyance from <em>Hughley, </em>the transaction was, in substance, a rescission of a former sale, rather than the purchase of a pretensed title. It did not tend to increase or encourage litigation; for, if the purchase had not been rescinded, <em>Hughley </em>would have sued <em>Martin, </em>or <em>Martin </em>would have sued <em>Hughley; </em>in either of which cases <em>Flowers </em>would have been substantially a party, in consequence of his obligation to defend the title of <em>Hughley; </em>and if <em>Martin </em>had been successful in that controversy, it would have been the ground of another suit by <em>Hughley </em>against <em>Floivers. </em>Whereas, under the new arrangement, <em>Flowers </em>became the nominal as well as the substantial party, and one suit terminates the whole controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">I am of opinion to affirm the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b183-6\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ah8\">Upon the authorities, I concur in the opinion that the deed from <em>Hughley </em>to <em>Flowers </em>did not convey the legal title: and am for affirming the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b183-7\">Brockenbrough, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArBZ\">I concur entirely in the opi- \u25a0 nion delivered by judge <em>Cabell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
