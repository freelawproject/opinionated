The condition of the bond again styled him \u201c Executor of <em>William Browne </em>deceased,\u201d and was in the usual way for payment of half the sum mentioned in the penalty, upon the 1st of January, 1789. The bond was signed \u201c <em>William </em>Browne;\u201d and the declaration was as follows: \u201cDa<em>vid Ross &amp;f Company </em>complain of <em>William Browne </em>in custody, &amp;c. of a plea that he render to them four hundred and ninety-six pounds nineteen shillings and ten pence, which to them he owes and from them unjustly detains; for that whereas the said defendant, on the 17th day of December, 1787, at the parish of Southwark, in the county aforesaid, by his certain writing obligatory sealed with his seal, and to the court now here shewn, the date whereof is the same day and year, acknowledged himself to be held and firmly bound unto the said plaintiffs in the just and full sum of four hundred and ninety-six pounds nineteen shillings and ten pence, to be paid unto the said plaintiffs on or before the first day of January, 1789. Yet the said defendant, although often required, &amp;c.\u201d There was no oyer of the bond; but the appearance bail pleaded that the defendant had paid the debt in the declaration mentioned, and the plaintiffs took issue. Upon the trial of the cause, the defendant objected that the bond did not agree with the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>claration; and therefore ought not to be received as evidence; but the objection being overruled, he filed a bill of exceptions to the court\u2019s opinion, and appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A1f\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8P\">It is a general rule that variance between the declaration and the evidence offered in support of it, is fatal, 1. Because it tends to mislead the defendant. For, if he comes prepared to encounter one charge, and another is suffered to be brought against him, he is necessarily subject to surprize. <em>2. </em>Because it is the constant object of the law, that the judgment shall settle all disputes relative to the subject for which the action is brought; and therefore, the pleadings ought to be so framed as to preclude future controversies respecting it. In the present case, however, the penalty, (which contains no day of payment,) was due presently ; but the declaration states it to be payable at a future day ; and therefore, the <em>allegata </em>and <em>probata </em>do not agree. The difficulty is not' removed by the condition; for, there is no reference to the latter in the declaration; nor is <em>oyer </em>prayed. It stands, then, upon the penalty only, which is payable immediately, and not at a future day. Consequently, the variance between the declaration and the evidence is clear; and therefore, the judgment cannot be sustained. <em>Cowp. </em>766, 769, 178. <em>Dougl. </em>640, 644.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-9\">\n<em>Campbell, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1r\">There is a profert of the bond; which incorporates it into the declaration and supersedes the necessity of <em>oyer. </em>For, as the act of assembly directs that the penalty shall be discharged by the sum in the condition, with interest and costs, the court is obliged, although the defendant does not call for it, to look into the bond to ascertain the amount to be paid; which necessarily unfolds the period of payment. Besides, the day of payment in the condition, is, in fact, the day when the penalty becomes forfeited; and therefore, the declaration states it rightly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-10\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Pendleton, President,</author>\n<p id=\"A33\">delivered the resolution of the court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">The judges are of opinion, that the variance contended for on behalf of the appellant is not fatal. The declaration is, indeed, new, and the court does not recollect to have seen one like it before: But, yet they cannot, when all the circumstances are considered, decide that it excludes the evidence. For, in the first place, if the defendant had, in fact, paid the debt, and wished to avail himself of it, he ought, according to the strictness of pleading, to have craved <em>oyer </em>of the bond, and pleaded payment of the sum in the condition; which would have made the bond part of the declaration, and shewn the day when it became payable. But the effect is similar as the case stands ; for the object of <em>oyer </em>is only to identify the instrument; and, when the defendant pleads to the bond referred to in the profert, he admits it to be the same with that described in the declaration; which answers the purpose of identity full as well as <em>oyer, </em>and precludes exception upon the ground of variance, at the trial. In the next place, it is to be observed, that the plea is payment generally, without specifying either time or sum. But, as it is obvious that he meant the principal and not the penalty, the indefinite plea should be referred to the condition; which discloses the period when the money was to be paid, and, by fixing the time when the penalty was forfeited, ascertains the day when that became payable. The judgment, therefore, is to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
