Nevertheless, the said <em>Philip </em>and <em>Presley, </em>in their livestime, or the said defendants, (who are executors of the respective wills of the said <em>Philip </em>and <em>Presley, </em>as aforesaid,) since their respective deaths, although often required, have not, nor hath either of them entered into bond jointly and severally, with the said <em>Benjamin Grymes, </em>with condition for payment of the said four thousand and eighteen pounds four shillings and eleven pence, to the said <em>John Robinson, </em>in his lifetime, or to the said plaintiffs, to whom, with <em>Peter Randolph, </em>esq., since deceased, administration of the estate of the said <em>John 'Robinson, </em>with his will annexed, hath been, in due form, committed, since his death; nor hath the said <em>Philip </em>and <em>Presley, </em>or the said defendants, or the said <em>Benjamin Grymes, </em>paid any part of the said sum of money, but such bond to enter into, and payment to make, have altogether refused, and the defendants still do refuse in delay of the execution of the will of the said <em>John </em>Robinson, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>to the damage of the said plaintiffs six thousand pounds, and thereof they bring suit, Sec., and bring into court their letters 0f administration, Sec.\u201d The record, immediately afterwards, thus: \u201cWhereupon came the said defendants, by their attorney, and thereupon came also a jury of the bystanders, to wit, Sec.\u201d Who found a verdict for the plaintiffs for <em>\u00a3 </em>2700 with interest upon several parts of it from several days. And thereupon the record states that the parties agreed that four gentlemen, (naming them,) or any two, or more, of them, should \u201cstate and settle an account of the several payments that have been made in discharge of the said damages and make report thereof to the court, and that judgment be entered, in this suit, for what shall be reported due by them ; and the same is ordered accordingly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AR\">The cause was continued from court to court, <em>\u201cfor the said referees to return their </em>report,\u201d until March 1779, when the record proceeds thus, \u201c at which day, carne, as well the plaintiffs aforesaid, as the defendants <em>John Taylor </em>and <em>Francis Thornton, </em>by their attornies, and the former rule in this cause not being complied with, on the motion of the plaintiffs, It is ordered that the persons therein named do perform the same, at Williamsburg, on the fifteenth day of September next, <em>ex parte, </em>in case either party shall fail to attend them.\u201d And the cause was continued until the October court following; when the record proceeds thus, <em>\u201c </em>at which day came, as well the plaintiffs as the defendants, <em>John Robinson </em>and <em>Francis Thornton, </em>by their attornies, the other defendants <em>Peyton Randolph, Benjamin Grymes </em>and <em>John Taylor, </em>being dead, and this suit, as to them, abated, and the former order, in this cause, not being complied with, is, on the motion of the plaintiffs, set aside, and thereupon it is considered, by the court, that the plaintiffs recover against the surviving defendants, two thousand seven hundred pounds, with interest upon one thousand and twenty-five pounds, part thereof to be computed after the rate of five per centum per annum, from the seventeenth day of June 1757, on one thousand six hundred pounds other part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>thereof, from the twenty-third day of July in the same year, and on seventy-five pounds the residue, from the first day of August in the same year, the damages in form aforesaid assessed, and their costs by them about their suit in this behalf expended, to be levied of the goods and chattels of the said <em>Philip Grymes </em>and <em>Presley Thornton, </em>in the hands of the said defendants to be administered, if so much thereof they have ; but if not then the costs to be levied of their .own proper goods and chattels, and the said defendants in mercy, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-4\">The judgment was afterwards revived by a writ of <em>scire facias; </em>and, on the 8th of November, 1785, a writ of error was awarded by the court of appeals to the original judgment in October 1779.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-5\">Several attempts appear by the record to have been made to establish, that there had been a plea filed in the suit, which had been, according to the loose practice of the day, and the subsequent confusion during the revolution, whereby the minute book and rule books had perished, been lost: But nothing satisfactory was obtained, after a strict scrutiny. And, therefore, the cause came on to be heard in the court of appeals, without any evidence of a plea, if one ever was, in fact, filed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b173-6\"><em>Randolph, </em>attorney general, for the plaintiffs in error contended</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aeb\">That the judgment was erroneous, 1.

That there was no misjoinder of defendants; for the undertaking was joint and several, and different judgments might be rendered against the defendants separately: which was the constant course in this country, even upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>bonds, where the writ was served upon the defendants at different times; for, in such cases, the course is to render flnal judgment against him that is brought before the court, and successively against the rest as they happen to be served. That this indeed was not the English practice, but custom had sanctified it here. That he himself had found the practice of a joint suit, against the representatives of several deceased persons, established, on his coming to the bar; and had practised on it ever since, whenever the undertaking was joint and several, and the representatives ultimately, liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-5\"><em>The </em>following judgment was this day rendered <em>by the </em>court of appeals in the cause, \u201c The court having maturely considered the transcript of the record and the arguments of counsel, on both sides, are of opinion, that the said judgment is erroneous. Therefore, it is considered by the court that the same be reversed and annulled. Which is ordered to be certified to the said general court.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\"><em>Memorandum. </em>\u2014 The precise grounds of the judgment of the court of appeals in this case, are not known further, than what was said by judge <em>Mercer, </em>in the case of <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Watkins, 3 </em>Call, who says, that the court held, that the representatives of two deceased persons could not be joined in the same action. But, as, in a bill in equity, which was afterwards brought upon the same contract, the plaintiffs say, that there were various errors assumed, (these <em>do not appear in the record, for the assignment of errors is lost,) </em>which the plaintiffs are bound to consider as legal objections, since they were so adjudged by the court, although some of them were occasioned by the derangements and loss of papers in the time of the British invasion, it is probable that the court went upon the want of an issue also.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
