An appellate <em>court cannot </em>say that the plea was improperly received.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b552-11\">A defendant is not \u00bfinhibited from pleading specially what he might give in evidence under the general issue, unless the matter pleaded amounts to the general issue, that is to say, denies the allegations which the plaintiff is bound to prove.

On the premises there were, at the time of the lease, a grist mill and carding machine, which during the term were consumed by fire, either accidentally, or by some unknown, incendiary. Held, the contract, according to its fair meaning, could not be considered as binding the tenant to rebuild.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-14\"><em>Assumpsit </em>in the circuit court of <em>Roclcingham, </em>by <em>John Maggort </em>against <em>Emanuel TIansbarger. </em>The declaration contained four counts. The first, third and fourth set forth the contract alike. It was alleged in each of these counts, that on the 20th of February 1830, by a written contract not under seal, the plaintiff leased to the defendant a lot or parcel of land on <em>Shenandoah </em>river in the county of <em>Rockingham, </em>with all the appurtenances thereunto belonging, and granted to the defendant the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>full and entire possession of the said lot with all the houses and machinery belonging thereto (the machinery consisting of a grist mill, a saw mill and a carding machine, and their appurtenances) and the use and profit arising therefrom, for the term of four years; that it was agreed the defendant should have the privilege of building and making any improvements which should be necessary to keep the machinery in operation, and any other improvements that he might deem necessary to enhance the value of the lot; and that the defendant, in consideration of the premises, agreed to pay the plaintiff' <em>22 </em>dollars a year for each of the four years, and further agreed, at the expiration of the four years, to return the said property to the plaintiff' with all of its appurtenances, the plaintiff' first paying the defendant for all the improvements which he might have made on the premises during the term, except for repairs made to the saw mill, grist mill and carding machine, for which last mentioned repairs the plaintiff should not be bound to pay. The first count alleged, as breaches of the contract, that the defendant had not paid to the plaintiff the sum of <em>22 </em>dollars a year for the four years, and had not returned to the plaintiff\u2019 the said property with all its appurtenances, but had failed to do so in this, that he had not returned to the plaintiff the lot or parcel of laud with the said grist mill and carding machine thereon, and their appurtenances, and had not returned the said lot or parcel of land to the plaintiff with any other grist mill or carding machine. The third count stated the breaches like the first; but after setting forth the contract, and before stating the breaches, contained an averment that thcie were no improvements made by the defendant on the premises during the term, for which the plaintiff by his contract was bound to pay any thing to the defendant. The fourth count averred that after the expiration of the four years, the plaintiff would have paid the defendant for all the improvements which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>had made on the premises during the term, and for which the defendant <em>by his </em>contract was entitled to receive any thing, but that the said defendant, after the expiration of the four years, discharged the plaintiff from paying for the same. The breaches were then stated as in the first count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-3\">The second count did not state the contract to be in writing, but in other respects set forth the contract like the first, as far as the statement that the defendant had agreed to pay the plaintiff <em>22 </em>dollars a year for each of the four years; and then, after so stating the agreement to pay the <em>22 </em>dollars, it alleged that it was agreed that the defendant should not charge the plaintiff any interest, for the said four years, on the sum of 800 dollars, which was then due and owing by the plaintiff to the defendant, and for the securing of which the plaintiff had before that time executed, for the benefit of the defendant, a deed of trust upon the said lot with its appurtenances, and that the defendant, during the four years, should not exact, demand or receive of the plaintiff the said 800 dollars or any part thereof. The agreement to return the property with its appurtenances was stated as in the first count; and it was averred to have been agreed that <em>the contract </em>should by no means affect the said deed of trust which the defendant then held upon the property, in any shape or form, except that the defendant should not enforce the deed of trust until the expiration of the lease. The breaches alleged were, that the defendant had not paid the plaintiff the sum of <em>22 </em>dollars a year for each of the four years; that the said defendant did, during the four years, demand and receive of the plaintiff the said 800 dollars, and by so doing charged the plaintiff interest on that sum, after the \u2014\u2014 day of-, until the expiration of the four years, by reason whereof the defendant became liable to pay the plaintiff the amount of the said interest, upon the expiration of the four years; that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>defendant nevertheless had not paid the said interest; and that the defendant had not returned to the plaintiff the said property with all of its appurtenances, but had failed to do so, in the manner mentioned in the first . count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-8\">The declaration having been filed at September rules 1834, the common order stood confirmed at the October rules; and the term of the court being in the same month, the defendant at that term pleaded the general issue. At October term 1835, the defendant filed a general demurrer to the whole declaration, and a general demurrer also to each count thereof, in which demurrers the plaintiff joined. The defendant also tendered two special pleas, which were objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel; but the court overruled the objection, and allowed them to be filed. By one, the defendant pleaded that after the several sums of <em>22 </em>dollars fell due, and before the institution of' this suit, he paid the same to the plaintiff In the same plea he averred that the several written contracts mentioned in the different counts of the declaration were one and the same contract, and the several lots or parcels of land mentioned in the different counts were one and the same lot or parcel of <em>land; </em>and lie pleaded that fie did, at the expiration of the four years, return to the plaintiff the said lot or parcel of land with the appurtenances, except the grist mill, saw mill and carding machine, which, during the term, were accidentally consumed by lire. The plea contained a further averment that the sum of 800 dollars mentioned in the declaration was voluntarily paid by the plaintiff The other special plea was like the first, except that in lieu of the words \u201c accidentally consumed by fire,\u201d were inserted these words, <em>\u201c </em>by some incendiary unknown to the defendant, destroyed and consumed by means of fire.\u201d To each of these special pleas the plaintiff demurred generally, and the defendant joined in the demurrers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AUc\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Upon argument of the demurrers, the circuit court overruled the demurrers to the declaration and to the several counts thereof; but it overruled also the plaintiff\u2019s demurrers to the defendant\u2019s special pleas, being of opinion that those pleas were sufficient to bar the plaintiff from maintaining his action. Final judgment was thereupon entered, that the plaintiff take nothing by his bill, and that the defendant recover against him his eosts. To this judgment a <em>supersedeas </em>was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b556-4\"><em>Peyton, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b556-5\"><em>Baldwin, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b556-6\">Parker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AZ9\">I shall first consider the last question raised in this case, because it goes to the foundation of the action, and is one of some interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The plaintiff in the court below alleges that he leased to the defendant a certain lot or parcel of land with all the appurtenances thereto belonging, consisting of a grist mill, a saw mill and a carding machine, with their appurtenances, for the term of four years; that the defendant should have <em>the privilege </em>of building or making any improvements' necessary to keep the said machinery in operation; that in consideration thereof he had agreed to pay a certain rent, and at the expiration of the term, \u201c to return the said property with all its appurtenances.\u201d The grist mill, saw mill and carding machine were consumed (accidentally or by some unknown incendiary) by fire; and the question is whether, under the terms of this agreement, the defendant was bound to rebuild the premises, and return them as he received them. There is no covenant to repair, or to deliver the demised premises in good order, or in the same order as he received them; but simply a covenant or agreement to return the property with its appurtenances. It is therefore distinguishable from <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Overton, </em>3 Call 309. <em>S. C. 2 </em>Hen. &amp; Munf. 408. <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Dommitt, </em>6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>T. R. 650. <em>Brecknock Navigation Company </em>v. <em>Pritchard, </em>Id. 750. <em>Digby </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>4 Camp. 275. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>16 Mass. Rep. 238. <em>Earl of Chesterfield </em>v. <em>Duke of Bolton, </em>Com. Rep. 627. and from every other case that has been or can. be cited. In all of them, there were express covenants to keep in repair during the term, or-to deliver the property at the expiration thereof in good order or good tenantable repair, and not merely to deliver it with its appurtenances : and even where there were such express covenants to repair, it has seejped to some a strained and doubtful construction to expend them to the case of rebuilding. <em>Iloss </em>v. <em>Overton </em>was considered at the time a doubtful case, although <em>Ross </em>had expressly covenanted to deliver the mill and other improvements \u201c at the expiration of the said term of seven years, in proper tenantable repair.\u201d And in <em>Pollard </em>v. <em>Shaaffer, 1 </em>Dallas 210. it was held by <em>M\u2019Kean, </em>C. J. delivering a learned and able opinion of the supreme court of <em>Pennsylvania </em>(which I do not mean, however, to be understood as approving or disapproving) that a covenant to repair, and to deliver the premises in good order and repair, did not bind the tenant to repair the premises, which had been wasted and destroyed by the british troops.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">'.Hiere arc strong considerations that would render me averse to extending the doctrine of the tenant\u2019s liability in any degree beyond the decided cases. Such a risque is scarcely ever contemplated by either party, and the tenant receives no premium for the insurance. Were he asked, at the time of making a contract and giving a fair rent for the property, \u201c do you mean, if it is destroyed by fire or tempest, to rebuild or repair it ?\u201d lie would be startled at the bare question : and the landlord himself, to the same enquiry, would unquestionably answer that he expected nothing so unreasonable. To bind him to something so unequal, and so contrary to the obligations imposed upon him by the common law, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>think his covenant ought to be special and express, and so clear as to leave no doubt that he intended to take this duty or charge upon himself. Nothing should be left to vague inferences or doubtful construction.</p>\n<p id=\"AvY\">Taking these principles as our guide (which might be sustained by many authorities, if any thing so reasonable required to be thus sustained) let us look at this agreement, as the plaintiff himself states it.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The tenant was not bound at any time to repair, although he had the privilege, at his own costs and charges, of building or making any improvements to keep the machinery in operation ; and at the end of the term, he was to return the property with all its appurtenances. Is this any thing more than the usual covenant to be found in leases, to provide against the tenant\u2019s holding over ? If the agreement was simply to return the property, there could be no doubt about its meaning; but some difficult}* seems to be produced by the expression \u201c with all its appurtenances.\u201d These I regard as mere words of form, generally used in all conveyances of land and in covenants relating to land, but importing no more than what the law would imply, to wit, that the lot, and every thing belonging to it, should, at the end of the term, be returned. It is plain to my mind that the parties did not, by the'use of these words, intend to create a duty or charge of this onerous nature. It would be a strained construction to give them that meaning, when'they admit another obvious interpretation, consonant to common usage. The lot and all its appurtenances, on the day limited for the surrender, are to be returned; but as to losses by fire or other accident, the burthen of them must be borne by him who has in clear and express terms contracted to bear them, or by him on whom the law imposes the obligation. In <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Nicholas, </em>5 Munf. 483. the covenant was to return the slave well clothed on the 25th of December: and if the mere-words had been re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>garded, without looking to the intention of the parties, the defendant was bound to return him at all events, or pay his value. But the court said, that if the covenant stated in the declaration could be considered a covenant to return the negro in question, it ought not to be considered as a covenant to <em>insure </em>such return, in the event which had happened; especially under the usage and understanding of this country in relation to the subject. So here, if the agreement is one to return the lot and all its appurtenances at any time existing, it ought <em>not to be </em>considered, under the usage and understanding of the country, as a contract of insurance, for which no premium or consideration has been paid. What thfe parties looked to was the return, in opposition to <em>holding over, </em>\u2014 -not to the hazards of fire or oilier casualty. I arn therefore of opinion that the demurrers to the pleas ought not to have been sustained on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The other questions, which relate principally to the forms of pleading or to rules of practice, may be dispatched in fewer words.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The first objection is that the court ought not to have received the pleas at the time they were <em>offered; </em>first, because it was after the issue had been made up on the plea of <em>non assumpsit; </em>and secondly, because the matters alleged in them might have been given in evidence under the general issue. No exception to the court\u2019s opinion is taken, so as to enable us to judge whether it exercised the sound discretion which it undoubtedly possesses, to admit or reject a special plea at any time before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">This court is bound to presume that the circumstances appearing to the court below, justified its admission of the pleas, unless the contrary is shewn. As to the other objection, I know of no rule which inhibits the party <em>from </em>pleading specially what he might give in evidence under the general Issue, unless the matter pleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>amounts to the general issue, that is to' say, denies the allegations which the plaintiff is bound to prove. But where the cause of action is avoided by matter <em>ex post facto, </em>it may always be specially pleaded, whether it could be given in evidence under the general issue or not. Thus in an action of debt, the defendant <em>may </em>plead infancy and other matters specially, as well as <em>nil debet; </em>and in <em>assumpsit, may </em>plead infancy, lunacy or coverture when the contract was made, or illegality of consideration, as usury or gaming, or that the contract was not in writing, and so void by the statute of frauds ; although all these defences might be made under the general issue. 1 Chitty\u2019s Pleading 557, 558, 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">It is next objected that the pleas embrace several distinct and substantive facts; but as they make but one defence, and answer the whole declaration, it is enough: and besides, the irregularity could only be taken advantage of by special demurrer. They profess to set up a defence to all the written contracts stated in the several counts, , averring the several written contracts to be the same; whereas, it is said, the contract set out in the second count is not declared on as a contract in writing. By intendment of law, the contract, being for a. lease for four years, was a written one, and the defendant might treat it as <em>such; </em>and it was <em>for </em>the benefit of the lessor that he should so treat it. But in any event, this form of pleading contained no substantial defect, either in alleging the contracts to be the same, or that they were in writing; and it would only be objectionable on special demurrer. 1 Chitty\u2019s Pleading 587, <em>3 Id. </em>1104. <em>in notis. </em>The pleas answer all the matter stated in the second count, and all and something more than the matters contained in the other counts. They are to be taken distributively, as pleas to each count; and in respect to the first, third and fourth counts, they contain matter which is mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Again, it is said the pleas do not aver the payment of the rent and interest, but simply of the rent itself. The declaration avers the nonpayment of the 22 dollars a year for four years, and the defendant says he paid it. If the declaration claims interest by this general aver-meat, the defendant says he has paid interest, for he uses the same general terms; and this is sufficient, without considering the effect of the act of assembly which declares that interest shall hereafter be allowed on rent in arrear.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">As to the lessor\u2019s payment of the 800 dollars he was allowed to retain without interest until the end of the term, as a part of the consideration of the lease, it being a voluntary payment, I do not see how the defendant was bound, either in law or morals, to constitute himself a borrower, and pay interest for the loan. If be ha.d subsequently <em>expressly </em>promised to pay this interest, as <em>Willing </em>did the released debt, in the case of <em>Willing v. </em>Peters, 12 Serg. &amp; Rawle 177. the previous contract to suflbr the principal sum to remain in the lessor\u2019s hands without Interest, as a part of the rent, <em>might have been </em>a sufficient consideration, and have made the promise binding: but on that point it is not necessary to express an opinion. Besides, the breach alleged in the declaration is for demanding and receiving the 800 dollars, which the plaintiff says was in eifbet charging him with interest: to which the allegation of a voluntary payment seems to be a sufficient answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The remaining objection is that the court, upon overruling the demurrers, ought not to have given a peremptory judgment. The plaintiff' did not ask for permission to withdraw his demurrers. He chose to abide by them; and the pleas offering a substantial defence, the court had no other alternative than to give judgment for the defendant. Stephen on Pleading 176. 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">For these reasons, I am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The other judges concurring, judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
