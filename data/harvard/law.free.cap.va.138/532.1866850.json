High street is ninety-three feet wide, and from the southern building line to the southern rail of the westbound track is forty-four feet. The street is level, the vision unobstructed for several squares, and there was no interfering street traffic at the time of the collision. The speed of the street ear was fixed at thirty miles per hour by one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses who was driving his automobile alongside of it just before it reached the Washington street intersection, who then observed his own speedometer. The speed of the plaintiff\u2019s automobile is by him fixed at seven or eight miles an hour, and he could have stopped it within five feet. That the plaintiff \u2022could and should have seen the rapidly approaching street ear as soon as he passed the building line of High street, forty-four feet before he reached the point of the \u2022collision, is manifest. His testimony as to when he .actually saw it, however, is not clear. He says that he \u2022did not see it until he \u201cventured across the street,\u201d and bhen he \u201csaw it about the parsonage, which was about 140 feet away.\u201d It is shown that this parsonage is actually 200 feet east of the place referred to. He says also that he was \u201cpractically one-third across the street,\u201d and that when he got to the sidewalk he looked -up and down High street, admits that the approaching \u2022car was then within his line of vision, and then follow a :number of statements which cannot be'reconciled, as that it was then 140 or 150 feet away, that it was the \u25a0same distance away when he was about to cross the southern rail of the eastbound track, that he was there .before he noticed the street car, -that he \u201cnoticed it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>right along. Of course, I saw the street car coming-right along,\u201d that he knew it was coming \u201cat speed,\u201d and that he made no effort to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">It seems to us perfectly clear from -this testimony that certainly he saw and realized the rapid approach of the car before he reached the first rail of the eastbound track, and if this is not true, then his failure to observe it constitutes negligence which bars his recovery. It is equally apparent that if at that time the street car was 140 feet or more away there would have been no collision, because it would have been physically impossible for the street car to traverse the intervening distance-within the few seconds which would have been required for the plaintiff to cross the tracks in safety. \u2022 The streetcar, therefore, must have been very much closer at that time, and the concurring negligence of the plaintiff, either in failing to look in time, or in failing to stop, or in failing to turn his automobile either to right or left, contributed to the collision and bars any recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">This ease is controlled by the principles stated in these cases: <em>Va.
