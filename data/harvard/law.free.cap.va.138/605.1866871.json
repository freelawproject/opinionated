The jury are instructed that under the consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>tution of the Virginia league of professional baseball clubs no member club can be legally expelled or its franchise forfeited except by the board of directors of said league after notice to such member club and opportunity for such member club to defend itself. * *\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b649-5\"><em>Cutchins &amp; Cutchins </em>and <em>Meredith &amp; Meredith, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b649-6\"><em>B.

Is this a case which, under the provisions of section 4 of the constitution of the league, the board of directors of the league were required to try?</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">The question must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">Upon the facts appearing from the evidence, without any conflict therein, the requirement contained in the resolution, adopted at the Suffolk meeting, that \u201cat the next meeting each club post a forfeit of $2,000.00\u201d was a \u201clawful requirement\u201d of the league within the meaning of subsection 8 of section 3 of the constitution of the league. The plaintiff and his club, a member of the league, failed and refused to comply with that requirement. As expressly provided in such subsection, such failure or refusal terminated the membership of the plaintiff\u2019s club in the league.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">As expressly provided in section 4 of the constitution of the league, when at the Norfolk meeting the plaintiff and his club were charged with the default just mentioned, by the resolution offered by the Wilson, N. C., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>club, the president had the duty imposed upon him of ascertaining \u201cwhether any dispute exists (existed)\u201d as to the fact of such default; it was only in case such fact was \u201cdisputed\u201d that the board of directors were required to try the case; under the constitution of the league, the plaintiff was not entitled to have the case tried by anyone when the fact of his alleged default was not disputed; and it appears from the evidence, without any conflict therein, that the president by his said \u2019phone talk with the plaintiff discharged the duty imposed upon him as aforesaid, and ascertained, as required by the constitution, that the default in question was a fact which was not disputed. Therefore, according to the constitution of the league, by which the plaintiff and his club, as a member of the league, were bound, as by contract, the plaintiff had no right to a trial by the board of directors, or by the league itself in meeting assembled; and, hence, had no right to complain of the action of the league itself in adopting the resolution at the Norfolk meeting, which declared the membership of the Richmond Baseball Club forfeited, that is, terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">As said in <em>Kalbitzer </em>v. <em>Goodhue, </em>52 W. Va. 435, 44 S. E. 264: \u201cThe constitution and by-laws adopted by. a voluntary association constitutes a contract between the members, which, if not immoral or contrary to public policy, or the law, will be enforced by the courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">To the same effect, see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Stoerkel, </em>74 Mich. 269, 41 N. W. 921, 3 L. R. A. 430; 5 C. J. 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">As said in <em>Ostram </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>161 N. Y. 353, 55 N. E. 919: \u201cThere is a marked difference between a volun4 tary association with rules and one without. If lawful rules are made for the government of the members, they must be conformed to until they are regularly changed. So long as they are in force, they are the law of the association and must be obeyed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The ease will be reversed; and since, under the circumstances, a new trial could avail the plaintiff nothing, we will enter final judgment dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment dismissing the action.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
