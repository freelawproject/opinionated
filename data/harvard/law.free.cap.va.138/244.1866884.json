Kindly let me hear \u2022 from you.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-6\">\u201cInreply to this letter of August 24, 1907, defendants, recommended that plaintiff buy 100 shares of the common stock of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, and. immediately plaintiff sent' defendants $2,000.00 and' they, on September 2 or 3, 1907, purchased for plaintiff the 100 shares of the common stock of the Atlantic-Coast Line Railroad at $8,300.00, and thereafter, defendants carried the stock for plaintiff, or in other-words, defendants held this stock for plaintiff as security for the balance of the.purchase money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-7\">\u201cIn October and November, 1907, there was a very-severe financial stringency over the country and all' stocks depreciated on the market. The market value-of this stock went as- low as fifty-nine and a fraction;, that is to say, the stock sold below sixty dollars the-share and of course the plaintiff had to put up with dedendants more money, or security to protect this stock purchase.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-8\">\u201cProm the time of the money panic in 1907 till January, 1909, the plaintiff wrote frequent letters to de\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>fendants asking their opinion about the general outlook and especially asking their opinion about selling this 100 shares of Atlantic Coast Line Railroad stock. To all of such letters the defendants promptly. replied, giving answer to all questions and advised against the sale of the Atlantic Coast Line stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-5\">\u201cOn January 11,1909, defendants wrote plaintiff that they had received for him the semi-annual dividend of $250.00 on this Atlantic Coast Line stock, which amount plaintiff was given credit for by defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-6\">\u201cOn January 14, 1909, plaintiff wrote defendants as -follows: T have yours of the 11th advising me of the $250.00 Atlantic Coast Line dividend to my credit, -which I am, of course, glad to hear. Could not enough more be spared from my now margin on the 100 shares you are carrying for me, without having to sell a part of my stock, to make the amount $1,000.00, as I need this amount to complete payment on a house now about \u2022completed, and don\u2019t wish to raise the money by mortgaging. Or would, if not, it be better to close out than wait for better prices on my stock. If I could make a \u25a0sale of some of my realty, I could easily pay up everything and it has been my hope to do so, but everybody at present seems to be holding off. A prompt reply will oblige.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-7\">\u201cIn reply, defendants wrote plaintiff on January 15, 1909, as follows: \u2018Yours of 14th received. You can \u2022draw on us for $1,000.00 if desired. We enclose herewith circular in regard to Georgia and Florida first mortgage five per cent bonds and would suggest that you sell the 100 shares of Atlantic Coast Line stock at 109 or 110 and buy $10,000.00 of Georgia and Florida first mortgage, prior lien five per cent bonds at par and interest in the bankers syndicate. A result of which you -will receive $4,000.00 bonus in preferred stock and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>$6,000.00 in common stock of the Georgia and Florida.Railway.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-5\">\u201c \u2018In the meantime the funds in your investment are- . absolutely protected by the first mortgage prior lien . bond, and your profits would accrue through the increase in value of the stock, which would stand you at little or nothing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-6\">\u201c \u2018If you desire to do this, we can arrange to carry these Georgia and Florida bonds in place of the Atlantic - Coast Line stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-7\">\u201c \u2018Four of the largest trust companies in Baltimore - subscribed to $100,000.00 or more of these bonds in the bankers syndicate.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-8\">\u201cOn January 16, 1909, the plaintiff wrote defendants as follows: \u2018Yours of. 15th just to hand, and I shall draw upon you for $1,000.00. In regard to change of' investment, will say that in such matters I am guided by your greater knowledge and experience, and authorize \u2022 you to sell my 100 shares as you suggest at 109 or 110,.. and buy Georgia and Florida first mortgage prior lien five per cent bonds at par and interest receiving as bonus - preferred and common stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-9\">\u201c \u2018Now, I owe some debt, <em>i. e. </em>$2,000.00 mortgage on my home, raised to continue to carry stock to prevent - sacrificing same, and also about same amount in bank here. I don\u2019t like much debt, never before until panic \u2022 had to borrow on my realty. I own considerably over, in first class real estate, $50,000.00.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-10\">\u201c \u2018My debts are to you for $3,000.00 with collateral and at the bank here $2,000.00 and mortgage on my home $2,000.00. On March 2, $2,000.00 is due.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-11\">\u201c \u2018What I am getting at in writing so freely is to apprise you of what I owe, and then let you decide for me,. whether it would not be best to buy only what I can easily carry, to enable me to have cash enough to liqui\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>date some of these debts that are bearing six per cent interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-5\">\u201c \u2018To reinvest in $6,000.00 or $7,000.00 of these bonds with the bonuses, instead of as much as $10,000.00</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-6\">\u201c \u2018This will give me some ready money and leave enough for margin. As soon as I can make a sale of real estate I will invest and buy outright these bonds that you recommend.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-7\">\u201c \u2018In the meantime carry what you * * , on a margin that will make me safe.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-9\">\u201c \u2018There would be no reason for not carrying the-$10,000.00 if you think at the expiration of a month or two I could then sell at an advance, if so, do as you. suggest to the extent of $10,000.00.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-10\">\u201c T am not needing the money now with the $1,000.00 you authorize me to draw upon you for, but am apprehensive, if things do not improve, I might be embarrassed, and this I have never yet been in all of my life. I am very cautious and conservative in my nature and. have found it to have been to my gain,-for I am possessed of more than a generous father gave me twenty-five years ago. I am taking you somewhat in my confidence, and giving you facts, that you, as old and tried friends, may decide what is best in this matter. What-you decide upon will meet my approval. I have two real estate deals pending, either one of which, if made,, would give me more than enough to pay off every dollar I owe.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-11\">\u201cUpon the receipt of this above letter the defendants-credited the account of the plaintiff on January 20, 1909, with the sale of 100 shares of Atlantic Coast Line-common stock at $10,925.00, and charged the plaintiff with the purchase of $10,000.00 Georgia and Florida five per cent first mortgage bonds for $10,111.11 and on January 21, 1909, wrote plaintiff as follows: \u2018Yours of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>of the 16th received. We have sold for you. 100 shares of Atlantic Coast Line common stock at 1093^ and we charge you by the cost of $10,000.00 Georgia and Florida first mortgage five per cent bonds at par and interest, carrying a bonus of $4,000.00 in preferred stock and $6,000.00 in common stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-5\">\u00edj&lt; H* \u2756</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-6\">\u201c \u2018We are not recommending that you buy this for any temporary holding of three or four months but for you to make up your mind to hold it for at least twelve months, the bonds will pay their interest on 1st of May and November.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-7\">\u201c \u2018Your draft for $1,000.00 has been presented and paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-8\">\u201c \u2018Yours very truly,\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-9\">\u201c \u2018P. S. The Georgia and Alabama bond syndicate turned out about 100 per cent profit, and the Georgia and Florida goes thru a richer territory than the Georgia and Alabama.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-10\">\u201cAnd accompanying the letter defendants sent plaintiff a memorandum statement as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-11\">\u201c \u2018We have today sold you \u201c \u201810,000 Georgia and Florida Syndicate subscription 100...........................-..................$ 10,000.00</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-12\">\u25a0\u201c \u2018Interest 5% from November 1, 1908 .. 111.11</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-13\">$ 10,111.11</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-14\">\u2018$10,000.00 Georgia and Florida Railway first mortgage 5a.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-15\">\u201c \u20184,000.00 Georgia and Florida Railway preferred stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-16\">\u201c \u20186,000.00 Georgia and Florida Railway common stock.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-17\">\u201cIt now appears from the evidence that the Georgia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>and Florida Railway paid interest on these bonds for a few years, and most if not all of the interest so paid was a fund set aside for the purpose and not from the-earnings of the road.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-5\">\u201cIt also appears from the evidence, or from the defendants\u2019 answer, that the defendants on January 20, 1909, when it was thought they had sold for the plaintiff his 100 shares of Atlantic Coast Line stock, sold on that day only thirty-five shares and transferred the remaining sixty-five shares to their own stock account (sold it to themselves) and at the same time transferred from their own bond account, and stock account, the-$10,000.00 first mortgage bonds Georgia and Florida and the $4,000.00 Georgia and Florida preferred stock and $6,000.00 Georgia and Florida common stock to-the account of the plaintiff (bought from themselves for the plaintiff).</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-6\">\u201cThe evidence further shows that defendants on February 5, 1909, sold ten shares of this Atlantic Coast Line stock at 109|-; on February 9, 1909, they sold ten shares at 109\u00a7; and several months later they, sold the remaining forty-five shares at a considerable advance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-7\"> \u201cAs I understand it, the law on this subject is-very clearly established, for in <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>94 Va. at page 8, 26 S. E. 397, 40 L. R. A. 234, the court said: \u2018Nothing is better settled than that a man cannot be the agent of both the seller, and the buyer in the same .transaction, without the intelligent consent of both. Loyalty to his trust is the most important duty which the agent owes to his principal. Reliance upon his integrity, fidelity, and ability, is the main consideration in the selection of agents, and so careful is the law in guarding this fiduciary relation that it will not allow an agent to act for himself and principal, nor to act for two principals on opposite sides in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\u2022transaction. All such transactions are voidable and may be repudiated by the principal, without showing that he was injured. \u00b0 In such cases the amount of consideration, the absence of undue advantage and other like features, are wholly immaterial. Nothing will deieat the principal\u2019s right of remedy except his own \u25a0confirmation after full knowledge of all the facts. Actual injury is not the principle upon which the law holds such transactions voidable. The chief object of the principle is not to compel restitution, where actual iraud has been committed, or unjust advantage gained, but it is to prevent the agent from putting himself in the position, in which to be honest is to be a strain upon him, and to elevate him -\u2018to a position where he \u25a0cannot be tempted to betray his principal.\u201d Under a less stringent rule it was said by the court in <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>36 N. J. Eq. 174, 80, fraud might be committed, or unfair advantage taken, and yet owing to the imperfections of the best human institutions, the injured party be unable either to discover it or to prove it in such manner as to entitle him to redress. To guard against this uncertainty all possible temptation is removed, and the prohibition against an agent acting in a dual character is made broad enough to cover all transactions. The rights of the principal will not be changed, nor the capacity of the agent enlarged, by the fact that the agent is not invested with a discretion, but simply acts under an authority to purchase a particular article at a specified price, or to sell a particular article at the market price. No such distinction is recognized by the adjudications nor can it be established without removing an important <em>safeguard </em>against iraud. <em>Buckles </em>v. <em>Lafferty, </em>2 Rob. (41 Va.) 292, 40 Am. Dec. 752; <em>Howory </em>v. <em>Helma, </em>20 Gratt. (61 Va.) 1; 1 Miss. Ins. L. (4th ed.) 244; 2 Pom. Eq.

Rep. 66; Warvelle on Vendors, p. 862.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-6\">\u201cIn the recent case of <em>Cardozo </em>v. <em>Middle Atlantic Immigration Company, Inc., </em>116 Va. at p. 360, 82 S. E. 80, in discussing the same principle of law the court said: \u2018It is the duty of the agent to place his principal in full possession of the facts bearing upon bis personal interest and relations to the subject and toward the prospective purchaser. It is not enough for the broker or agent to say that he thought his principal was advised as to all the facts, nor is it sufficient if he be able to point out circumstances from which an inference might be drawn that the principal knew or had means of knowledge. It may be true that the principal has suffered no injury by means of the ignorance of the facts, but the law makes no such inquiry. In order to remove temptation from the path of agents, as far as can be done, it stamps, from motives of public policy, all such dealings with the seal of its condemnation. Loyalty to his trust is the most important duty which the agent owes to his principal. Reliance upon his integrity, fidelity and ability is the main consideration, in the selection of agents and so careful is the law in guarding this fiduciary relation that it will not allow an agent to act for himself and principal, nor to act for two principals on the opposite sides in the same transactions. All such transactions are voidable and may be repudiated by the principal without showing that he was injured. In all such cases the amount of consideration, the absence of undue advantage and other features are wholly immaterial.' Nothing will defeat the principal\u2019s right of remedy except his own confirmation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>after full knowledge of all the facts. <em>Boury </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>111 Va. 581, 69 S. E. 1050, and authorities cited; <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Cline, </em>96 Va. 201, 31 S. E. 10.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-5\">\u201cOn the same subject see <em>Halsey </em>v. <em>Monteiro, </em>92 Va. 24 S. E. 258, p. 581, <em>Branch </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>109 Va. 784, 65 S. E. 652.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-6\">\u201cThe principle is very ably stated in a note by the reporter to the case of <em>Bucklee </em>v. <em>Lafferty, </em>2 Rob. (41 Va.) at p. 302, 40 Am. Dec. 752, quoting from the remarks of counsel for the York Building Company in case of <em>York Building Co. </em>v. <em>Mackenzie, 8 </em>Brown Par. Gas. said he: \u2018It is the constitution of nature itself, and is as old as the formation of society, and of course it. must be universal. It proceeds from nature and is silently received, recognized and made effectual wherever any well regulated system of civil jurisprudence is known. The ground on which the disability or disqualification rests is no other than that principle which dictates that a person cannot be both judge and party.. No man can serve two masters. He that is entrusted with, the interest of others cannot be allowed to make-the business an object of interest to himself, because from the frailty of human nature one who has the power will be too readily seized with the inclination to use the opportunity for serving his own interest at the expense of those for whom he is entrusted. The danger of temptation from the facility and advantages for doing wrong which a particular situation affords, does, out of the mere necessity of the case, work a disqualification; nothing less than incapacity being able to shut the door against temptation where the danger is imminent and the security against discovery great, as it must be where the difficulty of prevention or remedy is-inherent to the very situation which creates the danger. The wise policy of the law has therefore put the sting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>of a disability into the temptation as a defensive weapon against the strength of the danger which lies in the situation.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-5\">\u201cAs will be seen, from the above authorities, nothing will defeat the principal\u2019s right of remedy except his own confirmation after full knowledge of all the facts. But the burden of proof is on the agent, in a transaction of this character, -to prove that the principal was fully informed of all the facts within the agent\u2019s knowledge. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Pleasanton, </em>95 Va. at p. 658, 29 S. E. 680.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-6\"> \u201cIt is therefore necessary to ascertain what information was communicated to the plaintiff by the defendants. Whatever it was, it was done by correspondence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-7\">\u201cThe plaintiff was a customer of the defendants, who wrote plaintiff on March 6, 1907, among other things as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-8\">\u201c \u2018We are now organizing the Georgia and Florida Railway embracing about 350 miles of road in which the syndicate subscribers receive for every $1,000.00 invested $1,000.00 first mortgage five per cent fifty year gold bonds, $400.00 six per cent preferred stock, and $600.00 common stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-9\">\u201c \u2018Should you desire to sell some of your Georgia and Alabama 5\u2019s and invest proceeds in the above securities we think you would be doing a wise thing.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-10\">\u201cOn March 7, 1907, plaintiff replied and declined to make the investment. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-11\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 letter to the plaintiff on January 15, 1909, is copied herein above from which it will be seen defendants wrote plaintiff that he could draw on them for $1,000.00 as he had requested to do and enclosed a circular in regard to the Georgia and Florida first mortgage five per cent bonds and advised plaintiff to sell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>his 100 shares of Atlantic Coast Line common stock at 109 or 110 and buy the Georgia and Florida bonds. There is nothing in this letter nor is there anything in the circular, in my judgment, to indicate that defendants owned the bonds they advised plaintiff to buy, or that they would buy his Atlantic Coast Line stock, or any part of it.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s letter of January 16, 1909, to the defendants advised them of plaintiff\u2019s financial condition very fully; he tells them \u2018that in such matters I am guided by your greater knowledge and experience and authorize you to sell my 100 shares as you suggest at 109 or 110 and buy Georgia and Florida first mortgate prior lien five per cent bonds at par and interest, receiving as bonus preferred and common stock,\u2019 and again: \u2018What I am getting at in writing so freely is to apprise you of what I owe, and then let you decide for me whether it would not be best to buy only what I can easily carry,\u2019 and further on he says: T am taking you somewhat in my confidence, and giving you facts, that you as old and tried friends may decide what is best in this matter.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-6\">\u201cIt is true this-letter authorized defendants to sell this stock at 109 or 110 and buy the Georgia and Florida bonds, but it is equally true that the letter stated that he was guided by their greater knowledge and experience and that he was giving them the facts that defendants as old and tried friends may decide what is best for him in the matter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-7\">\u201cBy this letter plaintiff authorized defendants to sell his stock and buy bonds, thus expressly making defendants agents of plaintiff both to sell and to buy; but they were agents in this matter in whom the plaintiff was trusting and guided by their greater knowledge and experience and he expected them to decide what was best for him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>\u201cIn executing this agency to sell the stock and buy bonds, defendants sold thirty-five shares of this stock and bought (?) the sixty-five shares themselves. They did not buy any Georgia and Florida bonds for plaintiff, but simply transferred their own bonds to plaintiff\u2019s account and on January 21, 1909, wrote to the plaintiff the letter already copied and inclosed the statement also copied hereinabove. It would appear, therefore, unless the plaintiff ratified this transaction it comes under the influence of the authorities heretofore cited and quoted from, but before the plaintiff is bound by any ratification such ratification must be made after full knowledge of all the facts. Taking up first the sale of this Atlantic Coast Line stock, I believe the record shows that until the filing of the answer of L. M. Williams, one of the defendants, to the plaintiff\u2019s bill of complaint on April 8, 1918, the only information or knowledge the plaintiff had of the sale of the stock was contained in defendants\u2019 letter of January 16, 1909, to plaintiff to the effect they had sold the 100 shares of Atlantic Coast Line common stock at $10,926.00 and charged the plaintiff with the purchase of $10,000.00 Georgia and Florida five per cent first mortgage bonds, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-5\">\u201cUpon the filing of the said answer on April 8, 1918, the plaintiff for the first time it seems knew what had become of this stock, for on January 20, 1909, defendants sold only thirty-five shares of this stock at 109 and \u2018took over the balance to their stock account\u2019 (sold to themselves the sixty-five shares at 109)^); on February 5, 1909, they sold ten shares at <em>109}4 </em>and some months later sold the forty-five shares, but at what price the record does not seem to disclose. In my judgment it is apparent that defendants as agents of plaintiff were authorized to sell this stock and as agents only sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>thirty-five shares, and while agents bought the sixty-five shares they had as agents for sale. The defendants say that the plaintiff received the price he authorized'them to sell at and he has not been injured. They say that Atlantic Coast Line on the New York stock market on January 20, 1909, was quoted at 108 or <em>108% </em>and that by their taking over the sixty-five shares they gave the plaintiff more than the stock could have been sold for on January 20. That defense does not meet, the demands of the law, because the law says the plaintiff in a case like this can, on being informed of the facts, repudiate the transaction and recover. He does not have to show any damage. The fact that the defendants took over this stock at a point higher than it was that day quoted on the New York stock market; gave sixty-five dollars more for it than the New York stock quotation, rather weakens defendants\u2019 position. I do not believe such dealing is in accord with usual business methods and does not help the situation; but justifies the inference that the defendants were doing this in order to quickly enable them to buy for plaintiff their own first mortgage Georgia and Florida bonds, which they immediately did.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-5\">\u201cNow consider what information if any plaintiff had that defendants in executing his order bought their own bonds for him. So far as I can find in the' record there is nothing to show that at this time, January 20, 1909, plaintiff knew that defendants owned any Georgia and Florida first mortgage bonds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-6\">\u201cIt does appear, however, that defendants on March 5, 1907, wrote plaintiff among other things that they w\u00e9re then organizing the Georgia and Florida Railway of about 350 miles of road in which syndicate subscribers <em>receive </em>for every $1,000.00 invested a $1,000.00 first mortgage gold bond bearing five per cent with cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>tain preferred and common stock bonus, and advised plaintiff to invest. On March 7, 1907, plaintiff declined the investment. This letter of March 5th to plaintiff is not proof that on January 20, 1909, plaintiff knew, or ever had cause to suspect, that defendants owned any of these bonds. The circular which defendants sent to plaintiff with their letter of January 15, 1909, when they advised plaintiff to sell the Atlantic Coast Line stock and buy Georgia and Florida bonds, contains nothing to inform plaintiff that they owned any of these bonds, nor is there anything in the letter of defendants to plaintiff of January 21, 1909, to inform him that they owned the bonds that defendants charged plaintiff\u2019s account with the cost of. But defendants claim with great confidence that accompanying this letter to plaintiff of January 21, 1909, they sent plaintiff a statement which is filed as an exhibit with the bill in which the plaintiff was told in language as plain as language can convey that defendants sold their own bonds to plaintiff. What is here referred to and relied\u2019 on by defendants is a memorandum statement already copied in this opinion, is on a printed statement form and these words printed,\u2018We have today . ! . . .'</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-5\">for you\u2019 as filled out it is in the following appearance: \u2018we have today sold for you,\u2019 then follows the statement' as above copied. The word \u2018sold\u2019 in the lower quotation is filled in in pencil and a pencil line drawn through the word \u2018for\u2019 as indicated. The defendants say this reads: \u2018We have today sold you,\u2019 and they rely upon that as giving plaintiff full information of all facts in their knowledge touching the sale of these bonds. Their letter of January 21, 1909, inclosing this statement to plaintiff and in which they would naturally have given plaintiff full information of how they as his agents had executed the trust conferred on them by him, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>contain the information of the true facts. It does not tell plaintiff they had taken themselves sixty-five shares of bis Atlantic Coast Line stock they were instructed to sell, nor does it tell him that the bonds they were instructed to buy, and which the letter says they charged his account with the cost of, were their own bonds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff says in bis evidence in testifying about .this memorandum statement spoken of and of the words \u2018we have today sold you\u2019 that he never noticed those words until the counsel in preparing the papers for this suit called his attention to it. If the defendants, as they do, rely on ratification of plaintiff of the agents acts, the burden of proof is op defendants to show that plaintiff ratified their acts after full knowledge of all the facts. I do not think the defendants have met such burden, and I do not think the plaintiff had knowledge of many of the material facts, until they were disclosed by this suit and even now the record does not show at what price defendants sold the last forty-five shares of Atlantic Coast Line stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-6\">\u201cThen again the defendants claim that they were mere instruments in the performance of an appointed service and not fiduciaries in the performance of trust, and having sold the stock at a price authorized by the plaintiff, he has sustained no legal damage. In answer to this claim it is sufficient to say in the quotation from <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Gooch, supra, </em>it says: \u2018The rights of the principal will not be changed nor the capacity of the agent enlarged by the fact that the agent is not invested with a discretion, but simply acts under an authority to purchase a particular article at a specified price, or to sell a particular article at the market price.\u2019 Nor do I think anyone can read plaintiff\u2019s letter of January 16, 1909, and say that defendants were simply instruments in the performance of an appointed service.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u201cThe law as quoted from the case in <em>Cardozo </em>v. <em>Mid. Atl. Immigration Co. Inc., supra, </em>is \u2018If may be true that the principal has suffered no injury by means of the ignorance of the facts, but the law makes no such inquiry. In order to remove temptation from the path of agents, as far as can be done, it stamps, from motives of public policy, all such dealings with the seal of its condemnation.\u2019 \u2018All such transactions are voidable and may be repudiated by the principal, without showing that he was injured.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-5\">\u201cWhether the defendants regarded the letter of the plaintiff as confiding special trust in them, or simply authorized them as instruments in the performance of an appointed service, it is difficult to read plaintiff\u2019s letter of January 16, 1909, and reach a conclusion other than that plaintiff regarded them as old and tried friends and expected them to decide for him what was best in the matter. Under these circumstances, in my opinion, the defendants were agents coupled with the duty of exercising their best judgment in the matter, and consequently could not have been mere instruments for the performance of an appointed service.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-6\">\u201cTherefore, interpreting the law of this case as T do, and applying the facts as I view them, I am forced to the conclusion that the plaintiff is entitled to have the transactions set aside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-7\">\u201cThe defendants will be charged with the prices at which they actually sold to third persons the several blocks making up the one hundred shares of Atlantic Coast Line stock of the plaintiff, with interest from the dates of sale. The defendants shall have credit for any indebtedness as of January 20, 1909, of plaintiff to them for the unpaid purchase price of this Atlantic Coast Line stock; and they shall likewise have credit as of the several dates of payment of interest received by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>plaintiff on the Georgia and Florida bonds. The plaintiff -will deliver \u201cfor the defendants, the Georgia and Florida $10,000.00 first mortgage bonds, and the preferred and eommon stock of the Georgia and Florida.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-5\">\u201cA decree to this effect can be prepared.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-6\">\u201cWilliam A.

We shall add thereto merely the following observations upon certain points which have been especially urged upon our attention by the very able and earnest argument of counsel for appellees as having, in whole or in part, escaped the attention of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">At the outset we will say that the cause has been fully presented and ably argued by counsel on both sides, which has greatly lightened the labor of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">There has been no difference between counsel as to the principles of law applicable, and it has not been claimed in argument before us that the principles announced in the opinion of the learned chancellor, which we have adopted as aforesaid, are not the principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>to be applied in this cause. The main argument has centered around the controversy as to whether the letters of the appellants (the agents), especially of March 5, 1907, of January 15, 1909, the circular or prospectus sent therewith, and the letter of January 21, 1909, and the memorandum sent therewith (all dealt with in said opinion), were so clearly and unequivocally expressed on the subject that they in fact conveyed, or, when reasonably construed, must be taken to have conveyed to appellee (the principal) the information that the appellants proposed to sell and did sell to him their own mortgage bonds and the stock therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">On this point it is urged in argument for appellants that the court below overlooked any consideration of the aforesaid circular and also the postscript to the letter of January 15, 1909. The opinion expressly states that the circular \u201ccontains nothing to inform the (appellee) that they (the appellants) owned any of these bonds.\u201d The postscript mentioned was as follows: \u201cLet us hear from you promptly if you desire to avail yourself of this offer.\u201d This, as we think, added nothing to the meaning of the letter itself of January 15, 1909, and hence mention of it in the opinion aforesaid was doubtless omitted as immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">It is also urged in behalf of applicants that the court below overlooked any consideration of the following paragraph in the letter of January 21, 1909, from appellant to appellee, namely: \u201cWe have given you this participation in the bankers syndicate, as we feel that it is very safe and should bring you good profits during the next twelve months:\u201d It is true that this paragraph of this letter is not quoted in the opinion of the <em>court; </em>but we think this omission was due to the fact that the court found nothing in this (as we find nothing in it) to change the meaning which the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>pressions in other portions of the letter were reasonably calculated to convey to the appellee, namely that the transaction was a purchase for him from some one else, with no information given, which can be said to be unequivocal, that it was a sale by appellants to appellee of securities belonging to them personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\"> It is further urged in behalf of appellants that the appellee admits in his .testimony that, when his attention was first called, after the suit was instituted, to the exact phraseology of the memorandum, he saw that it said \u201csold you,\u201d and \u201cwas utterly surprised;\u201d from which it is urged that by appellee\u2019s own admission the phraseology of the memorandum was sufficient to, and would, have conveyed to him the information in question if he had read the memorandum when he received it, and, hence, that it did not do so, was due to his own negligence in not reading it, or, if he read it, in not comprehending its meaning, at the time he received it, and not to the fault of appellants. We cannot so regard the matter. It is apparent from the evidence that, as a matter of fact, the memorandum did not convey the meaning in question to appellee until after the suit was brought, when his attention was <em>for the first time </em>attracted to the precise phraseology of \u201csold you\u201d contained in it. In view of the fact that the letters were the source to which the appellee would naturally look for information which the appellants might have sought to convey to him on the subject of the transaction, rather than the memorandum, which he would naturally infer had reference to the same and not to a different transaction from that which was the subject of the mutual correspondence, we do not think that the contents of the memorandum, when reasonably construed along with the letters of the appellants and in the light of the other evidence disclosing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>mental attitude of the appellee, can be said to have been such that it ought to have attracted the attention of the appellee at the time it was received, or prior to suit brought, in such a way as that it should have conveyed to him the aforesaid meaning which appellants claim it should have conveyed and which they thought that it and their letters did convey. As said in <em>Cardozo </em>v. <em>Mid. Atl. Immigration Co., Inc., </em>116 Va. pp. 360-1, 82 S. E. 80-87, included in the quotation from such case in the opinion of the court below: \u201cIt is not enough for the broker or agent to say he thought the principal was advised as to all the facts, nor is it sufficient if he be able to point out circumstances from which an inference might be drawn that the principal knew or had means of knowledge.\u201d For the communication from the agent to be held to convey by inference the information in question in such case, the inference must be so obvious that it is apparent that the principal \u201cwillfully shut his eyes to what he might readily and ought to have known.\u201d See <em>Pence </em>v. <em>Langdon, </em>99 U. S. 578, 25 L. Ed. 420; in which the communications from the agent contained language more strongly warranting the inference in question than in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">It is further urged before us for appellants that consideration was not given by the court below to the fact that the memorandum aforesaid showed that no commission was charged on the purchase of the mortgage bonds and stock therewith, which should, as it is claimed, have informed appellee that it was not a purchase for him, as he supposed, but a sale to him by appellants personally. We do not think that it can be said that appellee should have reasonably expected that such a memorandum would set out the commissions charged if it had been a purchase for him, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>that the inference must be drawn, from its not stating any commissions as charged, that it conveyed the information aforesaid. He would naturally expect the information as to commissions charged or not charged to appear in a different character of document, such as an account rendered by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">But one other matter in controversy need be specifically referred to by us. It is earnestly urged for appellants that the court below erred in allowing the appellee to recover beyond the market value of the sixty-five shares of the Atlantic Coast Line stock on the day of the sale of the thirty-five shares of such stock. The authority of the court for this\" allowance is found in the settled rule which is thus stated in 1 Mechem on Agency, sec. 1224, pp. 894-5: \u201cThe well settled and salutary principle that a person who undertakes to act for another shall not, in the same matter, act for himself, results also in the other rule, that all profits made and advantage gained by the agent in the execution of the agency belong to the principal. And it matters not whether such profit or advantage be the result of the performance or the violation of the duty of the agent if it be the fruit of the agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">In the case of <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>83 Pa. St. 238, cited for appellants, the question involved was merely whether the principal could recover of the agent broker certain extra commissions charged by the latter, which he had had to pay other brokers. The court held that it should have been left to the jury to say whether the principal had promised to repay the broker the extra commissions. And in that case there was an account of sales rendered by the agent broker to the principal, which showed that the broker had fully accounted for his actual receipts from the actual sales of the stock. The case is therefore not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>We will add in conclusion (what we feel that the long years of upright, honest and fair dealing of the appellants\u2019 firm, shown by the evidence, justly entitles them to have the court make), the following statement: It is not even alleged by the appellee, nor is there any evidence whatever in the cause; that the appellants acted in any other manner throughout the whole course of their dealing with appellee, including the transaction aforesaid involved in this cause, than in the most scrupulously honest and upright manner, in so far as their intention was concerned. They risked for themselves, and, at the time of the suit, had still invested many hundreds of thousands of dollars in the same mortgage bonds and stocks as those which they sold to the appellee; and they, in good faith, thought that they had made it plain to the appellee at the time of such sale that they were making such sale to him from their own holdings of such securities. But, for the reason of public policy set forth in the opinion of the court below, which we have adopted as aforesaid as a part of this opinion, we feel constrained to adhere to the established rule on the subject, which is also set forth in such opinion, the importance of which, as a matter of public policy, is so great, that it transcends in importance and supersedes all consideration of any individual interests involved in any particular case in which it does not affirmatively appear that the agent has in fact made the disclosure aforesaid to his principal which the rule .as aforesaid requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The decree under review will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b309-7\">Prentis, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASH\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">I dissent, not from the salutary principles upon which the majority opinion is based, but because I do not think they should be applied t\u00f3 the facts of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>On Rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Richmond, Va., January 17, 1924.</p>\n<author id=\"b310-6\">Per Chriam:</author>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">This case is before us upon a rehearing.
