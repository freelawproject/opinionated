GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1219-9\">Defendant Joe Clinton Segler pled guilty to manufacturing methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (1988), and to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Segler was sentenced to a 300-month term of imprisonment and fined $30,000. On direct appeal, we upheld Segler\u2019s conviction and sentence in an unpublished opinion. <em>United States v. Segler, </em>No. 89-1588, 896 F.2d 550 (Table) (5th Cir. Jan. 31, 1990). <em>Segler, </em>proceeding pro se, now appeals an order of the district court denying his motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-11\">\u201cRelief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is reserved for transgressions of constitutional rights and for a narrow range of injuries that could not have been raised on direct appeal and would, if condoned, result in a complete miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Vaughn, </em>955 F.2d 367, 368 (5th Cir.1992). Moreover, a defendant \u201cmay not raise an issue [constitutional or jurisdictional in nature] for the first time on collateral review without showing both \u2018cause\u2019 for his procedural default, and \u2018actual prejudice\u2019 resulting from the error.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaid, </em>937 F.2d 228, 232 (5th Cir.1991) (en banc) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 978, 117 L.Ed.2d 141 (1992). \u201cIf the error is not of constitutional or jurisdictional magnitude, the defendant must show the error would result in a complete miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-18\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-19\">Segler first contends the district court erred in sentencing him for manufacturing a Schedule II controlled substance because methamphetamine was not properly transferred under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811 from a Schedule III to a Schedule II controlled substance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that this is an issue of sufficient constitutional magnitude to warrant raising on collateral attack, we previously have held that the transfer of methamphetamine from Schedule III to Schedule II satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 811. See <em>United States v. Branch, </em>980 F.2d 1445 (5th Cir.1992); <em>see also United States v. Greenwood, </em>974 F.2d 1449, 1472 (5th Cir.1992) (\u201cSince the early 1970s, as a matter of law, methamphetamine has been classified as a schedule II controlled substance.\u201d); <em>United States v. Allison, </em>953 F.2d 870 (5th Cir.) (holding rescheduling of methamphetamine from Schedule III to Schedule II had been properly accomplished), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 2319, 119 L.Ed.2d 238 (1992). Consequently, we reject Segler\u2019s first claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-22\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-23\">Segler next contends that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>lines in sentencing him as a career offender.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A district court\u2019s technical application of the Guidelines does not give rise to a constitutional issue cognizable under \u00a7 2255. <em>Vaughn, </em>955 F.2d at 368. Applying the \u00a7 4B1.1 criteria to determine whether to sentence as a career offender does not implicate any constitutional issues. <em>United States v. Faubion, </em>19 F.3d 226, 233 (5th Cir.1994). Moreover, this claim could have been raised on direct appeal. <em>See Vaughn, </em>955 F.2d at 368 (a nonconstitutional claim that could have been raised on direct appeal, but was not, may not be raised in a collateral proceeding). Accordingly, Segler is not entitled to \u00a7 2255 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-3\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">Segler next alleges that the district court erred in calculating his base offense level by including the entire 8.5 gallons of acetone seized by police officers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We considered, and rejected, this issue on direct appeal. See <em>Segler, </em>slip op. at 4-5. Therefore, we need not reconsider this argument on \u00a7 2255 review. <em>United States v. Kalish, </em>780 F.2d 506, 508 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>476 U.S. 1118, 106 S.Ct. 1977, 90 L.Ed.2d 660 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">Segler also argues that we should reduce his sentence because a recent amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines makes clear that the district court should not have calculated his base offense level using the entire quantity of acetone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Segler contends that Amendment 484 was to be retroactively applied and, consequently, the sentence imposed was illegal. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d) (noting that amendment 484 is to be applied retroactively). However, under the law in effect at the time of sentencing, the district court correctly included the total weight of the solution seized in determining Sealer\u2019s base offense level. <em>See United States v. Sherrod, </em>964 F.2d 1501, 1509 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Baker, </em>883 F.2d at 15. Moreover, this very claim was rejected on appeal. <em>Segler, </em>slip op. at 4-5. Because reconsidering an issue raised on direct appeal is beyond the narrow scope of \u00a7 2255 review, <em>Kalish, </em>780 F.2d at 508, we decline to consider the merits here. We note, however, that Segler is not barred from raising the issue in a motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10; <em>United States v. Towe, </em>26 F.3d 614, 616 (5th Cir.1994) (holding that a defendant may seek a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c) where the applicable guideline range has been lowered as a result of a retroactive amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-12\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-13\">Segler claims that the district court incorrectly adjusted his base offense level upward two points for possessing a firearm while manufacturing methamphetamine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>He argues that this upward adjustment, when combined with the sentence he received for being a felon in possession of a firearm, constitutes double jeopardy. He also argues that the district court erred in not grouping the methamphetamine and firearms counts as \u201crelated conduct offenses\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 3D1.1.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that these claims are cognizable on collateral review, we find both to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-4\">Segler\u2019s double jeopardy argument \u201c \u2018mis-perceives the distinction between a sentence and a sentence enhancement.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ainsworth, </em>932 F.2d 358, 363 (5th Cir.) (quoting <em>United States v. Mocciola, </em>891 F.2d 13, 17 (1st Cir.1989)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 346, 116 L.Ed.2d 286 (1991). The danger of violence increases when firearms are present during drug-related crimes. Sentence enhancement for firearms possession seeks to discourage drug traffickers from possessing firearms. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 3). The record reflects that loaded firearms were found at Segler\u2019s residence, where the drug laboratory was located. Because Segler does not claim that the firearms at issue were not connected to the offense, the district court did not err by increasing Segler\u2019s offense level after finding that he possessed the firearms during the commission of a drug offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l); <em>see also United States v. Hewin, </em>877 F.2d 3, 5 (5th Cir.1989) (noting that the offense level should be increased \u2018unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense\u2019) (citation omitted). Accordingly, there was no violation of Segler\u2019s double jeopardy rights. <em>Ainsworth, </em>932 F.2d at 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-13\">Likewise, there is no merit to Segler\u2019s claim that the district court failed to \u201cgroup\u201d the two counts for sentencing under \u00a7 3D1.1. Segler misunderstands the calculation of his sentence. The district court <em>did </em>group the counts, pursuant to \u00a7 3D1.2(c).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, because the resulting guideline range\u2014360 months to life\u2014was greater than the statutorily authorized maximum sentence for the methamphetamine count\u2014240 months\u2014the statutory maximum penalty controlled. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1. Consequently, \u00a7 5G1.2 required the district court to impose consecutive sentences for the methamphetamine count and the firearm count.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As Segler recognized, the district court imposed the statutory maximum penalty of 60 months for the unlawful possession of a firearm in an attempt to impose a sentence within the guideline range. Therefore, the district court accurately applied the guidelines with respect to sentencing for \u201cclosely related\u201d counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-14\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-15\">Segler also alleges that the district court erred in imposing a $30,000 fine without making specific findings regarding his ability to pay. The \u201cpropriety of a fine is a matter relative to sentencing and should have been raised on direct appeal and not for the first time in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>No. 93-8131, slip op. at 1-2, 8 F.3d 23 (Table) (5th Cir. October 29, 1993). Moreover, even assuming arguendo that his challenge comes under \u00a7 2255,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> his claim lacks merit. While Segler correctly identifies the various factors to be considered, <em>see 18 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(a) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2, the district court need not make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>express findings regarding these factors. <em>United States v. Matovsky, </em>935 F.2d 719, 722 (5th Cir.1991) (\u201c[T]he guidelines set forth no requirement that the district court make express findings [demonstrating consideration of the factors in \u00a7 5E1.2], and we decline to create one.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-3\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">Lastly, Segler alleges ineffective assistance of counsel. Segler specifically contends that he received ineffective assistance during sentencing and on direct appeal because counsel failed to challenge: (1) the district court\u2019s categorization of him as a career offender; (2) the two point enhancement for weapons possession pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l); and (3) the imposition of the $30,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">A claim that counsel has rendered ineffective assistance will succeed only if the defendant proves that such counsel was not only objectively deficient, but also that the defendant was thereby prejudiced. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Additionally, there must be a \u201creasonable probability that but for trial counsel\u2019s errors the defendant\u2019s non-capital sentence would have been <em>significantly </em>less harsh.\u201d <em>Spriggs v. Collins, </em>993 F.2d 85, 88 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, a court must consider such factors-as the defendant\u2019s actual sentence, the potential minimum and maximum sentences that could have been received, the placement of the actual sentence within the range of potential sentences, and any relevant mitigating or aggravating circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-8\">Segler first submits that counsel was deficient in not challenging the district court\u2019s determination that he was a career offender. Segler asserts that his two prior convictions for drug possession fail to qualify as \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Categorization as a career offender placed Segler in criminal history category VI. According to Segler, however, his criminal history warranted placement in category IV. We need not reach the merits of Segler\u2019s contention that he was not a career offender because Segler has failed to satisfy the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>standard. Segler\u2019s offense level of 40 resulted in an imprisonment range of 360 months to life, regardless of whether his criminal history category was IV or VI.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because the same guideline range would have resulted in the absence of Segler\u2019s categorization as a career offender, no prejudice resulted from counsel\u2019s failure to raise the career offender issue. Accordingly, we reject this portion of Segler\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-12\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-13\">Segler further contends that counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the enhancement for weapons possession at sentencing and on direct appeal. In fact, counsel did object to the two points at the sentencing hearing, but the district court overruled his objection. Additionally, an upward adjustment was directed by the Guidelines. <em>See supra </em>part II.E. Therefore, we find that counsel\u2019s failure to challenge this issue again on direct appeal was not \u201cdeficient.\u201d <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-14\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-15\">Finally, Segler alleges that counsel\u2019s failure to challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s imposition of a $30,000 fine constitutes ineffective assistance. We do not reach the merits of this claim because we conclude it lies outside the scope of 28 U.S.C.\u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-16\">The plain language of \u00a7 2255 provides only prisoners who claim a right to be released from custody an avenue to challenge their sentences: \u201cA prisoner in custody under sentence of a [federal] court claiming the right to be released ... may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>correct the sentence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. However, \u201c[a] monetary fine is not a sufficient restraint on liberty to meet the \u2018in custody\u2019 requirement for \u00a7 2255 purposes.\u201d <em>United States v. Michaud, </em>901 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir.1990); <em>accord Spring v. Caldwell, </em>692 F.2d 994, 999 (5th Cir.1982) (\u201carrest warrant issued for willful refusal to pay a fine does not amount to custody within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2254 in habeas cases challenging the constitutionality of a statute that only imposes a fine\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-4\">Segler\u2019s status as a federal prisoner brings <em>him </em>clearly within the class of petitioners described in \u00a7 2255. However, his ineffective assistance of counsel claim relating to his fine raises the question whether <em>his claim </em>arises under \u00a7 2255. We conclude that \u00a7 2255\u2019s limitation on who may seek release from federal custody also implies a limitation on the claims they may assert to obtain a release. Because Congress limited relief under \u00a7 2255 to persons in federal custody, we hold that Congress also meant to limit the types of claims cognizable under \u00a7 2255 to claims relating to unlawful custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">Segler challenges his counsel\u2019s failure to appeal the imposition of a $30,000 fine. Under <em>Strickland, </em>Segler must show: (1) that his counsel\u2019s performance was \u201cdeficient\u201d; and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced him. <em>See id., </em>466 U.S. at 687,104 S.Ct. at 2064; <em>Spriggs v. Collins, </em>993 F.2d 85, 87 (5th Cir.1993). We hold that when a prisoner asserts an ineffective assistance of counsel claim <em>under \u00a7 2255, </em>he must satisfy <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice requirement by showing harm that relates to his custody. That is, if counsel\u2019s constitutionally insufficient assistance affected the trial court\u2019s guilt determination or the sentencer\u2019s imposition of a prison term, a prisoner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim falls within the scope of \u00a7 <em>2255; </em>if, as here, it relates only to the imposition of a fine, his claim falls outside \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">This interpretation of <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice requirement in the habeas context promotes even-handed treatment of similar Sixth Amendment claims. A convicted defendant who receives an allegedly erroneous fine because of constitutionally inadequate assistance of counsel cannot seek post-conviction relief under \u00a7 2255, <em>see Michaud, </em>901 F.2d at 7, and neither should a petitioner who is both fined and imprisoned have an opportunity to assert an identical fine-related claim under \u00a7 2255. Our reading of the plain language of \u00a7 2255 suggests no reason why Congress would have intended to treat these two identical ineffective assistance of counsel claims differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-13\">We are aware of at least one case in which a Court of Appeals implied that \u00a7 2255 was a proper avenue to assert an ineffective assistance of counsel claim relating to the imposition of a fine. In <em>Vela-Fossas v. United States, </em>1990 WL 443937, at *2 (1st Cir. Sept. 7, 1990), the petitioner \u201cclaimed that due to ineffective assistance of counsel ... [he] received a more onerous restitution obligation and greater fine than he should have in the first place.\u201d The district court dismissed the claims \u201con the apparent basis that petitioner\u2019s sole proper remedy was under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3569 and related regulations,\u201d which provided indigent prisoners with a remedy to avoid continuing confinement for failure to pay a \u201cstand committed fine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals held that the district court erred by dismissing the claims on this basis. The court then concluded that the error was harmless because all of the claims lacked merit. <em>Id </em>at *3. To the extent the First Circuit\u2019s approach in <em>Vela-Fossas </em>is inconsistent with our holding here, we decline to follow its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1219-12\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 establishes \"five schedules of controlled substances, to be known as schedules I, II, III, IV, and V.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(a).
