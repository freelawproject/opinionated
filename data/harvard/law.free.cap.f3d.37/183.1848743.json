We review this question of law de novo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>The plaintiffs-appellees (Taxpayers) claimed deductions in 1985 and 1986 for carryover investment interest expense that was not deductible in 1984 under Section 163(d)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The carryover to 1985 exceeded the Taxpayers\u2019 taxable income in 1984, and the carryover to 1986 exceeded their taxable income for 1985. The Commissioner determined deficiencies with respect to the Taxpayers\u2019 1985 and 1986 tax years, asserting that under Section 163(d)(2) of the Code, the Taxpayers could only carry over an amount of investment interest expense that did not exceed their taxable income for the year. The Taxpayers contested this determination in Tax Court, maintaining that Section 163(d) did not limit the investment interest carryover to the year\u2019s taxable income, and the Tax Court granted their motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">We cannot find a single published opinion supporting the Commissioner\u2019s position. In <em>Beyer v. </em>Commissioner<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, the Fourth Circuit considered and decided this very issue. After thoroughly reviewing the legislative history of Section 163(d), that court found that \u201cCongress did not intend to impose a limitation on the carry-over of investment interest based on taxable income.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since the <em>Beyer </em>decision, every court that has considered this issue \u2014 two other Courts of Appeals and several district courts \u2014 had also rejected the Commissioner\u2019s position, finding that the carryover deduction of investment interest is not limited to taxable income.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">We agree with the reasoning in these cases and conclude, as did they, that in enacting Section 163(d), Congress evidenced no intent to limit the investment interest expense carryover to the amount of a taxpayer\u2019s taxable income. Here, the Taxpayers were entitled to their claimed deductions of investment interest expense for 1985 and 1986, and the district court properly granted their motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">The government\u2019s assessment of deficiencies in the Taxpayers\u2019 income taxes, and its appeal based on the same statutory interpretation previously rejected by the Fourth Circuit, the Federal Circuit, and several district courts<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> constitutes \u201ccircuit-shopping\u201d at the Taxpayers\u2019 expense in the hopes of creating a circuit conflict. Under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430, a taxpayer who establishes that \u201cthe position of the United States in the proceeding was not substantially justified\u201d may recover the reasonable costs of litigation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Commissioner\u2019s repeated losses on the identical issue establish beyond serious question that the government\u2019s actions in assessing the deficiencies, litigating again an issue so consistently lost, and appealing the grant of the Taxpayers\u2019 motion for summary judgment, were not \u201cjustified to a degree that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>could satisfy a reasonable person.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">We have previously ruled that, while the Commissioner is free by law to relitigate prior lost issues in other circuits, he does so at the risk of incurring the obligation to reimburse the taxpayer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, in continuing to litigate this issue despite constant jurisprudence to the contrary, the Commissioner is not substantially justified and should bear all reasonable costs of Taxpayers\u2019 litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Tax Court\u2019s order granting the Taxpayers\u2019 motion for summary judgment and invite counsel for the Taxpayers to file an application in accordance with Federal Circuit Rule 47.7(b)(2) for reasonable costs, including attorney fees, under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430.</p>\n<p id=\"ATi\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-17\">. <em>See Harris v.
