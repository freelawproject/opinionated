Because we conclude that Debtor\u2019s former law firm does not have standing to file such a motion, we affirm the denial of counsel\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">On May 26, 1993, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas entered a memorandum opinion granting Debtor\u2019s application to employ Wright Killen as an industry consultant <em>nunc pro tunc.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This opinion was published at <em>In re El Paso Refinery, L.P., </em>155 B.R. 418 (Bankr.W.D.Tex.1993). Debtor\u2019s former counsel, Andrews &amp; Kurth (\u201cA &amp; K\u201d) law firm, read the opinion in the advance sheets and took exception to some of the language in it, claiming that it is erroneous and wrongly casts the firm in an unfavorable light.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">The gist of the bankruptcy judge\u2019s opinion was that he granted Debtor\u2019s <em>nunc pro tunc </em>application, over the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s objection, based upon his conclusion that Wright Killen was not at fault for the delay in filing its employment application. Instead, the bankruptcy court found that it was A &amp; K\u2019s fault that the application had not been filed sooner. Accordingly, the judge decided not to penalize Wright Killen for what it viewed as A &amp; K\u2019s error. A <em>&amp; </em>K did not participate in the hearing on the application, as it was no longer serving as Debtor\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">Months later, after reading the opinion in the advance sheets, A <em>&amp; </em>K filed a Rule 60(b) motion to revoke the order approving Wright Killen\u2019s employment because of its quarrel with the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings and comments about A &amp; K, which it claims are wrongfully injurious to the firm\u2019s reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">In particular, A &amp; K objects to the bankruptcy judge\u2019s finding of fact that Wright Killen had provided copies of its employment contract to A &amp; K so that counsel could file an application seeking authorization to employ Wright Killen. The firm asserts that this finding is erroneous, that no employment contract ever was provided to A &amp; K by Wright Killen. A &amp; K claims that the court\u2019s finding was based upon untrue testimony given by Wright Killen at the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">The firm also objects to language in the opinion whereby the court found that Wright Killen performed services for the Debtor from approximately October 14,1992 through the first week of December 1992, \u201c[i]n reb-anee on counsel\u2019s representations and assurances that they would take care of filing the application to employ.\u201d <em>In re El Paso Refinery, L.P., supra, </em>at 419. A &amp; K contends that even if the employment contract and other documents needed to obtain court approval were delivered to A &amp; K during the first week of November 1992, as Wright Kil-len\u2019s representative testified at the hearing, the court\u2019s statement that Wright Killen relied on A &amp; K\u2019s assurances beginning <em>October Hth </em>is clearly erroneous. A &amp; K claims that its attorneys did not even meet Mr. Dudley, Wright Killen\u2019s representative, prior to October 23, 1992. Moreover, A &amp; K asserts that it told Wright Killen that it would have to have a copy of the employment contract and a certificate of disinterestedness, as required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>by the Bankruptcy Code, before it could file the employment application.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">The firm also quibbles with the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding of fact that A &amp; K was replaced on January 20, 1993 by Debtor\u2019s current counsel, Kemp, Smith, Duncan &amp; Hammond (\u201cKemp Smith\u201d). A &amp; K acknowledges that this finding is technically accurate, because January 20, 1993 is the date the order approving Kemp Smith was entered. However, A &amp; K contends that Kemp Smith was involved in this case from the outset and had already taken over as Debtor\u2019s primary bankruptcy attorney by early November 1992. A &amp; K also takes offense at other language in the opinion whereby the bankruptcy court, in approving the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>employment application, noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">The reason [the application] was never filed was due solely to the failure of [A &amp; K] to act as they represented they would_ Wright Killen was not responsible for their application not being filed. [A &amp; K] was. It would be unjust and improper to penalize Wright Killen for the failure of [A &amp; K] to perform their duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahq\"><em>In re El Paso Refinery, L.P., supra, </em>at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The A &amp; K firm asserts that these comments are erroneous and severely injurious. It claims that up to now A &amp; K has enjoyed a reputation as an excellent and highly capable bankruptcy firm, but now its reputation has been damaged as a result of the published opinion criticizing it. A &amp; K claims that the opinion could be used in the future to prevent the firm from being hired in bankruptcy cases, as court approval is usually required for a firm\u2019s employment to represent a bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The bankruptcy court denied A &amp; K\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion to revoke the employment order and published opinion, noting that A &amp; K is not an interested party, nor was it affected by the order in question. The judge stated that the motion was \u201cat best an attempt to appeal and/or collaterally attack an order previously entered which has no direct effect upon the movant.\u201d A &amp; K appealed to the district court for the Western District of Texas, which affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order denying the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">We review a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion only for abuse of discretion. <em>Latha</em>m <em>v. Wells Fargo Bank, </em>987 F.2d 1199 (5th Cir.1993); <em>First Nationwide Bank v. Summer House Joint Venture, </em>902 F.2d 1197 (5th Cir.1990); <em>Aucoin v. K-Mart Apparel Fashion Corp., </em>943 F.2d 6 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">At issue is whether Debtor\u2019s former counsel, A &amp; K, has standing to file a Rule 60(b) motion. A &amp; K contends that it does have standing. It makes three separate arguments in support of its view that it has standing to file a Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">A &amp; K contends that it qualifies as \u201ca party\u2019s legal representative,\u201d as that term is used in Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), enabling it to file such a motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A &amp; K also claims that it is a \u201cparty in interest\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109(b) and has status to intervene in the proceedings via a Rule 60(b) motion because it is debtor\u2019s former counsel and therefore a creditor of the debtor\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, A &amp; K argues that it is entitled to standing under principles of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-16\">We are not persuaded by any of A &amp; K\u2019s arguments that it has standing to file a Rule 60(b) motion. This opinion will separately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>address each of the three theories under which A &amp; K claims to derive standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\n<em>1. \u201cA party\u2019s legal representative\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">A &amp; K claims that it meets the definition of \u201ca party\u2019s legal representative\u201d for purposes of Rule 60(b) because it served as Debtor\u2019s counsel. We reject this argument. The phrase \u201ca party\u2019s legal representative\u201d means one who stands in the place and stead of another, such as an heir at law. <em>Mobay Chemical Co. v. Hudson Foam Plastics Corp., </em>277 F.Supp. 413 (S.D.N.Y.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The term was intended to reach \u201conly those individuals who were in a position tantamount to that of a party or whose legal rights were otherwise so intimately bound up with the parties that their rights were directly affected by the final judgment.\u201d <em>Kem Mfg. Corp. v. Wilder, </em>817 F.2d 1517 (11th Cir.1987).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <em>Kem </em>definition of \u201clegal representative\u201d was cited with approval by this Court in <em>Harrell v. DCS Equipment Leasing Corp., </em>951 F.2d 1453 (5th Cir.1992). Other courts have taken a very similar approach to <em>Kem </em>in analyzing standing issues under Rule 60(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\"><em>We </em>conclude that the phrase \u201clegal representative\u201d as used in Rule 60(b) does not include counsel within the context of the attorney-client relationship. We cannot say that A &amp; K was in a position \u201ctantamount\u201d to Debtor\u2019s, nor were its rights so intimately bound up with Debtor\u2019s that A &amp; K\u2019s rights were <em>directly affected </em>by the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">At least three courts, including our colleagues of the Tenth Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit, have specifically held that an attorney does <em>not </em>qualify as a \u201clegal representative\u201d of a party for purposes of Rule 60(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rule 60(b) on its face makes no provision for a motion otherwise to be brought by a party\u2019s counsel. In addition, A &amp; K has produced no Fifth Circuit authority on point indicating that the rule notwithstanding its literal language should be read to include one in A &amp; K\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">Moreover, even if we were to conclude that an attomey-at-law may in some circumstances have standing to file a Rule 60(b) motion, it must not be overlooked that A &amp; K was not Debtor\u2019s counsel at the time of the filing of either the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>application of the Debtor or the 60(b) motion of A &amp; K, but was the Debtor\u2019s <em>former </em>counsel. Even if the term \u201clegal representative\u201d were construed to include a party\u2019s attorney-at-law, the term certainly should not extend to a party\u2019s <em>former </em>counsel. In light of these facts, we cannot say that the bankruptcy judge abused his discretion in denying A &amp; K\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">\n<em>2. Status as a creditor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">A &amp; K also claims that it has standing as a <em>creditor </em>to challenge the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>appointment of Wright Killen under 11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1109(b). We reject this contention as well, finding it to be both specious and disingenuous. A <em>&amp; </em>K does not really challenge the appointment of Wright Killen <em>per se; </em>instead, it merely objects to the court\u2019s comments about A &amp; K in the published opinion. Thus, A &amp; K\u2019s 60(b) motion did not really seek to assert its rights as a <em>creditor, </em>instead, it sought to remedy the court\u2019s characterization of A &amp; K\u2019s performance in its role as <em>Debtor\u2019s prior </em>counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Had A &amp; K opposed the appointment of Wright Killen because it was afraid its position as a creditor might be compromised, i.e., that funds expended toward Wright Killen\u2019s employment would jeopardize A &amp; K\u2019s chance of being paid, it could have done so; however, A &amp; K did not oppose the appointment at the hearing \u2014 only the IRS did. A &amp; K merely quibbles with the <em>reasons </em>enunciated by the bankruptcy judge in his approval of Wright Killen\u2019s employment. In light of these facts, we reject as meritless A &amp; K\u2019s argument that it is entitled to file a Rule 60(b) motion seeking revocation of the order by virtue of its status as a creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\n<em>3. \u201cInterests of justice\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">We also reject A &amp; K\u2019s argument that the interests of justice require that their Rule 60(b) motion be granted. The bankruptcy judge was in an optimal position to determine whether the arguments forwarded by A &amp; K in its motion warranted relief under Rule 60(b). We cannot say it was an abuse of discretion for the court to deny the motion, or that the interests of justice require that the district court be reversed. To the contrary, as a matter of policy, it would not be in the interest of justice or judicial economy for federal courts to have to entertain motions from every individual who quarrels with the wording of an opinion or claims offense at some language contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s order and opinion had no real operative effect upon A &amp; K in this case. Although A &amp; K clearly was blamed for the delay in filing the employment application, the firm was not fined or forced to pay Wright Killen\u2019s fees as part of the court\u2019s order. It was not directly penalized at all by the judge\u2019s ruling. In fact, A &amp; K admittedly did not even know about the opinion until months after it was issued. Whether the judge\u2019s characterization of A &amp; K\u2019s performance regarding the employment application in this case might have some negative effect on the firm in the future is speculative at best. We are not persuaded that this is a situation in which the interests of justice require that the opinion be withdrawn. Accordingly, A &amp; K\u2019s \u201cinterests of justice\u201d argument fails as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Finding no abuse of discretion, we AFFIRM the denial of A &amp; K\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-11\">. Wright Killen had not obtained prior court authorization of its employment, although it had already performed services for Debtor. Thus, its employment application was sought <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>meaning \"now for then.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 964 (5th ed. 1979). <em>Nunc pro tunc </em>orders are allowed in bankruptcy proceedings where the judge feels that circumstances require it, as a result of a previous oversight or omission. <em>In re MortgageAmerica Corp., </em>831 F.2d 97 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\">. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) provides that \u2018\u2018[o]n motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve <em>a party or a party\u2019s legal representative </em>from a final judgment, order, or proceeding (emphasis added)\u201d in certain situations, including <em>inter alia: </em>(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; ... (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; ... or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"AZU\">Fed.R.Bankr.P. 9024 makes Fed.R.Civ.P. 60 applicable to bankruptcy proceedings. Thus, a party or a party\u2019s legal representative may file a Rule 60(b) motion in a bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b327-18\">. Section 1109(b) provides, in pertinent part, that \"[a] party in interest, including ... a creditor ... may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue in a case under this chapter.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b328-8\">. A &amp; K contends that under <em>Kem, </em>an attorney for a party may qualify as a legal representative under Rule 60(b); however, we disagree. The court in <em>Kem </em>analyzed whether the movant had standing by considering whether the final judgment therein directly affected any property or other legal right of the movant. Andrews &amp; Kurth relies on language therein which suggests that an attorney may qualify as representative of a party. However, the movant in <em>Kem </em>was not an attorney; therefore, the Court\u2019s comments are merely <em>dicta.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b328-9\">. <em>See e.g., In re Ewing, </em>54 B.R. 952 (D.C.Co.1985) (real estate broker did not have standing to file a motion to reconsider denial of Debtor\u2019s motion to have broker appointed as exclusive broker for sale of real property); <em>Screven v.
