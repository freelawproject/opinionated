Each petitioner is an elector who, in a timely manner, submitted written comments about the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title, pursuant to ORS 250.067(1). Accordingly, each is entitled to seek a different title in this court. ORS 250.085(2). We have considered each of petitioners\u2019 arguments concerning the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title. We conclude that none demonstrates a failure on the part of the Attorney General to comply substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2). <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(5) (establishing this court\u2019s standard of review). Accordingly, we certify the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The referred measure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">\u201cBe it Resolved by the Legislative Assembly of the State of Oregon:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">\u201cPARAGRAPH 1. Section 8, Article I of the Constitution of the State of Oregon, is amended to read:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">Sec. 8. (1) No law shall be passed restraining the free expression of opinion, or restricting the right to speak, write, or print freely on any subject whatever; but every person shall be responsible for the abuse of this right. [-]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-10\">(2) Obscenity, including child pornography, shall receive no greater protection under this Constitution than afforded by the Constitution of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-11\">\u201cPARAGRAPH 2. The Amendment proposed by this resolution shall be submitted to the people for their approval or rejection at the next regular general election held throughout this state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">(Boldface in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">In referring SJR 41 to the voters, the legislature created its own ballot title, but the Governor vetoed the act that contained that ballot title. Therefore, the Attorney General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>prepared a proposed ballot title pursuant to ORS 250.075<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, after the comment period provided by ORS 250.067(1), certified the following ballot title for SJR 41 to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: OBSCENITY MAY RECEIVE NO GREATER PROTECTION THAN UNDER FEDERAL CONSTITUTION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018YES\u2019 VOTE: \u201cYes\u2019 vote limits free speech protection for \u2018obscenity, including child pornography to federal constitution\u2019s level.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote retains Oregon Constitution\u2019s current right to speak freely on any subject, including obscenity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">\u201cSUMMARY: Amends Oregon Constitution. Oregon Constitution now protects the \u2018right to speak, write, or print freely on any subject.\u2019 The Oregon Supreme Court has held that provision protects obscenity. United States Constitution\u2019s free speech provision does not currently protect obscenity. Measure would state that \u2018obscenity, including child pornography,\u2019 may receive no greater protection than under United States Constitution. Measure thus would remove Oregon Constitution\u2019s current protection for obscenity. Measure would limit state judges\u2019 authority to interpret free speech provision as applied to obscenity, including child pornography.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">We shall discuss the parties\u2019 various contentions on a petitioner-by-petitioner basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>PETITIONERS MANNIX AND MARSHALL</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Petitioner Mannix was one of the chief sponsors of SJR 41 in the legislature. Petitioner Marshall is a supporter of the measure. They challenge all parts of the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The ballot title is to contain a Caption of not more than 10 words which \u201creasonably identifies the subject matter of the state measure.\u201d ORS 250.035(2)(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioners challenged the Attorney General\u2019s Caption for omitting the words, \u201cincluding child pornography,\u201d in the Caption. Those words appear in the measure itself, petitioners argue, thus \u201cindicat[ing] the importance of the language.\u201d \u201cAdditionally,\u201d they argue, \u201cbecause it cannot be assumed that all voters will understand that obscenity includes child pornography, the omission of [that phrase] is misleading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\"> The foregoing argument ignores the function of the Caption, which is to identify the <em>subject </em>of the measure. By its own wording, the <em>subject </em>of the measure is \u201cobscenity.\u201d True, the measure says that obscenity \u201cincludes child pornography,\u201d but that very statement demonstrates that child pornography is considered by the draftees to be a <em>subset </em>of the larger subject, obscenity. It is not a necessary function of a Caption to list subsets of a measure\u2019s subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Moreover, we note that the wording of the Attorney General\u2019s Caption tracks, almost verbatim, the wording of the subsection that would be added to the Oregon Constitution by SJR 41. It is an accurate statement of the subject of the proposed measure. Petitioners\u2019 challenge to the Attorney General\u2019s Caption is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Petitioners Mannix and Marshall next challenge the Attorney General\u2019s Statement of Result of \u201cYes\u201d Vote as \u201cmisleading.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Statement tells voters that a \u201cYes\u201d vote \u201climits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>free speech protection for \u2018obscenity, including child pornography\u2019 to federal constitution\u2019s level.\u201d Petitioners object to the Statement\u2019s use of the term, \u201cfree speech.\u201d That term, petitioners argue, is inappropriate, because Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution, protects more than \u201cspeech\u201d \u2014 it protects <em>expression.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">We agree with petitioners\u2019 description of the scope of Article I, section 8, but disagree with the conclusions that they draw. This court has, on at least two occasions, approved ballot titles that used the same term in describing the scope of Article I, section 8. <em>See Mannix v. Keisling, </em>317 Or 598, 858 P2d 1306 (1993) (certifying ballot titles for two measures under previous law); <em>Arenz v. Keisling, </em>317 Or 349, 855 P2d 1109 (1993) (same re single measure). The Attorney General asserts \u2014 and we agree \u2014 that the term \u201cis a simple and familiar term that voters will understand.\u201d It represents a useful shorthand for Article I, section 8, that probably is less confusing than would be the term \u201cfreedom of expression.\u201d At least, petitioners have failed to show that the Attorney General did not comply substantially with applicable law in using the term that he chose.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In the alternative, petitioners argue that the term is not impartial. Petitioners do not explain how that is so, and we do not find the proposition self-evident. If petitioners are concerned (as suggested by the brief of the Attorney General) that the term is <em>biased, </em>because \u201cmost citizens believe that freedom of speech is a good thing,\u201d that problem arises, not out of the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title, but out of the nature of the constitutional provision that SJR 41 proposes to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Finally, petitioners argue that the use of the word \u201climits\u201d in the \u201cYes\u201d Statement is impermissible, because that word implies \u201ca negative rather than a positive statement.\u201d We reject that argument. Use of the term is accurate: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>The measure proposes a new limit on the protection currently afforded to certain forms of expression under Article I, section 8. So understood, it is correct to say that the measure \u201climits\u201d speech. Petitioners have failed to show that the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cYes\u201d Statement does not comply substantially with ORS 250.035(2)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Petitioners Mannix and Marshall next challenge the Attorney General\u2019s Statement of Result of \u201cNo\u201d Vote as \u201cmisleading.\u201d That Statement says that a \u201cNo\u201d vote \u201cretains Oregon Constitution\u2019s current right to speak freely on any subject, including obscenity.\u201d This is misleading, petitioners argue, because there are exceptions to the right to speak, as this court noted in <em>State v. Henry, </em>302 Or 510, 732 P2d 9 (1987). Petitioners\u2019 point eludes us. The \u201cNo\u201d Statement is accurate: Voting \u201cNo\u201d leaves Article I, section 8, exactly \u201cas is.\u201d The Attorney General\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d Statement complies substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Finally, ORS 250.035(2)(d) requires that a ballot title contain a summary of not more than 85 words \u201csummarizing the measure and its major effect.\u201d Petitioners Mannix and Marshall challenge the Attorney General\u2019s Summary as \u201cinaccurate, misleading and not impartial.\u201d They maintain that the assertion in the Summary that this court \u201chas held that [Article I, section 8,] protects obscenity\u2019 is misleading because, they argue, \u201cobscenity is <em>not </em>fully protected from governmental interference in Oregon.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Petitioners\u2019 argument is premised on the implied assertion that the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title states that obscenity is protected \u201cfully\u201d by Article I, section 8. That premise is wrong; therefore, petitioners\u2019 argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Petitioners make two further arguments with respect to the Summary that are based on the same theories that they advanced concerning the Caption and the \u2018Yes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d questions. We answered those arguments in connection with those other parts of the ballot title, and need not repeat the answers here.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Finally, petitioners assert that the last sentence of the Summary is misleading. That sentence states that the \u201c[m]easure would limit state judges\u2019 authority to interpret free speech provision as applied to obscenity, including child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>pornography.\u201d That sentence is misleading, petitioners assert, because <em>\u201ca </em>state court\u2019s authority to interpret a constitutional provision is always limited by the language of the constitution itself.\u201d Such a statement, petitioners argue, is \u201cspeculative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">We disagree. The statement is precisely correct in its description of what the measure would do. It would eliminate any possibility that an Oregon judge would hold that such protections of obscenity as might be available under Article I, section 8, are any greater than those available under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, although the two constitutional provisions have different wording.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">We hold that, with respect to the challenges by petitioners Mannix and Marshall, the Summary in the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title complies substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(d). We turn to the challenges mounted by other petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">PETITIONER KANE</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Petitioner Kane is an elector who timely participated in the process for review of the joint ballot title. He challenges all parts of the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title. Most of petitioner Kane\u2019s arguments are disposed of by what has been said already. We deal here only with his arguments that are dissimilar.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Petitioner challenges the Statement of Result of \u201cNo\u201d Vote in the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title on the ground that the Statement fails to notify the voter that the protection afforded to obscenity under Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution, is limited, among other ways, by the possibility that a person who produces obscenity will be held responsible in an action for civil damages for any harm caused thereby. <em>See Henry, </em>302 Or at 514 (suggesting that possibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">We reject the foregoing argument, because there is no way, given the 15-word limitation on it, that the Statement could both retain the present accurate information that it contains and at the same time include the additional information that petitioner urges that it should contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Petitioner argues, in the alternative, that the \u201cYes\u201d vote Statement and the \u201cNo\u201d vote Statement, when read together, violate ORS 250.035(3). That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\">\u201cThe statements required by subsection (2)(b) and (c) of this section shall be written so that, to the extent practical, the language of the two statements is parallel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The wording of that statute \u2014 \u201cto the extent practical\u201d\u2014 answers petitioner\u2019s argument: Given the nature of the proposal before us, it simply is not \u201cpractical\u201d to produce two statements that utilize completely parallel wording.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Petitioner also argues that the two Statements are not understandable. We do not agree. Petitioner\u2019s challenges to the \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d vote Statements are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Petitioner challenges the Summary in the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title, advancing several arguments. All either are answered fully by our discussion of the challenges made by petitioners Mannix and Marshall or do not merit separate discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">PETITIONERS HULL, GARMAN, AND WEBSTER</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">Petitioners Hull, Garman, and Webster are three electors who oppose S JR 41. They accept the \u201cNo\u201d vote Statement, but challenge all other parts of the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-10\">With respect to the Caption, petitioners argue:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-11\">\u201cAnyone familiar with the political dialogue of this State in recent years knows what this measure is about: it is about the effort to cut back on constitutional protection for speech that the proponents of this measure consider to be obscene. Specifically, it is about the effort to overturn, through constitutional amendment, the decision in <em>State v. Henry </em>* * *. Voters are entitled to be told, in the caption itself, that they are being asked to limit free speech protection, and to remove constitutional protection from a class of speech that is now protected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">Based on the foregoing analysis, petitioners assert that this court should adopt one of three alternative Captions, each of which focuses on the impact of the proposed measure on free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The difficulty that we have with petitioners\u2019 argument is that it does not demonstrate how the Attorney General\u2019s Caption is not <em>also </em>a permissible way to tell the voter what (to use the wording of the pertinent statute, ORS 250.035(2)(a)), the \u201csubject matter\u201d of the measure is. Thus, assuming that one or another of petitioners\u2019 alternative Captions would have been permissible or even \u201cbetter,\u201d there is no basis for holding that the Attorney General committed legal error in adopting the one that he chose.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Petitioners next challenge the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cYes\u201d vote Statement on two grounds. The first ground mirrors their argument with respect to the Caption, and we reject it for the reasons already expressed. The second ground states: \u201c[The Statement] should not make reference to \u2018child pornography,\u2019 for to do so implies that the measure will effect a change in an existing constitutional protection for that kind of material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The proposed measure nowhere contains a definition of \u201cchild pornography.\u201d We know of no other source that could provide us with the definition of that concept as intended by the drafters of the measure. And, because the \u201ckind of material\u201d embraced by the term \u201cchild pornography\u201d is not clear, neither is it clear whether the measure \u201cwill effect a change in an existing constitutional protection\u201d for it. Faced with that definitional problem, the Attorney General simply chose to quote the actual wording of the measure. That was a permissible choice. Petitioners\u2019 challenge to the Attorney General\u2019s Statement is not well taken.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Finally, petitioners challenge the Attorney General\u2019s Summary on two grounds. First, petitioners argue that the Summary is misleading in that it fails to acknowledge that, in spite of the fact that obscenity is protected expression under Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution, it still is possible for obscenity to be regulated in a variety of ways. <em>See Henry, </em>302 Or at 525; <em>City of Portland v. Tidyman, </em>306 Or 174, 191, 759 P2d 242 (1988) (both so suggesting). The Attorney General declined to speculate \u2014 and it would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>been speculation \u2014 about tbe scope of permissible regulation of obscenity. Declining to do so was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Second, petitioners challenge the final sentence of the Summary, which we repeat here for convenience: \u201cMeasure would limit state judges\u2019 authority to interpret free speech provision as applied to obscenity, including child pornography.\u201d Petitioners assert that the sentence is under-inclusive and, therefore, misleading, because it fails to note that the limit that the proposed measure would impose on the power of judges is matched by an increase in the power of legislative bodies to \u201ccensor\u201d a certain form of expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">We disagree with petitioners that such a statement must be included in the Summary. Whatever consequences <em>might </em>occur if the proposed measure were adopted, the measure patently contains a limitation on the authority of state judges to utilize any authority other than the United States Constitution in considering the constitutionality of laws regulating obscenity. The Attorney General did not err in confining his discussion of the effects of the proposed measure in the Summary to those that would be certain to occur if the measure passed. Petitioners\u2019 challenge to the Attorney General\u2019s Summary is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In summary, we hold that the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title substantially complies with the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Ballot title certified. This decision shall become effective in accordance with ORAP 11.30(10).</p>\n<author id=\"b544-8\">FADELEY, J.,</author>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b537-9\"> ORS 250.075 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">\u201c(1) When the Legislative Assembly refers a measure to the people, a ballot title for the measure may be prepared by the assembly.

The only substantive change was the replacement of the former requirement, under ORS 250.035(1)(b), that the ballot title contain a question of not more than 20 words, an affirmative answer to which would lead to an affirmative vote for the proposed measure, with two 15-word statements designed to inform the voter of the consequences of a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno\u201d vote.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b538-10\"> ORS 250.035(2)(b) (enacted as part of Oregon Laws 1995, ch 534, \u00a7 1) requires that each ballot title for a state measure contain a \u201csimple and understandable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>statement of not more than 15 words that describes the result if the state measure is approved.\u201d The statement required by this paragraph shall include either the phrase, \u201cI vote\u201d or \u201cvote yes,\u201d or a substantially similar phrase, which may be placed at any point within the statement.\u201d Under ORS 250.035(4), the \u201cyes\u201d statement \u201cshall be written so that an affirmative response to the statement corresponds to an affirmative vote on the state measure.\u201d This court reviews for substantial compliance with the foregoing requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\"> Petitioners challenge the \u201cNo\u201d vote Statement on the same grounds.
