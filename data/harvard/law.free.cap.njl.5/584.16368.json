That they did then prosecute the bill before justice <em>Vermvle, </em>when <em>Drake </em>applied to them and offered to pay them 20 dollars, and give them \u00e1 new note, with other security, payable in one year; that they received 15 dollars from <em>Drake, </em>and agreed to give him further time ; that this was done without the knowledge or consent of said Manning; that since that time, <em>to wit, </em>on the 18th of <em>June </em>1819, <em>Drake </em>assigned away his property and stopped payment; and that from the time of discontinuing the suit before justice <em>Vermule, </em>to the time of bringing the presentaction, he had paid debts to a considerable amount. *A11 which evidence was overruled and the jury found a verdict, and judgment was rendered against both defendants for 82 dollars and 90 cents.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>The counsel for the plaintiff, (Ghetwood)</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFx\">relied for the reversal of the judgment, on the overruling this evidence alone, and referred to 7 <em>John. </em>337. 10 <em>John. </em>595.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b209-10\"><em> </em>See <em>Pintard vs. Davis, Spen. 205, 1 Zab. 632.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANM\">The defence in this case, in my opinion, is wholly insufficient in the law, and wholly unsupported by any case or principle of decision in <em>New-Jersey. </em>Therefore, let the'judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b210-9\">Rossell J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIL\">was of the same opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"b210-10\">Southard J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agf\">Upon the admissibility of this evidence, it is proper to remark, 1. That no difficulty arises from the mode in which the defendant, <em>Manning, </em>pleaded. In the court in which he was, there is no necessity for a written plea, in any case, except where it is specially pointed out by the statute. If the defence, therefore, was a good one, the evidence was competent under the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">2. If the facts, offered to be proved, are sufficient to discharge the security from a liability to pay a sealed bill, he had a right, in that court, to avail himself of the defence. If he can prove the facts; and those facts discharged him from the debt; those facts may be proved in an ordinary suit, on the bill, in a court of law. There is nothing in the nature or character of the defence which requires him to seek protection in a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">3. The facts offered to be proved, present this question. Can a security upon a sealed instrument, after the day of payment is passed, require the creditor to prosecute; and if he does prosecute and afterwards, without the knowledge and consent of the security, alters the mode and extends the time of payment; so that the principal fails and security is thereby injured, will he be discharged? And I think the question may very safely be answered in the affirmative. The rights of a security are always favoured. He is bound to the extent of his undertaking, but no farther; Neither the creditor, the principal, the court, nor any other power, can carry his engagement beyond what he has consented to. A new contract cannot be made for him, without his consent. It is true, a mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>delay in calling on his principal, will not, either *at law or equity, discharge him; because such delay is presumed to be with his approbation, unless it otherwise appears. But if he objects to the delay; if, at his request, the. creditor agrees to enforce the payment, and commenees a suit, he ought not afterwards to violate the agreement, select another day and mode of payment, and thus create a new contract against his will. For the overruling of this evidence, therefore, I think the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
