At the proper time, the defendant pleaded title to the land, from which the rails and wood were taken, and tendered to the justice, a bond, executed according to the statute; but the justice refused to receive it, \u201c as he could not conceive that the title of land could in any way come in question, as the controversy respected a quantity of rails, which, in his opinion, were moveable property, and not attached to the freehold.\u201d The verdict and judgment were for 9 dollars, 75 cents.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-11\"><em>Halsey, </em>for plaintiff in <em>certiorari,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-PW\">relied upon several reasons, but it is necessary to notice only the rejection of the plea and bond, by the justice.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-12\"><em>Dod, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b320-14\">\n<em> Van Mater vs. Real, Pen. *472.

The form of the action is nothing. The statute constituting courts for the trial of small causes, sec. 33, says, <em>\u201c </em>that when, in <em>any </em>action, to be brought by virtue of this act, the defendant shall, as a justification, ple^d title to any real estate, in himself or another, under whom he acted or entered, such defendant shall commit the said plea to writing, and having signed tho same, shall deliver such plea to said justice, who <em>shall countersign, </em>and deliver it to the plaintiff,\u201d &amp;c. This judgment must, therefore, be <em>reversed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
