The plaintiffs produced, proved, and read in evidence, a bfu 0f sale, dated the 6th of <em>November, </em>1816, from one . . . <em>Elijah Day, </em>to them, with an inventory of certain goods thereto annexed, being'the goods stated in the declaration. They then offered <em>Day </em>as a witness, to whose competency the defendant objected, and in support 0f the objection, offered and read in evidence, a petition of his, as an insolvent debtor, to the Court of Common Pleas of the county of <em>Essex, </em>dated the 18th day of <em>November, </em>1816; also a schedule and inventory thereunto annexed ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>and a certain order or decree of the court for his discharge, dated the 23d of <em>December, </em>183 6. Also, a deed of assign-ment, made by him, to one <em>William R. Williamson, </em>in pursuance of the said order or decree, 'dated the 23d of <em>December, </em>1816. The plaintiffs then, and before the court had given any opinion, tendered and delivered, to said <em>Day, </em>a deed of release, bearing date the day of 1819; and again offered him as a witness, and the defendant again objected to his admission, which objection the court overruled, and permitted him to be sworn; whereupon he did testify, that some time in <em>July, </em>1816, he received of <em>W R. Williamson, </em>esq., now deceased, the sum of $137, in trust, to be delivered to <em>Robert Mount, </em>in the city of <em>New-York, </em>for whom <em>W. R. Williamson, </em>who was an attorney at law, had collected the same. A paper in the hand-writing of <em>W. R. Williamson, </em>esq., containing a statement of said money, and of the delivery thereof to <em>Day, </em>for <em>Mount, </em>was then produced ; and being admitted, was read in evidence. <em>Day </em>then further testified, that having occasion for the use of said money, he had applied it to his own use ; then intending shortly to have replaced it and paid it over to <em>Mount; </em>but that, in fact, he never had so paid it. That on the 6th day of <em>November, </em>1816, he was indebted to <em>John C. Grane, </em>the other plaintiff, upon a promissory note, bearing date the 1st of <em>July, </em>1816, for $175, payable twelve months after date, \u2022which note was produced and read in evidence. That in the spring of 1815, he commenced business as a storekeeper, in <em>Elizaibeth-Town, </em>and soon afterwards took one <em>Thomson </em>into partnership with him; that shortly after, <em>Thomson </em>failed, leaving a considerable partnership debt unpaid; that after <em>Thomson\u2019s </em>failure, he continued in business, on his own account, until the fall of 1816, when he became embarrassed, and was committed to gaol, in the borough of <em>Elizabeth-Town, </em>on an execution, at the suit of <em>Halsey Munson, </em>and obtained the privilege of the limits of the prison. That on the day of <em>November, </em>1816, being indebted to defendant, in the sum of $440 or thereabouts, partly on his own account, and principally on account of <em>Day </em>and <em>Thomson, </em>he made an assignment, or bill of sale, by way of mortgage, of all his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>household furniture and goods, to the defendant, to secure him the said money; which bill of sale was produced ' an(j read in evidence ; that on the 7th day of <em>April, </em>1818, not having paid 'defendant the money intended to be secured to him by said assignment, he delivered to him all the goods and furniture contained in the said bill of sale, in satisfaction of the said debt, and took his receipt for the same, which was produced and read ; that while he was on the limits, and before the bill of sale was made to the plaintiffs, and after the defendant had been secured by an assignment of the witness\u2019 furniture, defendant came to witness, and proposed, or recommended to him, to take some of his goods out of *the store, and put them away, as otherwise he would have to give them all up to his creditors; that witness told him he did not wish to take any more of them than would be sufficient to secure to the <em>plaintiffs </em>the moneys he owed them; that in the night of the 6th of <em>November, </em>1816, or soon afterwards, about eleven o\u2019clock at night, he went to his store, in company with the plaintiff, <em>John G. Grane, </em>and the de^ fendant; and that they measured and inventoried the goods in the declaration, and in the invoice to the plaintiff\u2019s bill of sale annexed, mentioned ; that they packed up the goods so invoiced, and requested the defendant to take charge of them ; that he at first declined, but at last consented that they might be put in his cellar ; that the cask was then put in his cellar, and it was twelve o\u2019clock at night before they were done ; that he went at night, because he did not wish to be seen off the limits ; that he afterwards made an assignment of all the rest of his goods and property, in the store, to <em>Jonathan B. Dayton, </em>and for the benefit of his individual creditors, as' he thought he was bound to. pay them, out of his own property, in preference to the creditors of <em>Day &amp; Thomson. </em>Being cross-examined, he stated, that- he could not tell whether the bill of sale to plaintiffs, was executed the day it bears date, but thought it was delivered to <em>John G. Crane, </em>the first time he saw him after the night spoken of, and before he was discharged from confinement. Witness supposed, from what he said to the defendant, previous to putting up the goods, and from what passed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>when the goods were invoiced, that the defendant knew, and understood that they were to secure and satisfy to the plaintiffs, the moneys due them. In the summer of 1817, he went in defendant\u2019s cellar, in company with him, to see whether the goods were not injured by lying. The four or five last articles on the invoice, being of a perishable nature, were used by defendant, with his consent, and some of them by himself. Being asked whether he was not indebted to <em>John C. Crane, </em>in the sum of $175, at the time he gave him the note, he answered, that he could not say that he was, he supposed the note would charge him for that amount; he did not think, himself, he owed <em>Crane </em>so much ; but there were considerable accounts between them. <em>Crane </em>made up the account, and said the balance was $175, but he did not think there was quite so much due, but could not say, certainly, how much. Defendant *then gave in evidence a bond and mortgage of lands, given by <em>Day </em>to him, for $750, bearing date the 1st of <em>May, </em>1815. Plaintiff proved a demand and refusal of the goods, at two or three different times, about the 20th or 25th <em>May. </em>The writ in this cause was issued on or after the 20th of <em>May, </em>1818. The testimony being closed, the defendant, by his counsel, called on the court to charge the jury, that if they should find that the bill of sale was fraudulently made by <em>Day </em>to the plaintiffs, that then they were not entitled to recover of the defendant: whereupon the court charged the jury, that whether the bill of sale was fraudulent or not, was for their determination ; but that if the plaintiffs and <em>Day </em>had contrived it fraudulently between them, for covenous purposes, it was, nevertheless, valid, as between those who were the parties to <em>it; </em>that the statute had, indeed, declared it void, as against the creditors of <em>Day; </em>and if fraudulent, it was absolutely void, as against them, whenever they, or any of them, should seize the goods by legal process, as the property of <em>Day; </em>but that as to the defendant, they were only stored in his cellar, without a claim of title to them in him; and that whether the bill of sale was, or was not, fraudulent, as to creditors, the plaintiffs had a right to recover the value against the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>fendnnt. To which opinion of the court, the defendant \u25a0 excepted, and also to the admission of <em>Day </em>as a witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-9\">There was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-10\">Upon the argument, two grounds of error were principally urged. 1. The admission of <em>Day </em>as a witness; and, 2. The charge of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-11\">\n<em>Scudder.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR0\"><em>Day </em>was not a competent witness. He made a bill of sale, and thus gave an implied warranty. This may be released, so far as relates to the bill alone, but if the consideration of it be also released, the debt and all claim on the goods, are released with it. Again. He could not give these plaintiffs, or any other creditors, a preference by a payment of the debt, in this way. <em>Pat. </em>167, sec. 8. Under the bankrupt laws, if an assignment be made to pay one creditor, in the view of becoming insolvent, it is void. 3 <em>Mass. </em>325. <em>Bank. Law U. S. </em>section 8. 3 <em>Wils. </em>47. 4 <em>Wheat. </em>194. Our insolvent law is the same in principle. Its design is to give all creditors an equal share of the debtor\u2019s property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-13\">*2. The charge was contradictory in itself, and embarrassing to the jury. It declared that the bill, though fraudulent, is binding between the parties to it. This is not so. <em>Pat. </em>154. This statute has not altered the common law. Conveyances were always void, if fraudulent. A party to a fraudulent deed cannot claim any benefit under it. 4 <em>John. </em>598. <em>Cowp. </em>434. If this deed was fraudulent, the jury ought to have been instructed, that the plaintiff could not recover.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-14\"><em>Attorney-General, </em>in answer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEL\">The release takes away all interest arising from the bill of sale, and <em>Day </em>was, therefore, not interested in any view.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-15\">2. The charge states, that the bill, if fraudulent, is void against creditors; but <em>Hendricks </em>can claim no benefit from this : he was not a creditor. It also correctly states, that the bill, though fraudulent, is binding between the parties to it. <em>Cro. Jac. </em>207. <em>Fonb. </em>264. 1 <em>John. </em>161. Again. Under our insolvent laws, a debtor may prefer one creditor to another; this is a principal distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>between them and the bankrupt laws. <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Roff, </em>1 <em>Vern. 399.

The goods had merely been left with him, for safe keeping, and for safe keeping only. He was a mere depositary, and had only a depositary\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">It is, further, entirely manifest, from the state of the case, that when he received the goods, he knew the nature of the transfer, which had been made of them. He received them as the property of <em>Mount </em>and <em>Crane. </em>They wore deposited with him for tlieir benefit, and to be under their control. Has he a right, then, when they claim them, when they demand the possession of them, to say, your title is defective; and though I have no claim, you shall not have them ? I think, clearly, not. In the first place, *he received them, with the express condition, to keep for the benefit of the plaintiff. He must comply with his contract. In the second place, although I think he might, in such case, set up a title in himself, of which he was ignorant, at the time of the deposit, yet he cannot set up a right in some third person ; much less may he defend himself by saying that there are creditors, to wljom, in. justice, these goods ought to go to satisfy their claims. But it is argued, that the bill of sale which transferred the goods to <em>Mount </em>and <em>Crane, </em>was in fraud of creditors, and, therefore, ought to avail them nothing. Now although -we were to admit the fraud in the execution of the bill? yet I do not see how it can avail this defendant. The parties to that bill are willing to abide by it; no one has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>a right to dispute its validity, but he who is interested in -it. This defendant is not so interested. He is a perfect stranger, so far as relates to any rights under it. And although a creditor may dispute the legality of an instrument, yet, as between the parties to it, a stranger has no right to interfere. We recognize the right of no man, in this wajq to turn <em>Quixotte </em>and fight against fraud, for justice sake alone, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> In the mouth, therefore, of this defendant, I do not perceive the right to set up this defence, even if it were true in fact. But, upon the case, it is not very clear that there was any fraud in the creation of this bill. <em>Mount </em>and <em>Crane </em>appear to have been both creditors ; one of them a creditor of a most peculiar kind. Is there any thing to prevent the debtor from securing their debt, even if by so doing, he should defeat the claims of other creditors ? It is every day done, under our insolvent system; and every day sustained, in our courts of justice. And however improper, in an honest and moral view, it may sometimes be, still it is legal. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> If then <em>Mount </em>and <em>Crane, </em>were truly and <em>bona fide </em>creditors, <em>Day </em>had a right, before he presented his petition, to secure their claim. Whether they were such creditors, and whether the bill of sale were made before the petition was presented, were inquiries for the jury. The fair inference, from the evidence, is in their favour, on both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Let us now look to the charge against which complaint is made, and see if it be erroneous, as applied to these facts and principles. I understand the court to lay down four positions. 1. That the fact, whether the bill of sale was fraudulent, was, under the evidence, for the consideration and decision of the *jury. 2. That if the jury believed the bill of sale to be fraudulent, it was .void, as against creditors, whenever they should legally contest it; and, as against them, could confer no rights on the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>tiff. 3. That, as between the parties, it was binding. 4. That the defendant having no interest in the goods, concern in the transaction, had no right to interfere and set up the fraud, even if it existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Upon all these points, the court was clearly and unquestionably right; and it is scarcely necessary to call in the aid of authorities to prove them. The charge, in substance, was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Upon the question of interest, in the witness, <em>Day, </em>I think there is no necessity for argument or illustration. Whatever doubt might have been raised before the execution of the release, none could be fairly raised after it was executed. ' The argument of the counsel, that the release, if it did not discharge the consideration of the bill, left the interest still existing; and if it did discharge the consideration, destroyed the bill, and with it the rights of the plaintiff; will scarcely be insisted on, when he shall more deliberately have investigated its force. The release merely relieves <em>Day </em>from all claim by <em>Mount </em>and <em>Crane ; </em>but it surely does not restore to him the property, which he had, long before, transferred to them. He had sold the goods in discharge of his debt. The bill was the mere evidence of the sale and transfer, and even if the bill were destroyed, their right to the goods, under the sale, would not be destroyed with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Judgment must, therefore, be rendered for the defendants in error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b390-10\"> <em>Melville vs. Brown, 1 Har. 366.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b390-11\"> <em>Tillou vs. Britton, 4 Hal. 136.
