At <em>April </em>1814, the defendant not guilty, and before trial was had, a <em>certiorari </em>was presented, to remove the indictment to this court. When the writ was returned, Halsey, for defendant, prayed leave to withdraw his plea of not guilty, that he might move to quash the indictment. Leave was granted, the plea withdrawn, and motion made; and argued <em>November </em>term *1819. The material part of the indictment was as follows. The jurors &amp;c., present, that heretofore &amp;c., one <em>David Gustin </em>and <em>Daniel Harker, </em>&amp;c. both of the county of <em>Sussex, </em>drew their joint promissory note, bearing date on the day and year aforesaid, and made payable to <em>John Gustin, </em>esquire, or order, at the <em>New-Brunswick Bank, </em>ninety days after date, for the sum of five hundred dollars, without defalcation or discount, for value received ; which said promissory note, was endorsed by the said <em>John Gustin, </em>esquire, and one <em>John Ogden, </em>esquire, and delivered to the said <em>David Gustin, </em>for the purpose of enabling him, the said <em>David Gustin, </em>to get the said note discounted, at the said <em>New-Brunswick Bank. </em>And the jurors aforesaid, upon their oath aforesaid, do further present, that the said <em>David Gustin, </em>late of the township of <em>Elizabethan, </em>the county of <em>Essex, </em>afterwards, to wit: on the fifth day of <em>October, </em>in the year aforesaid, had the said note in his possession, and that he, the said <em>David Gustin, </em>on the same fifth day of <em>October, </em>in the year aforesaid, at the township of <em>Elizabeth, </em>in the county of <em>Essex, </em>and within the jurisdiction of this court, did falsely, wilfully and knowingly, alter and cause and procure to be altered, and act and assist in altering the said promissory note,before mentioned and described, by altering the sum to be paid by the said note, from five hundred dollars, to five thousand dollars, so that the said promissory note, might purport to be for the payment of the false sum of five thousand dollars, instead of the sum of five hundred dollars, for which sum, the same was drawn payable; which said alteration, was made without the knowledge or consent of the said <em>Daniel Harker, John Gustin </em>and <em>John Ogden, </em>or either of them, and with intent to'defraud the said <em>Daniel Harker, John Gustin, </em>and <em>John Ogden, </em>contrary to the statute, &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b393-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>\n<em>Halsey.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY0\">The tenor is not set out, nor any fact to show, that it was impossible to set it out. 8 <em>Mass. </em>107-11. <em>Davis </em>304. 1 <em>Star. </em>98.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b393-4\">\n<em>Chetwoocl.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5Y\">There is no case or form to be found, in which the loss or destruction of the instrument is set out.

The objection to it is, that the tenor of the note is not sot out, nor any circumstances, shewing, that it was not in the power of the jury to set it out. And the objection is well taken. The instrument must be shewn, that the court may see whether it be an instrument, of which there jan be forgery, by the statute. There is a distinction between the indictment itself, and the proof necessary to sustain it. If the tenor be set out, proof that the instrument is not within the power of the prosecutor, is sufficient to authorize other proof as to its contents; and proof, which will justify conviction. I think the motion must prevail.</p>\n<author id=\"b393-6\">The Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Aac\">Let the indictment be quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">As difficulty has frequently arisen from the manner in which the record of judgments upon indictments are made up; and also from the manner in which returns are made to <em>certiorari </em>to remove indictments : the reporter subjoins the form of a return and judgment, in the fore-which were and have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>been sanctioned by the court; and which, with the alterations adapted to the particular cases, may serve to prevent error and difficulty hereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Form of record to be returned with <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\"><em>Essex, </em>to wit: Be it remembered, that at a court of Oyer and Terminer and General Gaol Delivery, holdeD at <em>Newark, </em>in and for the said county of <em>Essex, </em>on the third <em>Tuesday </em>in <em>September, in </em>the year of our <em>Lord </em>one thousand eight hundred and thirteen, before the honourable <em>William S.
