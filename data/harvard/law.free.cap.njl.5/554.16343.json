That they made a division and report on the 11th of <em>February </em>1818 ; that this report was confirmed m the same month; that the whole of the land set off and divided to <em>Jemima South, </em>one of the heirs, (who was at the time of the division, and still continued an inhabitant of the state of Ohio) and part set off to <em>Rachel Ro*berts </em>and <em>Jane Rossell, </em>was contained in a deed given by said <em>Quigley, </em>on the 21st of <em>November </em>1780, to <em>Ebenezer Cowell, </em>and that <em>Cowell </em>went into possession of it at the date of the deed, and he and his heirs had continued in possession ever since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-9\">\u2022 Upon these affidavits a certiorari was issued, directing the court to send up the report and order. Upon the return of the writ other affidavits were taken, which proved the facts before stated, and it was moved to set aside the report of the commissioners, upon the ground that they had divided lands not belonging to the estate of <em>Isaac Quigley, </em>and had not given any of his lands, to one of his heirs, and less than their proportion, to two others.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b172-10\"><em>Kinsey </em>objected.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUD\">That the certiorari ought to have been brought within three months; that the objection to the report ought to have been made within three months ; that the adverse claim of <em>Cowell </em>could not be tried here, and must be tried before a decision can be made in favour of Mrs. <em>South; </em>and that chancery had the jurisdiction over this matter.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number><em>Wall </em>replied;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARk\">that Mrs. <em>South, </em>lived out of the state; that the writ was applied for as soon as could be done, from her situation ; that the division was made in <em>February, </em>the affidavit in <em>August, </em>and the motion in <em>November; </em>that the certiorari must necessarily be issued in three months, only in adversary suits, not in <em>ex parte </em>hearings ; that this was the only mode of reaching the evil; the application here was to the general superintending power of the court, which was sufficient for the purpose.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b172-11\">\n<em> See Bellerjeau vs. Real Estate of George Ely, 3 Hal. 273.
