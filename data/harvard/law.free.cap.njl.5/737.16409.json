The defendant pleaded the general issue. The bill of exceptions states, that \u201c the. plaintiffs offered in evidence, a promissory note, and proved the execution of the same, by the subscribing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>witnesses thereto. The defendant objected to the said evidence.\u201d The court admitted it; the note was read the jury; and the bill of exceptions taken and sealed. The note accompanied the return of the writ, and by it, it appeared that the word <em>first, </em>in the date had been erased, and the word <em>second, </em>written over it; and that several payments had, at different times, been made by defendant upon it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-6\"><em>Scudder, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Art\">The alteration in this note is in a material part; and if made without the consent of the maker, is a forgery; and as it appears upon the face of it, it ought to have been proved to be done before the signing ; otherwise it is fatal to the claim of the plaintiffs J proving the hand-writing of such a note is not sufficient to make it evidence. 5 <em>Jac.

The variance between the note and the declaration is not fatal: the note is sufficiently stated. An alteration, since it was made, is not to be presumed; it is to be proved by the defendant. Besides, payments have been made on it, for several years; and this shews an acquiescence in the alteration.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b382-14\">\n<em> President, &amp;c., of Cumberland Bank vs. Hall, 1 Hal. 215.

But however true the law, the argu*ment were better addressed to the jury than the court. The proof of the note as stated in the bill of exceptions, was such as to demand its admission ; after which, its corruption was a fit matter for consideration. But it appears to me, that either as matter of law, or of fact, but little doubt on the subject could be felt by either court or jury. The suit was brought by adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>trators <em>de bon. non. </em>The alteration could produce no effect on the parties, except to make the note bear interest one day later, and save the defendant from the payment of a few cents; and there were several endorsements on the back of the note, proving that defendant had made several payments upon it, long after its date. Under such circumstances, to presume a forgery, would be a violation of all probabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">There must be judgment for the defendant in error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
