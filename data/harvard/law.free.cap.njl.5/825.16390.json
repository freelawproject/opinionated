J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXF\">The constable, in his state of demand, sets forth that he had certain executions, in his hands, against one <em>Samuel T. Lawrence, </em>and that this <em>Daniel Lawrence </em>prevented him from taking his body, uPon these executions. If this were so, it subjected him to a criminal prosecution, and also to actions at the suit of the plaintiffs in these executions, respectively, but it gives the constable no action, unless it be for his own direct and personal injury. He cannot lump it in this way, and become the general avenger of other men\u2019s wrongs. His giving his notes to those persons for the money due upon their executions, does not help him. No man, and especially an officer of the peace, can buy up other men\u2019s quarrels. There are sundry other substantial reasons for reversal, but I rest upon this alone.</p>\n<author id=\"b486-8\">Southard J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXX\">The state of demand sets out, that the plaintiff is one of the constables of <em>Morris </em>county; that <em>G. A. Pitney, </em>on the 23d <em>December </em>1817, before <em>D. Day, </em>esq., obtained a judgment against <em>S. T. LamAnce </em>for $43.15, debt, and 63 cents, costs; that an execution was issued upon the judgment, on the 10th of <em>March </em>1818, directed to the plaintiff, as one of the constables, &amp;c., by means whereof a right accrued to the plaintiff to seize, arrest and take the body of said <em>S. T. </em>Lawrence; that in the lawful exercise of that right, he was obstructed and hindered, and molested, and altogether prevented, by the defendant; and by such obstruction, &amp;c., the plaintiff was totally unable to seize, arrest, and take the body of <em>S. T. Lawrence, </em>and he escaped such rightful seizure, viz., on the 22nd <em>January </em>1819. The plaintiff also complains, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>that on the 20th of <em>January </em>1818, justice <em>Bay </em>gave judgment against the same <em>S. T. Lawrence, </em>in favour of <em>E. Byram - </em>and <em>N. Wilson, </em>for $25.25, debt, and 53 cents, costs, and, on the 22nd of <em>January </em>1819, issued an execution directed to the plaintiff, and that he was, in like manner, obstructed, &amp;c., by which hindrance, &amp;c., he was endamaged $90.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">*This suit was commenced 12th of <em>February </em>1819, and tried 27th <em>February </em>1819. At the trial, a motion for a non-suit was made, because the executions, as stated by the plaintiff, did not authorize the arrest of <em>8. T Lawrence; </em>and the motion was overruled. Plaintiff proved the hand-writing of <em>G. A. Pitney, </em>to a receipt, and the receipt was admitted ; both the receipt and mode of proof, being objected to. This receipt was in the following words: \u201cRec\u2019d of <em>John 8. Jones </em>const, his note for forty-seven dollars and twenty-five cents, when pd. will be in full of an execution he has in my favr. agt. <em>Saml. T. Lawrence </em>dated 10 <em>March 1818\u2014Feby. </em>27th <em>1819\u2014Chs.A. </em>Pitney.\u201d Plaintiff then offered <em>Elias Byram, </em>one of the firm of <em>Byram &amp; Wilson, </em>to prove, that he had satisfied them, for their demand against <em>8. T. Jjawrence, </em>for their execution. This evidence was objected to on the ground of the witness\u2019 interest in the suit; but the justice swore the witness, on his <em>voir dire, </em>and he denying any interest, was sworn. There was also produced a receipt, but how proved does not appear, given by <em>Byram &amp; Wilson, </em>for their execution, in the same form as that of <em>Pitney's, </em>and dated 27th <em>February </em>1819, the day of the trial. There was a verdict and judgment for $75.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">To the sufficiency of this judgment, several objections have been taken. I will state a part of them only in the view which I take of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The complaint here, is, that the officer was obstructed in the lawful right to take the body of the defendant, and thus the defendant escaped. The first inquiry is, had he any such lawful right to take the body ? I think it manifest he had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\"><em>Pitney\u2019s </em>execution was issued 10th <em>March, </em>1818; the obstruction was on the 22nd \u2022January, 1819. The constable had no right to take the body on such execution. The defendant might well have resisted him: he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>himself a trespasser, and a fit subject of punishment. improper conduct, ought not to be rewarded, by a verdict, giving him all the money due on the execution, The same remarks apply to the other execution. The judgment was given on the 20th <em>January, </em>1818; the execution issued the 22nd <em>January, </em>1819. The execution itself was, therefore, void. For, aiding in the escape of the defendant, upon either of these executions, <em>Daniel Lawrence </em>could not be criminally punished.</p>\n<p id=\"AYhi\">\u25a0 In the next place, if the constable had performed his duty, so *that he could complain of any body, he was not liable to the plaintiffs in the .execution. They had no right to call on him for the payment of the executions ; and if he chose voluntarily to come forward, and pay the plaintiffs, that affords no ground for calling on any one to compensate him: and if he had not done his duty, he surely can have no claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">In the third place, there was a plain violation of law, in admitting <em>Pitney\u2019s </em>receipt. It was not so proved, as to render it admissible in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">But, in the last place, for a resistance to a public officer, unless a personal injury is done to him, no civil action lies. The suit is radically wrong. And it certainly assumes the appearance of a combination, between the constable and plaintiffs, to extort the money from a third person, because they could not get it from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Judgment unanimously reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
