The declaration was in the common form ; the lands situated on <em>Rahway </em>river; the pleas, <em>not </em>guilty, and <em>liberum, tenennentum, </em>with notice, &amp;c. The plaintiffs, who were infants, shewed title to the lands, by descent from their father; and proved, that since the dam was built, by defendant, in 1815 or 1816, about three acres of the land had been overflowed, so as to injure and destroy grass, trees, &amp;c. to the value of $300, in the opinion of some of the witnesses. That in <em>April </em>1809,'the administrators of plaintiffs\u2019 father, obtained an order of the Or. phans\u2019 Court, to sell seven acres, to raise $78, a deficiency in the personal estate; that one of the administrators bid at the sale, and the land was struck off to him; and he afterwards sold to defendant for $500; the administrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>representing the land to be valuable, on account of the mill-seat upon it. The defendant proved the injury to be $60, or $70, or $90; that there was one, or one and a quarter acre, overflowed;\\ and that the dam had been raised about eighteen or twenty inches, by the defendant, which occasioned the overflowing. The defendant offered to read the deed from the administrators to him, for the land ; to which the plaintiffs objected ; because it appeared, upon the face of the deed, that the administrators had not pursued, but exceeded their authority; that one of them bid off the land, and then conveyed to defendant, without any public sale. The Chief Justice overruled the deed. The jury found a verdict for $269, damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-4\">The rejection of the deed ; and the amount of damages; were the reasons filed for setting aside the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-5\">\n<em>Attorney-General.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6x\">The deed was not to be rejected, because one of the administrators bid; this is an exception, only in a court of equity. 14 <em>John. </em>407. 2 <em>John. Ch. Cas. </em>252, 263. The deed was, really, made to the highest bidder, the purchaser, and there was no pretence of fraud; the heirs received the money. Besides, the lot was bought for a mill-seat, as appears by the *deed itself; and it follows, that the purchaser had a right to use it for that purpose, though he did overflow the adjoining land. Again; the deed was proper evidence in mitigation of damages; and by its rejection, they were made excessive. That they are so, is manifest from the whole evidence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-6\"><em>Scudder </em>in answer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeAd\">1.

If the deed was valid, it was inadmissible, because unconnected with the issue. The administrator could only convey title to the land, not a right to use it, so as to injure and destroy the remainder of the estate. Even if the intestate had sold, the buyer would have no such right. And the deed could not support the plea of <em>liberum </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>tenementum,, because the complaint was for injury done to other lands, not those in the deed..</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2Tf\">The damages were not excessive; not equal to what was sworn to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4Tz\">\u25a0 But <em>'Brookfield, </em>the defendant, is dead ; the action does not survive against his administrators; and the effect of setting aside the verdict, would be to deprive the plaintiff, altogether, of its benefit.

The deed could have no operation upon the question of damages. If it be considered a valid deed, free from legal exception, it can give the defendant no right to overflow the. adjoining lands; lands, not contained within it. And although the damages seem high, yet, as some of the witnesses swore to more than were given, and as the jury were the best judges of their amount, the verdict cannot be set aside on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Rule discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
