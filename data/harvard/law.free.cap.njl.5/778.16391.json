The defendant pleaded, first, <em>nul tiel record; </em>secondly, <em>nil debet, </em>and annexed to it a notice of various particulars, which he should prove under it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-10\">Upon the first plea, issue was joined. To the second, the plaintiff filed a demurrer. The defendant joined in demurrer, and the case was noticed for argument.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-11\">\n<em>Chetwood,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgH\">moved to amend the declaration, by altering the day on which the judgment in <em>New-York </em>was laid. <em>Scudder </em>objected that it was too late; but the court directed the amendment to be made, on payment of proper costs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-12\"><em>Chetwood, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0KS\">The demurrer brings up the question, as to the effect of a judgment in another state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>under the constitution of the <em>United States. </em>Argument is not necessary ; the cases need only be cited. 2 <em>Dall. </em>302. <em>Brown\u2019s Rep.

The constitution and laws of congress, were only designed to overcome the necessity of proving them as foreign judgments, by witnesses, and to permit them to be proved by certificate. <em>Gilb. Ev. </em>19. The law of congress of 26th <em>May, </em>1790, directs the statutes of the several states, to be authenticated, by their respective seals; and then gives them full faith, <em>&amp;c. </em>in the very words respecting judgments ; yet still, thus authenticated, the statutes remain foreign, and of no validity. The words full faith and credit, have been misapprehended, and are sometimes misquoted, and read, <em>effect, </em>(2 <em>Dall. </em>302) a meaning they were never designed to have. Under the doctrine contended for, if a judgment were obtained under the penal laws of <em>New- York, </em>which are directly in opposition to our own, this court might be compelled to carry it into effect; and even help to punish a citizen of <em>New-Jersey, </em>for resisting the process of <em>New- York, </em>on our docks, within our *own jurisdiction. See laws of <em>New-York </em>and <em>New-Jersey.

Some are; some are not. See <em>Uolkar </em>case, and <em>Pen. </em>399. 2. If the judgment be only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the debt, <em>nil debet </em>is a good plea. If it is conclusive, then <em>nul tiel record, </em>is the right plea. 3. Every pleading is to be taken most strongly against him who makes it. 5 <em>Bac. </em>322. 4. There is nothing in the declaration to shew that this is a conclusive judgment; that there was process, service, trial, verdict, &amp;c. The court must, therefore, presume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>that it is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of debt only, and therefore <em>debet </em>is a good plea. Whether such conclusive judgment will be produced at the trial, <em>non constat. </em>In the case in <em>Peters </em>74, <em>nil debet, </em>was pleaded; a conclusive judgment was given in evidence, and the court so charged the jury. So 7 <em>Cra. </em>484; 1 <em>Mass. </em>401.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ADZ\">\n<em>Ghetwood.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeJd\">The cases, where judgments are hot con- \u25a0 sidered conclusive, are <em>in rem: </em>this is slander, and if by default, still conclusive. Besides, defendant does shew by his plea and notice, that there was process and trial, and the record, which is referred to, and made part of the declaration, also shews the same.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b430-13\"> <em>Condit vs. Neighbor, 7 Hal. 320. </em>See <em>Williamson vs. Updike, 2 Gr. </em>270, But not after judgment. <em>Gulick vs. Loder, 2 Gr. 572, 3 Gr. 416.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b430-14\"><em> Vanuxem vs. Hazelhursts, 1 South. 192, note (a).

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApXp\">This is an action of debt, upon a judgment entered in the Supreme Court of the state of <em>New- York</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The defendant pleads, first, <em>nul tiel record, </em>upon which issue is joined; and secondly, <em>nil debel, </em>giving notice of the particulars to be given in evidence upon the trial; which particulars, go to shew that the judgment was obtained, partly by the fraud of the plaintiff, and partly by the oppression and injustice of the court, and not upon the truth and justice of the case. And to this last plea there is a demurrer, and a joinder in demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"AHXx\">The question presented by these pleadings, has been considered and settled in this court, some terms ago, in the case of <em>Olden </em>v. <em>Hallet; </em>and since that time, in the same way, in the Supreme Court of the <em>United States, </em>in the case of <em>Hampton </em>v. <em>*M\u2019 Connel. </em>This last is conclusive, for being a constitutional question, it belongs to that court to settle the law, and having settled it, we are bound by the decision; we have no further discretion upon it. The plea, therefore, must be overruled, and there must be judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b432-10\">Southard J.</author>\n<p id=\"AP0\">I concur in the opinion of the court, but I do it under the irresistible weight of authority alone.
