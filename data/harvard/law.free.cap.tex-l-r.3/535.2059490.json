A trial upon the merits before a jury resulted in a verdict and judgment thereon for the defendent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-14\">Prom an examination of the statement of facts, wc believe the following to be the case as made by the preponderance of evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-15\">1. Plaintiff owned a lot upou which was situated a store-house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u25a0within the corporate limits of the city of Dallas, and which storehouse was at the time of the alleged injury occupied and used for the business of merchandising by tenants of plaintiff under a lease for one year, at the price of $40 per month rent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-4\">2. By action of the city council of Dallas, the grade of the Street upon which this lot abutted, ivas ordered to be raised. Also, a natural ditch or gully which was adjacent to the lot, and which conveyed a'vay water, which, without said ditch or gully, would have flowed upon said lot, was ordered by the council to be filled up, and another ditch or sewer was ordered to be constructed in its stead ; and these orders of the city authorities were executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-5\">3. When the street was graded, the grade was higher in front of plaintiff\u2019s house than the ffoor of said house \u2014 at least twelve inches higher.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-6\">4. The new ditch was not as large as the old one and was not straight, but had an angle in it, and did not have as much capacity lor carrying off the water from the lands which it drained as did the old ditch.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-7\">5. On November 4, 1873, a very heavy rain fell in Dallas, and this new ditch was insufficient to carry off the water from the grounds which it drained, the consequence' being that the water backed up upon plaintiff\u2019s lot and overflowed Ins store-house and caused him to sustain damage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-8\">6. Plaintiif\u2019s store-house would not have been overflowed, and he would not have sustained damage, if he had raised said house to the grade of the street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-9\">7. The old ditch or gully, only carried off surface or rain-water. At the head ol\u2019 this ditch or gully were two springs, the water from which flowed through it for a little distance, but was absorved in some swampy ground, before it reached plaintiff\u2019s premises.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b536-10\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">Our conclusions of the law, as applicable to the foregoing statement of the case, are as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">1. The city of Dallas through its corporate authorities unquestionably had the power to raise the grade of the street. (2 Dillon on Corp., 689 <em>et seq.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">2. It likewise had the power to establish and change a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>system of drainage for the city, so as to carry off the surface water which might accumulate within the city limits. (2 Dillon on Corp., 578 n.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">3. If the officers of the city, who were charged with the duty of grading the street, and constructing- the new ditch or sewer, performed their duty unskilllully or negligently, they, and not the city, would be liable for injuries caused by such unskillful or negligent construction. (Keller v. Corpus Christi, 50 Texas, 614; Navasota v. Pearce, 46 Texas, 525.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">4. In exercising the lawful powers of causing the street grade to be raised, and a new channel to be constructed for draining the surface water, the city did not become liable for the consequential damages caused by surface water to plaintiff\u2019s premises. (2 Dillon on Corp., p. 1040.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">5. The doctrine of contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff applies in this as in other cases when the action is for damages caused by negligence. In this case plaintiff contributed to the injury sustained by him, by not raising his house to a level with the street, which, if he had done, would have prevented the damage for which lie seeks a recovery. (2 Dillon on Corp., p. 1926; Thompson on Negligence, pp. 1146-1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">We find the charge of the court in all respects in accordance with the view we have taken of the law of the case. Wc are of the opinion that the verdict of the jury is correct, and that no error has been committed for which the judgment should be reversed, and we therefore recommend the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b537-8\">Watts, J \u201e</author>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Report of commissioners of appeals examined, their <em>conclusions </em>adopted, and the judgment affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b537-10\">Willie, C.
