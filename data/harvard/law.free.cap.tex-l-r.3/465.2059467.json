Doris, 57 -Texas, <em>225 </em>; and Dwyer v. Hackworth, 57 Tex., 245 <em>\\ </em>and it was there held that such power existed when the provisions of the statute were complied with, and we regard those cases as decisive of the question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-4\">In this case the admitted facts show that the city of Rockdale had complied with the requirements of the statute in so far as to acquire the power to levy the tax, except it is contended that the proper question was not submitted to the vote of the people. The question submitted was : \u201cShall a tax of one-half of one per cent be levied and collected to support the public free schools.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-6\">The statute provides that \u201cThe proposition submitted muy be for a tax not exceeding One-half of one per cent, or it may be for a specific per cent.\u201d (Gen. Laws, 1881, page 64.) The question submitted was *. \u201cWhether a tax of one-half of one per cent should be levied. This was for a specific per cent, and was authorized by the last member of the clause above copied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-7\">The only other question necessary to be considered is : Has the legislature the power to authorize a municipal corporation to levy a poll tax ? Art. Till, sec. 1 of the constitution expressly gives to the legislature power to impose a poll tax. Art. XI, sec 4, provides that towns and cities of the class to which the city of Rockdale belongs \u201cMay assess and collect an annual tax to defray the current expenses of the local government, but such tax shall never exceed for any one year one-fourth of one per cent.\u201d This ovidently refers to an <em>ad valorem </em>tax, and was not intended to operate as a denial of power to collect other classes of taxes ; for the same section recognizes the power of such cities and towns to collect other taxes as does section 1 of article vm, which, to some extent, limits the power. The power of the legislature, unless restricted by some constitutional provision, to delegate its power to municipal corporations is thus stated by Mr. Dillon: \u201cIn the general power of the legislature, as well as in its power to create municipal corporations, may be found the right to authorize them, when created to <em>impose </em>or <em>levy local </em>rates, taxes aud assessments upon their inhabitants, and upon all property within <em>the limits </em>of the designated taxing district, which is ordinarily coextensive with the territorial limits of the municipal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>ity. Indeed, it is one of the distinguishing features of our municipal institutions that local rates shall be locally imposed by those who have to pay them or bear their burden ; and this power, from very early periods, has, in the different states, been constantly delegated to, and exercised by the local authorities.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-4\"><em>2 </em>Dillon Municipal Corporations, sec. 793$ Blessing v. Galveston, 42 Tex., 659; City of Marshall v. Sneideker, 25 Tex., 460; Burgess v. Pue, 2 Gill, 19; Alexander et al v. Mayer &amp; Co., Baltimore, 5 Gill, 389; Harrison v. Vicksburg, 3 S. &amp; M\u201e, 585; State v. Aberdeen, 25 Miss., 491.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-5\">In reference to cities of that class to which the city of Rockdale belongs, the legislature has declared that \u201cthe city council shall have power toTevy and collect an annual poll tax, not to exceed one dollar, of every male inhabitant of said city over the age of twenty-one years of age (idiots and lunatics excepted,) who is a resident thereof at the time of such annual assessment. (Rev. Stats. 428.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\">This statute confers the power as fully as the legislature possessed it. It was held, however, that the ordinance under which the several taxes, sought to be enjoined, were levied, was invalid, and the court, therefore, modified the preliminary injunction granted, so as to enjoin the collection of the taxes, levied under the insufficient or invalid ordinance, and left the city free, should it see proper to do so, to levy and collect under valid ordinance, like taxes as those enjoined.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\">There is no error in the judgment and it is affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b467-8\">Stay ton, J.</author>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
