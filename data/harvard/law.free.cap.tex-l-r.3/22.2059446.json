Roberson, were married in Keutucky in 1844; that they lived together in that state until the year 1868, when she \u201cwilfully, voluntarily, and without any cause or provocation abandoned his bed and board,\u201d and had never returned. He also avers that she left him with the intention of perpetual abandonment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-13\">A general denial was filed by defendant March 27th, 1882. On same day trial was had by the court without a jury and judgment rendered for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-14\">On the trial plaintiff introduced John H. Roberson the only witness. He testified that plaintiff and defendant were married in Kentucky thirty years ago, and lived together until 1869, when defendautleft and went to Memphis, Tenn., where she remained until 1872, when she went to the house of witness in the state of Missouri, where she remained a short time. She then went to California where she has been ever since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-15\">Witness states that plaintiff had a comfortable home, and he does not know why defendant left plaintiff.

Every fact attested by the witness in this case might be true, and yet the defendant might have been driven from her home by the plaintiff, or at least, she might have left it with his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">In accordance with the rule announced in <em>McGown </em>vs. <em>McGown, </em>(52 Tex. 567,) the plaintiff should have produced at least some reasonable measure of proof, that he \u201cneither caused, nor procured, nor consented to the separation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence falls far short of this.
