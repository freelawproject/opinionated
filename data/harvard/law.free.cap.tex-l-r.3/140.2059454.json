See Baldwin vs. Heet, 22 Tex. 714 ; Van Hook vs. Walton, <em>supra.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AKK\">The deed we are passing upon arose before the passage of the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>sign merit law of 1879, and is of course considered without reference \u25a0to \"the provisions of that aoh</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-4\">It is further urged that the court erred in not charging the jury that the burden of proof that some of the creditors of the assignee were unpaid at the date of the trial of this cause, was upon the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-5\">It is certainly clear that at the time the attachment was levied, as also when this suit was commenced, no debts had been paid, as no disposition had been made of the assets till February 1, 1879. If the assignment was valid it passed title to all the property out of Keep <em>&amp; </em>Yates and it was not liable to attachment for their debts, whether sufficient or insufficient to pay all debts in full. By levying the attachment the defendants became trespassers, and if they wished to justify themselves, or show that the other creditors wore not injured, or that they, the defendants, were entitled to the money which might be recovered in the suit as the only remaining creditors, Ae^mt\u00f3jwasjap^theinjo. p\u00edo ve.i t..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-6\">It was a ground of defense for themselves and not a necessary' fact to be pleaded or proved bj' the plaintiffs to entitle them to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-7\">Besides there was some proof made by the plaintiff that a portion of the consenting creditors had not been paid, and the plaintiffs were of course not of that class. And had the judge charged as defendants say he should have done on this subject, it could not have altered the verdict,and it has been held that under the circumstances a judgment will not be reversed. (GJ-. H. &amp; S. A. R. R. Co. vs. Diblobunts, 52 Tex. 206.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-8\">As to the refusal of the court to charge in reference th the supposed attempt of Keep &amp; Yates to prefer creditors, it is sufficient to say that there was no proof to show that any individual creditors were preferred. Phelps &amp; Co., the alleged individual creditors, state positively that their claims were firm debts. The only proof offered to the contrary was that the books of Keep &amp; Yates show that the claims of Phelps &amp; Co. were charged up to Yates as his separate indebtedness. But this would only show that Yates had assumed the indebtedness, and that as between him and Keep, Yates would have it to pay from his separate funds. But this did not render the parnership any less liable upon these claims to Phelps &amp; Co. The latter had nothing to do with any arrangement between the part<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>ners from whom the debt was due. They looked to both members of the firm, could sue both and enforce those claims against' them, and Keep &amp; Yates might settle between themselves as to how they would charge up the money that was used towards their payment. The partnership property was liable for the indebtedness before it could be used to the payment of any separate debts, and hence an assignment of that property for its payment in preference to other firm debts was legitimate. There was then no evidence that these claims were the separate debts of Yates and hence the court was not authorized to give the charge requested by the appellants.
