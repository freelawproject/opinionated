M. PEARRE &amp; CO. V. J. W. HAWKINS.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b501-10\">IN SUPREME COURT,</court>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AL3\">TYLER TERM, 1884.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b501-11\"><em>Attachment </em>\u2014 Affidavit.\u2014An affidavit made for the purpose of procuring a writ of attachment which states two grounds entirely inconsistent, the -one with the other, is insufficient.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b501-12\"><em>Same. </em>\u2014 \u201cThat defendants have secreted their property for the purpose of defrauding their creditors;\u201d and \u201cthat they (defendants) have disposed of their property with intent to defraud their creditors,\u201d is inconsistent.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-13\">Appeal from Hunt county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-14\">It becomes unnecessary, in the view taken of one question presented, to consider any other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>The affidavit for attachment alleged, \u201cthat defendants aforesaid have secreted their property for the purpose of defrauding their creditors, and that they (defendants) have disposed of their property with intent to defraud their creditors.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-4\">A motion to quash the attachment was filed, and one of the grounds on which this was sought was, \u201cbecause the affidavit for attachment charges two inconsistent and contradictory grounds, for said attachment, and said affidavit is, therefore, indefinite as to the true ground for which the same is sought.\u201d The motion was sustained, and this is assigned as error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-5\">That two or more grounds for attachments are set forth in the affidavit is unimportant, unless from the manner of statement the real ground is uncertain, either by the manner the several grounds are connected, or by the statement of two or more grounds which are within themselves inconsistent. In the case before us, the two grounds for attachment are stated cumulatively, and if one of them be true, it matters not that the other be untrue. If, however, two grounds entirely inconsistent, the one with the other, be stated, it is as though no ground at all be stated, or at least the latter is left in a state of uncertainty, as is wholly inadmissible, and insufficient for the officer who is called on to issue a writ, before judgment, by which property is to be taken from the possession of the owner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-6\">The revised statutes give several grounds for attachment, not given before their enactment, and in some instances words and clauses have been inserted which were not before found in the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-7\">That a person has secreted his property for the purpose of defrauding his creditors, was a ground for attachment under the former, as it is under the revised statutes. (Pas. Dig., art. 142; Rev. Stats., art. 152.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-8\">In'the cases of Hopkins v. Nichols (22 Tex., 206), Oulbersqn v. Cabeen (28 Texas, 247) and Carpenter v. Pridgen (40 Texas, 34), the word \u201csecrete,\u201d as used in the attachment law, was held to mean, \u201cto hide 5 to put it where the officer of the law will probably not be able to find it.\u201d Mr. Webster thus defines the word : \u201cTo hide ; to conceal, to remove from the observation or knowledge of others, as to <em>secrete </em>stolen goods.\u201d We have no doubt that this is the sense in which the word is used in the statute. The word seems to carry with it the further idea that the thing secreted, although not open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>to the viow of others, is still possessed or owned by the person by whom secreted. It certainly does not convey the idea that the title or right to the thing possessed or owned is in any respect affected by the fact that it has been hidden from the view or knowledge of other persons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-4\">\u201cThat he has disposed of his property in whole or in part, with intent to defraud his creditors,\u201d was not, in the same language, made a ground for attachment under the former statute. The nearest approach in meaning to the ground for attachment above quoted found in the former statute, is in that clause which declared that an attachment might be issued when an affidavit was made charging that the defendant \u201chas transfered * * Ms property for the purpose of defrauding his creditors.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-6\">In the case of Hopkins v. Nichols, the word \u201ctransfer\u201d was defined, and it was held that the word transfer of property and the secreting of property presented separate and distinct grounds for attachment and not different phases of one ground. The court said : \u201cto transfer property, within the meaning of the statute, is to place it in the hands of another under pretense of title. To secrete property within the meaning of the statute, is to hide it 5 to place it where the officer of the law will not probably be able to find it.\u201d The same was held in Culberson v\u201e Cabeen (29 Texas, 256) In the case referred to, however, the separate grounds for an attachment were disjunctively connected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-7\">In the case of Carpenter v. Pridgen (40 Texas, 33), the affidavit stated that the defendants \u201care about to transfer their property, or dispose of the same, for the purpose of defrauding their creditors,\u201d etc., and it was said that the word \u201cdispose,\u201d when used in relation to property, has a broader signification than the word \u201ctransfer,\u201d or the word \u201csecrete.\u201d That this is true, we think there can be no doubt, but as the word \u201ctransfer\u201d is omitted in the present statute, and the word \u201cdisposed\u201d is inserted where it formerly stood, it is obvious that it was intended by the latter word to reach all such cases as could have been reached by the former statute, which contained the word \u201ctransfer,\u201d and any others, which might be reached by the ordinary or legal meaning of the word \u201cdispose,\u201d when con - sidered in reference to an appropriation of the property by ibo owner in such a way as to defraud his creditors j or that the word sub stituted was used in the same sense as the word \u201ctransfer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>If used in the latter sense only, the two grounds set out in the affidavit are inconsistent. The one carrying with it the idea that the property, in fact as well as in form, is still owned and possessed by the debtor, and is only held from the process sued out by the fact that it is hidden or concealed from the view or knowledge of the officer, and all other persons than the debtor or those who are in his confidence. It is the hiding of the thing. The other conveys the idea that by the act of the debtor, the title to the thing has been so divested as to operate a fraud on the creditor, even though the thing be not hidden. It relates to the title of the thing transferred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-4\">It may have been thought by the legislature that the word \u201ctransfer\u201d could be applied only to \u201can act or transaction by which the property of one person is by him vested in another.\u201d This, without the use of some qualifying word, is the legal moaning rf the term. (Abbott\u2019s and Bouvier\u2019s Law Diets.; Webster.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-5\">It may have been thought necessary to use a word of broader signification, in order to embrace any conceivable form of appropriation of property, in actual ownership or otherwise, to another by a debtor with intent to defraud creditors, by an act which gives, or which purports to give to another a general or qualified ownership or right in or to the thing in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-6\">The word \u201cdispose\u201d is thus defined by Mr. Abbott: \u201cTo dispose of property is to alienate it; assign it to a use; bestow it; divest its ownership.\u201d Mr. Webster defines the primary meaning of the words \u201cto dispose of\u201d as follows <em>: </em>\u201cTo part with ; to sell; to alienate, as \u2018the man has disposed of his home.\u2019 \u201d\u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-7\">We have no doubt that these definitions embrace both the popular and legal significations of the word \u201cdispose\u201d when used in connection with property, as it is in the attachment law. If the word is used in the statute in any of these senses, it gives to the clause of che statute in which it is found a meaning inconsistent with that in which the word \u201csecrete\u201d is found. They do not piesent phases of the same fact or act, nor is the existence of the one ground compatible with the existence of the other. If the debtor has disposed of his property, he has nothing which he can secrete and thereby defraud his creditors, If he has only secreted his property he has not disposed of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-8\">That a person may, by fraudulent conveyance, becloud the title of Ms property as affeets creditors, and thereby in a certain sense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>secrete it, it is true, but that would be to secrete the title or render uncertain the ownership, and not to secrete the property, and would be within the meaning of the law to dispose of his property.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b505-4\">We are of the opinion that the court below did not err in holding that the two grounds for attachment in the affidavit were inconsistent, and that this rendered the application so uncertain as to require the writ to be quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"AG7\">Stayton, J.</author>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
