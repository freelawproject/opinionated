The agreement itself precludes the idea of any representation, by the appellants, which was intended or understood by the parties to be the foundation on which the contract was made ; and this being true, we are of the opinion that the court erred in overruling the demurrers which revert to so much of the answer as sought to avoid liability on the ground that the appellants failed to give to Strong such information as would enable him to buy and deliver him the cattle, and thereon make a net profit of one dollar per head.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-4\">If we look to the evidence in the case it is rendered more certain, if possible, than by the written contract, that the parties did not rely upon the information which the appellants were to give Strong as to where he could buy cheap cattle ; for upon request by Strong that the information to be given should amount to a guarantee that the cattle could be so bought as to enable him to make the named profit, such guaranty or assurance was denied, after which the written agreement was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-5\">The judge who tried the case found, that the representations made by the appellants to Strong in reference to where he could buy cattle so as to fill his contract with them, and make the contemplated profit,- were made in good faith ; if so, and the appellee was informed before he executed the written contract, that the appellants would not guarantee or be bound by the representation which they made, then he must be held to have known that the representations were made as mere matter of opinion, upon which, if he relied, he must do so at his own peril.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-6\">If a representation be made by one contracting party to another, in reference to a matter affecting the contract, and the person to whom it is made be informed that the other will not be bound by such representation ; then, if it proves untrue, it is not such misrepresentation as amounts to fraud that will invalidate a contract, for such representation cannot be fraudulent [if believed to be true, for the party to whom it is made, has no right to rely upon it, when the other informs him that he does not intend to be bound by it,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-7\">Jackson vs. Stockbridge, 29 Texas, 295.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-8\">Wooters vs. I. &amp; G-.
