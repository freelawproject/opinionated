W. M. SHUMATTE AND JOHN A. MATHEWS.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b336-10\">IN THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS,</court>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AK4\">TYLER TERM, 1884.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b336-11\"><em>Promissory Note </em>\u2014 It by some clause in tlie body of the instrument, the elements, which impart to it negotiability are limited or qualified, the negotiable character of the paper as an ordinary promissory note is distroyed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b336-12\"><em>Pleading. </em>\u2014 In an action upon such an instrument, the nature character and extent of the obligation incured by the parties must be fully set forth in the pleadings.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-13\">Appeal from Anderson County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-14\">We are of the opinion that upon the whole case here made by the pleadings of the appellant, taking them altogether, that the learned judge below, for several good reasons, committed no error in sustaining the special exceptions taken to the appellant\u2019s cause of ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>tion in the manner and form in which it was presented to the court in her pleadings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-4\">The instruments therein set forth were not negotiable promissory notes. The authorities are very full indeed, and satisfactory to the effect., that though the written contract which is made the basis of the party\u2019s cause of action may have on its face several of the ordinary features of a common promissory note, and may in the body of the written instrument use some of the conventional terms that would ordinarily confer upon it the character of negotiability, yet if by some clause or stipulation in the body of the instrument these elements which impart to it negotiability are limited or qualified, the negotiable character of the paper as an ordinary promissory note is destroyed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-5\">In order to maintain an action on such an instrument, the nature, character and extent of the obligation incurred by the parties executing it, must be fully and distinctly set forth.

Many other authorities have been examined and could bo referred to, but the above are deemed to be sufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-6\">The statement of the nature and character of the instrument made the basis of the appellant\u2019s cause of action, was not in the pleadings set forth with sufficient certainty. Under the circumstances, the special exceptions of appellees were properly sustained.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The judgment of the district court in-dismissing the cause is affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"ABF\">West, J.</author>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
