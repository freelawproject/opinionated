Under the law then in force the September terms of county courts were fixed by law, to begin on the third Monday in that month, and the commissioners court at that time had no power to change the time of holding said courts. (See Con., art. 5, sec. 17; Rev. S., art. 1173.) It was not until the amendment to article five of the constitution became operative that the commissioners courts were clothed with the power to change the time fixed by law, for holding the regular terms of the county courts for civil business. (See amendment to Constitution, acts eighteenth legislature, p. 134.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b2-20\">This amendment did not become operative until the fortieth day after the election at which it was adopted. (Rev. S. art. 1810; Con. art. 17.) The election occurred on the second Tuesday in August, 1883, which was the fourteenth day of the month. (See acts eighteenth legislature, sec. 2, p. 134.) It was, therefore, not until the twenty-third day of September, 1883, that said amendment went into effect. It was not until then that it was knrwn to have been adopted (Sewell v. The State of Texas, L. Rev. 254; Rear v. The People, 24 N.
