R. Turner &amp; (Jo. and J. S. Davis, the appellant; and, if the averments of the answer are to be taken as true, was delivered by Turner &amp; Co. to Gray in the ordinary course of business for a valuable consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-4\">This being true, it must be held, that any agreement between Turner &amp; Co. and Davis, to the effect that the note should not be used unless Ellison and Kyle also signed it as sureties, cannot defeat the right of plaintiffs recover on the note, unless it be shown that he had notice of the agreement between Turner <em>&amp; </em>Co. and Davis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-5\">The signing and delivery of the note by Davis to Turner, entitled the latter to deliver it to Gray, who in the absence of notice to the contrary might rely upon the intention of all the parties, whose signatures were on it, to make with him the contract which the note evidenced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-6\">Brandt on Suretyship, 354-355;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-7\"><em>State </em>vs. Potter, 63 Mo., 312;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-8\"><em>Russell </em>vs. Freer, 56 N.
