Lyon, a mechanic, upon and in the construction of a certain three story brick building, situated on the south end of lot 1, 2 and 3, in block 3, in the city of Rockdale, in Milam county, Texas, at, ihe junction of Main and Mi-lam streets, and fronting 5!) feet on Main street, and 81 feet on Milam street, have this day granted and given, and by these presents do grant and give unto tbe said J. L. Lyon; a mechanic\u2019s lien, in, and upon the house aforesaid, and the said parts of lots in said block, \u201cin order to secure him in the payment\u201d of the sum of three hundred and seventy-two dollars and fifty-seven cents. The amount due by me to the said J. L. Lyon at this date, for the said work done and labor performed on said building in its construction, and I further agree to pay him the sum of three hundred and seventy-two dollars'and fifty-seven cents, on the first day of November, A. D., 1881, with 12 per cent per annum interest from this date, and I hereby give this lien as a mechanic\u2019s lien under chapter 27, title 61, of the Revised Statutes of the State of Texas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-7\">In witness, whereof, I hereunto set my hand, this 21st day of November, A. 1)., 1880.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-8\">F. M. MUNDINE.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-9\">This contract was\u2019duly acknowledged on the same day of its execution, and was duly recorded in the county clerk\u2019s office of Milam county, Texas, on the 2nd day of December, A. D,, 1880. And this contract was duly transferred by Lyon to the plaintiff in writing rendered thereon, for a valuable consideration, if the averments of the petition are true. If the labor performed by Lyon was such, and was done under such circumstances, as woulc? have enabled him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>establish a mechanic's lien on the property by complying with the statute, we do not sec that the written contract, made after the work was done and the labor performed, would not, when such is clearly expressed to be the intention of the parties, as fully give even <em>fh\u00a7. </em>mechaniojsjien as would the written contract if made prior to the ~\"tTme the\"work was done, if the written contract was recorded as provided by statute.

Such a constimctionjiim]^ the words of the statute, and wBuTd be at war with its spirit and intent. ~~</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-7\">The statute provides s \u201cIn order to fix and secure the lien herein provided for, the person or firm, contractor, mechanic, laborer, artisan or lumber dealer furnishing material shall have the right at any time, within six Months after such debt becomes due, to file Ms contract in the office of the county clerk of the county in which such property is situated, and cause the same to bo recorded in a book to be kept by the county clerk foythat purpose.
