The order of adjudication of insolvency was entered in the Chancery Division April 30, 1965. The wage claims were for periods up to April 3, 1965. The taxes had accrued and were due long prior to insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">The trial court erred, perhaps because of the absence of supporting argument in favor of the Government\u2019s claim of priority at the hearing beyond the mere assertion thereof by its representative. There is no question about the general primacy of the wage claimant\u2019s position under New Jersey law. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:11-31; <em>R. S. </em>34:11-33; <em>N. J. S. </em>2A: 19-30. But federal statute law giving debts owing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>United States as of the date of insolvency absolute priority is paramount in the matter. 31 <em>U. S. C. A., </em>\u00a7 191; <em>Com. of Massachusetts v. United States, </em>333 <em>U. S. </em>611, 68 <em>S. Ct. </em>747, 92 <em>L. Ed. </em>968 (1948); <em>United States v.

Ct. </em>1267, 12 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>370 (1964), where insolvency of the debtor was not involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"> Unless and until the competing lien has become \u201cspecific and perfected,\u201d the paramountey of the federal lien is unabated. Furthermore, such specific and perfected character of the other lien must have attached prior to the insolvency. <em>Spokane County v. United States, </em>279 <em>U. S. </em>80, 93-94, 49 <em>S. Ct. </em>321, 73 <em>L. Ed. </em>621 (1929); <em>United States v. State of Texas, </em>314 <em>U. S. </em>480, 484-486, 62 <em>S. Ct. </em>350, 86 <em>L. Ed. </em>356 (1941); <em>United States v.

S., </em>at <em>p. </em>366, 73 <em>S. Ct. </em>701).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Here the wage claimants did not obtain possession until after the insolvency, when the receiver made distribution pursuant to the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">We do not regard this controversy as mooted by the distribution of the funds. Leave to appeal from the order, which was interlocutory, is herewith granted <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Reversed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
