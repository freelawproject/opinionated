J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A28\">Defendant Home Insurance Company (Home) issued an automobile liability policy to plaintiff which contained \u201cMedical Expense\u201d coverage. She was injured when her automobile collided with another. She settled her claim against the driver of the other car for $14,000 and gave him a general release, and then she demanded $3,250 from Home for her medical expenses. Home refused to pay it on the ground that she had recovered the sum from the tortfeasor and had destroyed the right of subrogation reserved to Home by the policy. Plaintiff then sued Home, but the trial court entered summary judgment in Home\u2019s favor, citing <em>Rogers v. American Fidelity &amp; Casualty Company, Inc., </em>52 <em>N. J. Super. </em>254 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>Smith v. Motor Club of America, </em>54 <em>N. J. Super. </em>37 <em>(Ch. Div.), </em>affirmed 56 <em>N. J. Super. </em>203 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959), certification denied 30 <em>N. J. </em>563 (1959). Plaintiff appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Plaintiff argues that \u201cTo allow medical payments subrogation violates two important legal principles. Eirst, it violates the principle against assigning a personal injury claim, and second it violates the principle against splitting a cause of action.\u201d In support of this proposition plaintiff cites <em>Peller v. Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Co., </em>220 <em>Cal. App. 2d </em>610, 34 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>41 <em>(D. Ct. App. </em>1963); <em>Wrightsman v. Hardware Dealers Mutual Fire Insurance Co., </em>113 <em>Ga. App. </em>306, 147 <em>S. E. 2d </em>860 <em>(App. Ct. </em>1966); <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Chumbley, </em>394 <em>S. </em>W. <em>2d </em>418 <em>(Mo. App. </em>1965) and <em>Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co. v. Lea, 2 Ariz. App. </em>538, 410 <em>P. 2d </em>495 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\"> We disagree. An assignment is a transfer by action of the transferor, whereas subrogation is an equitable right which arises out of the facts and which entitles the subrogee to collect that which he has advanced. See <em>e. g., Standard Accident Ins. Co. v. Pellecchia, </em>15 <em>N. J. </em>162 (1954); <em>Bd. of Ed., Woodbridge Tp. v. Kane Acoustical Co., </em>51 <em>N. J.

Ct. </em>1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Plaintiff contends that permitting subrogation for medical payments may cause many practical difficulties, especially where payment is made by the insurer and then the insured makes, or seeks to make, a compromise settlement with the tortfeasor. The short answer to this argument is (1) no such difficulty exists here, and (2) the question of whether a provision for subrogation should not be permitted in a policy because impractical or unfair is for the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance to decide. <em>Smith v.
