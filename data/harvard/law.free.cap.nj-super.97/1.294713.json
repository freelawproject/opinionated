At oral argument it was conceded by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel that no maintenance work nor repairs were made to the conduit since its installation in 1957. Suit was commenced in July 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-12\">The trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings. They appeal, contending that plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action arose more than six years before the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>mencement of suit and, therefore, it is barred by the statute of limitations, <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:14-1. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">Plaintiffs rely heavily upon <em>Fernandi v. Strully, </em>35 <em>N. J. </em>434 (1961). That case is clearly distinguishable. <em>Fernandi </em>was an action for medical malpractice based on the leaving of a foreign object in a patient\u2019s body during the course of an operation performed on April 26, 1955. In August 1958 X-rays revealed the foreign object in the patient\u2019s abdomen, and suit was instituted against the operating surgeons on August 3, 1959. The statute of limitations was pleaded. Our Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-6\">\u201c* * * Justice cries out that she [plaintiff] fairly be afforded a day in court and it appears evident to us that this may be done, at least in this highly confined type of case, without any undue impairment of the two-year limitation or the considerations of repose which underlie it.\u201d (35 <em>'N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>451, 173 <em>A. 2d, </em>at <em>p. </em>286)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b21-7\"> Here we are concerned with an action for tortious injury to property and the application of a six-year statute of limitations. The asserted negligence and the damage to. plaintiffs\u2019 sewer line occurred in 1957. We hold that plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action accrued in that year. The running of the statute of limitations is not postponed bjr the fact that additional damages were subsequently sustained. See <em>Stanley Development Co. v. Millburn Tp., </em>26 <em>N. J. Super. </em>328, 331 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953); 54 <em>C. J. S. Limitations of Actions </em>\u00a7 168. <em>p. </em>122 (1948). <em>Cf. Gogolin v. Williams, </em>91 <em>N. J. L. </em>266 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1917); <em>Winkler v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Ind. Co., </em>66 <em>N. J. Super. </em>22, 30 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), certification denied 34 A. <em>J. </em>581 (1961). There was no evidence of a continuing tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-8\">In <em>Rosenau v. City of New Brunswick, </em>93 N. <em>J. Super. </em>49, 54 <em>(App. Div. </em>1966), this court emphasized that \u201cthe giving of repose to human affairs\u201d is one of the important policy considerations embodied in our statutes of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-9\">In the circumstances of this case the trial court erred in not adhering to N. <em>J. S. </em>2A:14-1. Eeversed and remanded for entry of judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
