A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AcqN\">The executors of the estate of Amos Steinhardt appeal from an order of the Inheritance Tax Bureau of the Division of Taxation which levied a transfer tax of $(3,113.68 against their decedent\u2019s estate on a one-third interest in a business property. The property, occupied by a national chain store under a long-term lease, was evaluated by the bureau at $475,000, and appellants\u2019 interest therein at $158,333.33. The executors challenge the gross valuation and further contend that the value of their partial interest should be discounted 15% since it \u201cis worth less than its arithmetical share of the whole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">We find the gross valuation of $475,000 amply supported by the evidence. Presumptively, therefore, the decedent\u2019s one-third was worth $158,333.33. The Bureau held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>that the taxpayer had not proved that this figure should be discounted. Considering all the evidence in the record, including the length of the lease and the identity of the tenant, we are satisfied that the findings and the determination of the agency could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record. Accordingly, we affirm. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N. J. </em>146, 162 (1964). See also <em>Frater Corp. v. State of N. J., Div. of Tax Appeals, </em>80 <em>N. J. Super. </em>427, 431 <em>(App. Div. </em>1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">We find it necessary, however, for the future guidance of the Bureau, to express our disapproval of the position taken by it in its \u201cFindings Respecting Valuation of Real Property,\u201d that it uniformly follows \u201ca policy grounded upon \u2018administrative <em>stare decisis\u2019 * </em>* * of denying a claim for a discount, or deduction, in the valuation of a fractional interest in real property.\u201d While <em>stare decisis, </em>under some circumstances, may be applied to certain administrative determinations, the Bureau may not under guise of that doctrine follow an inflexible uniform policy which conflicts with the statute the Bureau is charged with administering. The policy of disallowing discounts in all cases and under all circumstances is disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The evidence in the instant matter does not provide any basis for the allowance of the claimed discount. However, in a particular case there may be evidence to justify a discount allowance in determining the clear market value of a fractional interest in real or personal property. See <em>Bassett v. Neeld, </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>551, 557 (1957); <em>In re Smith\u2019s Estate, </em>261 <em>Pa. </em>51, 104 <em>A. </em>492, 493 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1918); <em>In re Gilbert\u2019s Estate, </em>176 <em>App. Div. </em>850, 163 <em>N. Y. S. </em>974, 975-976 <em>(App. Div. </em>1917); <em>In re Turner\u2019s Estate, </em>221 <em>App. Div. </em>116, 222 <em>N. Y. S. </em>645, 646 <em>(App. Div. </em>1927); <em>Brone\u2019s Estate, </em>8 <em>Pa. Dist. &amp; Co. R. 2d </em>672, 679-680 <em>(Pa. Orph. Ct. </em>1956). But see <em>Wingert v. State, </em>129 <em>Md. </em>28, 98 <em>A. </em>224, 225 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1916). Note, 34 <em>Am. Jur. 2d, Federal Taxation, </em>\u00a7 8961 (1966), citing <em>Campanari v. Commissioner, </em>5 <em>T. C. </em>488, 492-493 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>R. S. </em>54:34-5 ordains that a transfer inheritance tax is to be computed upon \u201cthe clear market value of the property transferred.\u201d The statutory direction is mandatory and the quoted language is the polestar of the valuation process. See <em>Grell v. Kelly, </em>132 <em>N. J. L. </em>450, 451 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1945); <em>Montclair Trust Co. v. Zink, </em>141 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>401, 411 <em>(Prerog. </em>1948); <em>Tracy v. Alexander, </em>17 <em>N. J. </em>397, 401 (1955). Whatever the difficulty may be in ascertaining the market value, \u201cthe statutory standard is the one by which the bureau\u2019s determinations of value are and must be controlled.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>Bassett v. Neeld, supra, </em>where the value of closely held corporate stock was at issue, the court enunciated the general rule that the taxing authority \u201cis obliged to consider ail relevant criteria in establishing a valuation.\u201d 23 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>557. The weight to be accorded each factor depends upon the \u201cvarying circumstances of each case and calls for expert knowledge in the field.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at <em>p. </em>560.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The valuations and tax under review are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
