Trial by the court and decree for the defendant. Transferred from the May term, 1913, of the superior court by <em>Pike, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-13\">Solomon Jones died in March, 1864, leaving a widow, Lavina, and three children, Greenleaf, Florentine, and Sarah. By his will, which was duly proved, he gave one dollar to each of the children and a life estate in the residue to Lavina, with remainder to Green-leaf in fee. Lavina was named as executrix, but never qualified. She died in November, 1864. By her will, which was duly proved, Florentine and Sarah were each given one dollar and the residue was left to Greenleaf, who was named as executor, but never qualified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-14\">Upon the decease of Solomon, Greenleaf assumed to act as his administrator, took possession of the estate, and paid the debts and legacies. After his mother\u2019s death he pursued the same course with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>respect to her property. No bond or inventory was filed in either estate. He died in May, 1908, leaving a will which gave his entire estate to his widow, Anna, who died in May, 1909, intestate. The defendant is administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Greenleaf\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-5\">The estates of Greenleaf and Anna are in process of settlement in the insolvent course. Florentine\u2019s claims against those estates have been disallowed by the commissioners and appeals are now pending. The claims against Greenleaf\u2019s estate are: (1) For the principal and interest of money deposited by Florentine with Solomon, which came to the possession of Greenleaf; (2) for the proceeds of certain railroad stock which Florentine entrusted to Solomon and which Greenleaf subsequently sold; (3) one half of Solomon\u2019s estate with accretions, or, in lieu thereof, damages for breach of a contract made in 1876, whereby Greenleaf and Anna promised to leave all their property by will to Florentine, in consideration of his agreement not to enforce his claims against his father\u2019s estate. The claim against Anna\u2019s estate is for damages for breach of the same contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-6\">In the superior court, the grounds urged for the appointment of an administrator were that Florentine had a right of action against Solomon at the time of the latter\u2019s death, which survived and still exists, and that such administrator should be made party to the pending proceedings against the estates of Greenleaf and Anna. The court found that the plaintiff\u2019s delay in asking for the appointment of an administrator constituted laches and that such appointment w'as not necessary in aid of the pending proceedings, and dismissed the appeal. To these findings and the decree thereon the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-7\"><em>Remick &amp; Jackson {Mr. Remick </em>orally), for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-8\"><em>Burleigh &amp; Adams </em>and <em>Martin &amp; Howe {Mr. Howe </em>orally), for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b311-9\">Young, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnA\">If a creditor wishes to exercise the right given him by sections 2 and 5, chapter 188, Public Statutes, he must act within a reasonable time after he learns of the death of the debtor. <em>Whidden </em>v. <em>Whidden, </em>67 N. H. 303. The plaintiff attempts to excuse his delay of forty-seven years before beginning this proceeding by saying that he made a contract with Greenleaf shortly after their father\u2019s death, by which his brother, in consideration of his agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>ment not to enforce his claims against their father\u2019s estate, agreed to give the plaintiff all his property at his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">If the plaintiff made this contract he is bound by it, and in so far as he is concerned Solomon\u2019s estate is fully administered. <em>George </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>45 N. H. 456. If the plaintiff failed to enforce his claim against Solomon\u2019s estate because he thought he had made this contract, though in fact he had not made it, a different situation is presented;, but in that case it does not necessarily follow that he should be permitted to proceed against Solomon\u2019s estate. That depends in part on the reasonableness of his conduct in thinking he had made such a contract, in part on his conduct since that time, and in part on the reasonableness of Greenleaf\u2019s conduct. It is useless, however, to consider this question further, for the finding of the court is that he has been guilty of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The necessary parties to any proceeding, regardless of its nature (that is, whether it is <em>in rem, </em>at law, or in equity), are those and those only who have an interest in the subject-matter of the suit and whose rights may be concluded by the judgment. <em>Busby </em>v. <em>Littlefield, </em>31 N. H. 193. Therefore, the test to determine who should be made parties to this proceeding, in which the plaintiff is seeking to impress a trust on the property Greenleaf received from his father, is to inquire who have an interest in or to that property. The answer to this question must be, those and those only who claim through Greenleaf; for he took the property into his possession in 1864, paid his father\u2019s debts and legacies, and has since held the property as his own. As no one claiming through Solomon appears to have any interest in or to the property, no ground is perceived upon which it will be held that his administrator is a necessary party to the trust suit. There is no occasion for the appointment of an administrator until in some proceeding it is judicially determined that such administrator must be a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b312-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
