Brooks.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b575-11\">Section 2, chapter 104, Laws of 1911, does not empower the superior court to appoint a guardian of a minor upon an original petition, but prevents section 1 of the act being so construed as to take from any court of competent jurisdiction authority to appoint guardians of minors whose parents are living.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-12\">Libel for Divorce. Trial at the May term, 1914, of the superior court before <em>Sawyer, </em>J., who found that the plaintiff\u2019s charges were not sustained and dismissed the libel. Subsequently, a motion filed by the plaintiff in the superior court during the pendency of the libel, requesting the appointment of a guardian for her minor child, was dismissed by <em>Pike, </em>C. J. To the foregoing finding and rulings the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b575-13\"><em>Marion W.

Section 2 provides, in substance, that nothing contained in section 1 shall prevent any court of competent jurisdiction from appointing a guardian of the person of a minor. It is therefore the office of section 2 to prevent section 1 being so construed as to take from the court jurisdiction to appoint guardians of minors whose parents are living, and not to confer such jurisdiction. The probate court is specially authorized to appoint guardians of minors. P. S., c. 178, s. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b576-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
