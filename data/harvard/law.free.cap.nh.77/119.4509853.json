May 8, 1912, the mayor issued to the defendant police officers the warrant provided for by section 11, chapter 60, Laws 1891, the police commissioners of the city joining therein. The police officers claim that they should be paid for services rendered, under the warrant, and this proceeding is brought to restrain the approval and payment of bills for such compensation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-5\">The members of the police force are appointed by the police commissioners. The rules and regulations of the police department-provide that hours of regular service will be specified, that all officers are liable to be called into service at any time, and that no-extra compensation will be allowed \u201cexcept upon bills approved by the marshal or the police commissioners, and ordered paid by proper-authority.\u201d The work for which compensation is claimed was done-outside the regular hours of service, but upon days for which the-claimants received pay as policemen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-6\">Subject to the defendants\u2019 exception, the court ruled that the-police officers were not entitled to additional compensation for the-services in question and that the mayor and treasurer should be-enjoined from approving and paying the bills therefor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-7\"><em>Arthur 0.

Their bill for serving the warrant has not been so approved, and there is no statute which provides that the city shall pay members of its police force for serving such warrants. It would be illegal, therefore, for the mayor to order this bill paid. <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Rochester, </em>60 N.
