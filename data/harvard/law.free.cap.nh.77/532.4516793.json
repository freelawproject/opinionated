Edward Poland, having been arrested by Day upon a complaint and warrant made out by Goss, paid upon a sentence of the police court of the district of Berlin, to the clerk of said court, costs which included $1.62 as officer\u2019s fee for the arrest and $1.50 as fee for the complaint and warrant. The city claims these fees, having procured the issuance of the warrant and the making of the arrest. The marshal and solicitor are paid regular salaries by the city. The clerk of the court paid the sums in question to the county treasurer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b560-15\"><em>Goss &amp; James, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b560-16\"><em>Burritt H.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4O\">An action of assumpsit cannot be maintained against a county. Claims against a county must be presented to the county commissioners for allowance. P. S., c. 27, <em>s. </em>10. In case of disagreement between the claimant and the commissioners as to any claim, the same may be laid before the court for decision. <em>Ib., s. </em>13. If the claims in dispute have been presented to the commissioners, the suits in assumpsit may be transformed by amendment into applications for a revision by the court of the judgment of the commissioners. <em>Plymouth </em>v. <em>County, </em>68 N. H. 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The costs, including the fees in question, were properly collected by the clerk of the district police court, whose duty it was, before turning his collections over to the county treasurer, to pay, among other expenses of the court, the \u201cfees of officers and witnesses.\u201d Laws 1913, c. 169, s. 60. As the clerk, instead of complying with the law, paid the money to the county treasurer, the county has money of the officers to whom the fees should have been paid. Whether as between the officers and the city the money collected as fees for their services belongs to them or to the city is immaterial. If the city by virtue of agreement with the officers has title to it, nothing appears transferring that title to the county. Upon the facts stated, the claims should be allowed by the commissioners, or by the court if the commissioners have disallowed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b561-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
