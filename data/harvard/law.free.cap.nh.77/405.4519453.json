Trial by jury and verdict for the plaintiff. Transferred from the November term, 1913, of the superior court by <em>Pike, </em>C. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-11\">During the trial a witness testified that the plaintiff resided in Grafton county, where the defendant had its sole place of business. Thereupon the defendant moved that the case be transferred to that county, and offered to prove that the plaintiff resided there and that the defendant and its counsel were justifiably ignorant of the facts until that time. The court declined to hear the evidence and denied the motion, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-12\">The negligence complained of was in improperly erecting and caring for a tent, by reason whereof it fell and injured the plaintiff. The defendant contracted with Wallingford &amp; Acres to erect and take care of the tent, and one Acres was sent by the firm to do this work. The defendant contended that it had discharged its duty with respect to the condition of the tent by contracting with responsible partiesNfor its erection and care.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-13\">In the closing argument for the plaintiff counsel said: \u201cI don\u2019t suppose that there' is any rule claimed here that because they hired what they supposed to be competent men to put up these tents that they can say \u2018It is Acres and not us.\u2019 Whatever legal complications may come after in this case, if there are any, as to who might be responsible in another matter don\u2019t concern us. You are to try this case on the evidence that is here and on nothing else, and the courts take care of the hereafter in another and a different way if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>becomes necessary.\u201d The defendant excepted, and counsel continued: \u201cIf in any way I have intimated that this association could in any way be helped out on any verdict that you render, I say to you here, as I intended to say before, that you have nothing to do with that whatever, and I don\u2019t know as there is anything of that sort. \u201d The defendant excepted, the court inquired what the bearing of the remarks was, and counsel continued: \u201cThey object. I told them they are to try this case on the law and evidence in this case; and whether there is anything between them and the tent company, as to whether they can get after the tent company or not, that thing they should not regard at all or consider in this case.\u201d The defendant excepted \u201cto the reiteration of the statement. \u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-5\"><em>Owen &amp; Veazey </em>and <em>Charles B. Hibbard {Mr. Hibbard </em>orally), for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-6\">\u25a0 <em>Streeter, Deniond, Woodworth &amp; Sulloway {Mr. Sulloway </em>orally), for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b434-7\">Peaslee, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abr\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim, that a change of venue because an action has been brought in the wrong county can only be had at the plaintiff\u2019s option, is not well founded. Instead of dismissing such a suit for want of jurisdiction, the court may transfer it to the proper county without any request from the plaintiff that such action be taken. <em>Wheeler &amp; Wilson Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Whitcomb, </em>62 N. H. 411. The order is made only when required by justice. <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>60 N. H. 168. There is no sound reason why a defendant may not ask for the relief which justice will afford him, rather than for an unreasonable and unattainable defeat of the whole suit upon a collateral plea. Knowing that on the facts in the case he is entitled to a transfer and to nothing more, the non-technical procedure in this state permits him to ask for it directly. He is not required to demand an unconscionable advantage in order to be granted the lesser one to which he is justly entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">But while the defendant may seek such relief, it does not follow that in seeking it he is entitled to treat his motion as a plea in abatement. If the facts show that the suit is brought in the wrong county, the court has no discretion as to granting or withholding some relief when the question is raised upon a plea in abatement. But upon a motion for a change of venue, a further question must be decided. No relief will be granted unless justice so requires. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Lake, </em>67 N. H. 193. The fact as to what justice requires may vary the relief granted upon a plea in abatement, but proof of it is a necessary prerequisite to obtaining any relief whatever upon a motion for change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The motion here made is not, either in form or in substance, a plea in abatement. If the defendant might have asked for leave to file such a plea at so late a day because of its justifiable ignorance of the facts, it did not do so. It chose rather to ask for a change of venue, and its rights are limited accordingly. If it had made or should hereafter make a request that the suit be abated, the result would be the same. The time for filing the technical plea having elapsed, the whole question would be disposed of upon the broad ground of what justice requires. <em>Tinkham </em>v. <em>Railroad, ante, </em>111. The question is, therefore, whether the record shows that justice has not been done by the action taken in the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The defendant offered to prove that the plaintiff was not a resident of Belknap county, and that it was justifiably ignorant of this fact until the motion for a change of venue was filed during the progress of the trial of the cause before a jury. The court refused to hear the evidence and denied the motion. The defendant now claims that this amounts to a denial of its motion as matter of law. The action taken falls short of this. It was a finding that even if the facts were as alleged, still justice did not require that the motion be granted. This was a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the trial court, and the conclusion reached cannot be attacked here, save upon a showing that there was a plain abuse of judicial discretion; that is, that there was no evidence to justify the conclusion arrived at. The facts that a jury trial had already been commenced in a county adjoining that where the defendant does business and the plaintiff is alleged to reside, and that there was no suggestion that there was any reason to believe that the Belknap county jury would not deal justly by the parties, were in themselves enough to warrant the conclusion that justice did not require putting the parties and the public to the expense involved in granting the motion at that stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The argument to which exception was taken was not objectionable. The defendant had set up the claim that the person who erected the tent was liable. It now concedes, as it must, that it might be liable for his acts. The substance of the argument was that a claim that \u201cit is Acres and not us\u201d had no foundation in law, and that the extent of the defendant\u2019s rights in that behalf would be a recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>over against Acres. It was a statement of a legal position, rather than one of fact, and was legitimately made as an answer to that' taken by the defendant. The statement about being \u201chelped out\u201d1 meant no more than a reiteration of the*proposition that Acres might be liable over. The second statement was merely a colloquial paraphrase of the first. The remarks not being open to the objection made, it is unnecessary to consider whether they were withdrawn in the colloquy that followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b436-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
