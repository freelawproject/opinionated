At the October term, 1911, of the superior court, the action was referred to arbitrators by an agreement of the parties in which it was stipulated \u201cthat the decision of said arbitrators, or a majority of them, in writing shall be final upon questions of law as well as fact arising in the case before them, and shall be made to the superior court for said county of Rockingham at its next term after the rendition of said decision, and judgment shall be rendered thereon by said court with costs. \u201d During the October term, 1913, of the court, the arbitrators filed their report in favor of the defendant town, and judgment was entered thereon. At the April term, 1914, the plaintiff filed a motion requesting the court to vacate the judgment because it was not rendered at the next term after the decision, and to recommit the report for special findings upon the ground that it might thereby appear that errors had been made by the arbitrators. Neither party had asked for specific findings before the decision was rendered. The court <em>(Pike, </em>C. J.) vacated the judgment rendered at the October term, denied the motion for a recommitment of the report, and entered judgment in favor of the defendant as of the January term, 1914. To these rulings the plaintiff excepted and filed a bill of exceptions which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-9\"><em>Hubert C. Thompson </em>and <em>Wells &amp; Hale </em>(both of Massachusetts) and <em>Arthur 0.

H. 599, 603. It does not appear that the plaintiff has suffered injustice by the order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">As no request was made of the arbitrators to report the evidentiary facts found by them and their rulings of law thereon, either at the hearing or trial, or before the filing of their report in court, no error of law was committed by the court in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion that the report be recommitted for that purpose. <em>Janvrin </em>v. <em>Janvrin, </em>58 N. H. 144; <em>Peterborough R. R. </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>61 N. H. 418; <em>Moynihan </em>v. <em>Brennan, ante, </em>273. In view of the terms of the submission that the report should be \u201cfinal upon questions of law as well as fact arising in the case,\u201d and in the absence of any suggestion or intimation of fraud, mistake, or misconduct on the part of the arbitrators, it is apparent that justice does not require a recommitment of the report. This is true if it is assumed, in accordance with the plaintiff\u2019s contention, that the case was submitted to referees under sections 9-14, chapter 227, Public Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b428-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
