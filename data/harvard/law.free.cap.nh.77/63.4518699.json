The plaintiff is a resident of Haverhill and is the owner of real estate in the defendant town, which is taxed to .him as non-resident. The petitions were referred to the tax commission. The plaintiff claimed before the commission that in appraising his land for taxation the value of the growing trees thereon should be excluded, but the commission included the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>same as a part of the value of the land. Upon the return of the report, the superior court <em>(Mitchell, </em>J.) ordered judgment upon the report at the September term, 1912, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-5\">The plaintiff, <em>pro se, </em>by brief and orally.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-6\"><em>Marshall D.

According to his theory, only the value of the land exclusive of the wooded growth should have been considered by the assessors. But it is unnecessary in deciding what the law is upon this subject to enter upon a discussion of philosophical theories of how taxes ought to be imposed and raised, or to consider what unused methods of taxation might have been adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The statute provides that \u201creal estate, whether improved or unimproved, and whether owned by residents or others, is liable to be taxed,\u201d excepting certain classes of real estate not material in this case. P. S., c. 55, s. 2. As universally understood, the term \u201creal estate \"includes growing timber. \u201cThewords, 'land/ 'lands/ or 'real estate\u2019 shall include lands, tenements, and hereditaments, and all rights thereto and interests therein.\u201d P. S., c. 2, s. 21. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it is not to be doubted that the legislature in declaring that real estate is taxable meant property in land as thus defined and understood, which includes timber until severed from the land. <em>Kingsley </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>45 N. H. 313; <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>61 N. H. 583, 585; <em>Amoskeag Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Concord, </em>66 N. H. 562; <em>Hodsdon </em>v. <em>Kennett, </em>73 N. H. 225. Because the question relates to the subject of taxation has.never been held to be a reason for a different and more restricted definition of \u201cland,\u201d than is employed when the question relates to a sale or conveyance of the same property. \u201cMines and quarries, though the ownership of them is severed from that of the surface, are taxable as real estate; so is standing timber, though owned separately from the land whereon it grows.\u201d Cool. Tax. (3d ed.) 635. \u201cThe ownership of timber standing and growing on land is an interest in the land itself, and . . . assessable as realty.\u201d <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Alcona, </em>72 Mich. 18, 23. It is held in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Cass County, </em>69 Ia. 147, that nursery stock growing upon land is part of the realty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>and should be assessed with the land. See, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>82 N. Y. 459; <em>Pine County </em>v. <em>Tozer, </em>56 Minn. 288; <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>State, </em>115 Ala. 208; <em>Globe Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Lockett, </em>106 La. 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">As standing timber is a part of the realty for the purposes of taxation, its value is an element to be considered in ascertaining \u201cthe true value\u201d of the land. \u201cThe selectmen shall appraise all taxable property at its full and true value in money as they would appraise the same in payment of a just debt due from a solvent debtor.\u201d P. S., c. 58, s. 1. \u201cBy our statute, all real estate, with certain specified exemptions, is liable to be taxed.\u201d <em>Nashua Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Nashua, </em>46 N. H. 389, 392. By an unbroken line of decisions for more than eighty years, \u201cthe constitutional rule of equality in taxation requires that throughout the same taxing district the same tax shall be laid upon the same amount of property, \u2018so that each man\u2019s taxable property shall bear its due portion of the tax according to its value.\u2019 <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>4 N H. 565, 568. The share which every person is bound to contribute, for the protection in the enjoyment of his life, liberty, and property, to which he is entitled (Bill of Rights, <em>art. </em>12), is his proportional part of the expense of such protection according to the amount of his taxable estate.\u201d <em>Amoskeag Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>70 N. H. 336, 344. These views were further elaborated in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>76 N. H. 588-597.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s timber land is his \u201ctaxable estate,\u201d and its \u201cfull and fair value in money\u201d is not ascertained by excluding from the computation the value of the timber. The idea that it is excluded as a matter of law in this state is a novel one, which, in view of the long continued and unquestioned understanding and practice in the assessment of taxes to the contrary, would require a legislative act or a constitutional amendment, or both, to justify the judiciary in declaring it to be law. That the value of the standing timber is an essential element of the value of the land supporting it was recognized and assumed, as a universally conceded fact, in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>76 N. H. 609, rendered to the house of representatives upon the question whether an act exempting from taxation standing wood and timber to the extent of twenty-five per cent of its true value would be constitutional. Our reply was in the negative. It must be taxed at its full value as a part of the real estate. The plaintiff\u2019s position, as a proposition of existing law, is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b93-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
