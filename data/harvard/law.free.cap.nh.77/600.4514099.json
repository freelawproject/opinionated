Roby.</parties>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-13\">Petition, for an injunction restraining the defendant from interfering with real estate alleged to be charged with the debts of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and for instructions as to whether the debts might be considered a charge upon the real estate if the intestate intended to make them so. Upon a trial of the facts it was found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>that there was no evidence that the intestate had such an intention, and the petition was dismissed subject to exception. The plaintiff also excepted to the refusal to grant him an <em>ex parte </em>hearing. Transferred from the April term, 1914, of the superior court by <em>Sawyer, </em>J.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b629-5\"><em>Horace J.

The administrator of Volney Day\u2019s estate now seeks to prevent Mrs. Roby from disposing of the property, upon the ground that it is charged with the payment of Volney\u2019s debts. As the plaintiff failed to prove the allegation upon which his claim depended, his petition was rightly dismissed. No brief has been filed in support of the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions, and no error has been found in the rulings of the superior court. The claim that it was the plaintiff\u2019s right to have the defendant\u2019s rights curtailed without opportunity to make objection on her part is not entitled to serious consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b629-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
