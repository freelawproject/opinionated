Trial by the court. Transferred from the April term, 1914, of the superior court by <em>Sawyer, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b627-18\">The plaintiff, having suffered injury, furnished the defendants satisfactory proof in which he claimed $82.50 for six weeks\u2019 total disability. The defendants sent him a check for $61.50, with a letter stating that payment was allowed for only four weeks\u2019 total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>disability, with two weeks\u2019 partial disability. Upon the face of the check was a printed statement that the same was \u201cin full and final settlement for all claims originating prior to the date hereof,\u201d and upon the back was a \u201creceipt and indorsement\u201d acknowledging the full satisfaction of all claims. The plaintiff collected the check and two days later requested further payment. The court found that the plaintiff was totally disabled for six weeks and that he accepted payment in accordance with the terms of the check and the indorsement thereon. A verdict was entered and judgment rendered for the defendants, subject to exception.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b628-5\"><em>Ovide J.

Whether in accepting and collecting the defendants\u2019 check the plaintiff assented to the defendants\u2019 proposition that the money so received should be deemed to be in full settlement of the claim is a question of fact, not of law. <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Buzzell, </em>75 N. H. 486; <em>S. C., </em>76 N. H. 120. The fact' being found that the plaintiff accepted the defendants\u2019 payment in accordance with the terms of the check and the printed indorsement, it would be useless to consider whether the evidentiary facts reported are as matter of law inconsistent with the opposite conclusion. Neither fraud nor mistake is charged. The verdict and judgment for the defendants are the legal results of the findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b628-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
