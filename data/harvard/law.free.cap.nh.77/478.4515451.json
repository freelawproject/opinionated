Transferred from the April term, 1914, of the superior court by <em>Sawyer, </em>J., on the plaintiff\u2019s exception to an order of nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show the following facts: In 1907, he was engaged in the business of examining timber lands, and buying and selling them on commission. At that time Annis asked the plaintiff to inform him of any good trades, as he desired to purchase. Shortly thereafter the plaintiff informed the defendants that there were 1,100 acres at a place in Canada, for sale at $7 per acre, and the parties went from their home in Colebrook and examined the property. Upon their return the defendants asked the plaintiff what pay he expected. He said fifty cents per acre, and they agreed to pay that sum if they bought the land. It was soon learned that 400 acres of the best of the land were not for sale, and in April, 1907, the defendants bought remaining 700 acres for S5 per acre. After waiting a reasonable time the plaintiff asked Annis for his pay, and Annis replied that he would attend to the matter. In 1909, the plaintiff again asked Annis for his commission, and Annis replied that he would attend to it and pay it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-6\"><em>Horace J.

Subsequently it developed that a part of the land was not for sale, and a little later the defendants bought the balance at a reduced price. From this it could be found that the defendants had received value from the plaintiff, at their request, and were bound to pay for it. It might well be argued that the amount was then uncertain, since the lands bought were presumably less valuable than the average of the whole tract to which the express promise related. But the plaintiff also testified that in a reasonable time thereafter he asked Annis for the money, and Annis promised to have the matter attended to. This would warrant a finding that the minds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>of the parties met upon the proposition. There was therefore sufficient evidence of the existence of the contract, as against Annis, aside from any admissions contained in the new promise of 1909. In this state of the proof, the chief question argued by the defendants does not arise. The existence of the original undertaking is shown, without reference to the new promise; and the new promise could be found to refer to this undertaking and no other. The plaintiff testified that within six years he asked Annis for \u201cthat commission, \u201d and that Annis promised to pay it. This is sufficient evidence that at the time the new promise was made both parties had in mind the $350 for which this suit is brought. The plaintiff was entitled to go to the jury upon the question of Annis\u2019 original undertaking to pay $350 and of his new promise to pay the same sum. <em>Kittredge </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>9 N. H. 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">There is no evidence of a new promise by Johnson. That alleged to have been made by Annis did not bind his associate. There is no evidence that Annis was Johnson\u2019s agent for this purpose, or that he undertook to act in such capacity. It is unnecessary to inquire as to the sufficiency of the evidence to show an original undertaking by Johnson; for if there was one, action upon it is barred by the statute. As to him, the nonsuit was properly ordered and he is entitled to judgment; but as to Annis there must be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b508-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
