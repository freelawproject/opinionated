This is the same case reported 76 N. H. 388, and <em>ante, </em>61. Upon this trial, at the October term, 1913, of the superior court, there was a verdict for the plaintiff. At the beginning of the trial and again after the verdict, the defendants made a motion for judgment, which was denied by <em>Plummer, </em>J., subject to exception. The ground of the motion was that upon the facts reported upon the first transfer and claimed to exist at the present trial, a judgment for the plaintiff would be in violation of the federal interstate commerce law.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b621-11\"><em>Joseph Madden, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b621-12\"><em>John E.

H. 154, 158.\u201d No additional reasons are now presented for a reconsideration of the federal question suggested, or for a modification of the opinion given on the first transfer, as reported in 76 N. H. 388. Nor is there occasion for the court in the exercise of its discretion <em>(Hedding </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>72 N. H. 377, 379) to again consider the federal question which is again raised by the defendant upon the same state of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b622-6\">Plummer, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
