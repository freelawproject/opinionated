The court enjoined the defendants and they excepted.

H. 574, 575. The defendants\u2019 contention that it has never been decided that the plaintiffs have a right of way over their land is therefore not open to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">The defendants contend that the court erred in enjoining them, because they were entitled to a jury trial of the issue as to whether the way described in the plaintiffs\u2019 petition is the same way that was described in their brief statement in the former action. But that contention is not open to them in this proceeding. It can only be raised in a proceeding to punish them for a violation of the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">\n<em>Exception orerruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b128-14\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
