In March, 1913, Charles gave the defendant Wyman an order on the trustee which has not been paid. William adopted the defendant Bean in 1898 and died in 1913, leaving no natural children. The court ruled that the defendants Bean and Allen had no interest in the trust property, and that it was for the trustee to decide whether Wyman\u2019s order should be paid, and they excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number><em>Isaac L.

His only right under Calvin\u2019s will is the right to receive so much of the income of the fund set apart for his benefit as the trustee thinks will benefit him. <em>Wolfman </em>v. <em>Webster, ante, </em>24. Consequently that was all he could assign to Wyman. In other words, the right Wyman took from Charles was the right to receive the amount of the order if the trustee thinks it should be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">The defendant Bean takes nothing under the will of Calvin, for she is not William\u2019s child within the ordinary meaning of the word, and there is nothing to rebut the presumption that Calvin intended to give that word its ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">While Calvin intended to create two trust funds, one for the benefit of each of his sons, and to give the trustee power to determine how much of the income of the fund set apart for the benefit of each son should be paid to him, when it came to disposing of the principal and accumulated income he gave each of these funds on the death of the son for whose benefit it was created, not to the children of that son, but \u201cto the children of my said sons and their heirs, to be equally divided among them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b482-14\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
