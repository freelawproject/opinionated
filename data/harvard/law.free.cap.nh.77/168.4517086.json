Kerin <em>&amp; a.</em></parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b196-10\">Certain evidence deemed sufficient to warrant the conclusion that a devise of \u201creal estate located at the corner of Pearl and Pine streets\u201d was intended to include all land sc situated of which the testatrix died seized, although the same was conveyed to her by a deed which described the property as three separate tracts.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-11\">Bill in Equity, by the executor of the will of Ellen Kerin, praying for a construction of the second clause, which is as follows: \u201cI give. . . . my real estate located at the corner of Pearl and Pine streets, . . . known as the Pattee house, to my son, John F. Kerin.\u201d Facts found, by a master. Transferred without a ruling from the May term, 1913, of the superior court by <em>Chamberlin, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-14\">About a year prior to the execution of the will, the testatrix purchased of the heirs of Luther Pattee land at the corner of Pearl and Pine streets in Manchester, on which were three houses, one located on Pearl street, another on Pine street, and a third at the corner of those streets. The deed to her described the property as three separate tracts. The corner lot, on which stood a house and barn, was purchased by Pattee in 1883. There was a fence around the land on which the house stood, but not around the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>occupied by the barn. Pattee bought the adjoining house on Pearl street in 1886, and the house on Pine street in 1892. He occupied the corner house and rented the others, and Mrs. Kerin was using the property in the same way at the time the will was executed. There was nothing to indicate whether she' considered the corner house, or all three houses, as the Pattee place or house, except what was said when she was conferring with her attorney as to a draft of her will. At a preliminary conference she said that John was to have the place at the corner of Pearl and Pine streets; and when she was asked by the attorney what property she meant, her brother replied \u201cthe Pattee place.\u201d At the final conference she said John was to have her house or place at the corner of Pearl and Pine streets; and when she was asked how it was called or described, she replied \u201cthe Pattee house.\u201d Evidence as to declarations of the testatrix which tended to show her understanding and intent was admitted subject to exception by Timothy Kerin.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-5\"><em>Taggart, Tuttle, Burroughs &amp; Wyman, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-6\"><em>Jones, Warren, Wilson &amp; Manning, </em>for Timothy Kerin.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-7\"><em>Branch &amp; Branch, </em>for John F. Kerin.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b197-8\">Young, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbS\">When the language Mrs. Kerin used is read in the light of the facts, it is uncertain just what land she intended to give John. \u201cMy real estate located at the corner of Pearl and Pine streets\u201d is apt language to describe all three of the houses, while \u201cknown as the Pattee house\u201d tends to limit it to the corner house; but there is nothing to show either that that house was-commonly known as the Pattee house, or that that was the way Mrs. Kerin thought of it. But it does appear that at two of the conferences she had with her attorney she said John was to have her house or place at the corner of Pearl and0 Pine streets, and that at one of these conferences the property she had in mind was all three of the houses. This tends to the conclusion that she used \u201cthe Pattee house\u201d and \u201cthe Pattee place\u201d as synonymous terms when she was speaking of this property. Although the fact that the Pattee heirs described the property in the deed they gave Mrs. Kerin as three separate tracts of land and the further fact that there was a fence around the corner house may be relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>to the issue of her intention, any inferences that fairly may be drawn from these facts are not sufficient to rebut the conclusion that she intended to give John all three of the houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Although the deed describes the property as three separate tracts of land, it does not describe either of these tracts as the Pattee house or place; and while it may have some tendency to show that the grantors thought of the property as three separate tracts of land, it has little or no tendency to prove that that was the way Mrs. Kerin thought of it. The same is true of the fact there was a fence around the corner house, for the fence bounded only a part of the land Pattee occupied in connection with the corner house, and is also true in respect to Mrs. Kerin\u2019s occupation at the time the will was made, or until 1905, when she converted the stable into a house. This result renders it unnecessary to consider the competency of the evidence admitted subject to Timothy\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The plaintiff is advised that John takes a life estate in all the land at the corner of Pearl and Pine streets of which Mrs. Kerin died seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Case <em>discharged.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b198-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
