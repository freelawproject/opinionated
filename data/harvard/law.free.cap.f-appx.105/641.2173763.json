As for the individual defendants, Ag\u00fcero has failed to file a written report but, irrespective of that failure and the justification for it, the only claim of malpractice is the failure to supply him with darker tinted eyeglasses, or to engage a different physician. He has not alleged deliberate indifference to serious medical needs. Dismissal was justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b665-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
