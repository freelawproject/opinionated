(\u201cMack\u201d), and its orders denying Washington\u2019s motions to amend his complaint, for a continuance, and to admit affidavits. Washington alleged that his employment with Mack was terminated because of his race in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2000e-17 (2000), and in retaliation for filing charges of discrimination against Mack. Our review of the record and the district court\u2019s opinions disclose that this appeal is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-15\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Washington\u2019s motion to amend his complaint, given that Washington previously had filed three complaints and further amendment would have prejudiced Mack through undue delay. <em>See Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962); <em>Franks v. Ross, </em>313 F.3d 184, 192 (4th Cir.2002). Nor do we find abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Washington\u2019s request to admit affidavits into the record, considering the court previously had granted Washington two extensions of time to file affidavits to counter summary judgment, and his request was made after the magistrate judge had rendered his recommendation for disposition of the case. We likewise find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s refusal to grant Washington a continuance of his case, given the posture of the case at the time he made his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-16\">Washington also asserts error in the district court\u2019s adverse grant of summary judgment. However, Washington failed to timely file objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, despite being given notice that the failure to do so could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Washington has waived appellate review of the district court\u2019s adverse grant of summary judgment by failing to file objections after receiving proper notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders denying Washington\u2019s motions to amend his complaint, to file affidavits, and for a continuance, and further affirm the district court\u2019s order granting Mack\u2019s summary judgment motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
