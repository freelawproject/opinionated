The granting of a writ of mandamus is a drastic remedy to be used in extraordinary circumstances. <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). Hicks\u2019 petition does not set forth exceptional circumstances as would warrant the issuance of a writ of mandamus at this time. We note, however, that no significant action has been taken in the district court for over seven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-17\">Accordingly, we deny Hicks\u2019 mandamus petition without prejudice to her refiling it should the district court fail to act within a reasonable time. We grant Hicks\u2019 application to proceed on appeal in forma pauper-is and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-18\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
