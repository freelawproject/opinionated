Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d 644 (4th Cir.2002). We recently held that an order denying Rule 60(b) relief in a habeas setting is \u201cthe final order in a habeas corpus proceeding\u201d subject to the certificate of appealability requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 367-70 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find both that his constitutional claims are debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Brinkley has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
