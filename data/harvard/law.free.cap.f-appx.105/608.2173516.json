He argues that the allegations contained in his complaint and the evidence adduced at the <em>Spears</em><footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing were sufficient to establish a claim against Larry Settles for deliberate indifference to medical needs. Webb does not challenge the dismissal of his claims against Vernette Porter and has thus abandoned any challenge related to the dismissal of those claims. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Webb contends that Settles was not aggressive enough in treating his ankle injury. His disagreement with Settles\u2019s treatment of his injury is insufficient to state a constitutional claim. <em>See Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Webb\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous and the dismissal of this appeal each count as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). If Webb accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b633-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
