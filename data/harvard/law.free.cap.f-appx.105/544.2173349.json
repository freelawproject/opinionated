Between the time that Hernandez\u2019 jury was selected and sworn and the time that his trial commenced, 11 out of his 12 jurors served interim jury service. On the morning of trial, Hernandez filed a motion asserting that some of the jurors had been on convicting juries in similar criminal cases in that interim period. The district court denied Hernandez\u2019 motion as untimely. Hernandez now appeals that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-16\">Hernandez argues correctly that his motion, filed on the morning of trial, but before any testimony was heard, was timely. <em>See United States v. Jefferson, </em>569 F.2d 260, 261-63 (5th Cir.1978); <em>United States v. Capua, </em>656 F.2d 1033, 1036 (5th Cir.1981). Any challenge for cause based on interim jury service made during voir dire would have been premature. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>699 F.2d 704, 708 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Jefferson, </em>569 F.2d at 262. Any peremptory challenge based on interim jury service made during voir dire would have been uninformed and meaningless. <em>See United States v. Mutchler, </em>559 F.2d 955, 958 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-17\">Hernandez\u2019 interim-jury-service challenge was timely. However, the record is insufficiently developed to determine whether the interim jury service at issue was done on convicting juries in similar trials. <em>See United States v. Mutchler, </em>566 F.2d 1044, 1044 (5th Cir.1978). Thus, this case is remanded to the district court for factual findings and a ruling on the merits of Hernandez\u2019 motion. <em>See Jefferson, </em>569 F.2d at 263. \u201cIf the district court finds that interim service occurred in \u2018other cases similar in fact and in legal issue or in cases in which the same government witnesses\u2019 testified, as explicated in <em>Mutchler, </em>it should order that a new trial be held; otherwise, it should reaffirm the judgment of conviction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-18\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b569-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
