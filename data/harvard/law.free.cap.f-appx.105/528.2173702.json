To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence [s]he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the record and conclude Tesfaye fails to show the evidence compels a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-26\">Additionally, we uphold the Board\u2019s denial of Tesfaye\u2019s request for withholding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>removal. The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for granting asylum. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Because Tesfaye fails to show she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
