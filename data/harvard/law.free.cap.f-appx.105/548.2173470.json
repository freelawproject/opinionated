Campbell petitions for review of the decision of the Benefits Review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Board of the United States Department of Labor (\u201cBRB\u201d) affirming the decision of the ALJ, which denied Mr. Campbell\u2019s claim for benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901, <em>et seq. </em>In his petition, Mr. Campbell, in effect, challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the denial of his disability benefits claim. Our review of a decision of the BRB is limited in scope to \u201cconsidering errors of law and making certain that the BRB adhered to its statutory standard of review of factual determinations, that is, whether the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and [are] consistent with the law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The key issue before the ALJ was whether Mr. Campbell\u2019s disability was caused by (1) a work-related injury or (2) circumstances unrelated to his job. The ALJ found that, even though Mr. Campbell had met his burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case for benefits,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> his employer successfully rebutted that presumption by adducing substantial evidence to show that Mr. Campbell\u2019s injury was pre-existing and that it was not exacerbated by his work-related trauma.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result, the ALJ was obligated to assess the issue of causation by looking at <em>all </em>of the record evidence, which he did.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After doing so, the ALJ concluded that the weight of the credible testimony and medical evidence demonstrated that Mr. Campbell had failed to establish a sufficient relationship between the work trauma that he had experienced and the disability for which he was asserting a claim for benefits. Thus, Mr. Campbell\u2019s claim was denied because he ultimately failed to meet his burden of proof. In affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision, the BRB concluded that the ALJ appropriately weighed the evidence and that his decision was supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">Having reviewed the arguments and authorities cited in the parties\u2019 briefs, the record on appeal, and the extensive, comprehensive and well-reasoned decisions of both the ALJ and BRB,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we conclude that Mr. Campbell\u2019s petition must be</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b572-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
