Qadir, Texas prisoner # 743563, appeals the dismissal of his <em>pro se, in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. In his complaint, he raised claims of failure to protect, retaliation, deliberate indifference, and flawed disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">We note as an initial matter that Qadir does not argue that the district court erred in finding that his challenge to his disciplinary proceedings was barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Thus, we deem this issue to be abandoned. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">Qadir\u2019s claims that he was denied medical treatment and that the defendants failed to protect him from other inmates fail because he has not shown that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Qadir\u2019s claims of retaliation fail to set forth a chronology of events from which retaliation may plausibly be inferred. <em>See Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-16\">The district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous of Qadir\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint counts as one strike for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Qadir is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-17\">AFFIRMED; STRIKE WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b31-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
