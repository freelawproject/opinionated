He argues that the disability decision was not supported by substantial evidence and was not made under the proper legal standards, that the administrative law judge (ALJ) used improper criteria to assess his credibility, that the magistrate judge erred in its review of the administrative record, and that the ALJ was required to address whether he could maintain gainful work activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-26\">We hold that the disability determination was supported by substantial evidence and was made under the proper legal standards. <em>See Ripley v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 552, 555 (5th Cir.1995). In so holding, we determine that the record supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>the ALJ\u2019s rejection of portions of the treating physician\u2019s evaluation, the ALJ\u2019s determination of Lang\u2019s residual functional capacity, and the ALJ\u2019s characterization of Lang\u2019s allegations of disabling pain as not credible; and we conclude that the ALJ adequately incorporated all of Lang\u2019s disabilities in posing the hypothetical question to the vocational expert. <em>See Boyd v. Apfel, </em>239 F.3d 698, 707 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Spellman v. Shalala, </em>1 F.3d 357, 364-65 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Wren v. Sullivan, </em>925 F.2d 123, 128-29 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Lang has not established that any error committed by the magistrate judge constitutes reversible error. This court reviews the Commissioner\u2019s decision for propriety. <em>See Ripley, </em>67 F.3d at 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Finally, the evidence did not show that Lang\u2019s ability to maintain employment would be compromised despite his ability to perform employment as an initial matter, and there is no indication that the ALJ did not understand that an ability to maintain employment is inherent in the definition of residual functional capacity. <em>See Dunbar v. Barnhart, </em>330 F.3d 670, 672 (5th Cir.2003). Consequently, the ALJ was not required to make a specific finding with regard to Lang\u2019s ability to maintain employment. <em>See Dunbar, </em>330 F.3d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b601-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
