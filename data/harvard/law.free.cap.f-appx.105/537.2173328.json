Section 1915A \u201capplies regardless ... whether the plaintiff has paid a filing fee or is proceeding [IFP].\u201d <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 274 (5th Cir.1998). Dismissals under \u00a7 1915A are reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 275; <em>but see Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999) (a dismissal as frivolous under \u00a7 1915A(b) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-17\">Colgrove argues that prison officials have violated his rights under both the Due Process Clause and the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause by keeping him confined in administrative segregation for more than a decade. It is debatable whether the district court erred in concluding that such confinement did not present an \u201catypical and significant hardship ... in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,\u201d so as to constitute a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Wilkerson v. Stalder, </em>329 F.3d 431, 435-36 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 432, 157 L.Ed.2d 310 (2003); <em>Pichardo v. Kinker, </em>73 F.3d 612, 612 (5th Cir.1996); <em>see also Shoats v. Horn, </em>213 F.3d 140, 144 (3d Cir.2000). Nonetheless, Colgrove has not argued that the periodic review procedures he received were insufficient under the Due Process Clause, and he has thus failed to state a cognizable claim under the due-process framework set forth in <em>Sandin. </em>Colgrove also has not established that the confinement violated his Eighth Amendment rights because he has not shown that it deprived him of the \u201cminimal measure of life\u2019s necessities\u201d or that prison officials subjectively acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to his conditions of confinement. <em>See Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-20\">This court recently rejected a claim almost identical to Colgrove\u2019s contention that prison officials\u2019 demand for him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>provide a blood sample for a DNA database for felons violates his Fourth Amendment right to privacy. <em>See Velasquez v. Woods, </em>329 F.3d 420, 421 (5th Cir.2003). Colgrove also contends that officials\u2019 enforcement of the statute requiring such blood samples violates his rights under the Ex Post Facto Clause. Because this claim is raised for the first time on appeal, we will not address it. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Colgrove\u2019s conclusory allegations are insufficient to establish a \u201cchronology of events\u201d as required to support his claim that his prolonged confinement in administrative segregation is the product of retaliation by prison officials. <em>See Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 324-25 (5th Cir. 1999); Woods <em>v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In his appellate brief, Colgrove did not set forth the following claims that he raised in the district court: prison officials violated his due process rights at a disciplinary hearing concerning his refusal to provide a blood sample; officials retaliated against him, by denying him visitation privileges, after he filed grievances against a female correctional officer for forcing him to submit to a strip search; the cross-gender strip searches violated his Fourth Amendment rights; officials violated his due process rights by searching his cell and confiscating property without a hearing; officials were deliberately indifferent to his safety by failing to remedy slippery shower floors; and officials were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs by failing to provide adequate medical treatment. By failing to brief these claims, Colgrove has abandoned them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b562-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
