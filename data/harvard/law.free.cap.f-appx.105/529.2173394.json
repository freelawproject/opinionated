Mosley\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although counsel states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, he challenges Mosley\u2019s forty-six-month sentence on Count One and the consecutive sixty-month term of imprisonment on Count Two. Although informed of his right to do so, Mosley did not file a pro se supplemental brief. The Government declined to file a responsive brief. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have considered the brief and examined the entire record for meritorious issues. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-24\">It is well-settled that a sentence within a properly calculated sentencing guidelines range is not reviewable on appeal. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number><em>States v. Jones, </em>18 F.3d 1145, 1151 (4th Cir.1994) (holding \u00a7 3742(a) precludes a criminal defendant from seeking review of court\u2019s sentence anywhere within properly calculated sentencing range); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) (2000). Because Mosley\u2019s forty-six-month sentence on Count One falls within the properly calculated guidelines range of forty-six to fifty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment, and because his sixty-month consecutive sentence on Count Two is mandated by statute, neither is renewable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case, including the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 and sentencing transcripts, and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Mosley\u2019s sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court to withdraw from representation at that time. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Mosley.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
