California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Heinaman was informed of counsel\u2019s motion but has not responded to it. Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief shows that there are no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and this appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cm. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b653-40\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
