The district court found that each of the defendants was immune from suit and <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed the complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) <em>de novo. Jackson v. City of Beaumont Police Dep\u2019t, </em>958 F.2d 616, 618 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Pajooh argues that Judge Kirk was not entitled to absolute judicial immunity because his failure to order the issuance of the summonses was an administrative, rather than a judicial, act. We conclude that Judge Kirk\u2019s actions constituted normal judicial functions for which he is entitled to absolute immunity. <em>See Malina v. Gonzales, </em>994 F.2d 1121, 1124 (5th Cir. 1993) (describing factors for determining whether action was judicial in nature).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Pajooh\u2019s brief addresses Clerk Shemwell in a single sentence, and he has failed to even mention the other defendants. Although <em>pro se </em>briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even <em>pro se </em>litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Pajooh has waived his claims against these defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b627-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
