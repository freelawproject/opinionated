A judge of this court granted a certificate of appealability on the issues whether Finley is entitled to statutory tolling under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B), in light of <em>Egerton v. Cockrell, </em>334 F.3d 433 (5th Cir.2003), and/or to equitable tolling on the basis that he was \u201cprevented in some extraordinary way from asserting his rights.\u201d <em>See Coleman v. Johnson, </em>184 F.3d 398, 402 (5th Cir.1999). The overarching issue is what disposition this court should make in light of the fact that most of the evidence now relied on by the parties is being presented on appeal for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s findings of fact only for clear error. This includes deferring to the district court\u2019s resolution of conflicts requiring credibility determinations. <em>See Galvan v. Cockrell, </em>293 F.3d 760, 764 (5th Cir.2002). Because such conflicts are present, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand the cause. Upon remand, the parties can present their evidence to the district court, which should state appropriate findings and conclusions. <em>See Barrientes v. Johnson, </em>221 F.3d 741, 770 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
