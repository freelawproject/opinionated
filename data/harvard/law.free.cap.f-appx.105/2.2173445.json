In order to obtain a COA, Hayes must make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Hayes asserts that the district court erred in dismissing his federal petition as untimely. It cannot be ascertained from the current record whether the Mississippi Supreme Court considered Hayes\u2019s 2002 postconviction application as a challenge to a statutory rape conviction, as was alleged in the facts of the application, or as a challenge to the escape conviction, as was alleged on the cover page of the application. The Mississippi Supreme Court did dismiss as successive Hayes\u2019s 2003 application challenging his escape conviction. If the earlier application was in fact a challenge to the escape conviction, Hayes would be entitled to tolling for the time that application was pending, which would continue until the present date if the Mississippi Supreme Court never ruled on it. Consequently, COA is GRANTED on the following issues: considering the state court\u2019s ruling on Hayes\u2019s 2003 application, whether Hayes\u2019s state postconviction application filed in 2002 was interpreted by the state courts as a challenge to his escape conviction; whether Hayes was entitled to tolling for any time that such an application was pending; and whether Hayes\u2019s federal petition has been rendered timely by any such tolling. Because the record is insufficient to establish the propriety of the district court\u2019s ruling, the case is REMANDED to the district court so that that court may obtain copies of any necessary postconviction documents in either the escape or the statutory rape case.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Hayes\u2019s motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) on appeal is also GRANTED. Hayes has moved for appointment of counsel on appeal; this motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">COA GRANTED; JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED; IFP GRANTED; APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b26-14\"> Pursuant to 5th cir. r. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th cir. r. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
