We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-23\">Daniels filed suit against her employer, BASF Corporation (\u201cBASF\u201d), alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. BASF filed a motion for summary judgment to which Daniels\u2019s counsel failed to respond. Accordingly, the district court granted BASF\u2019s motion and dismissed the case on May 16, 2003.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On September 15, 2003, Daniels filed a pro se motion for reconsideration, which the district court properly treated as a Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment. <em>In re Stangel, </em>68 F.3d 857, 859 (5th Cir.1995) (treating motion filed more then ten days post-judgment as Rule 60(b) motion). The district court denied the motion, after again considering the merits of Daniels\u2019s claims, on November 17, 2003. Daniels timely filed her notice of appeal from the denial of her motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Daniels\u2019s brief to this court is devoid of legal argument and legal authority. In place of a legal argument, Daniels simply states, \u201cI do not understand this part; therefore, I do not have any information at this time.\u201d It is well-settled in this circuit that arguments not briefed on appeal are waived. <em>United States v. Thibodeaux, </em>211 F.3d 910, 912 (5th Cir.2000). Daniels\u2019s pro se status cannot excuse her complete failure to provide this court with a legal argument. <em>See Kersh v. Derozier, </em>851 F.2d 1509, 1512 (noting that self-representation does not excuse a party\u2019s noncompliance with the relevant procedural and substantive rules). (In any event, an independent review of the district court\u2019s denial of Daniels\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion reveals no reversible error.)</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b25-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b25-17\">. BASF notes that the district judge considered the merits of Daniels\u2019s claim when ruling on the unopposed motion for summary judgment, although'he was not required to do so. <em>See </em>S.D. Tex Loe. R. 7.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b25-25\">. Daniels\u2019s December 12, 2003 notice of appeal refers only to the court\u2019s denial of her motion for reconsideration. Even if Daniels intended to appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in BASF\u2019s favor, her notice of appeal was filed well after the thirty-day deadline. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
