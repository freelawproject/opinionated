Nicholson, Texas prisoner # 1126089, seeks leave to proceed <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>(IFP) in this appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. The district court denied Nicholson\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Nicholson challenges the district court\u2019s certification decision pursuant to <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Nicholson has not addressed the merits of the district court\u2019s certification decision. Accordingly, his request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Nicholson is cautioned that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). If Nicholson accrues three strikes, he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b625-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
