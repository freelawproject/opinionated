Dockeray, Texas prisoner # 563359, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice as time-barred of his civil rights complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Dockeray\u2019s brief is poorly drafted and almost illegible. He has failed to set forth argument identifying error in the district court\u2019s determinations and conclusions. Moreover, he has failed to provide a clear statement that the district court erred in its conclusion that Dockeray\u2019s complaint was barred by the statute of limitations. Although <em>pro se </em>briefs are liberally construed, even <em>pro se </em>litigants must brief arguments to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993). When an appellant fails to identify error in the district court\u2019s decision, it is as if the appellant had not appealed that judgment, and this court \u201cwill not raise and discuss legal issues that [Dockeray] has failed to assert.\u201d <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Dockeray\u2019s appeal has no arguable merit and is thus dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The district court in this proceeding determined that Dockeray\u2019s claims were frivolous. Additionally, Dockeray has had at least one other civil rights complaint dismissed as frivolous, and we dismissed as frivolous his appeal of that dismissal. <em>See Dockeray v. Black, </em>No. 04-50025, slip op. (5th Cir. June 7, 2004) (unpublished). Thus, Dockeray has accumulated four strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996). Dockeray is therefore BARRED from proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-14\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) SANCTIONS IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b634-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
