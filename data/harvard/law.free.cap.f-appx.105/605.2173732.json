Summers, Texas prisoner # 1130913, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights action for failure to state a claim for failing to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e. Summers argues that he filed his complaint in the district court without having exhausted the grievance procedures because of fear of what would happen to him, but he does not allege that he has been retaliated against for filing grievances or lawsuits. Summers stated in his complaint that he did not exhaust the grievance procedures at his institution. In his reply to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, he gave no explanation for his failure to exhaust and made no argument against the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation of dismissal on that basis. The district court did not err in dismissing Summers\u2019s action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 866 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-23\">Summers\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-24\">Summers is hereby informed that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), in addition to the strike for the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir. 1996) (\u201c[Dismissals as frivolous in the district courts or the court of appeals count [as strikes] for the purposes of [\u00a7 1915(g) ].\u201d). We caution Summers that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-25\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b629-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
