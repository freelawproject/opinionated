Worry Free asserted to the courts below that the air conditioning and heating system (\u201cthe system\u201d) sold to Ca-mareno and installed in her home was personalty, as opposed to a fixture, making its UCC-1 financing statement filed with Texas\u2019s Secretary of State sufficient to qualify Worry Free as a secured creditor. The district court found that the system was a fixture subject to Chapter 53 of the Texas Property Code and that Worry Free\u2019s UCC-1 filing was insufficient. Worry Free contends on appeal that the courts below clearly erred in finding the system to be a fixture and in applying Chapter 53 of Texas\u2019s Property Code. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-15\">We review the lower court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous when they are \u201cimplausible based upon the entirety of the record or the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review the lower court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-16\">The lower courts did not clearly err by concluding that the system was a fixture. Section 9.313 provides that \u201cgoods are \u2018fixtures\u2019 when they become so related to particular real estate that an interest in them arises under the real estate law of the state.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Texas Supreme Court explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-17\">[wjhether a chattel attached to permanent improvements has become a part thereof depends on the intention with which the fixture is annexed or put into position, and this intention is to be inferred from the nature of the article affixed, the relation and situation of the party making the annexation and the policy of the law in relation thereto, the structure and mode of the annexation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>and the purpose or use for which the annexation is made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">Given that the system was installed in Camareno\u2019s home, could not easily be removed, and that reasonable buyers and sellers of the system would expect it to be a permanent improvement to the house, we find no clear error in categorizing the system as a fixture.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">Given that the system was a fixture incorporated into Camareno\u2019s home, Worry Free was required to proceed under Chapter 53 of Texas\u2019s Property Code. The Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d) applies, except as otherwise provided, to \u201ca transaction (regardless of its form) which is intended to create a security interest in personal property or fixtures.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 9.104 describes which transactions are excluded from Article 9\u2019s reach, and the relevant exclusion here provides that the chapter does not apply \u201cto a lien given by statute or other rule of law for services or materials.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Chapter 53 of the Texas Property Code is one such statute; it governs mechanic\u2019s, contractor\u2019s, or material-men\u2019s liens, and provides that a person is entitled to a hen if he furnishes materials for construction or repair of a house, building or improvement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cMaterial\u201d is defined as \u201cthe material, machinery, fixtures, or tools incorporated into the work.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To claim a lien under Chapter 53, a person \u201cmust file an affidavit with the county clerk of the county in which the property is located,\u201d and the affidavit must contain specific information.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Worry Free did not follow these procedures and therefore cannot claim secured status. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-14\">Worry Free asserts that its failure to make a fixture filing is not fatal because it has a contractual security interest in the system, and Article 9 states that \u201cthis Chapter applies to security interests created by contract.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, Worry Free contends that its contractual security interest is valid despite its lack of any fixture filing under Chapter 53 or Article 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-15\">This argument ignores the mandate of Article 9 and Chapter 53. In addition to requiring fixture filings to describe the property and be filed in the County Clerk\u2019s office of the country where a mortgage of the property would be filed, Article 9 specifically excludes from its coverage liens \u201cgiven by statute or other rule of law for services or materials.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Here, the lower courts found the system to be a fixture incorporated into Camareno\u2019s home; as such, it falls within Chapter 53\u2019s coverage and Worry Free was required to follow its mandate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It did not do so, and now has no basis for secured creditor status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-16\">Finally, Worry Free asserts that the lower courts erred in finding that it held no constitutional lien. This argument was not properly presented to the bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>court, and we may not consider it on appeal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1144-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
