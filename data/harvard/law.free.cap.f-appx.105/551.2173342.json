He contends that there was no valid basis for the district court\u2019s upward departure from the recommended sentencing guideline range based on the facts of his particular case and that the degree of departure was excessive. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-23\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether there was a sufficient basis for the departure, while the degree of departure is reviewed for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-24\">The district court appears to have relied in part on Hunter\u2019s extensive prior arrest record, contrary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. However, any error was harmless. The district court properly relied on the similarity of Hunter\u2019s prior convictions to the present conviction, Hunter\u2019s failure to satisfy parole requirements, and the lack of a deterrent effect of prior lesser punishments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court\u2019s reliance on these valid and sufficient reasons convinces us that the court would have imposed the same sentence even without reliance on any invalid factors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-25\">We also conclude that the degree of departure, from a range of 33-41 months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>to 87 months, was not unreasonable or an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b575-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
