Ortiz was convicted of aggravated robbery and aggravated assault. He filed his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint against his court-appointed attorney and investigator in that criminal proceeding. Ortiz argues that his attorney and investigator conspired to deny him due process and deprive him of equal protection by failing to investigate his case. He contends that an investigation of the case would have shown that the charges against him were fabricated.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">Ortiz\u2019s allegations are ones alleging \u201charm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid.\u201d <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Under <em>Heck, </em>Ortiz\u2019s allegations are not actionable because he has not shown that his conviction has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by the executive, invalidated by other state means, or called into question by the issuance of a federal habeas writ. <em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-22\">Accordingly, Ortiz\u2019s appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of his complaint and appeal in this matter each count as a \u201cstrike\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996). Ortiz has accumulated at least two other \u201cstrikes.\u201d <em>See Ortiz v. Fernald, </em>No. 04-20186, 2004 WL 1372935 (5th Cir. June 18, 2004) (unpublished). Thus, Ortiz is BARRED from proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-23\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) SANCTIONS IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b631-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
