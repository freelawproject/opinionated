Allsbrook appeals the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint. As to Allsbrook\u2019s claim he received inadequate medical care, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying relief. As to Allsbrook\u2019s claim that the prison drug rehabilitation program was unconstitutional under the First Amendment because it required participants to recite a creed, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying relief. As to Allsbrook\u2019s assertion that the prison drug rehabilitation program was unconstitutional under the First Amendment because it required him to watch a video recommending participation in a Christian or religious fellowship group, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of this claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and remand to the district court for further review, noting the record reveals that on November 8, 2002, Allsbrook filed an unsuccessful grievance regarding this claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process. Allsbrook\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
