Nicholson, Texas prisoner # 1126089, seeks leave to proceed <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>(IFP) in this appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. The district court denied Nicholson\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Nicholson challenges the district court\u2019s certification decision pursuant to <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Nicholson has not addressed the merits of the district court\u2019s certification decision. Accordingly, his request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-21\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Nicholson has had at least one other civil rights complaint dismissed for failure to state a claim, and we dismissed as frivolous his appeal of that dismissal. <em>Nicholson v. McLennan County Comm\u2019rs Court, </em>No. 04-50356, slip op. (5th Cir. August 17, 2004) (unpublished). Nicholson has accumulated four strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 387. Nicholson is therefore BARRED from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-22\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) SANCTIONS IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b630-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
