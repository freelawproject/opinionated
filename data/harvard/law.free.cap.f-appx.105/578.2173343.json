Johnson and Pettiette argue that the district court erred by denying their motions to suppress evidence obtained during a search of their residence and that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support their convictions for one count of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense and the jury\u2019s verdict that the conspiracy involved more than 50 grams of methamphetamine. Pettiette further asserts that the district court erred by denying her motion to suppress evidence obtained during a traffic stop on September 18, 2001, and that the evidence that she possessed the shotgun was insufficient to support her convictions for possession of an unregistered firearm and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. For the first time on appeal, Johnson contends that the district court erred by attributing certain amounts of pseudoephedrine to him in making its drug quantity determination at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Pettiette\u2019s argument that the district court erred by denying her motion to suppress evidence seized during the traffic stop on September 18, 2001, is without merit. The district court correctly concluded that the search of the truck was legal because Johnson consented to the search. <em>See United States v. Crain, </em>33 F.3d 480, 484 (5th Cir.1994). Furthermore, the discovery of anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container in the truck provided probable cause for her arrest as Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.124 does not require that a field test of suspected anhydrous ammonia be conducted before a suspect is arrested and the presence of the anhydrous ammonia in the truck provided probable cause to arrest all of the occupants of the truck. <em>See Johnson v. Wright, </em>509 F.2d 828, 830 (5th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The affidavit used to procure the search warrant to search Johnson\u2019s and Pettiette\u2019s residence was not a \u201cbare bones\u201d affidavit because it contained factual allegations beyond mere conclusions that Johnson and Pettiette were involved in illegal activity. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>941 F.2d 1300, 1303 n. 1 (5th Cir. 1991). The affidavit provided probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant even with the challenged portion referring to Johnson\u2019s and Pettiette\u2019s prior offenses removed. <em>See United States v. Fooladi, </em>703 F.2d 180, 184 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the district court did not err by denying Johnson\u2019s and Pettiette\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the search of their residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The evidence at trial showed that a short-barreled shotgun was found in a bedroom in the residence near gas masks and starting fuel. The residence was small and contained many other materials used in the manufacture of methamphetamine. A law enforcement officer testified that Pettiette told him that the gun was used for the protection of inventory. Although the circumstances surrounding the testimony about Pettiette\u2019s statement was questionable, we must consider the statement when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence because the testimony about the statement was not factually impossible. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>74 F.3d 575, 578 (5th Cir.1996). Pettiette\u2019s statement, along with the other evidence presented at trial, was sufficient to show that the shotgun was possessed in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. <em>See United States v. Ceballos-Torres, </em>218 F.3d 409, 414-15 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">As Pettiette lived at the residence where the shotgun was found and told a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>law enforcement officer that it was used to protect inventory, the evidence gave rise to a plausible inference that she had knowledge of, and access to, the shotgun. <em>See United States v. Mergerson, </em>4 F.3d 337, 349 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to show that Pettiette constructively possessed the shotgun and to support her convictions for possession of an unregistered firearm and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The evidence at trial showed that Johnson and Pettiette could have realistically manufactured 48.4 grams of methamphetamine from the pseudoephedrine seized from them. The evidence also showed that receipts for the purchase of over 400 boxes of nasal decongestant were seized from Johnson and Pettiette during the traffic stop on September 18, 2001, and that Johnson and Pettiette could have reasonably manufactured 145 grams of methamphetamine from this nasal decongestant. Given that the receipts evidenced the purchase of a massive quantity of nasal decongestant and that other materials used in the manufacture of methamphetamine were seized during the traffic stop, the jury could reasonably infer that the receipts evidenced purchases of pseudoephediine that was used to manufacture methamphetamine. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>987 F.2d 251, 255-56 (5th Cir. 1993). Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict that the conspiracy involved more than 50 grams of methamphetamine. <em>See United States v. Gourley, </em>168 F.3d 165, 168-69 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Because Johnson did not challenge the district court\u2019s drug quantity determination below, we review this issue for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Ocana, </em>204 F.3d 585, 588-89 (5th Cir.2000). As sufficient evidence supported Johnson\u2019s conviction for the quantities of methamphetamine that could have been produced from the nasal decongestant evidenced in the receipts, the district court did not err by including these amounts in its drug quantity determination. <em>See United States v. Alarcon, </em>261 F.3d 416, 423 n. 3 (5th Cir.2001). The district court\u2019s determination of this issue in regards to Pettiette\u2019s sentence does not affect the propriety of its determination of the issue in regards to Johnson\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Montes, </em>976 F.2d 235, 239 (5th Cir.1992). Therefore, the district court did not commit error, plain or otherwise, in making its drug quantity determination regarding Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Johnson\u2019s and Pettiette\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b603-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
