He was sentenced to consecutive terms of life imprisonment with thirty years to be served before parole eligibility for the murder and twenty years with ten years of parole ineligibility for the conspiracy. The aggregate sentence was life plus twenty years with forty years to be served before parole eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">On his appeal defendant, through counsel, raises seven contentions he claims require reversal. They include the failure \u201cto charge conspiracy to commit murder as a lesser-included offense to the murder\u201d; that \u201c[b]ecause the conspiracy clearly terminated prior to the five-year statute of limitations, a judgment of acquittal should have been entered on the conspiracy to commit racketeering count\u201d and that the murder conviction must also be reversed because of the related prejudice; a judgment of acquittal should have been entered on the conspiracy charge because \u201cthe only alleged conspiratorial act that took place within the five year statute of limitations\u201d was dismissed at the first trial; \u201cthe jury charge on the statute of limitations and termination of a conspiracy were legally incorrect\u201d and shifted the burden of proof; the trial judge committed reversible error by allowing testimony about Salvatore Lombardino\u2019s refusal to testify at the defendant\u2019s first trial; the charge on conspiracy was incorrect because \u201cit failed to require the jurors to reach a unanimous verdict on the alleged racketeering acts\u201d and the sentence on the conspiracy conviction is \u201cillegal because conspiracy to commit racketeering is a second degree crime.\u201d We affirm the convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The proofs at trial reflect that defendant was a member of the Colombo organized crime family. We need not detail the proofs concerning organized crime, the Colombo family or its involvement in racketeering.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Defendant\u2019s brother Rocco was the principal witness for the State. Together with Jimmy Randazzo and others, defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Rocco participated in the murder of Jimmy Angellino at Rocco\u2019s home in Kenilworth, New Jersey in 1988. Thereafter, the brothers and Lombardino<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were involved in the May 1993 execution of Randazzo in Tinton Falls, New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Defendant, Rocco and others were indicted by a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) for various crimes related to the Angellino murder, and Lombardino was indicted in the District of New Jersey with respect to the Randazzo murder. Rocco entered into a cooperation and plea agreement with the United States Attorney. In May 1994, Rocco pled guilty to a one count information including a RICO conspiracy involving the murders of Angellino and Randazzo. Lombardino entei\u2019ed into a negotiated plea including conspiracy to murder Randazzo, but the Government could reinstate the entire indictment if he ultimately testified for defendant in connection with the Randazzo matter. That term of the agreement was subsequently deleted. Defendant also entered a guilty plea to a racketeering conspiracy in 1995 in the EDNY.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">At defendant\u2019s state trial on the first indictment in 2002, Lombardino refused to testify, and invoked the Fifth Amendment outside the presence of the jury. That prosecution ended in a \u201chung jury.\u201d The State grand jury returned a superseding indictment. At the second trial, resulting in the judgment before us, the State introduced witnesses concerning Lombardino\u2019s gesturing and exchange with defendant at the first trial. Defendant\u2019s appeal is from the conviction at the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">The first indictment was returned against defendant on February 24, 2000. It charged defendant, as \u201ca made member or soldier of the Colombo Crime Family and New Jersey Colombo Crew,\u201d with first degree racketeering conspiracy in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>2C:41-2(d) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-2 (count one), and with the May 17, 1993 murder of James V. Randazzo in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3(a) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6 (count two). The conspiracy count alleged the following overt acts: (1) \u201cIn or about November 1988, in Kenilworth, New Jersey, the defendant ... with others whom he aided or agreed or attempted to aid in the planning and commission of the offense, shot and killed Vincent \u2018Jimmy\u2019 Angellino, a high ranking member of the Colombo Crime Family\u201d; (2) \u201cOn May 17, 1993, in Tinton Falls, New Jersey, the defendant ... with others, including co-conspirator Salvatore Lombardino, shot and killed James V. Randazzo, as he sat in his car, which was parked in a hotel parking lot\u201d; (3) \u201cOn or about January 20, 1994, in Union, New Jersey, co-conspirator Lombardino had a conversation concerning the murder of Randazzo, during which Lombardi-no suggested that he, [Rocco and defendant] should get together and discuss their false alibis ... to avoid prosecution for the murder of ... Randazzo\u201d; and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">4. On or about May 1, 1998 and on or about October 8, 1998, co-conspirator Salvatore Lombardino, in violation of a federal court order compelling his testimony and in contempt of court, refused to answer questions concerning the involvement of another person in the murder of .James V. Randazzo, in an attempt to conceal from law enforcement authorities the identity of defendant, RAY CAGNO, as a member of the Colombo Clime Family and as having been involved in the murder of James V. Randazzo.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">As a result of a hung jury, defendant\u2019s first trial ended in a mistrial on June 28, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">A two-count superseding indictment was returned on January 2, 2003. It again charged defendant with \u201cracketeering conspiracy-first degree\u201d and the murder of Randazzo. With respect to the racketeering conspiracy count, the superseding indictment charged the same first three overt acts as charged in the original indictment, deleted the original fourth overt act, and charged as overt acts four and five that on or about June 13, 2002 and June 18, 2002, respectively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">co-conspirator Salvatore Lombardino, during a prior proceeding in the matter of the <em>State of New Jersey v. Ray Cogno, </em>in violation of a Superior Court of the State of New Jersey, Law Division-Criminal court order compelling his testimony and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>contempt of the court, refused to answer questions concerning the murder of James V. Randazzo and communicated with, and gestured to the said RAY CAGNO in an effort to effectuate and perpetuate certain rules of the Colombo Crime Family and the New Jersey Colombo Crew, to conceal from law enforcement authorities the identity of the said RAY CAGNO as a member of the Colombo Crime Family and as having been involved in the murder of James V. Randazzo, and to provide reassurance to the said RAY CAGNO of the ongoing nature of the racketeering conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Defendant filed unsuccessful pretrial motions before both trials. Among them were the motion \u201cto dismiss the RICO conspiracy-count (Count One) based upon a failure to satisfy the statute of limitations because the charged overt acts are flawed\u201d and \u201cto amend the RICO conspiracy count (Count One) to a second degree offense rather than a first degree offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Through their loan-sharking and gambling activities, and extortion in the business of refuse disposal, the Colombo family had engaged in criminal activities that affected commerce within this State. For an associate to become a \u201cmade member\u201d of the family, he is observed for a lengthy time period, has to show extreme loyalty to the family and has to be sponsored by a captain. At the \u201cmaking\u201d ceremony, the candidate must take the oath of \u201cOmerta\u201d or silence. He swears \u201callegiance to the family that if [he] betrayed [his] friends in the family, [he] should burn in hell.\u201d Betrayal, which occurs when a \u201crat\u201d cooperates with law enforcement, is punishable by death. The killing of a \u201crat\u201d must be sanctioned by the boss. An \u201cunsanctioned\u201d killing may itself result in the murder of the perpetrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Defendant and his brother, Rocco, had been associated with La Cosa Nostra (LCN) since the late 1960s or early 1970s. Rocco was involved with \u201c[b]ookmaking, cigarette smuggling [and] murder.\u201d In 1977, Rocco and Randazzo committed a murder. Randazzo, a loan shark, asked Rocco to assist in killing a man who owed him money. Randazzo brought the man to Rocco\u2019s bar which was closed for the day. Rocco \u201chit [the man] in the head with a club\u201d; both Randazzo and Rocco then choked him. Ran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>dazzo put the body in the trunk of his car. Rocco did not know the victim\u2019s name or where Randazzo disposed of the body. Rocco was not questioned by the police about this murder and was unaware if Randazzo had been questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">In July 1987 Randazzo told Rocco that he and defendant were going to be \u201cmade.\u201d Randazzo, Roceo, defendant and Tony Scianna, an acting Colombo capo, drove to Queens, New York where the \u201cmaking\u201d ceremony took place. Randazzo was Roceo\u2019s sponsor. Their fingers were pricked with a needle and their blood was smeared on a cardboard image of a saint, which was ignited. Holding the burning saint, Rocco swore that if he broke the oath of silence (Omerta) he would \u201cburn in hell as [the] saint ... burn[ed] in [his] hand.\u201d He also promised that he would \u201cdo a piece of work\u201d (kill someone) if requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Rocco further testified that he and defendant participated in the murder of Angellino in November 1988. Rocco\u2019s home was selected as the site because it could be accessed through the garage without anybody being seen from the driveway. It was decided that Carmine Sessa and Billy Cutolo would do the shooting from the top of the steps because they were capos and Angellino, the intended victim, was an acting consigliere. Defendant, who was armed, was instructed to hide and be ready as a back-up to the shooters.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Randazzo brought Angellino to Roeco\u2019s house. Rocco, who had stashed his gun in the basement, opened the garage door for them. The lights went out and Roceo heard shots. When the lights went on, \u201cAngellino was in a corner on the bottom of the steps.\u201d Angellino\u2019s body was put into a body bag that Randazzo had brought, and was placed in the trunk of Randazzo\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">In 1991 or 1992, Roceo had new steps installed in the area where Angellino was killed. Defendant relayed a message to Rocco from Carmine Sessa that Rocco should have this work done to thwart any search for blood. In view of a developing internal struggle within the family, there was a fear that someone would \u201cturn\u201d with regard to the Angellino murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Randazzo was an acting captain of Sal Profaci\u2019s crew, to which defendant and Rocco were assigned in 1992. Beginning in 1980 Roeco began borrowing money from Randazzo. Rocco told Randazzo that he lent out the borrowed money. Over a fourteen-to fifteenyear period, Roeco repaid close to $400,000 against loans totaling $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">After Randazzo was incarcerated in 1992, Dominic Prosperi collected payments from Randazzo\u2019s debtors. Pursuant to a search warrant, in December 1992 the FBI recovered Randazzo\u2019s loanshark notebook from the residence of Joseph Prosperi, Dominie\u2019s father. Roeco was visiting Randazzo in jail when they learned that Randazzo\u2019s notebook had been seized by the FBI. Randazzo became upset and said he (Randazzo) was \u201cdead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">As a result of Randazzo\u2019s reaction, Roeco became concerned that Randazzo would \u201cturn\u201d and implicate him in the two murders described above. Rocco spoke about his concerns with Lombardi-no and with defendant, who also could have been implicated in the Angellino murder. All three were in favor of killing Randazzo, and spoke with that purpose in mind \u201cover the next couple of months.\u201d Rocco became more concerned when he learned that Randazzo was calling in his loans and selling his car, indicating that Randazzo \u201cwas getting ready to leave.\u201d Defendant and Lombardino shared Rocco\u2019s concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Rocco became increasingly worried when Randazzo showed him an April 13, 1993 newspaper article that reported that Camine Sessa was cooperating with the authorities. According to Rocco, Randazzo said he could understand why Sessa turned. Sal Profaei also expressed concerns about Randazzo.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">As noted above, under LCN\u2019s rules, the killing of a \u201cmade\u201d member must be sanctioned. However, Rocco, defendant, and Lombardino decided not to get approval for the Randazzo murder. At a meeting attended by Profaei, Rocco, defendant and Lombardino, Lombardino said \u201cwe ought to whack Jimmy Randazzo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>The plan to kill Randazzo took shape as Randazzo sought to meet with Profaci. Refusing, Profaci, said that Randazzo \u201chad too much heat [law enforcement] on him and he [Profaci] didn\u2019t trust him anymore.\u201d Rocco told Randazzo that he would \u201chave to wait awhile for the meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">After rejecting Bloomfield as a place for the murder, Rocco, defendant and Lombardino chose the shore area. At one time, defendant had operated a pizza restaurant and an equipment supply company in Long Branch, and he lived in Toms River.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">A hotel parking lot in Tinton Falls was the planned site of Randazzo\u2019s murder. On Monday May 17, 1993, Rocco met defendant and Lombardino at the parking lot. Rocco had refused Randazzo\u2019s earlier request to ride with him to the lot on the pretense that Rocco had an earlier meeting with Profaci. Upon meeting Lombardino and defendant, Rocco got in the rear seat of Lombardino\u2019s car and Lombardino drove to a nearby Holiday Inn with defendant in the front passenger seat. Rocco gave Lombardino the gun to use in the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">The trio met Randazzo at the Holiday Inn; that location was rejected as the murder site because it was too crowded. Defendant, who was designated as the shooter, was to ride with Randazzo in his car from the Holiday Inn to the other hotel where the killing was to take place. Rocco and Lombardino were to follow as \u201cback-up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">At the Holiday Inn, Lombardino parked his car behind Randazzo\u2019s. Rocco hid the gun as Randazzo approached. In response to Randazzo\u2019s question about what he was doing there, Rocco replied that Profaci was at the other hotel. Defendant told Randazzo that he would ride with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">After Randazzo and defendant got in the driver and passenger seats of Randazzo\u2019s car, they engaged in a \u201cstruggle.\u201d Lombardi-no and Rocco got out of Lombardino\u2019s car. Before Lombardino got to the driver\u2019s side door of Randazzo\u2019s ear, Rocco heard a shot. After trying to get a clean shot to avoid hitting defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Lombardino fired once into Randazzo\u2019s car through the driver\u2019s open door and fired a second shot in Rocco\u2019s direction. Rocco did not have his gun with him as it remained on the back floor of Lombardino\u2019s car. Aside from Lombardino\u2019s two shots, Rocco heard two or three others.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Rocco saw a man in the parking lot taking down a plate number, other men in an upstairs window of the hotel, and a woman crossing the lot who began to run when she heard the shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Lombardino reentered the driver\u2019s seat of his car and Rocco got in front. Staggering, defendant left Randazzo\u2019s ear and leaned against a wall. Upon Lombardino\u2019s urging, defendant got in the back seat of Lombardino\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The license plate number of Lombardino\u2019s vehicle was observed by bystanders, and Lombardino was identified from a photo array. Other observers described the assailants.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">After driving away from the parking lot, Rocco cleaned the guns of fingerprints and threw them out the car window onto a grassy area. Rocco did not remove his gun from the plastic bag before disposing of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">As Rocco recalled it, in response to Rocco\u2019s comment that he hoped Randazzo was dead, defendant replied, \u201che is I put another one in his head.\u201d Defendant also told Rocco that he had hurt his shoulder. Because defendant had blood on his clothes, the trio attempted to find a K-Mart to buy new clothes but the store was closed. Rocco was dropped off at the parking lot where he parked his car and departed. After Rocco got home, he went to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">In 1993 both Rocco and defendant habitually smoked non-filtered Pall Mall cigarettes. On the night of the murder, Rocco brought a different brand of cigarettes, explaining, \u201cPall Mall they would know ... I just brought a different brand to try to throw anything off the track.\u201d Defendant may have asked Rocco for a cigarette, but Rocco was not sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">A search warrant and search inventory from the Prosperi search were found on the front passenger floor of Randazzo\u2019s car. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>A .38-caliber discharged bullet was discovered in the parking lot next to Randazzo\u2019s car and two bullet fragments were taken from the passenger\u2019s side front floor of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">FBI Special Agent Butler had been involved in the investigation of Randazzo\u2019s loansharking operation and became involved in the investigation of his murder. Becoming aware that a car registered to Lombardino was suspected to have been connected to the murder, Butler suggested that local authorities attempt to locate Lombardino, defendant and Peter Campisi. A search of Lombardino\u2019s home produced a box of .38-caliber ammunition and an empty holster.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Telephone records indicated that Rocco received telephone calls from defendant\u2019s residence at 3:04 a.m. and 5:41 a.m. on May 18, 1993. On both occasions the caller was Rita Cagno, defendant\u2019s wife. Normally, Rocco had not received phone calls from Rita at 3:00 a.m. on other occasions. Records also showed a 5:15 a.m. three-minute call from Lombardino\u2019s residence to defendant\u2019s, and a 5:56 a.m. one-minute call from Roeco\u2019s residence to defendant\u2019s, during which time Rocco again spoke to Rita.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Records reflected five telephone calls between 5:13 p.m. and 6:59 p.m. on May 18, 1993, from Rocco\u2019s residence to defendant\u2019s, which Rocco agreed was not commonplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">A consent search of Randazzo\u2019s house recovered an April 13, 1993, <em>Daily News </em>article that reported the cooperation of Colombo LCN figure Carmine Sessa. Papers containing names of defendant, Rocco, and Lombardino along with their phone numbers were among the papers found at the Randazzo home.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Joseph Monahan of the State Police Intelligence Bureau, who had been advised of Randazzo\u2019s murder, responded to the Tinton Falls Police Department on the morning of May 18, 1993, to render assistance. Accompanied by Monmouth County investigator Peter Short, Monahan drove into Long Branch in an undercover ear. Monahan chose Long Branch because defendant had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>previously involved in the pizza parlor and restaurant supply business there.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">May 18, 1993 was a \u201craw\u201d and \u201covercast\u201d day, and it was drizzling. As he was driving, Monahan saw defendant walking in the opposite direction. He stopped the car and asked defendant if he wanted to go for a ride. Monahan said that he was investigating a homicide. In response to Monahan\u2019s question why defendant \u201cwas walking on such a rotten day,\u201d defendant replied that he had \u201cnothing to say.\u201d Defendant was dressed in a sweatshirt and jeans but was not wearing a raincoat or carrying an umbrella.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">John Tesauro, who in 1993 was a captain with the detective division of the Monmouth County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, briefly chatted with defendant on the afternoon of May 18, 1993, while defendant was at the Tinton Falls Police Department. Tesauro noted that defendant\u2019s \u201chair was mussed\u201d and \u201cdisheveled,\u201d that he was \u201cunshaven,\u201d \u201c[h]e had a shadow of a beard and his eyes were puffy and swollen as though he hadn\u2019t slept.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">A federal search warrant had been obtained to search defendant\u2019s person for physical trauma. The warrant was executed at the Tinton Falls police station in the presence of FBI Special Agent David Kelly. Defendant removed his clothing. Although there was no indication of any injury, Kelly noticed that defendant \u201chad some difficulty trying to get the sweatshirt over his head.\u201d Later that afternoon, Monahan drove defendant back to Toms River and dropped him off a block away from his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">A search of defendant\u2019s house on the afternoon of May 18,1993, resulted in the seizure of telephone records, a notebook, phone numbers, check ledgers, cassettes from the answering machine, a slip of paper bearing Randazzo\u2019s name and phone number and another piece of paper with a phone number, and the notation \u201cTutti ... beeper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Although defendant was not under arrest on May 20, 1993, the FBI obtained his fingerprints and photographs at that time. On that occasion, FBI Agent Butler spoke to defendant about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>FBI\u2019s pre-May 17, 1993, investigation into Randazzo\u2019s loan-sharking operation. After telling defendant that many people were interviewed, defendant asked if the FBI had spoken to Randazzo. When Butler said that he had not, defendant\u2019s \u201ceyes grew wide.\u201d According to Butler, \u201c[i]t appeared to be disbelief ... [defendant] was surprised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Rocco\u2019s home was also searched by the FBI on May 20, 1993. Tiles were taken from the area where Angellino was murdered and bullets were seized from a robe hanging in a clothes closet. During the search, defendant called Rocco from Newark Airport and said that he was going to Las Vegas where he had in-laws. Rocco told defendant about the in-progress search and nothing else was discussed. Defendant called Rocco on seven occasions from Las Vegas between May 21 and May 29, 1993. Rocco did not recall having received that many phone calls from defendant when he had been in Las Vegas on prior occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Three handguns and ammunition were recovered during the investigation. The first gun was recovered from a grassy area off Asbury Avenue in Ocean Township during the morning of May 20, 1993. This gun was an unloaded Smith &amp; Wesson .38-caliber revolver with a two-inch barrel.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">On the afternoon of May 20, 1993, a torn plastic Ziploc baggie containing a gun and four bullets was found along a fence on Asbury Avenue. Two other bullets were also located in the grassy area between the baggie and the roadway, and a plastic bag of bullets was found further down the road near a telephone pole. The gun was a fully loaded Smith &amp; Wesson .38-caliber revolver with a four-inch barrel.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">On the next day, a third gun was recovered from Hope Road in Tinton Falls. This weapon, a .38-caliber revolver with a two-inch barrel, \u201ccontained two discharged shell casings and three live rounds of ammunition.\u201d The two discharged casings meant that the gun had \u201cbeen fired at least two times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Also on May 21, 1993, Lombardino\u2019s abandoned car was found in an industrial area in Brooklyn, New York. Its bottom back seat and license plates were missing. The car was removed to the Tinton Falls Police Department for further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">On June 9, 1993, defendant visited Lombardino, who was then being held at the Burlington County jail. Defendant, who indicated that he was a \u201cfriend\u201d of Lombardino in the jail\u2019s visitor logbook, stayed for twenty-five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Line-ups were conducted on June 29, 1993. Defendant, Lombardino, Campisi and Gerry Giambanco were placed in the lineups which were observed by five witnesses. There was one identification of Lombardino but none of the others. An observer of the shooting, who was not present at the line-up, subsequently identified Lombardino from a photo array. Rocco was not included in the line-ups because the FBI did not then believe that he was at the murder scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Within four months of Randazzo\u2019s murder, Rocco decided to cooperate with law enforcement. On January 20, 1994, Rocco, fitted with a body wire, recorded his conversation with Lombardi-no at a diner. In response to Lombardino\u2019s question whether Rocco had spoken to defendant, Rocco replied that he would probably see defendant on Sunday at a graduation. Lombardino, telling Rocco that they and defendant would have to develop an alibi with respect to Randazzo\u2019s murder stated: \u201cWe\u2019ll sit down ... the three of us, and see how we\u2019re gonna handle this.\u201d To explain the presence of Randazzo\u2019s blood in Lombardino\u2019s car, Lombardino said that he would make up a false story that when he and Randazzo went out to lunch, Randazzo developed a bloody nose.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">A ballistics expert determined that a discharged bullet found outside the driver\u2019s door of Randazzo\u2019s car and another recovered by the Medical Examiner from Randazzo\u2019s chest, were fired from the first weapon retrieved by the police, to the exclusion of other guns. He also determined that the two empty cartridge cases found in the third gun retrieved were fired from the third gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Comparing blood stains on Randazzo\u2019s shirt to a swatch of material taken from the rear driver\u2019s side door of Lombardino\u2019s ear, Linda Harrison of the FBI concluded that the DNA profiles of both stains \u201cmatched.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Special Agent Jennifer Lindsey Smith of the FBI performed DNA tests upon the ten cigarette butts found in the rear of Lombardino\u2019s car. The first six were Salems, the next three were Ducados and the last was an unfiltered cigarette with no brand name. Two Salem butts and the unfiltered cigarette butts bore DNA consistent with that of defendant\u2019s DNA. Ninety-one percent of the Caucasian population, including Rocco and Lombardino, \u201cwould be excluded as the source of the saliva on those cigarette butts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">On November 9, 1993, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of New York charged defendant, Rocco, and two others, as \u201csoldiers in the Colombo Family,\u201d with the November 15, 1988 murder of Angellino, conspiracy to murder Angellino \u201ca member of the Colombo Family,\u201d and \u201cusing and carrying firearms.\u201d On February 1,1994, Lombardino was indicted for his participation in the Randazzo murder by a federal grand jury in the District of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">On March 18, 1994, Rocco entered into a \u201cplea and cooperation agreement\u201d with the United States Attorneys\u2019 Offices for the Eastern District of New York and for the District of New Jersey. The agreement reflected the acceptance by the government of a guilty plea from Rocco \u201cto a one count criminal information charging him with conspiring to conduct the affairs of the Colombo Crime Family through a pattern of racketeering activity which included three acts of conspiracy to commit murder.\u201d The agreement further provided for Rocco\u2019s cooperation with the government \u201cconcerning possible violations of the criminal laws, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>particularly (but not limited to) homicides and organized crime schemes to infiltrate legitimate business and subvert government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Notwithstanding the foregoing, the agreement also recited that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEE\">Rocco Cagno has expressed a strong unwillingness to testily against his brother, Aurelio \"Ray\u201d Cagno, even though he has identified Aurelio Cagno as having been a main participant in the Randazzo and Angellino murders. Recognizing this sensitivity, the Government agrees to make eveiy reasonable effort to obviate the necessity of having to call Rocco Cagno as a witness against his brother, as a defendant. This provision does not, however, create any right on behalf of Rocco Cagno. Therefore, it is understood that if a good faith effort to develop alternative legally sufficient evidence is unsuccessful and, therefore, it becomes necessary to call Rocco Cagno as a witness against his brother in order to prevent a failure of justice, Rocco Cagno will be required to provide truthful testimony about the involvement of Ray Cagno in the planning and commission of the Randazzo and Angellino murders with others, in accordance with the provisions of this agreement and as otherwise required by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">On May 5, 1994, Rocco entered a guilty plea in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey to a one-count information charging him with racketeering conspiracy. The racketeering acts included: (1) the murder in 1976 or 1977 of \u201can unknown white male identified as a \u2018loanshark customer\u2019 of Jimmy Randazzo\u201d; (2) conspiracy to commit the November 1988 murder of Angellino; and (3) conspiracy to commit the 1993 murder of Randazzo.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Lombardino\u2019s federal trial in 1994 resulted in a mistrial. During a second trial, on October 4, 1994, Lombardino entered into a \u201cplea agreement\u201d whereby the government agreed to accept a guilty plea from him to a three-count criminal information charging: (1) \u201ceonspir[acy] to murder in aid of racketeering activity\u201d; (2) \u201cusing and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence\u201d and (3) \u201caccessory after the fact ... (destruction or removal of property to prevent seizure).\u201d In return, the government promised that after Lombardino entered a guilty plea to the information and was sentenced, it would dismiss the pending indictment. However, there was no promise as to sentence, and the three terms could run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">An \u201cAmendment to the Plea Agreement\u201d also dated October 4, 1994, recited, in part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>It is further agreed and understood that Count Two of the Indictment, charging a violation of 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1959(a)(1) [conspiring to murder in aid of racketeering] can be reinstated in the event that Salvatore Lombardino should testify as a witness on behalf of Aurelio \u201cRay\u201d Cagno concerning the subject matter of this Information, namely the conspiracy and murder of James Randazzo.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">On February 1, 1995, Lombardino was sentenced to prison for consecutive sentences aggregating seventeen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">On November 27, 1995, defendant entered a guilty plea to racketeering conspiracy in the Eastern District of New York. During his allocution, defendant stated that he \u201cconspired with others,\u201d that he \u201cwas available to facilitate the unlawful act,\u201d and did so to maintain his \u201cposition in [anj association [with the Colombo Family].\u201d Defendant admitted conspiring to kill Angellino, but refused to name any co-conspirators and stated that he was \u201cnot privy to whatever activities some people may or may not have been involved in.\u201d He expressly said \u201cI am not naming the people in the indictment\u201d and \u201cnot allocating [sic] to anyone else\u2019s involvement.\u201d Defendant was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment on January 31, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">In the interim, on March 7, 1996, Rocco was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation. At the sentencing hearing, Rocco\u2019s cooperation in connection with the <em>Lombardino </em>case was lauded by FBI Special Agent Marehalonis. Marchalonis stated that Rocco\u2019s \u201ctestimony was responsible for the FBI solving the first mob hit [the Randazzo killing] ... in the history of the Newark office,\u201d and that law enforcement \u201cdefinitely need people like Mr. Cagno to come forward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">On May 1, 1998, Lombardino appeared before a New Jersey federal grand jury in connection with its investigation into Randazzo\u2019s death. At the outset of the proceedings, Mark Rufolo, the Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) who negotiated the prior Lombardino and Rocco Cagno pleas, told Lombardino that he had been granted immunity by a District Court Judge and that he was compelled to truthfully answer questions. Lombardino was further advised that if he failed to answer questions he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>be held in contempt and that if he answered falsely he could be charged with perjury or obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Lombardino acknowledged that he and Rocco were involved in Randazzo\u2019s murder but refused to implicate defendant. He said he did it \u201cbecause [he] feared for [his] life.\u201d Although Lombardi-no admitted that he was \u201ca member of the Colombo family of La Cosa Nostra,\u201d he testified that he was not \u201ctoo sure\u201d if Randazzo was a member and \u201crefused\u201d to testify about Sal Profaci\u2019s role in the Family. At several points Lombardino refused to answer questions about the Family and people in it, and \u201crefused to answer\u201d if defendant was involved in planning Randazzo\u2019s murder. In other words, Lombardino only implicated himself and Rocco Cagno, who had already entered a guilty plea pursuant to an agreement with federal authorities regarding Randazzo\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">On May 8, 1998, upon application of the government, Federal District Judge Nicholas Politan held Lombardino in contempt for \u201chaving refused to fully comply with the order given to him by the Grand Jury to testify and answer all questions.\u201d Nevertheless, at an October 8, 1998 deposition conducted by the Unites States Attorney at the facility where Lombardino was incarcerated, Lombardino continued his refusal to implicate defendant. He repeatedly \u201crefused to answer\u201d the questions asked.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">On December 4, 1998, Rocco appeared before a federal grand jury in New Jersey. He acknowledged his testimony at Lombardino\u2019s trial, during which Rocco testified about his own involvement and the involvement of Lombardino in \u201cthe Colombo family of La Cosa Nostra\u201d and in Randazzo\u2019s murder. He had refused to implicate his brother at the time, but had now changed his position and was \u201cwilling to testify in a case brought against Ray Cagno.\u201d In a December 28, 1998 letter, Rufolo wrote to EDNY Judge Allyne Ross that Rocco reversed his previous position of refusing to testify against defendant, and that \u201cNew Jersey intended] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>proceed\u201d with a state or federal prosecution against defendant because they could proceed with proofs independent of his plea in the EDNY.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">At defendant\u2019s first State trial, Rufolo, who had been designated a Special Deputy Attorney General to try the case, indicated that he intended to call Lombardino as a witness. Out of the presence of the jury, Lombardino relied upon his Fifth Amendment privilege in response to Rufolo\u2019s questions. Rufolo then served Lombardino with a petition and a proposed order to compel testimony. On June 13, 2002, after the judge granted Lombardino immunity, she held him in contempt upon his failure to testify after being ordered to do so. Also out of the jury\u2019s presence, the contempt order was extended on June 18, 2002, upon Lombardino\u2019s continued refusal to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">FBI Special Agent Stephen Kodak was present at defendant\u2019s first criminal trial on June 13 and June 18, 2002. At the second trial, Kodak testified about Lombardino\u2019s refusal to testify at the first trial and the ensuing contempt proceedings. Specifically, Kodak testified that Lombardino refused to answer questions relating to Randazzo\u2019s murder at the Tinton Falls Holiday Inn on May 17, 1993, and his knowledge of the Colombo Crime Family. Kodak did not mention anything about Lombardino\u2019s reliance upon his Fifth Amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Kodak also testified that when Lombardino walked into the courtroom on June 13, 2002, he \u201csmiled\u201d at defendant and defendant \u201csmiled back.\u201d As Lombardino left the courtroom after refusing to testify and being held in contempt, he \u201cgave [defendant] a thumb\u2019s up sign and said hang in there kid.\u201d According to Kodak, defendant \u201csmiled back.\u201d When Lombardino left the courtroom on June 18, 2002, he gave defendant another \u201cthumbs up\u201d sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">Monmouth County Sheriffs Officer Benjamin Rivera-Estrada was present at defendant\u2019s first trial on June 18, 2002. He also testified that Lombardino refused to answer questions. According to Rivera-Estrada, as Lombardino exited \u201che looked over at Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Cagno, gave him kind of a small smile, wink and head nod with a thumbs up sign,\u201d and said \u201ckeep your head up, kid. Keep it up, kid or words to that effect.\u201d According to Rivera-Estrada, defendant \u201c[s]miled and just nodded his head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Defendant argues that the judge \u201ccommitted reversible error in refusing to charge conspiracy to commit murder as a lesser-included offense of murder.\u201d In response to defense counsel\u2019s request for such a charge the judge stated that she determined that \u201c[conspiracy to commit murder is not a lesser included charge.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">A conspiracy to commit an offense may be a lesser included offense to be presented to the jury if the evidence so warrants. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8(d). However, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8(e) provides that \u201c[t]he court shall not charge the jury with respect to an included offense unless there is a rational basis for a verdict convicting the defendant of the included offense.\u201d Therefore, in order to justify an instruction on a lesser included offense, including conspiracy, \u201ca rational basis [must exist] in the evidence for a jury to acquit the defendant of the charged offense before the court may instruct the jury on an uncharged offense.\u201d <em>State v. Brent, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>107, 113-14, 644 A.2d 583 (1994). <em>See also State v. Cassady, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>165, 178, 966 A.2d 473 (2009); <em>State v. Savage, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>374, 397-98, 799 A.2d 477 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Defendant contends that \u201c[w]hile the jury might have accepted Rocco\u2019s testimony about the conspiracy, it had every reason to doubt whether defendant was actually present at the shooting\u201d of Randazzo. In support, defendant contends there is no physical evidence connecting him with the crime, and three of the four eyewitnesses gave descriptions that did not match defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>dant\u2019s. However, as the Supreme Court stated in <em>State v. Bridges, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>447, 468, 628 A.2d 270 (1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">LA] conspirator can be held liable for the acts of others that constitute a reasonably foreseeable risk arising out of the criminal conduct undertaken to effectuate the conspiracy, and occurring as the necessary or natural consequences of the conspiracy. The substantive crime must be reasonably and closely connected to the conspiracy even though those crimes may not have been within the actual contemplation of the conspirators or within the scope of the conspiracy as originally planned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Thus, \u201c \u2018[cjonspirators are treated as accomplices under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6, and hence are guilty of the same substantive offense as the principal.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Taccetta, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>227, 243, 693 A.2d 1229 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>188, 704 A.2d 18 (1997) (quoting <em>State v. Curry, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>1, 9, 532 A.2d 721 (1987)). <em>See also State v. Stein, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>369, 389, 360 A.2d 347 (1976) (although he was not present at the crime scene, defendant was guilty of an armed robbery which \u201cwas within the scope of the conspiracy to steal currency from the Gordon home\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Here, we conclude that the trial judge properly declined to charge conspiracy to murder as a lesser included offense to murder \u201cbecause, in the circumstances presented, there was no rational basis\u201d for the charge. <em>Cassady, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 169, 966 A.2d 473. Even if the jury believed that defendant was not an active participant at the scene, but found him to be a co-conspirator in the murder, defendant would have been guilty of the substantive murder offense because the clear object of the conspiracy to kill Randazzo was accomplished. Thus, there was no rational basis on which to acquit defendant of the murder charge and to convict him only of a conspiracy on that count. <em>See Brent, supra, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>at 113-14, 644 A.2d 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">In addition, Rocco\u2019s testimony was essential to both factual determinations that defendant conspired to kill Randazzo and that he actively participated in the murder. The jury had no rational basis to credit Rocco\u2019s testimony in one respect, but not the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Defendant contends that a judgment of acquittal should have been entered on the conspiracy to commit racketeering count at the trial because there was no proof the conspiracy continued within the five-year statute of limitations. Defendant argues that the State did not prove at the first trial that he or anyone else conspired to assist the Colombo Family in any criminal act after January 20,1994, the date of Roceo\u2019s taped meeting with Lombardino at the diner when Lombardino suggested that defendant, Rocco and he develop an alibi for the Randazzo murder. Defendant also argues the proofs within five years of the statute of limitations, specifically Lombardino\u2019s conduct at the first trial, were inadmissible at the second. Defendant adds that the State in the first indictment \u201csought to avoid the statute of limitations by citing Salvatore Lombardino\u2019s refusal to answer \u2018certain questions concerning the involvement of another person\u2019 in 1998 as an overt act.\u201d Defendant further notes that since \u201c[t]he judge later ruled that that refusal to testify was not done in furtherance of the conspiracy, ... the statute of limitations would have expired in early 1999,\u201d five years after the January 1994 meeting and before the first indictment was returned in February 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Defendant also asserts that, because the 2003 superseding indictment did not allege that the co-conspirators had done anything to further the conspiracy from January 1994 to June 2002, the State improperly circumvented the statute of limitations by alleging in the superseding indictment that the conspiracy continued as evidenced by Lombardino\u2019s refusal to testify at defendant\u2019s first trial and his gestures to defendant while in the courtroom. The State counters that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">Defendant overlooks the ongoing nature of this racketeering conspiracy whereby concealment of its criminal activities from law enforcement was alleged and proven [Lombardino\u2019s silence and \u201cencouragement\u201d at defendant\u2019s first state criminal trial] as a major objective of the conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Prior to his first trial, defendant moved to dismiss the original conspiracy indictment on statute of limitations grounds. Defendant maintained that the State had not alleged any overt acts advancing the conspiracy during the relevant time period. He asserted that the overt act alleging Lombardino\u2019s May 1, 1998, refusal \u201cto answer certain questions\u201d before the federal grand jury and Lombardino\u2019s subsequent refusal to answer these questions in a deposition conducted by AUSA Rufolo, were not overt acts and must be excluded. As a result, defendant asserted that the racketeering conspiracy count had to be dismissed on statute of limitations grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The trial judge denied the motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">Although the conspiracy statute does not require proof of an overt act, the Statute of Limitations will bar an action for RICO conspiracy against an individual unless he or she continues as a co-conspirator and another conspirator acted within the five year period. [Citation omitted].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">Because the Court found Count One of the Indictment is suppoi\u2019ted even without the alleged ovei\u2019t acts of 1998, the question of whether those overt acts must be eliminated from the indictment need not be resolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">Count One of the Indictment ... charges a RICO conspiracy not a murder conspiracy. It alleges that the Defendant, and other\u2019s, from about the mid 1980\u2019s, up thi\u2019ough October, 1998, conducted the affairs of a secret [organization] through a pattern of racketeering activity consisting of various criminal acts, including illegal gambling, extoi'tion and murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">The pi\u2019osecution of this charge was commenced in 2000, well within the five year statutory period which commenced after the crime was committed, which in this ease was not until acts of concealment that were central [to] the charged RICO conspiracy were committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">As we will discuss, this ruling was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">After the mistrial and prior to his second trial, defendant again moved to dismiss the superseding indictment on statute of limitations grounds. Defendant contended, among other things, that the State manufactured Lombardino\u2019s contemptuous conduct during the first trial by requiring him to testify knowing that he would not. As also noted above, this conduct at the 2002 trial provided the basis for overt acts four and five of the superseding indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>In declining to dismiss the conspiracy count of the superseding indictment the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">Now in this case the Federal plea agreement originally restricted Mr. Lombardi-no from testifying on the defendant\u2019s behalf. Nonetheless, he was released from this condition. And clearly he\u2019s not prohibited from offering truthful testimony after his release from the Federal plea agreement, which was nearly one year before the defendant\u2019s first trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">So the contention that the State manufactured those overt acts by placing Lombardino in a catch-22 position is invalid. Mr. Lombardino had already been sentem .d for his participation in the crimes. He was granted immunity for any statements made during [sic] truthful testimony in the defendant\u2019s trial. And he was formally released from the no-testimony requirement in his plea agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">But nevertheless, he voluntarily chose not to answer questions regarding the defendant\u2019s role in the Randazzo murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">... I find that the State has not engaged in misconduct that would require a dismissal of the [superseding] indictment____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">More specifically regarding the statute of limitations, the judge added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">You don\u2019t need overt acts in a conspiracy----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">Now in <em>[Grunewald v. United States, </em>353 <em>U.S. </em>391, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>963, 1 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>931 (1957)], ... the Supreme Court said, \u201cThere is a distinction between acts of concealment done in furtherance of the main criminal objects of the conspiracy, and acts of concealment done after the central objectives have been obtained for the purpose only of covering up after the crime.

The defendant asserts that the Col[o]mbo crime family has been defunct for a period outside the five year statute of limitations. And in other words that the defendant alleges the contempt was merely to conceal the completed crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-14\">Now the issue of whether Lombardino\u2019s contempt was done in furtherance of the main criminal objectives of the conspiracy or done for the purpose only of covering-up after the crime, <em>is one of fact fon- the jury to decide.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-15\">(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-16\">In denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s ease at the second trial, the judge stated the following with respect to the statute of limitations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>I do not believe that ... the statute of limitations is an issue for a jury. Nevertheless, I think that the State has proven a prima facie case when it comes to conspiracy. They have shown acts four and five. Now, whether or not the jury wants to believe acts four and five, whether they even happened is number one. Or if they did happen, if they mean anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">But there was testimony about this wink, this nod, this, hang in there, kid. There was also testimony by Mr. [Newsome] that there is this what we call omerta. This belief that there\u2019s a secrecy. There is some kind of blood oath that people involved in this conspiracy subscribe to.

A reasonable jury could certainly conclude that when Yannotti agreed to participate in the affairs of the Gambino Family, he was by no means limiting that participation to his own loansharking. Instead, it could have found that Yannotti had agreed that he, and others, would engage in a jointly undertaken pattern of racketeering activities reaching all of the predicates established by the government. Thus, the fact that the government did not prove Yannotti\u2019s specific knowledge of or participation in each predicate act conducted by other members of the Gambino Family does not undermine the sufficiency of the evidence establishing his conviction as to the charged RICO conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">\n<em>[Ibid,]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">As to the statute of limitations, the court further held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">Although a \u201csubstantive RICO charge is barred by limitations as to any defendant unless <em>that defendant </em>committed a predicate act within the five-year limitations period,\u201d a RICO conspiracy \u201cis complete, thus commencing the running of the five-year statute of limitations, only when the purposes of the conspiracy have either been accomplished or abandoned.\u201d <em>United States v.

For every conspiracy is by its very nature secret; a case can hardly be supposed where men concert together for crime and advertise their purpose to the world. And again, every conspiracy will inevitably be followed by actions taken to cover the conspirators\u2019 traces.

Sparano, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>411, 423, 592 A.2d 608 (App.Div.1991). Based thereon, we agree with the State that the jury could have found defendant guilty of conspiracy at the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Lombardino\u2019s contemptuous silence in the face of granted immunity at defendant\u2019s trial in June 2002, together with his words and gestures of encouragement to defendant, could properly have been considered acts of concealment in furtherance of the overall Colombo conspiracy to which defendant, Lombardino and Roeco pledged their lives.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Silence is the hallmark of La Cosa Nostra\u2019s operations, as developed in the evidence, and a jury could find that Lombardino\u2019s silence furthered the conspiracy through at least June 2002. As noted in <em>United States v. Gigante, </em>925 <em>F.Supp. </em>967, 970 (E.D.N.Y.1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">Induction as a Member of a Family is coveted [by participants]. It is [considered by participants] an honor as well as a harbinger of large increases in income. But admission entails responsibilities. It requires, among other things, taking an oath of omerta, that is, an oath to remain silent to the outside world about the criminal affairs of the Family, never to betray anyone in the crime Family or in organized crime, and never to reveal to law enforcement personnel anything that might incriminate anyone in organized crime. The penalty for violation of this oath is death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">In the organized crime setting, therefore, respect for the pledge of silence can be seen as furthering the conspiracy, not merely as an endeavor to conceal or cover-up a prior conspiracy. Recent cases support the proposition that the refusal to testify, when there is no longer a Fifth Amendment privilege to refuse, and a signal such as a \u201cthumbs ups\u201d or similar gesture can be understood, and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>admissible, as evidencing an on-going conspiracy. <em>See State v.

NLRB, </em>490 F.3d 957, 964 (D.C.Cir.2007) (gesture could be understood to \u201cencourage support for the union\u201d). Moreover, and perhaps more important, \u201cwhere a conspiracy contemplates a continuity of purpose and a continued performance of acts, it is presumed to exist until there has been an affirmative showing that it has terminated.\u201d <em>United States v. Coia, </em>719 F.2d 1120, 1125 (11th Cir.1983) (quoting <em>United States v.

Hence, he asserts the indictments were time-barred on that basis. The State responds that \u201c[bjecause defendant failed to present any evidence that he withdrew from this conspiracy, the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>limitations never began to run on the racketeering conspiracy count.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Defendant argues that his 1995 guilty plea to federal racketeering charges arising out of the murder of Angellino signaled his abandonment of the conspiracy. However, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-2(f)(3) provides for the termination of an individual\u2019s participation in a conspiracy \u201conly if and when he advises those with whom he conspired of his abandonment or he informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his participation therein.\u201d \u201cMere cessation of activity in furtherance of an illegal conspiracy does not necessarily constitute withdrawal. The defendant must present evidence of some affirmative act of withdrawal on his part, typically either a full confession to the authorities or communication to his co-conspirators that he has abandoned the enterprise and its goals.\u201d <em>United States v. Steele, </em>685 F.2d 793, 803-04 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>908, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>213, 74 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>170 (1982); <em>United States v.

His plea did not cover the Randazzo murder, a significant aspect of the racketeering conspiracy alleged in the superseding indictment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, defendant during his plea allocution refused to name other conspirators to the Angellino murder. He acknowledged his acts as a member of the Colombo crime family, but added he was \u201cnot privy to whatever activities some people may or may not have been involved in.\u201d Therefore, it cannot be said that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>made a \u201cfull disclosure\u201d to authorities to constitute his abandonment of the conspiracy in 1995 within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:5-2(0(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Since the conspiracy lasted at least through June 2002 when Lombardino refused to testify at defendant\u2019s first trial, and there was an insufficient showing of abandonment by defendant, the racketeering conspiracy charge contained in the January 2, 2003, superseding indictment was not subject to dismissal on statute of limitations grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The second trial, of course, would not have been reached if there was no proof at the first trial of a conspiracy within the limitations period of the first indictment, and jeopardy precluded a retrial. However, we conclude, as did the trial judge, that the presumption of a continuing conspiracy warranted denial of the judgment of acquittal at the conclusion of the first trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The nature of the Colombo enterprise and the presumption of a continuing conspiracy would permit the trial judge to hold that the racketeering conspiracy had not terminated. <em>See Yannotti, supra, </em>541 <em>F.</em>3d at 121. <em>See also United States v. Persico, </em>832 <em>F.</em>2d 705, 712-14 (2d Cir.1987) (sufficient evidence of continued participation in family enterprise despite defendants\u2019 guilty pleas; statute of limitations for RICO conspiracy does \u201cnot begin to run until the accomplishment or abandonment of the objectives of the conspiracy\u201d; conspiracy, unlike substantive RICO acts, does not require proof of predicate act within five years of indictment). We, therefore, examine the issues before us only in the context of the second trial which resulted in defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">The State acknowledges, \u201c \u2018[wjhether acts can be construed as committed in furtherance of the conspiracy or only for purposes of concealment depends on the objectives of the conspiracy\u2019 which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>a question of fact for a jury,\u201d quoting <em>Unites States v. Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>741 <em>F.Supp. </em>334, 343 (D.Conn.1990); <em>see also Cannistraro, supra, </em>800 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 78. The issue then becomes whether the jury was sufficiently advised that it had to find that the gesture and silence constituted an act in furtherance of the conspiracy, or alternatively, that the conspiracy continued within the five year period in some other way. After all, Lombardino\u2019s conduct was the only acts alleged or developed as occurring within the five-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Defendant contends that the jury charge on the statute of limitations and other issues was erroneous and warrants reversal. Specifically, defendant raises four arguments in support of his attack on the racketeering conspiracy charge: (1) the \u201ccharge misstated the law relating to the statute of limitations and allowed the jury to convict based on acts [that] occurred after the statute ... had expired\u201d; (2) the charge \u201cwas legally incorrect in stating that a conspiracy could \u2018only\u2019 be terminated when it was \u2018abandoned\u2019 by defendant\u201d; (3) the statute of limitations charge violated defendant\u2019s due process rights because it shifted the burden of proof to him; and (4) the judge erred \u201cin refusing to allow the jury to decide whether Lombardino\u2019s refusal to testify was in support of the main objectives of the conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The judge initially charged the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">In order to find the defendant guilty of Count One, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the racketeering conspiracy did not terminate prior to January 2,1998, which is five years prior to the date of the indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">In other words, proof beyond a reasonable doubt of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy or some other evidence of the vitality of the conspiracy after January 2nd must be found. And the State has alleged certain overt acts and those overt acts were ... the Angellino murder in 1988; the 1993 murder of James Randazzo; the meeting in January 1994 between Rocco Cagno and Lombardino where they discussed the plan to form their alibis; <em>the June 13, 2002 couit proceeding whereby Mr. Lombardino refused to testify and that June 18, \u2018[02] court proceeding where Mr. Lombardino refused to testify. </em>So those are the overt acts that the State alleges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">Again, in other words, beyond a reasonable doubt of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy or <em>some evidence of the vitality of the conspiracy after June 2, 1998 [sic January] must be found.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>In this regard, I instruct you that the conspiracy is a continuing course of conduct [that] will only terminate when the agreement to conduct the affairs of the racketeering enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activities is abandoned by the defendant and by those . . with whom he conspired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">[An] individual abandons the agreement by advising those with whom he conspired of his abandonment or inform] s] law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and his participation in the conspiracy. However, in that ease, the conspiracy is terminated only as to that individual who abandons the conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">The State is not required to prove that an overt act occurred after January 2, 1998. The State however must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy continued after January Hi, [sic] 1998.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">During deliberations, the judge considered a note received from the jury on the previous day requesting: (1) a review of the elements necessary for racketeering conspiracy and, (2) \u201cthe significance of the June 1998 date with respect to count one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">After recharging the jury with respect to the elements of a conspiracy, the judge instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">As to question two, your question was, \u201cWhat is its significance of the June 1998 date with respect to count one\u201d. Well, it is not June, it is January 1998. So you have the wrong date there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">In order to find the defendant guilty of count one, you must also find beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy to commit racketeering did not terminate \u00a1mor to January, not June 2, 1998, which is five years prior to the date of the indictment. So there is no particular significance in the January 1998 date in the context of evidence that you heard other than it happens to be five years prior to the date that the indictment was returned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-11\">In other words, proof beyond a reasonable doubt of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy or some other evidence of the vitality or existence of a conspiracy after January 2nd 1998, must be found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">In response to a juror\u2019s request for a re-reading of the last sentence, the judge re-read the last two paragraphs just quoted, discussed the five alleged overt acts, and re-stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-13\">Now' in this regard, I instruct you that a conspiracy is a continuing course of conduct which only terminates when the agreement to conduct the affairs of the racketeering enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity is abandoned by the defendant and by those with whom he conspired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-14\">An individual abandons the agreement by advising those with whom he conspires of his abandonment or inform[s] law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and his participation in the conspiracy. However, in that case the conspiracy is terminated only as to that individual who abandons the conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number><em>The State is not required, to prove that an oveH act occurred after January </em>2, <em>1998. The State, however, must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy continued after January 2nd 1998.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">In this case the State, even though not required, has alleged four [sic five] overt acts to include acts that allegedly occurred in June 2002, that is, the two times that Mr. Lombardino would not testify at another proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that an act occurred in June 2002 and that it was in furtherance of the charged conspiracy, then that should be considered in your determination whether or not the conspiracy continued after January 2nd 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Noting that the jurors had raised their hands and expressed \u201csome puzzled looks,\u201d the judge again re-read what she had charged regarding the need for proof that the conspiracy continued beyond January 2, 1998. She emphasized there must be \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy or some other evidence of the vitality or existence of the conspiracy after January 2nd 1998 must be found.\u201d She recharged on the concept of \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d and abandonment, and ended by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">The State is not required to prove that an overt act occurred after January 2nd 1998. However, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy continued after January 2nd 1998.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">On the same day, the jury asked for a list of the overt acts to be considered in Count One. The jury further asked that if Lombardi-no\u2019s two acts of refusing to testify \u201cin this courtroom, are among those listed[,] ... [m]ust these acts be considered in total; i.e. can the failure to testify be considered without the alleged communication between Mr. Lombardino and the defendant?\u201d After again reading the five overt acts contained in the superseding indictment, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-11\">As I told you earlier, the State is not required to prove an overt act in an offense that alleges conspiracy to commit racketeering; however, the State must prove the vitality of the existence of the conspiracy to commit racketeering through some other evidence. Therefore, you may consider the alleged overt acts as charged or any other evidence including any evidence presented in the context of the alleged overt act that you believe prove the vitality or existence of the conspiracy to you beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>The judge was correct. As previously noted, an overt act, as such, need not be proven and there is a presumption that the conspiracy continues. <em>See Coia, supra, </em>719 F.2d at 1124. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-2(d) (regarding the lack of need to prove an overt act with respect to a conspiracy to commit a first or second degree crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In <em>Persico, supra, </em>832 F.2d at 713, the Second Circuit agreed with the District Court\u2019s Judge\u2019s holding \u201cthat the statute of limitations for RICO conspiracy should not begin to run until the accomplishment or abandonment of the objectives of the conspiracy.\u201d The court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">In order to convict a defendant of RICO conspiracy, only an agreement to commit two or more predicate acts, rather than the acts themselves, need be proven.

Thus, the RICO conspiracy statute is most closely analogous to other conspiracy statutes pursuant to which overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy need not be pleaded or proven. Under such statutes, for limitations purposes, the conspiracy may be deemed terminated when, in a broad sense, its objectives have either been accomplished or abandoned, not when its last overt act was committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">The statute of limitations applicable to RICO conspiracy provides that \u201cno person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any offense, not capital, unless the indictment is found ... within five years after such offense shall have been committed.\u201d 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 3282 (1982). The limitations period is measured from the point at which the crime is complete. Because the RICO conspiracy statute does not require proof of an overt act, we believe that the crime of RICO conspiracy is not complete until the purposes of the conspiracy either have been accomplished or abandoned____Although proof of a RICO conspiracy requires a demonstration that a defendant agreed to commit two or more predicate acts, rather than a simple showing that the defendant agreed to join the conspiracy, the agreement proscribed by section 1962(d) is conspiracy to participate in a charged enterprise\u2019s affairs, not conspiracy to commit predicate acts. We perceive no valid reason why the RICO conspiracy statute should be analyzed in a manner inconsistent with other conspiracy statutes not requiring proof of overt acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-11\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the statute of limitations for the RICO conspiracy charges at issue here did not begin to run at least until the filing of the indictment. As Judge Keenan noted, the government amply demonstrated that the conspiracy to conduct the affairs of the Colombo Family continued until, and well after, April 4,1985, the date the superseding indictment was filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-12\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(some citations and internal quotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-13\"><em>Persico </em>was followed by <em>Salerno, supra, </em>868 <em>F.2d </em>at 524. In that ease the defendant Anthony Indelieato was indicted on RICO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>conspiracy and substantive RICO charges on November 19, 1985. <em>Id. </em>at 534. Evidence adduced at trial established that the \u201cCommission\u201d was \u201cthe ultimate ruling body over the five La Cosa Nostra families in New York City and affiliated families in other cities,\u201d and its purpose was \u201cto regulate and facilitate the relationships between and among the several La Cosa Nostra families.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528. Since three of Indelicato\u2019s alleged racketeering acts occurred in 1979, more than five years before the indictment was returned, he contended that his conviction on both the RICO conspiracy and substantive counts were barred by the five-year statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 534. With respect to the RICO conspiracy count, the jury was charged that it must find \u201cthat the Commission enterprise continued to exist after November 19, 1980, and that Indelieato continued after that date to be a coconspirator or associate of that enterprise.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Holding that the jury was properly charged on the RICO conspiracy count, the Second Circuit noted:</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Subsequent to oral argument, this court decided in <em>United States v.

But where the crime of which defendant was convicted was of the first or second degree, the presumption of abandonment does not apply in the absence of proof of an overt act within the period of limitations. As we noted previously, \u201c[i]f an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to him only if and when he advises those with whom he conspired of his abandonment or he informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his participation therein.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-2(f)(3). <em>See also Final Report of the New Jersey Law Revision Commission, Commentary, </em>\u00a7 2C:5-2, at 143 (October 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The charge as a whole was consistent with the relevant case law which provides that a conspiracy offense is complete as to a particular defendant only when the object of the conspiracy has been accomplished or when that individual abandons the conspiracy. The jury was properly instructed that, while the State is not required to prove that an overt act was committed after January 2, 1998, the State had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the racketeering conspiracy continued to within five years of the indictment, and did not terminate prior to January 2, 1998, and that the conspiracy continued after that date. The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>was further charged that \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy or some other evidence of the vitality or existence of a conspiracy after January 2nd 1998, must be found.\u201d In effect, the judge told the jury that the State had the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the Colombo racketeering conspiracy continued beyond January 2, 1998, and that defendant remained a conspirator.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In addition, the judge properly charged the jury as to how a conspiracy could be abandoned by an individual eo-eonspirator. It is understandable that defendant did not want the jury informed about his federal racketeering conviction premised upon the Angellino murder as a basis for his argument that he abandoned the conspiracy. The jury did not learn that defendant pled guilty to a crime involving the Angellino murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Defendant argues that the statute of limitations chai\u2019ge violated his due process rights \u201cby shifting the burden of proof to him.\u201d He points to a small portion of the charge that states that \u201cconspiracy is a continuing course of conduct which will only terminate when the agreement to conduct the affairs of the racketeering enterprise ... is abandoned by the defendant and by those ... with whom he conspired.\u201d Defendant argues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABq\">[U]nder the instruction, once a conspiracy is proven, it is presumed to continue until <em>the defendant </em>proves abandonment. As noted, not only does the defendant bear the burden of demonstrating that <em>he </em>has abandoned the conspiracy prior to the effective date of he statute of limitations, he must prove that it was abandoned \u201cby those ... with whom he conspired.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">However, the charge must be read as a whole, and the jury was repeatedly told that the State had to \u201cprove beyond a reasonable doubt that the racketeering conspiracy did not terminate\u201d prior to January 2, 1998, or that it continued after that date. The jury was repeatedly told that defendant had no burden to prove anything. The jury was also repeatedly advised that the State had to prove five elements to sustain the conspiracy conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGH\">To summarize, the essential element that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to Count One are: (1) That an enterprise existed; (2) That the enterprise engaged in trade or commerce, or its activities affected trade or commerce. (3) The defendant was employed by or associated with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>enterprise; (4) The defendant agreed that he or one or more of the coconspirators would participate directly or indirectly in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise by agreeing that some member of the conspiracy would commit a pattern of racketeering activity, and (5) That the defendant acted purposely with knowledge of the unlawful objective of the conspiracy charged in the indictment and with an intent to further that objective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Defendant also argues that the judge erred by not charging the jury that it was their responsibility to decide whether Lombardi-no\u2019s silence at the first trial \u201cwas done in furtherance of the main criminal objectives of the conspiracy, or\u201d was merely an act of concealment done after the central objectives were attained. Defendant did not ask the judge to specifically charge the jury that they had to decide whether Lombardino\u2019s silence was in furtherance of the conspiracy or whether it amounted to an after-the-fact cover-up. However, defendant stressed at trial that the \u201covert act ... in furtherance of the conspiracy\u201d language should be charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In her instructions to the jury, the judge instructed that the overt acts embodied in the superseding indictment, including acts four and five that alleged Lombardino\u2019s refusal to testify and his communication with defendant at the first trial, must have been done</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">[I]n an effort to effectuate and perpetuate certain rules of the Colombo Crime Family and \u201cthe New Jersey Colombo Crew\u201d, to conceal from law enforcement authorities the identity of the said Ray Cagno as a member of the Colombo Crime Family and as having been involved in the murder of James V. Randazzo, and to provide reassurance to the said Ray Cagno of the on-going nature of the racketeering conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">As noted above, the jury was also charged that \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy or some other evidence of the vitality or existence of a conspiracy after January 2nd [1998], must be found,\u201d and that the State \u201cmust prove beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that the conspiracy continued after that date.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">We find no reversible error by the judge\u2019s failing to expressly charge that the jury must find that Lombardino\u2019s silence be in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>furtherance of the conspiracy \u201cas opposed to\u201d or \u201cas compared with\u201d a post-conspiracy cover-up. The charge as a whole clearly instructed that the jury had to find the conspiracy continued until within the five year limitation period.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">In so holding, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation and hearsay rule <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b)(5) were violated when the judge admitted testimony from an FBI agent and a sheriffs officer that Lombardino did not answer questions about the Randazzo murder at the first trial and that Lombardino was held in contempt, and when these witnesses were permitted to testify about Lombardino\u2019s words and gestures to defendant at the first trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Clearly, the proofs were introduced as evidence of a conspiracy and not for \u201cthe truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>801. <em>See State v.

Defendant, however, was not charged with, or convicted of, the substantive crime of racketeering, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-2, but with conspiracy to violate that section in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-2(d) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Given the nature of a racketeering conspiracy proscribed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-2(d) and its federal analog, 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1962(d), there was absolutely no need for the judge to specifically instruct the jury that they had to reach a unanimous verdict on the racketeering acts. In <em>Yannotti, </em>the Second Circuit stated that in <em>Persico, supra, </em>832 F.2d at 713, it emphasized that \u201cthe agreement proscribed by section 1962(d) is [a] conspiracy to participate in a charged enterprise\u2019s affairs, not [a] conspiracy to commit predicate acts.\u201d <em>Yannotti, supra, </em>541 F.3d at 121. Further expounding on this point, the <em>Yannotti </em>court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AII\">To establish a RICO conspiracy, the government must prove that a defendant agreed to participate in the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. However, in <em>Salinas v. United States, </em>522 <em>U.S. </em>52, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997), the Supreme Court made clear that to establish this pattern, the government need not prove that the defendant himself agreed that he would commit two or more predicate acts. <em>See id. </em>at 64, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>469 (noting that, although the RICO statute \u201cbroadened conspiracy coverage by omitting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>requirement of an overt act; it did not, at the same time, work the radical change of requiring the Government to prove [that] each conspirator agreed that he would be the one to commit two predicate acts\u201d). Indeed, Salinas held that to be found guilty of RICO conspiracy, a defendant need only know of, and agree to, the general criminal objective of a jointly undertaken scheme. <em>See id. </em>at 63, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>469; <em>see also United States v. Ciccone, </em>312 F.3d 535, 542 (2d Cir.2002) (stating that \u201ca conspirator charged with racketeering conspiracy need not commit or even agree to commit the predicate acts ... to be found guilty of the racketeering conspiracy, for it suffices that he adopt [ ] the goal of furthering or facilitating the criminal endeavor\u201d (internal citations and quotations marks omitted)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">It is well-settled that a conspirator need not be fully informed about his co-conspirators\u2019 specific criminal acts provided that he agreed to participate in the broader criminal conspiracy and the acts evincing participation were not outside of the scope of the illegal agreement. \u201cA conspiracy may exist even if a conspirator does not agree to commit or facilitate each and every part of the substantive offense. The partners in the criminal plan must agree to pursue the same criminal objective and may divide up the work, yet each is responsible for the acts of each other.\u201d <em>Salinas, </em>522 <em>U.S. </em>at 63-64, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>469 (internal citation omitted); <em>see also United States v.

Thus, there was no obligation upon the State to prove the actual commission of an act in violation of chapter 41, and a charge that the jury had to unanimously find the commission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>racketeering acts in violation of chapter 41 was unnecessary. <em>See also United States v. Gotti, </em>451 F.3d 133, 137 (2d Cir.2006) (requiring unanimity \u201cas to each of two predicate acts\u201d to sustain a substantive RICO violation, as compared with RICO conspiracy).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Here, the judge told the jury that the racketeering acts charged by the State were \u201c[cjonspiracy to commit murder, murder, criminal usury (loansharking), operating illegal gambling businesses, illegal lotteries, and possession and distribution of video gambling machines and devices.\u201d She also instructed that \u201c[ijnvolvement in at least two incidents of racketeering conduct must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to establish a pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d However, she further instructed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">In order for you to find the defendant guilty of the crime of conspiracy to commit racketeering, the State need not prove the defendant actually committed the crime of racketeering; rather, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, with the purpose of promoting and facilitating the commission of the crime of racketeering, agreed with at least one other person referred to in the indictment that one of them would commit the crime of racketeering or an attempt to or a solicitation to commit the crime of racketeering, or agreed to aid such other person or persons in planning or commission of the crime of racketeering.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The judge also instructed that, because \u201cthis is a criminal case, your verdict, whatever it may be, must be unanimous.

They were specifically told that the answer to that question must be unanimous.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">As defendant was charged with racketeering conspiracy, we hold the judge did not have to instruct the jury that it had to unanimously find the actual commission of racketeering acts or agree as to the commission of two such predicate acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">We agree with the trial judge that defendant was properly-sentenced as a first degree offender on the racketeering conspiracy. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-4(a), the general statute pertaining to grading of criminal attempt and conspiracy, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">a.

He alternatively argues that the judge \u201ccommitted reversible error by constructively amending the indictment\u201d to so provide when charging the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">The superseding indictment charges the existence of an \u201centerprise which was engaged in, and the activities of which affected trade and commerce\u201d taking place between the mid 1980\u2019s and June 2002 \u201cat the Borough of Kenilworth and at the Township of Union, both in the County of Union, at the Borough of Tinton Falls and at the Borough of Freehold, both in the County of Monmouth, elsewhere, and within the jurisdiction of this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">The superseding indictment also refers to defendant, Lombardi-no, Randazzo, and \u201cother persons\u201d as \u201cNew Jersey crew members of the Colombo Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra\u201d otherwise referred to as \u201cthe New Jersey Colombo Crew.\u201d As part of the pattern of racketeering activity, the superseding indictment charged the commission of murder and other crimes \u201cin violation of the laws of the State of New Jersey,\u201d and the overt acts were alleged to occur in Kenilworth, the place of Angellino\u2019s murder, Tinton Falls, the place of Randazzo\u2019s murder, and Union, the place where Lombardino and Rocco met and conversed in January 1994. The indictment sufficiently alleged impact on \u201ctrade and commerce\u201d in this state. <em>See State v. Wein, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>491, 497-500, 404 A.2d 302 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Next, defendant contends that the judge \u201cerred in admitting the January 20,1994 taped conversation between Lombardino and Rocco.\u201d He also contends that \u201cdue to the inflammatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>content of that tape\u201d his convictions should be reversed. Defendant argues that Lombardino\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were violated because Lombardino was represented by counsel at the time of the taping and that such was known by AUSA Rufolo. Defendant also claims standing as an \u201calleged coeonspirator with a \u2018participatory interest.\u2019 \u201d We reject these arguments. Defendant had no right to assert any right or privilege of the co-defendant or co-conspirator. <em>See State v. Baum, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>407, 416-20, 972 A.2d 1127 (2009) (following federal law and rejecting third party standing with respect to Fifth Amendment rights); <em>see also United States v. Sims, </em>845 <em>F.2d </em>1564, 1568 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>957, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>395, 102 L.Ed.2d 384 (1988), (a defendant has no standing to assert the Sixth Amendment rights of a co-conspirator). <em>Cf., State v. Clausell, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>298, 324, 580 A.2d 221 (1990) (standing to challenge to an out-of-court identification of a co-defendant).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Next, defendant contends that his federal plea agreement was breached after his racketeering conspiracy plea with respect to the Angellino murder because that murder was used \u201cby the very same prosecutor\u201d as a predicate act in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">As already noted, on November 27, 1995, defendant pled guilty to a racketeering conspiracy charge involving Angellino\u2019s murder in the Eastern District of New York. On April 22,1996, he moved to withdraw that plea. He was concerned that his New York conviction would be used as a predicate act for a federal RICO charge in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">In December 1996, a \u201csupplemental plea agreement\u201d was reached whereby defendant agreed to withdraw and not refile his motion to withdraw his Eastern District plea. Paragraph two of that supplemental agreement provided that the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey (\u201cNew Jersey\u201d) agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>[T]hat as it relates to the potential indictment of the defendant for his alleged involvement in the murder of James Randazzo or other criminal activity on or about May 17,1993, it will not introduce into evidence at trial or in the grand jury against the defendant in any manner, including but not limited to as an admission, as a prior bad act or as a RICO predicate act, the defendant\u2019s (a) guilty plea allocution to the above-captioned indictment, (b) conviction on that charge, and (c) statements to the Probation Department. However, New Jersey reserves the right to offer such evidence if, and only if, the defendant takes the stand and testifies in a manner that is inconsistent with his plea allocution to the above-captioned indictment. New Jersey agrees that it will not indict Cagno without first obtaining evidence that it does not presently have. Such additional evidence could include, but is not limited to, testimony from a person presently known to New Jersey who was reluctant or unwilling to testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The supplemental agreement\u2019s fifth paragraph specifically noted that the \u201cagreement is limited to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for New Jersey and the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York <em>and cannot bind other federal, state or local prosecuting authorities </em>\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The supplemental agreement, by its terms, is not binding upon the New Jersey State prosecution of defendant. While AUSA Rufolo acted on behalf of the State Attorney General\u2019s Office in this prosecution, it was a State prosecution. <em>See State v. Barone, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>599, 689 A.2d 132 (1997). <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-11 (no bar to prosecution). Moreover, defendant\u2019s guilty plea allocution to the Eastern District indictment, his conviction on that charge and statements to the federal probation department were not introduced during his State trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Finally, defendant contends that the prosecutor improperly vouched for Rocco at various times and referred to his \u201ctruthful testimony.\u201d Defendant also complains that the prosecutor made himself a witness by using the phrase \u201cI submit\u201d \u201cover eighty times during the course of his summation.\u201d It may very well be \u201cpoor practice for ... prosecutors to frequently use rhetorical statements punctuated with excessive use of the personal pronoun T Lbecause s]uch a practice runs the risk that the words that follow will convey the personal view of the prosecutor to the jurors.\u201d <em>United States v. Walker, </em>155 F.3d 180, 189 (3d Cir.1998). Nevertheless, as the Walker court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>The second part of the AUSA\u2019s remark during closing consists of the statement, \u201cI submit to you that they have no motivation to lie to you. I submit to you that you can determine, using your common sense and your judgment, you can determine the credibility of those two [witnesses]----\u201d The phrase \u201cI submit to you that,\u201d without more, does not constitute vouching. Submit means \u201cto commit to the discretion of another,\u201d or \u201cto yield to the will of another,\u201d or \u201cto present for determination; as an advocate submits a proposition for the approval of the court.\u201d BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 1278 (5th ed.1979). Thus, the phrase \u201cI submit to you that,\u201d is merely a method of prefacing an argument and does not by itself constitute vouching. The phrase fails to meet the vouching standard because it does not <em>assure </em>the jury that the witness is credible, but instead <em>asks </em>the juiy to find that the witness w&gt;as credible. This is proper argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 188.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">X.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">We conclude that the other points raised in defendant\u2019s briefs are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">The judgment of conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-9\"> Lombardino was known by the nickname \"Tutti.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b600-8\"> On November 11, 1998, Judge Politan signed a consent order that vacated the contempt order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b602-9\"> With respect to the murder charge, the judge instructed the jury that it could find defendant guilty as a principal or an accomplice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b607-12\"> The defendant asserts the first indictment should have been dismissed for evidentiary insufficiency because the judge refused to admit evidence of Lombardino\u2019s refusal to answer questions before the federal grand jury and at a subsequent deposition in 1998 regarding the Randazzo murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\"> Of course, Lombardino's silence was not used against Lombardino.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b611-7\"> Taccetta's grant of post-conviction relief for ineffective assistance of counsel was recently reversed by the Supreme Court. <em>State v.
