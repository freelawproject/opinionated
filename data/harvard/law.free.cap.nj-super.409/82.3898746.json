Severino and Rodriguez exited the vehicle and were struck by an automobile. Severino and Rodriguez died as a result of injuries sustained in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">Plaintiffs filed these actions in the trial court and asserted various claims, including claims against defendants NJM Group (NJMG), New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Company (NJM), New Jersey Re-Insurance Company (NJR), New Jersey Casualty Insurance Company (NJCI) and New Jersey Indemnity Insurance Company (NJI) for underinsured motorist (UIM) and personal injury protection (PIP) benefits under an insurance policy covering the Muniz vehicle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs thereafter consented to the dismissal of their claims against NJMG, NJM, NJCI and NJI and pursued their claims for UIM and PIP benefits against NJR, the entity that issued the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The trial court found that Severino was not entitled to coverage under the Muniz policy as a \u201cnamed insured,\u201d but that plaintiffs are nevertheless entitled to UIM and PIP benefits because, at the time of the accident, Severino and Rodriguez were \u201coccupying\u201d the Muniz vehicle. NJR appeals and the <em>Severino </em>plaintiffs cross-appeal from the orders memorializing these determinations. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that plaintiffs are not entitled to UIM or PIP benefits under the Muniz policy because Severino was not a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under the policy and because Severino and Rodriguez were not \u201coccupying\u201d the covered vehicle at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The facts regarding the accident are essentially undisputed. Louis Soba (Soba) was with Severino and Rodriguez in the Muniz automobile prior to the accident. At his deposition, Soba testified that, during the evening before the accident, he attended a party at a club in New York City. Severino and Rodriguez met Soba at the club at around 11:30 p.m. They remained there about four hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Severino, Rodriguez and Soba left the club. They stopped briefly at a grocery store in New York City to get something to eat. They got into Muniz\u2019s automobile to return to Jersey City. Severino was driving. Rodriguez was in the front passenger seat and Soba was in the rear.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Soba said that Severino was not intoxicated and that he did not have any problem operating the car during them return to Jersey City. They planned to stop at Severino\u2019s apartment on Palisade Avenue, where Severino and Muniz were going to reside. Severino had just purchased new furniture and he wanted Soba and Rodriguez to see the apartment and the new furniture. Thereafter, Severino intended to drive Soba and Rodriguez to their homes in Jersey City.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Severino parked the car on the northbound side of Palisade Avenue and turned off the engine. Severino got out of the car on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the driver side and Rodriguez exited on the front passenger side. They closed the doors of the car. Soba leaned over to the floor to pick up his sandwich and, a few seconds later, heard a \u201cboom.\u201d An automobile had struck the car. The driver of that automobile was Jermaine J. Malachi (Malachi). He was driving a vehicle owned by Kimberly Kilroy (Kilroy).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Soba testified that Severino and Rodriguez had just gotten out of the car and \u201c[ejverything happened within seconds.\u201d He did not realize that Severino and Rodriguez had been hit until he exited the car. Soba observed their bodies lying about fifty feet from the car. He also observed that Malachi had struck several other vehicles parked on Palisade Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Soba initially estimated that about fifteen or twenty seconds elapsed from the time Severino and Rodriguez exited the car until they were struck. Later in his deposition, however, Soba testified that about eight seconds had elapsed. On cross-examination, Soba stated that Severino and Rodriguez were crossing the street when they were hit. He said that Severino and Rodriguez were probably several feet away from the car when they were struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The police investigated the accident and filed a report that includes measurements taken at the scene. The report identifies a point of impact. The officer who took the measurements was not deposed; therefore, the record does not reveal the basis for his findings regarding the point of impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The insurance policy covering Kilroy\u2019s vehicle only provided coverage in the amount of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per occurrence. Plaintiffs sought UIM coverage under the Muniz policy, which provides that NJR will pay compensatory damages that an \u201cinsured\u201d is entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an underinsured vehicle as a result of bodily injury sustained in an accident. As it pertains to underinsured benefits, the policy defines \u201cinsured\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-9\">1. You or any family member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">2. Any other person occupying your covered auto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>3. Any person for damages that person is entitled to recover because of bodily injury to which this coverage applies sustained by a person described in \u201c1.\" or \u201c2.\u201d above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The plaintiffs in the <em>Severino </em>case filed a motion for summary-judgment, seeking a declaration that Severino was entitled to UIM benefits under the Muniz policy. The plaintiffs in the <em>Rodriguez </em>case joined in the motion. NJR opposed the motion and filed a cross-motion seeking a determination that Severino and Rodriguez were not entitled to UIM coverage because they were not \u201coccupying\u201d the Muniz vehicle when they sustained their fatal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The trial court considered the motions on May 26, 2006, and placed its decision on the record on that date. The court found that plaintiffs had established a \u201csufficient and substantial nexus between the insured vehicle and the injuries that [Severino and Rodriguez] sustained so as to compel UIM coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">The court accordingly entered an order on June 5, 2006, granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion for UIM coverage and denying NJR\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 UIM claims. NJR thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration, which the trial court denied by order entered on September 26, 2006. NJR filed a motion for leave to appeal, seeking review of the trial court\u2019s interlocutory decision. We denied that motion on September 25, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">Thereafter, plaintiffs settled their claims with Malachi and Kilroy for the liability limits under the policy covering the Kilroy vehicle. The plaintiffs in the <em>Severino </em>action then filed a motion seeking a determination that Severino was entitled to coverage under the Muniz policy on an alternative basis, specifically that Severino was a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under the Muniz policy. The plaintiffs additionally asserted that they were entitled to PIP death benefits under the policy covering the Muniz vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">The trial court considered this motion on August 3, 2007, and determined that Severino was not a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under the Muniz policy. The court found, however, that plaintiffs in both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>actions were entitled to PIP benefits because they were \u201coccupants\u201d of the vehicle, as the court had previously determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The court entered an order dated August 3, 2007, memorializing its findings. The plaintiffs in the <em>Severino </em>action filed a motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s determination that Severino was not a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under the Muniz policy. The trial court filed an order on October 5, 2007, denying the motion. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">NJR argues that the trial court erred by concluding that Severino and Rodriguez were entitled to UIM benefits under the Muniz policy because there was a \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d between the accident and the covered vehicle. Our resolution of this issue is informed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Mondelli v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>167, 506 A.2d 728 (1986), and <em>Torres v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>147, 793 A.2d 592 (2002), as well as our opinion in <em>Macchi v. Connecticut General Insurance Co., </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>64, 804 A.2d 596 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>79, 812 A.2d 1111 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">In <em>Mondelli, </em>the Court considered whether the plaintiff was \u201coccupying\u201d an insured vehicle for purposes of establishing uninsured motorist (UM) coverage. <em>Mondelli, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 169, 506 A.2d 728. The plaintiff sought UM benefits under a policy covering his girlfriend\u2019s car. <em>Ibid. </em>On the day of the accident, the plaintiff had taken his girlfriend\u2019s car to be serviced at a garage where he worked as an auto mechanic. <em>Id. </em>at 170, 506 A.2d 728. Thereafter, the plaintiff drove the car to a home where his girlfriend was working as a babysitter. <em>Ibid. </em>She had driven there in the plaintiffs car. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">When the homeowners returned, the plaintiff and his girlfriend intended to leave in their own cars. <em>Ibid,. </em>The plaintiffs girlfriend got in her car, which was parked at the curb. <em>Ibid. </em>The plaintiff was standing in the street, with his arm resting on the roof of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>car when he was struck by another vehicle that drove away without stopping. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The Court in <em>Mondelli </em>stated that the determination of whether a person is \u201coccupying\u201d a vehicle for purposes of UM coverage must be determined on a \u201ccase-by-ease\u201d basis. <em>Id. </em>at 172, 506 A.2d 728. The Court concluded that the plaintiff was \u201coccupying\u201d the vehicle at the time he was struck. <em>Id. </em>at 172-73, 506 A.2d 728. The Court noted that the insurance policy defined the term \u201coccupying\u201d as \u201c \u2018in or upon or entering into or alighting from\u2019 \u201d the insured vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 171, 506 A.2d 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The Court found that the plaintiff met this definition because he was \u201cupon\u201d the insured vehicle at the time of the accident. <em>Id. </em>at 171-73, 506 A.2d 728. Further, the Court concluded that he did not have to show that he had been on or near the car in connection with his immediate use of it as a means of transportation. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court noted, however, that the \u201c \u2018[m]ere coincidental connection between the accident and some touching of the ear would not be enough\u2019\u201d to establish coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 172, 506 A.2d 728 (quoting <em>Mondelli v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>522, 532, 475 A.2d 76 (App.Div.1984) (Petrella, J.AD., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">The Court addressed a similar issue in <em>Torres. </em>In that case, the plaintiff was working as a warehouse manager for a company. <em>Torres, supra, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>at 147-48, 793 A.2d 592. A delivery truck had stopped at the warehouse to deliver some packages and, after the truck departed, the plaintiff discovered that a package was missing. <em>Id. </em>at 148, 793 A.2d 592. The plaintiff drove in a company van to look for the delivery truck and the missing package. <em>Ibid. </em>He located the truck, which was double-parked nearby. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">The plaintiff stopped his van behind the delivery track and, with the driver\u2019s permission, entered the truck to look for the missing package. <em>Ibid. </em>The plaintiff said that he believed that he left the engine in the van running when he exited that vehicle. <em>Ibid. </em>The plaintiff could not find the package. <em>Ibid. </em>He exited the truck on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the driver\u2019s side and began to walk back to the van. <em>Ibid. </em>The plaintiff was a few inches from the van when he was struck by another truck, which was uninsured. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The plaintiff sought UM benefits under the policy covering his employer\u2019s van. <em>Ibid. </em>According to the policy, the persons insured included \u201c \u2018[a]nyone ... occupying a covered auto or a temporary substitute for a covered auto.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149, 793 A.2d 592. The policy defined the term \u201coccupying\u201d as \u201c \u2018in, upon, getting in, on, out or off.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The <em>Torres </em>Court held that, \u201cin order to obtain UM coverage where occupancy is in issue, a plaintiff is required to establish a substantial nexus between the insured vehicle and the injury sustained.\u201d <em>Ibid,. </em>The Court determined that the plaintiff had established \u201ca \u2018sufficient nexus\u2019 between the vehicle and the accident to require coverage.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">In <em>Macchi, </em>the plaintiff was driving a motor vehicle owned by her estranged husband\u2019s business. <em>Macchi, supra, </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 68, 804 A.2d 596. The plaintiff was on the way to a video store when she observed a one-car accident on the other side of the road. <em>Ibid. </em>The plaintiff stopped and told the other occupant of the car that she \u201c \u2018would be right back.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>She left her purse in the car. <em>Ibid. </em>The car\u2019s engine was running and the lights were on. <em>Ibid. </em>After the plaintiff exited the car, another vehicle collided with the disabled car, causing that vehicle to strike her. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">The plaintiff sought UM and UIM coverage under the policy covering the car. <em>Id. </em>at 68-69, 804 A.2d 596. The policy provided UIM coverage to any person \u201coccupying\u201d the vehicle and defined \u201coccupying\u201d as \u201c \u2018in, upon, getting in, on, out or off.\u2019 \u201d The trial court held that the plaintiff was not \u201coccupying\u201d the automobile because her activity \u201c Vas not substantially associated with her occupancy of the motor vehicle[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 71, 804 A.2d 596. We reversed, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">[tjhe facts in <em>Torres </em>are, for all intents and purposes, indistinguishable from those before us in this matter. In both cases, the claimant drove the covered vehicle to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>the place where the accident occurred and, leaving the engine running, stepped from the vehicle to perform an essential task with every intention of returning to the vehicle to continue the journey. The one factual difference that the claimant in <em>Torres </em>was discharging his employment duties in driving the covered vehicle and that plaintiff herein was on a personal errand is of no consequence in applying the pertinent language of the insurance policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 72, 804 <em>A.2d </em>596.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Applying the principles enunciated in <em>Mondelli Torres </em>and <em>Macchi, </em>we conclude that plaintiffs failed to establish the requisite \u201csubsta itial nexus\u201d between the accident and the Muniz vehicle. As stated previously, Severino and Rodriguez were not in or getting out of the Muniz car when they were hit. They had already exited the vehicle and closed the doors of the car. Furthermore, there is no evidence that either Severino or Rodriguez was leaning upon or touching the Muniz vehicle when they were struck, as was the case in <em>Mondelli.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Moreover, Severino did not leave the vehicle with its lights on or its engine running in order to perform some essential task, as was the case in <em>Torres </em>and <em>Macchi. </em>Severino\u2019s and Rodriguez\u2019s journey from New York City to Severino\u2019s apartment had concluded when Severino parked the car and turned off the engine. According to Soba, Severino and Rodriguez exited the car to enter Severino\u2019s apartment. They intended to return to the car at some point so that Severino could drive Rodriguez and Soba to their homes. Even so, Severino\u2019s and Rodriguez\u2019s use and occupancy of the vehicle had ended when they sustained their fatal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">We therefore conclude that Severino and Rodriguez were not entitled to UIM coverage under the Muniz policy because they were not \u201coccupying\u201d the covered vehicle at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">We next consider whether the trial court erred by concluding that Severino and Rodriguez were entitled to PIP benefits under the Muniz policy. The PIP statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>every standard automobile liability insurance policy ... shall contain personal injuiy protection benefits for the payment of benefits ... to the named insured and members of his family residing in his household who sustain bodily injury as a result of an accident while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile, or as a pedestrian, caused by an automobile or by an object propelled by or from an automobile, and to other persons sustaining bodily injury while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using the automobile of the named insured, with permission of the named insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\"><em>{N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">In order to determine whether PIP benefits must be paid with regard to a person who sustains bodily injury while \u201coccupying\u201d a covered vehicle, we apply the same \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d test that is applied when determining whether a person is entitled to UM or UIM coverage. <em>Svenson v. Nat\u2019l Consumer Ins. Co., </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>410, 413, 731 A.2d 91 (App.Div.1999) (citing <em>Smaul v. Irvington Gen. Hosp., </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>592, 595, 508 A.2d 1147 (App.Div.1986), <em>aff'd, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>474, 530 A.2d 1251 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">As stated previously, plaintiffs failed to establish a \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d between the covered vehicle and the accident. Plaintiffs have not shown that Severino and Rodriguez were \u201coccupying, entering into, alighting from or using\u201d Muniz\u2019s automobile when they sustained their fatal injuries. <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-4. Therefore, the trial court erred by finding that plaintiffs are entitled to PIP benefits under the Muniz policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Our decision in <em>Aversano v. Atlantic Employers Insurance Co., </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>570, 676 A.2d 556 (App.Div.1996), <em>affirmed, o.b., </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>490, 701 A.2d 129 (1997), supports this conclusion. In that case, the plaintiff was injured when he stepped into a pothole in a parking lot. <em>Id. </em>at 572, 676 A.2d 556. The plaintiff had been \u201cwalking towards his car with key in hand, right arm extended, reaching for the lock.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The plaintiff sought PIP benefits on the ground that he sustained an injury while \u201c \u2018occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">We determined that the plaintiff was not entitled to PIP benefits because he was not injured while \u201centering into\u201d the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 574-75, 676 A.2d 556. The plaintiff was \u201cmerely approach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ing\u201d the car when he stepped into the pothole. <em>Id. </em>at 574, 676 A.2d 556. We concluded that \u201cmere proximity\u201d and an \u201cintent to enter\u201d the covered vehicle are not sufficient to establish entitlement to PIP benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 575, 676 A.2d 556. We held that, as used in the statute, the phrase \u201cwhile entering into\u201d means \u201ca process of entry which begins, at the earliest, when physical contact with the vehicle is made with intent to enter.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">In this case, Severino and Rodriguez were out of the Muniz vehicle when they were struck. They were either standing adjacent to the covered vehicle or, as Soba reported, crossing the street, when they were hit. As we stated in <em>Aversano, </em>\u201cmere proximity\u201d to a covered vehicle is insufficient to establish entitlement to PIP benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">In their cross-appeal, plaintiffs in the <em>Severino </em>ease alternatively argue that Severino was entitled to coverage under the Muniz policy because he was a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under that policy. We are convinced that the trial court correctly rejected this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">The record shows that Muniz first applied for coverage from NJM in September 2002. Muniz obtained auto insurance for a 2003 Honda for the period from October 23, 2002 through October 23, 2003. Severino\u2019s name was not mentioned on the declarations page. In December 2002, a 1980 Toyota was added to the policy. According to Muniz, her father had purchased the car and turned it over to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">In October 2003, Muniz contacted NJR concerning the renewal of the policy and spoke to a company representative. The conversation was recorded. Muniz said that she was thinking of \u201cgetting rid of\u2019 the 1980 Toyota and insuring another ear, specifically a 1994 Chrysler. Muniz said that she had picked up the car the day before and it was parked in front of her house. Muniz was told that any car added to the policy had to be registered in Muniz\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Muniz also asked NJR\u2019s representative about \u201cadd[ing] on another driver.\u201d Muniz said that Severino would be driving the Chrysler. The representative said that Severino had to have the same address as Muniz. The representative also said that Severino\u2019s motor vehicle record could \u201caffect\u201d her policy if he had \u201cpoints.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Muniz asked whether it would be \u201cbetter\u201d if Severino obtained a policy under his name. The representative replied that Severino did not have to have his own policy but he would have to be \u201clisted\u201d under Muniz\u2019s policy until he obtained his own insurance. The representative told Muniz that the additional car could not be covered until NJR received proof that the vehicle was registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">It appears that Muniz elected not to insure the 1994 Chrysler. The policy was renewed for the 2003 Honda and the 1980 Toyota. Muniz was the only \u201cnamed insured\u201d on the declarations page. The two vehicles were listed on the declarations page and on the declarations supplement under the statement, \u201c[t]he rates applicable to this policy are based on the Rating Tier(s) indicated below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The declarations supplement also stated that the Honda was insured under the \u201cSafe Driver Tier\u201d and the 1980 Toyota listed under the \u201cStandard Tier.\u201d Severino\u2019s name appears under the Toyota. Next to his name is a statement indicating that in August 2001 he failed to observe a traffic signal.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Muniz testified that the NJR representative did not inform her that Severino would be entitled to the same coverage that she had under the policy. Muniz stated, however, that it was her expectation that Severino would receive the same benefits that she was receiving under the policy. She asserted that the NJR representative did not inform her of the difference between the status of a \u201cdriver\u201d and a \u201cnamed insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">Based on these facts, plaintiffs in the <em>Severino </em>matter contend that Severino was entitled to coverage as a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under the Muniz policy, rather than simply as an \u201coccupant\u201d of the vehicle. They assert that Muniz reasonably expected that Severi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>no would be covered as a \u201cnamed insured.\u201d The trial court found, however, that Severino was not entitled to such coverage under the policy. In our judgment, the trial court\u2019s determination was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">When interpreting the language of an insurance policy, \u201ccourts should give the policy\u2019s words \u2018their plain, ordinary meaning.\u2019\u201d <em>Nav-Its, Inc. v. Selective Ins. Co. of Am., </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>110, 118, 869 A.2d 929 (2005) (quoting <em>President v. Jenkins, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>550, 562, 853 A.2d 247 (2004)). \u201cIf the policy language is clear, the policy should be interpreted as written.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>at 562, 853 A.2d 247). \u201c[C]ourts \u2018should not write for the insured a better policy of insurance than the one purchased.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gibson v. Callaghan, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>662, 670, 730 A.2d 1278 (1999) (quoting <em>Longobardi v. Chubb Ins. Co., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>530, 537, 582 A.2d 1257 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Here, the relevant provisions of the policy are clear and unambiguous. Muniz\u2019s policy provides that NJR would pay PIP benefits to an \u201cinsured\u201d who sustains bodily injury. The policy defines \u201cinsured\u201d for PIP coverage as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">a. The named insured or any family member who sustains bodily injury:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">(1) Occupying or using an auto; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">(2) A pedestrian, when caused by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-11\">(a) An auto; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-12\">(b) An object propelled by or from an auto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-13\">b. Any other person who sustains bodily injury while:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-14\">(1) Occupying or using your covered auto with the permission of the named insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-16\">(2) A pedestrian, when caused by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-17\">(a) Your covered auto; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-18\">(b) Being struck by an object propelled by or from your covered auto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-19\">The policy thus provides broader coverage for the named insured and family members than other persons. For example, named insureds and their family members are entitled to coverage for bodily injuries sustained while occupying or using <em>any </em>automobile; whereas, other persons are entitled to coverage when occupying or using the covered automobile. In addition, the named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>insured and family members are entitled to coverage for bodily injuries sustained as pedestrians when the bodily injuries are caused by <em>any </em>automobile; whereas other persons are only entitled to coverage for bodily injuries sustained as a pedestrian when their injuries are caused by the covered automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Moreover, Muniz is identified on the declarations page as a \u201cnamed insured\u201d and Severino is not. There is nothing in the policy which indicates that Severino is a \u201cnamed insured.\u201d Although Muniz says she thought otherwise, the letter from NJR confirming the changes to the policy clearly indicates that Severino was only mentioned in the policy because he was a driver of the Toyota.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Plaintiffs in the <em>Severino </em>case argue, however, that the declarations page gave Muniz a reasonable expectation that Severino was a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under the policy. In support of this argument, they rely upon <em>Lehrhoff v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 638 A.2d 889 (App.Div.1994). In that case, the plaintiff sought UM coverage for his son, who had been injured as a pedestrian in a traffic accident with an unidentified motorist. <em>Id. </em>at 342, 638 A.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The plaintiffs auto insurance policy covered the plaintiff and his family members. <em>Id. </em>at 344, 638 A.2d 889. The declarations page identified the plaintiff as the \u201cinsured\u201d and listed four members of the family as drivers. <em>Ibid. </em>Another section of the policy indicated that the term \u201cfamily member\u201d only included persons who were related to the insured \u201c \u2018by blood, marriage or adoption\u2019 \u201d and were residents of the insured\u2019s household. <em>Id. </em>at 345, 638 A.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The insurer denied coverage because, at the time of the accident, the plaintiffs son was no longer residing in the plaintiffs household. <em>Ibid. </em>We held that the plaintiff was entitled to coverage under the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 351, 638 A.2d 889. We observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">it is the declaration page, the one page of the policy tailored to the particular insured and not merely boilerplate, which must be deemed to define coverage and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the insured\u2019s expectation of coverage. And we are also convinced that reasonable expectations of coverage raised by the declaration page cannot be contradicted by the policy\u2019s boilerplate unless the declaration page itself clearly so warns the insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 347, 638 A.2d 889.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The Supreme Court addressed a similar coverage issue in <em>Zacarias v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>590, 775 A.2d 1262 (2001). That ease involved a boatowner\u2019s insurance policy which identified the plaintiff and his relatives as \u201cinsured persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593, 775 A.2d 1262. The policy expressly excluded coverage for bodily injury to any person insured under the policy. <em>Ibid. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s wife had been injured while riding in the plaintiff\u2019s boat and the plaintiff sought indemnification under the policy for the claims asserted against him by his wife. <em>Id. </em>at 594, 775 A.2d 1262. The plaintiff argued, among other things, that the coverage exclusion did not apply because it was not mentioned on the declarations page. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 775 A.2d 1262. The Court held, however, that the exclusion applied because it was clear and unambiguous. <em>Id. </em>at 601, 775 A.2d 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">In its decision, the Court commented upon our decision in <em>Lehrhoff:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">We share the sentiments expressed by the Appellate Division in <em>Lehrhoff </em>in respect of the importance of the declarations sheet. We do not, howevex-, interpret <em>Lehrhoff </em>to 1\u2018equii'e an insui\u2019er to include an intra-family exclusion on the policy\u2019s declarations sheet in all cases. After an extensive analysis of the declarations sheet, as compared to the limits of coverage contained elsewhere in the policy, the <em>Lehrhoff </em>court found that the general definition section would \u201cunfairly defeat the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations\u201d of coverage. <em>[Lehrhoff, supra, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 350, 638 A.2d 889], In this case, in contrast, we find no ambiguity, inconsistency, or contradiction between the declarations sheet and the body of plaintiffs policy. As noted, the declarations sheet alerts the insured that the coverages and limits of liability are subject to the provisions of the policy, one of which is the intra-family exclusion. Also, as noted, the exclusion itself is written in direct and ordinary terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\"><em>[Zacarias, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 602-03, 775 A.2d 1262.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Here, as in <em>Zacar\u00edas, </em>there is no \u201cambiguity, inconsistency, or contradiction\u201d between the declarations sheet and the policy. The only \u201cnamed insured\u201d identified on the declarations page is Muniz. Severino\u2019s name appears on the declarations page but he is only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>mentioned to explain the rates applicable to the vehicles covered under the policy. Thus, there is nothing on the declarations page that would give Muniz a reasonable expectation that Severino was entitled to the same coverage that she had as a \u201cnamed insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Moreover, Muniz\u2019s conversation with the NJR representative did not give rise to a reasonable expectation that Severino would be covered under the policy as a \u201cnamed insured.\u201d The representative never told Muniz that Severino would be a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under the policy; rather, the representative made clear that Severino had to be \u201cadded\u201d because he was a regular driver of the car. Muniz had not previously disclosed that fact, but NJR became aware that Severino had been driving the car. NJR\u2019s representative did not explain the difference between the coverage provided to a \u201cnamed insured\u201d and an \u201coccupant\u201d of the covered vehicle but the difference in coverage was spelled out in the plain language of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Reversed on the appeal and affirmed on the cross-appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-12\"> Plaintiffs in the <em>Severino </em>action are the administratrix of Severino's estate and his family members.
