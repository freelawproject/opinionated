Following a determination that the four-year-old victim, C.J., was competent to testify, a delinquency hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>together with a hearing to determine the admissibility of A.S.\u2019s confession, was held in the Family Part. After denying A.S.\u2019s motion to suppress her confession, the judge ruled that A.S. was guilty as charged. She was sentenced to the Juvenile Justice Commission for one year, but the sentence was stayed pending sex offender treatment at Haven Home and completion of two years of probation. A.S., who was found to be subject to Megan\u2019s Law, was also prohibited from contact with the victim and from unsupervised contact with children under the age of twelve. Minimum sex offender and other customary fines and penalties were imposed. A.S. has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">On appeal, A.S. raises the following arguments for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">\n<em>POINT ONE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">THE JUVENILE\u2019S STATEMENT WAS TAKEN IN VIOLATION OF HER RIGHTS AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION, AND THE SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL RIGHTS AFFORDED TO JUVENILES, NECESSITATING SUPPRESSION AND REVERSAL. <em>U.S. CONSTITUTION, </em>AMENDS V, XIV; <em>NJ. CONST. </em>(1947), ART. 1 PAR. 10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">A. Even Under Standards Applicable to Adults, the Juvenile\u2019s Statement Was Taken in Violation of Her Right to Silence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-12\">B. The Questioning Was Particularly Improper In Light of the Special Protections Afforded to Juveniles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-13\">C. Suppression of the Juvenile\u2019s Statement Requires Reversal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">A.S. is the adoptive daughter of F.D., with whom A.S. has lived since the age of eleven.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A.S.\u2019s natural mother is an active substance abuser who abandoned A.S. at the age of nine; the whereabouts of her father are unknown. A.S. and F.D. reside in a duplex residence. F.D.\u2019s daughter, T.B., and the victim, T.B.\u2019s four-year-old son, C.J. (F.D.\u2019s grandson), live in the other half of the home. On November 25, 2007, while A.S. was babysitting for C.J., she committed fellatio on the child, paused to remove her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>retainer, and then continued the act for a total of approximately ten minutes. At its conclusion, A.S. cautioned the child not to tell his mother, but on the following night, after his bath, C.J. did so, telling T.B. that A.S. \u201cwas kissing on [his] balls and sucking on [his] tinky.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Upon learning of A.S.\u2019s conduct, T.B. summoned F.D. from next door, and when she had arrived, T.B. asked C.J. to repeat his story. Believing the story to be true, F.D., by then very angry, went back to her house to get A.S., who commenced to cry and to state \u201cI didn\u2019t do nothing\u201d even before accusations had been leveled against her. During the next forty minutes, A.S. continued to deny that she had committed a sexual assault on C.J. Nonetheless, T.B. called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">On the following morning, in the presence of F.D., T.B. and an aunt, A.S. allegedly confessed to the crime and stated that she did not know why she did it. Thereafter, C.J. was interviewed by a detective with the county prosecutor\u2019s office, and later in the day, A.S. was interviewed in the presence of F.D. by Jorge Ramos, a detective in the office\u2019s sex crimes unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The interview with A.S. was videotaped. However, the visual and sound quality of the videotape is poor, and it is therefore difficult, at times, to discern precisely what was said. The extreme antagonism of F.D. toward A.S. and the reluctance of A.S. to speak are nonetheless clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Because, on appeal, A.S. has challenged the admissibility of her confession on various grounds, we describe its circumstances in some detail.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a few preliminaries, Ramos commenced the interview by requesting that F.D. read to A.S. her <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights, which she did without elaboration, asking after reading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>each right whether A.S. understood, and receiving a slight nod. There then ensued a lengthy discussion between Ramos and F.D. regarding F.D.\u2019s right to be present for the interview, together with A.S.\u2019s analogous right to her mother\u2019s presence, both of which F.D. contended were poorly drafted in a \u201cdouble-folded\u201d fashion. At the conclusion of the discussion, F.D. asked A.S.: \u201cSo what do you want to do?\u201d When no response was received, F.D. then asked: \u201cDo you want to talk to the police or you don\u2019t want to talk to em?\u201d Again, A.S. did not immediately respond, but eventually answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To this, F.D. responded: \u201cWell you have to answer it, this is what the papers are for. He has to know, are you gonna talk to him or you\u2019re not going to talk to him?\u201d Again there was no response from A.S. As F.D. waited for a reply, she checked off that A.S. had understood each of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and she signed both the <em>Miranda </em>form and the parental presence form. A.S. did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Eventually, F.D. asked A.S. if she wanted a lawyer. When asked by A.S. \u201cwhat it is a lawyer do,\u201d F.D. responded: \u201cSuppose to represent you.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">After further delay and some inaudible comments, F.D. stated: Well at some point in time you gonna have to talk. You ain\u2019t been saying nothing anyway. And you ain\u2019t gon do nothing but lie to him anyway We already know you did it, what you did. And you get (inaudible) rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Without obtaining consent from A.S., F.D. then told Ramos: \u201cYou can question her, but I\u2019ll be present when you question her.\u201d At this point, A.S. signed the waiver form, throwing the pen down after doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Although the waiver had been executed, Ramos sought a further response as to whether A.S. wanted a lawyer. In that connection, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">JR: Okay, do you want to have an attorney present while I\u2019m asking questions'!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>AS: Then what would an attorney do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">JR: Well an attorney would represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">AS: So it would talk for me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">JR: Umm no, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">AS: Then what would it do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">JR: Well what, well what he would do is he would represent you legally, okay. At some point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">FD: And they make sure</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-11\">JR: They make sure you get</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-12\">FD: your rights are not violated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-13\">JR: violated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-14\">FD: And if you think he\u2019s ... asking you something that you shouldn\u2019t be answering, that\u2019s why it\u2019s asking you if you want an attorney. The attorney can\u2019t speak for you, he can represent you. When the questions are asked, you have to answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-15\">JR: And the attorney (inaudible) like your mom said the attorney is there to be sure that your rights aren\u2019t violated, um that, that I\u2019m ah you know advised you of what your rights are, that you\u2019re being advised. Um but he can\u2019t, you know you\u2019re the only one that can actually speak the truth here. So he\u2019s not going to speak for you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-16\">A.S. was not then asked whether she wished an attorney. Instead, F.D. expressed impatience because A.S. was delaying the process and declared that she hoped A.S. would answer \u201csome of them questions, cause she needs to do just like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-17\">Ramos then commenced the interview by stating that he expected the truth, that \u201cthe truth is only gonna help you,\u201d that \u201can attorney that\u2019s an assistant prosecutor was gonna review all this information,\u201d and \u201cthe more truthful you are and more complete you are, okay, the better it looks for you, okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-18\">At the outset of the interview, Ramos conducted the questioning, which was met by partial responses and long pauses. As time went on, F.D. again expressed her impatience, stating: \u201cIf you tell what happened, then you don\u2019t have to sit there all this time trying to figure out how you\u2019re gonna figure out some lie.\u201d Ramos then added: \u201cWe can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t help us.\u201d Once more, F.D. expressed certainty as to A.S.\u2019s guilt, stating: \u201cTell him what happened, [A.S.] Don\u2019t be embarrassed. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>already knows. See he already done talk to C.J., so you might as well just go ahead and tell him.\u201d After Ramos assured A.S. that she should not be embarrassed, F.D. again acknowledged A.S.\u2019s guilt, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">If she was so embarrassed she would\u2019ve never done what she did in the first place. Tell him what you did, [A.S.] We cannot sit here all day long for you to stare at the man, tell him what happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">By this point A.S. had stated that \u201cit\u201d happened on Sunday in her bedroom and that C.J. was wearing pajamas. After Ramos had asked whether C.J.\u2019s pajamas were pulled down and received no answer, F.D. took over the interrogation until she finally got a response that C.J. had pulled them down. Ramos then resumed the questioning, eliciting, after many pauses, A.S.\u2019s admission that she had \u201csucked [C.J.\u2019s] tinky\u201d for about ten minutes, told C.J. not to tell anybody, and then went to sleep. A.S. was arrested and confined for a period of ninety-three days.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">As we stated previously, a suppression hearing occurred during the course of A.S.\u2019s delinquency hearing to determine the admissibility of her confession. Although A.S. did not testify at the trial itself, she did testify at the hearing, stating at that time that she was in the ninth grade, but read at a third-grade level.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When asked whether she had understood her <em>Miranda </em>rights, A.S. responded, \u201c[sjome of it.\u201d She indicated that she understood the role of attorney to be to \u201cmake sure when people are questioning you that they don\u2019t ask you something that is not supposed to be asked or something. I didn\u2019t know that they do what you do.\u201d On cross-examination, A.S. explained that she did not request an attorney because she \u201cfelt as though there was no reason because they didn\u2019t do anything. They just sat there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">A.S. was also asked her understanding of the right to remain silent. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">Q. What about the right to remain silent? What did you understand that to mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-11\">A. That if I didn\u2019t want to say anything I didn\u2019t have to talk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-12\">Q. And is that what you did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>A. Yeah. But I still got asked a question and stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">Q. Did you feel pressured to answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">Q. Did you\u2014do you consider what you said to be voluntary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">A. What do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">Q. Did you want to say what you said or did you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-10\">A. No, I didn\u2019t want to answer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">A.S. provided a further description of her understanding of her rights on cross-examination, stating that although she was informed that she had a right to remain silent, \u201c[w]hen I would remain silent they kept on asking me the same questions over and over again for me to answer. They never said that I had to say, no, I don\u2019t want to talk no more. It says remain[ ] silent and that\u2019s what I had did.\u201d Then on re-direct examination, A.S. described what she thought would happen if she did not answer by testifying: \u201cI don\u2019t know what would happen so that\u2019s why after a while they kept asking me, I finally just answered some of them\u2014 most of them. Because I didn\u2019t really know what would happen or what wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d Nonetheless, A.S. admitted that she thought something bad would occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">A.S. confirmed that, during the course of the long interview, which was extended well beyond the confession while Ramos sought to determine the level of A.S.\u2019s sexual experience and the potential origin of her impulse to commit an act of fellatio, she never became tired or exhausted. And she confirmed that Ramos had never yelled at her or threatened her.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">At the conclusion of the suppression hearing, defense counsel argued that A.S. did not understand either her right to an attorney or the right to remain silent, which she attempted to invoke. Additionally, counsel argued that A.S.\u2019s statements to Ramos were not voluntary. Instead, she was badgered to confess by a mother who actively participated in the interrogation process. Further, counsel argued that, during the interview, F.D. protected the rights of her grandson, G.J., and not her daughter. Counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-14\">I think it is just abundantly clear that [A.S.] was an afterthought. And after this happened [A.S.] never went home again. Her mother didn\u2019t want her to come home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>As I recall at our hearing for her placement and detention, when she was ready to come home, she couldn\u2019t come home. And I don\u2019t know if the mother is rescinding the adoption or what is going on. It is all in flux.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the Family Part judge ruled that A.S.\u2019s statement to Ramos was admissible. However, in this connection, he found it \u201ca little unusual\u201d and \u201cprobably not the best police practice\u201d for the mother to have administered the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Additionally, the judge accepted A.S.\u2019s statement that she read at only a third-grade level, but found that her level of intelligence was \u201ctotally appropriate to a 14-year-old\u201d and that there were no impairments whatsoever to A.S.\u2019s comprehension and intelligence. The judge noted that A.S. had questioned what the role of an attorney would be, and he found that the explanation given by Ramos and F.D. was \u201cquite good\u201d and \u201ccertainly adequate.\u201d Although A.S. acknowledged that she understood that her waiver of rights could be rescinded, the judge noted that she never asserted her desire to stop questioning. Further, the judge found that F.D. was not coercive, but he agreed that her anger was \u201cvery clear.\u201d However, he concluded, \u201cthat anger had to do with what she believed [A.S.] had done ... and [A.S.\u2019s] reluctance to answer the questions\u201d and that F.D.\u2019s emotional state did not taint the interview. The judge concluded by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">I find that [A.S.] was not confused. She was reluctant. Absolutely. And she explained why. Because she was embarrassed. She knew what she did was wrong. She told us at the beginning before she began answering. I am embarrassed. And so that made her reluctant. And she was not coerced, as I said by the detective or her mother.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">A finding of delinquency followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">To admit the confession of a juvenile over the age of fourteen, the State must demonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>that the statement was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily given. <em>State v. Presha, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>304, 313, 748 A.2d 1108 (2000). Whether those conditions have been met depends upon the judge\u2019s evaluation of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation. <em>Ibid. </em>Factors to be considered include \u201cthe suspect\u2019s age, education and intelligence, advice as to constitutional rights, length of detention, whether the questioning was repeated and prolonged in nature, and whether physical punishment or mental exhaustion was involved.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Miller, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>392, 402, 388 A.2d 218 (1978)). The suspect\u2019s \u201cprior encounters with the law\u201d are also relevant in this regard. <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Miller, supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 402, 388 A.2d 218).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">As the Court held in <em>Presha, </em>\u201c[t]he role of a parent in the context of a juvenile interrogation takes on special significance.\u201d 163 <em>N.J. </em>at 314, 748 A.2d 1108 (citing <em>In re Carlo, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>224, 225 A.2d 110 (1966)). In this regard, the parent selves as an advisor to the juvenile, providing a measure of support in the unfamiliar setting of a police station. <em>Presha, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 314, 748 A.2d 1108. For that reason, the parent and child must have a reasonable opportunity to consult on such matters as whether the right to avoid self-incrimination should be waived. <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>Garrett v. State, </em>265 <em>Ind. </em>63, 351 <em>N.E.2d </em>30, 33 (1976)). Additionally, because a goal of juvenile adjudications is rehabilitation, the presence of a parent not only protects the juvenile\u2019s interests, but ensures the truthfulness of statements made by the juvenile to the police. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">However, as noted by the Court, because \u201cpunishment has now joined rehabilitation as a component of the State\u2019s core mission with respect to juveniles,\u201d a parent\u2019s role takes on a \u201cnew significance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314-15, 748 A.2d 1108.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">When young offenders are in custody, the parent selves as a buffer between the juvenile, who is entitled to certain protections, and the police, whose investigative function brings the officers necessarily in conflict with the juvenile\u2019s legal interests. Parents are in a position to assist juveniles in understanding their rights, acting intelligently in waiving those rights, and otherwise remaining calm in the face of an interrogation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>[Id. </em>at 315, 748 A.2d 1108 (citing <em>Gallegos v.

Colorado, </em>370 <em>U.S. </em>49, 82 <em>S.Ct. </em>1209, 8 L.Ed.2d 325 (1962). There, the court observed in connection with a juvenile boy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">[A] 14-year-old boy, no matter how sophisticated, is unlikely to have any conception of what will confront him when he is made accessible only to the police. That is to say, we deal with a person who is not equal to the police in knowledge and understanding of the consequences of the questions and answers being recorded and who is unable to know how to protect his own interests or how to get the benefits of his constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 54, 82 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1212, 8 L.Ed.2d at 328.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">The Court additionally emphasized that the child \u201cwould have no way of knowing what the consequences of his confession were without advice as to his rights\u2014from someone concerned with securing him those rights\u2014and without the aid of more mature judgment as to the steps he should take in the predicament in which he found himself.\u201d <em>Id., </em>82 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1213, 8 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 329. <em>See also In re Gault, </em>387 <em>U.S. </em>1, 55, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1428, 1458, 18 L.Ed.2d 527, 561 (1967) (\u201cthe greatest care must be taken to assure that ...

The voluntariness of a juvenile\u2019s confession is evaluated from the juvenile\u2019s perspective. <em>State in the Interest of Q.N., </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>165, 174, 843 A.2d 1140 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">When we view the confession of AS. in light of the standards established by the Court, we have a number of concerns. First of all, we note that A.S. was just fourteen years of age at the time of her interrogation. The Court has held with respect to those thirteen or younger that the juvenile\u2019s \u201cimmaturity so limits [their] ability to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of rights that an added layer of protection [afforded by the presence of a parent] is required.\u201d <em>State v. A.G.D. </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>56, 67-68, 835 A.2d 291 (2003); <em>see also Q.N., supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 172-73, 843 A.2d 1140. We do not regard passage from thirteen to fourteen necessarily to be accompanied by new-found maturity and wisdom. That observation may be particularly true in the present case, involving a juvenile with a third-grade reading level. Although that deficiency could be attributed to disruption in schooling caused by her insecure childhood, A.S.\u2019s low intelligence was undoubtedly a contributing factor, as well. The level of A.S.\u2019s understanding of her rights thus must be judged after consideration of her intellectual deficits.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">We note further in this regard that the Court has required that a parent have a reasonable opportunity to \u201cconsult\u201d with her child regarding any proposed waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights. In the present matter, such consultation did not occur, either in the presence of Ramos or outside his presence, which we would deem preferable. At this \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the proceedings, <em>Q.N., supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 176, 843 A.2d 1140, Ramos handed the rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>form to P.D. to read to A.S.\u2014a step that the experienced Family Part judge found \u201cunusual\u201d and \u201cnot the best police practice\u201d\u2014 and AS.\u2019s alleged \u201cunderstanding\u201d of her rights was obtained in a wholly pro forma manner. Nothing done by F.D. at this point contributed to AS.\u2019s comprehension of the rights that she was being urged to waive, and no discussion took place either as to whether waiver was an appropriate course for AS. to take or what the practical consequences of such waiver would be.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, A.S., who had no experience with the criminal law, was unable to rely upon prior knowledge in this regard. <em>Compare Presha, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 309, 748 A.2d 1108 (noting the juvenile\u2019s fifteen prior arrests and finding them relevant to the voluntariness of his waiver of rights). As the Court observed in <em>In re S.H., </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>108, 293 A.2d 181 (1972), a juvenile \u201ccannot make a knowing and intelligent waiver of something he cannot understand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115, 293 A.2d 181. In this important area,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkE\">we cannot give any weight to recitals which merely formalize constitutional requirements. Formulas of respect for constitutional safeguards cannot prevail over the facts of life which contradict them. They may not become a cloak for inquisitorial practices and make an empty form of the due process of law for which free men fought and died to obtain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\"><em>[Haley, supra, </em>332 <em>US. </em>at 601, 68 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 304, 92 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 229.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">When A.S. later stated that she did not understand the role of an attorney, Ramos and F.D. responded in a manner that was unlikely to be understood by A.S., stating only that an attorney would protect her \u201crights\u201d and would keep Ramos from asking improper questions. The statements of both Ramos and F.D. provided the clear impression that, regardless of an attorney\u2019s presence, A.S. would be required to confess. Neither informed AS. that an attorney would advise her on matters such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the consequence of her confession and the advisability of waiving her right against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The testimony of A.S. at the suppression hearing confirmed her incomplete understanding of an attorney\u2019s role, thereby suggesting that her waiver of such assistance was not entirely knowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">As we have already emphasized, to be valid, any waiver by A.S. was required to be voluntary, knowing and intelligent. As the United States Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">The inquiry has two distinct dimensions. First, the relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception. Second, the waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it. Only if the \u201ctotality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u201d reveals both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the <em>Miranda </em>lights have been waived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\"><em>[Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>412, 421, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1135, 1141, 89 L.Ed.2d 410, 421 (1986) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">A.S.\u2019s waiver in this ease does not meet these exacting standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">A further issue arises with respect to the right to remain silent. And here, the poor quality of the videotape becomes an issue, because it is not possible to determine with any accuracy the content of many of A.S.\u2019s mumbled responses. It does not appear that A.S. ever directly requested that questioning cease\u2014and Ramos testified that he would have complied with nothing less. However, A.S.\u2019s statement that she did not know whether she wished to speak to Ramos, her evident reluctance thereafter to speak, and the long silences occurring before she offered any response, however minimal, suggests at least an equivocal invocation of the right to silence, warranting further inquiry by Ramos <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>as to A.S.\u2019s intent, not continued interrogation. <em>See Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 473-74, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 1627-28, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 723 (1966) (\u201cIf the individual indicates <em>in any manner, </em>at anytime prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.\u201d) (emphasis supplied). \u201c[AJ valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after warnings are given or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1628, 16 L.Ed.2d at 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">As the United States Supreme Court recognized in <em>Michigan v. Mosley </em>when discussing <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>requirement that the right to remain silent must be \u201cscrupulously honored,\u201d <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 479, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d at 726:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">The critical safeguard identified in the passage at issue is a person\u2019s \u201cright to cut off questioning.\u201d Through the exercise of his option to terminate questioning he can control the time at which questioning occurs, the subjects discussed, and the duration of the interrogation. The requirement that law enforcement authorities must respect a person\u2019s exercise of that option counteracts the coercive pressures of the custodial setting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\"><em>[Michigan v.

As the <em>Bey I </em>Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">Even if defendant\u2019s conduct and remarks are treated as equivocal, and the police reasonably were unsure of defendant\u2019s wishes, their subsequent exchanges with him would have been narrowly restricted to <em>clarifying </em>the meaning of his statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\"><em>[Bey I, supra, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>at 65 n. 10, 548 A.2d 846.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX\">Ramos did not follow this precept, failing to clarify in any way A.S.\u2019s statement that she did not know whether she wished to speak to him and failing to ascertain the foundation for A.S.\u2019s evident reluctance thereafter to respond to his questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>We also find it significant that Ramos misleadingly stated to AS. that \u201cthe truth is only gonna help you,\u201d implying that A.S.\u2019s truthfulness would be favorably evaluated by the assistant prosecutor in making a decision as to what to do with A.S.\u2019s ease. As Ramos stated, \u201cthe more truthful you are and more complete you are, okay, the better it looks for you, okay.\u201d Courts have found such tactics to be improper. <em>Woods v. Clusen, </em>794 F.2d 293, 295, 297 (7th Cir.1986) (officer\u2019s \u201cstatement to the juvenile that it would \u2018be better\u2019 if [he] talked was dubious advice to the ignorant, as any minimally competent defense counsel would be quick to attest.\u201d); <em>Hart v.

Because the proper treatment of such conflicts has not been addressed in New Jersey, we invited the Attorney General and the Acting Child Advocate to appear as amici in this matter, which they did, submitting briefs that have considerably illuminated the issues presented by this appeal and precedent relevant to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Our review of the record in this matter satisfies us that a conflict of interest on the part of F.D. was in fact present and manifest, and that throughout the interrogation, F.D. acted in the best interests of her grandson, not her adopted daughter. We find any conclusion by the Family Part judge to the contrary not to have been supported by the evidence. <em>State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 470-71, 724 A.2d 234 (1999) (requiring the existence of substantial evidence in support of a trial judge\u2019s factual findings).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>In this regard, we recognize that in <em>Q.N., </em>a case involving the sexual assault upon three girls by a twelve-year-old non-relative, the Court found that the State had carried its burden of demonstrating the juvenile\u2019s confession to be admissible, while observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aii\">This strikes us, however, as an atypical ease in view of the fact that Q.N.\u2019s mother twice urged her son to confess to the suspected acts, which ultimately he did. \u201c[A] suspect is always free to waive the privilege [against self-incriminationj and confess to committing crimes, [so long as] that waiver [is not] the product of police coercion.\u201d <em>[Presha, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J.] </em>at 313, 748 A.2d 1108.

But in the present matter, F.D. went further than the mother of Q.N. First, she confirmed to Ramos A.S.\u2019s guilt, which in fact was not a speculative conclusion, as in <em>Q.N., </em>but known to her as the result of A.S.\u2019s confession to the family. And, second, she actively participated in the questioning of A.S., not only urging her to speak, but also at one point taking over Ramos\u2019s role as interrogator. As A.S. testified at the suppression hearing: \u201cWhen I would remain silent <em>they </em>kept asking me the same questions over and over again....\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">While urging a juvenile to tell the truth, and even expressing an opinion as to guilt may be of benefit to the juvenile from the perspective of rehabilitation, F.D.\u2019s open acknowledgement of A.S.\u2019s guilt and her active participation in A.S.\u2019s interrogation removed entirely the buffer F.D.\u2019s presence was designed to provide between A.S. and the police, and cannot be deemed in this context to have been in the child\u2019s interest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See Presha, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 314-15, 748 A.2d 1108; <em>In re J.F., </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>89, 100, 668 A.2d 426 (App.Div.1995); <em>see also Haley, supra, </em>332 <em>U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>at 599-600, 68 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 303-04, 92 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 228-29 (\u201cA 15-year-old lad ... needs someone on whom to lean lest the overpowering presence of the law, as he knows it, crush him ... to see to it [the police] stopped short of the point where he became the victim of coercion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In the circumstances presented, F.D.\u2019s conflict in many respects rendered her assistance absent\u2014a \u201chighly significant factor\u201d under <em>Premia\u2019s </em>standards for judging voluntariness. 163 <em>N.J. </em>at 315, 748 A.2d 1108. Moreover, her unconnected legal misstatement that A.S. would have to talk eventually and her participation in AS.\u2019s intenogation rendered the process substantially unfair. <em>S.H., supra, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 115, 293 A.2d 181 (requiring in the absence of a knowing and intelligent waiver of rights that any questioning be \u201cconducted with the utmost fairness and in accordance with the highest standards of due process and fundamental fairness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The significant impact of a parental conflict of interest was recognized by Justices Marshall and Brennan, dissenting in the denial of certiorari in the matter of <em>Little v. Arkansas, </em>435 <em>U.S. </em>957, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>1590, 55 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>809 (1978). In that case, a thirteen-year-old girl of \u201clow dull normal\u201d intelligence confessed to the murder of her father after a ten or fifteen minute conference with her mother, who believed that she herself was a suspect. In an opinion written by Justice Marshall, the Justice stated he would have granted the writ \u201cto resolve the question whether, before a juvenile waives her constitutional rights to remain silent and consult with an attorney, she is entitled to competent advice from an adult who does not have significant conflicts of interest.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In this regard, the Justice noted the Court\u2019s prior recognition of the special problems associated with the waiver of rights by juveniles and its requirement that the child receive advice from a \u201ccompetent\u201d adult before making a confession. 435 <em>U.S. </em>at 959, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1592, 55 L.Ed.2d at 810. The Justice further relied upon lower court decisions and commentary declining to find a juvenile\u2019s waiver to be valid when there was no showing that the parent was free from conflicts of interest and was competent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>advise the child. Similarly, in <em>Little, </em>the Justice observed that the mother \u201cwas plainly not in a position to provide rational advice with only the child\u2019s interests in mind, especially on the day of the murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 959, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1592, 55 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 810. In conclusion, Justice Marshall stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">Under all of the circumstances, petitioner\u2019s contention that there was no valid waiver of her rights deserves this Court\u2019s plenary consideration. At the time that she made the decision to confess, the girl of \u201clow dull normal\u201d intelligence was not old enough, according to state law, to make decisions for herself on such other matters as marriage, voting, drinking alcoholic beverages, entering into an enforceable contract, initiating a lawsuit, and remaining in school. Her mother was hardly in a position to act on petitioner\u2019s behalf on the day of the confession, as discussed above. In view of our reaffirmation only last Term that courts must \u201cindulge in <em>every </em>reasonable presumption against waiver,\u201d <em>Brewer v. Williams, </em>430 <em>U.S. </em>387, 404, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>1232, 51 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>424 (1977), I would grant the petition for certiorari. [435 <em>U.S. </em>at 961, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1593, 55 L.Ed.2d at 811.]<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">We review the totality of the circumstances presented in this case against this background and conclude that the State has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that A.S.\u2019s confession was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily given. <em>State v. Yough, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>587, 602, 231 A.2d 598 (1967). Therefore, it should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful of A.S.\u2019s youth, her relatively low intelligence, and her unfamiliarity with the criminal justice system. We also note the cursory nature of the administration of A.S.\u2019s rights, the lack of meaningful consultation, the inadequacy of the explanation given to her regarding the role of an attorney in protecting her rights, and the significant possibility that she ambiguously invoked her right to remain silent. But of overwhelming significance to us is F.D.\u2019s patent conflict of interest in advising A.S., arising from her relationship to the victim, her grandson C.J., and her evident determination to protect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>interests of C.J. at the expense of those of AS. Indeed, in the absence of the other enumerated factors, we would still be inclined to find suppression warranted in this matter. <em>Cf. State v.

We remain troubled that by affirming the trial judge on this alternative ground, our determination to suppress the confession given by A.S. has no prophylactic effect. We are further troubled by the application of Megan\u2019s law to this fourteen-year-old girl who, it appears fair to conclude, is not a sexual deviant, but rather an immature teen who engaged in an unfortunate sexual experiment.
