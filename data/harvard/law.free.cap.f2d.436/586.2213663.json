Cohen appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to vacate judgment and sentence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">Cohen was convicted upon his plea of nolo contendere on one count of causing the interstate transportation of a counterfeit American Express traveler\u2019s check, knowing the same to be counterfeit, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. Four similar counts, and one count alleging a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, were dismissed upon motion of the Government. There was no direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">Cohen contends that, inasmuch as the record does not indicate that the grand jury which indicted him was shown any evidence that he himself caused the counterfeit traveler\u2019s cheek to be transported interstate, the indictment was so defective as to deprive the District Court of jurisdiction. The argument is without merit. Indictments are not open to challenge merely on the ground that the evidence before the grand jury was inadequate or incompetent. Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 363, 76 S.Ct. 406, 408, 100 L.Ed. 397 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-14\">Cohen further contends that his plea of nolo contendere was involuntary, and that the assistance rendered him by counsel was ineffective. The District Judge examined the transcript of the original proceeding and concluded, without an evidentiary hearing, that there was no substance to Cohen\u2019s allegations. We agree that the records of the case conclusively show that Cohen is entitled to no relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; Barrett v. United States, 5 Cir., 1962, 302 F.2d 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
