Under the circumstances, purchasers thereof may well consider such products as emanating from a common source <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> were they to be marketed under the same or confusingly similar marks. See: Roman Meal Company v. Roman Crest Food [Foods], Inc., [49 CCPA 980, 300 F.2d 926] 133 USPQ 202 (CCPA, 1962); and Goldenrod Ice Cream Company v. Louisville Pecan Company, [49 CCPA 1194, 305 F.2d 473] 134 USPQ 255 (CCPA, 1962).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-15\">* * -!t * # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-16\">Applicant urges that the only element the marks possess in common is the generic word \u201cCORN\u201d since \u201cKITS\u201d and \u201cKIX\u201d differ in both appearance and connotation and, in addition, the addition of the surname \u201cMORRISON\u2019S\u201d to applicant\u2019s mark clearly distinguishes the marks of the parties when considered in their en-tireties. We cannot agree with applicant that the marks only possess the generic word \u201ccorn\u201d in common since, in our opinion, \u201cCORN-KITS\u201d and \u201cCORN KIX\u201d are substantially similar in sound and appearance. Moreover, while the marks must be considered in their entireties, \u201cCORN-KITS\u201d is a separable, conspicuous and visually the most prominent element of applicant\u2019s mark (See: Roman Meal Company v. Roman Crest Foods, Inc., supra); and, in the present instance, the mere addition of applicant\u2019s housemark cannot serve to distinguish it from opposer\u2019s \u201cCORN-KIX\u201d. See: Celanese Corporation of America v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company [33 CCPA 857, 154 F.2d 143], 69 USPQ 69 (CCPA, 1946).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1123-18\">Initially, as appellant points out, this is not a case of potential product confusion, notwithstanding superficial similarities in the marks. Even were the marks identical, purchasers would , not likely confuse the goods, or mistakenly accept a prepared corn bread mix in anticipation of getting a breakfast cereal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>Turning, then, to a comparison of the marks, we cannot agree with the board that the marks so resemble each other that confusion or mistake as to the origin of the goods is likely. While it is true that \u201cKits\u201d and \u201cKix,\u201d or \u201cCorn-Kits\u201d and \u201cCorn Kix,\u201d are somewhat similar in sound and appearance, they nevertheless possess entirely different connotations. \u201cKix\u201d or \u201cCorn Kix\u201d itself is arbitrary, having no well defined meaning. \u201cKits\u201d or \u201cCorn-Kits,\u201d on the other hand, is suggestive of the packaging and form of appellant\u2019s product \u2014 a handy \u201ckit\u201d from which one can easily prepare corn muffins or corn bread. Moreover, when one considers that appellant\u2019s mark in its entirety is \u201cMorrison's Corn-Kits,\" we harbor no doubt that consumers would find the respective marks and manufacturers readily, distinguishable. Cf. Rockwood Chocolate Co. v. Hoffman Candy Co., 372 F.2d 552, 54 CCPA 1061 (1967). We do not think that the ordinary purchaser, familiar with appellee\u2019s \u201cKix\u201d and \u201cCorn Kix\u201d products and marks, would, upon encountering a product marked \u201cMorrison\u2019s Corn-Kits,\u201d believe that the products emanated from a common source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1123-19\">.

The board earlier had noted that General Mills manufactures, in addition to its cereal food line, a corn muffin mix, although the latter product is marketed under a different trademark than those here involved. The record also shows that at one time in its history Morrison manufactured breakfast cereals, although it does not do so now.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
