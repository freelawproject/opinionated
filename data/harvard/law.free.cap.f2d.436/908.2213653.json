East Bay Union of Machinists, Local 1304, United Steelworkers of America, A.F.L.-C.I.O. v. N. L. R. B., 116 U.S.App.D.C. 198, 322 F.2d 411 (1963), affirmed, <em>sub nom. </em>Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 379 U.S. 203, 85 S.Ct. 398, 13 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964). The instant case relates only to the supplemental back pay proceedings resulting from the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\"> Both the union and the company raise various objections to the Board\u2019s disposition of these proceedings. We have carefully examined all these objections and find that the Board in its supplemental decision and order has correctly stated the law applicable to the issues presented. <em>See </em>180 NLRB No. 33 (1969). We also find that there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the Board\u2019s factual findings. While on some of the issues we may well have found differently,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-12\">\u201c[a]s with the Board\u2019s other remedies, the power to order back pay \u2018is for the Board to wield, not for the courts.\u2019 NLRB v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., 344 U.S. 344, 346 [73 S.Ct. 287, 97 L.Ed. 377] (1953). \u2018When the Board, \u201cin the exercise of its informed discretion,\u201d makes an order of restoration by way of back pay, the order \u201cshould stand unless it can be shown that the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 346-347 [73 S.Ct. at 289.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">N.L.R.B. v. J. H. Rutter-Rex Manufacturing Co., 396 U.S. 258, 263, 90 S.Ct. 417, 420, 24 L.Ed.2d 405 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-14\">The petitions of the union and the company to review and set aside in part the Board\u2019s supplemental order in this case are denied and the supplemental order will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-15\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-16\">MATTHEWS, Senior District Judge, respectfully dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
