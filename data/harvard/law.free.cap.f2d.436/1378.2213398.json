Jones &amp; Laughlin Co., 331 U.S. 416, 428, 67 S.Ct. 1274, 1281, 91 L.Ed. 1575 (1947), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1451-10\">\u201cWhen circumstances do arise after the Board\u2019s order has been issued which may affect the propriety of enforcement of the order, the reviewing court has discretion to decide the matter itself or to remand it to the Board for further consideration. For example, where the order obviously has become moot, the court can deny enforcement without further ado; but where the matter is one involving complicated or disputed facts or questions of statutory policy, a remand to the Board is ordinarily in order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1451-11\">It, therefore, appears from the record that there is a substantial issue whether or not the orders of the Board are now moot, and that the resolution of that issue is one which involves a complicated question of fact and questions of statutory policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-15\">It is ordered that the issue of whether the orders-, of the Board have become moot is remanded to the Board for such proceedings, findings, recommendations and orders as may be required pursuant to the Board\u2019s discretion under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-16\">If additional proceedings are instituted in this court, in connection with any new determination which the Board may make pursuant to this Order of remand, then this court will reach the conclusion required of it upon consideration of the record and briefs already in this court and such supplemental record and briefs as may be submitted and upon this same docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-17\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
