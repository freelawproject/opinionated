United States, 310 F.2d 447 (6th Cir. 1962); Noll v. United States, 83 F.Supp. 887 (W.D.Pa.1949); cf. Jefferson v. United States, 277 F.2d 723 (9th Cir. 1960), cert. denied 364 U.S. 896, 81 S.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>Ct. 227, 5 L.Ed.2d 190 (1960). We have reviewed the record and find that the District Court acted reasonably and within the proper latitude of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">In addition we have considered the allegations raised in the habeas corpus petitions and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">Accordingly, the order of the District Court denying Clarence and William Holiday\u2019s applications will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
