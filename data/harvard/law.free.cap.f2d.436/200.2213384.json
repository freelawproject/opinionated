Without in any way challenging the allegations regarding his participation in the crimes charged, appellant, admittedly a narcotic addict, argues that the evidence of his narcotic addiction, when weighed with the testimony of two psychiatrists and a psychologist called by the appellant, should have compelled the trial judge to grant the motion for judgment of acquittal by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">Prior to trial appellant was committed to St. Elizabeths Hospital, and in due course he was certified competent to stand trial. Three members of the staff at St. Elizabeths who had examined appellant during his confinement there testified at length regarding his mental condition, and he also called as a witness one of the police officers who had observed his condition shortly after his arrest. The trial judge, in ruling upon appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, first observed that had there been a jury in the case he would have been required to submit the question of appellant\u2019s mental capacity to that body (Tr. 199) \u2014 obviously to determine as a matter of fact whether the evidence established appellant\u2019s capacity beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">The trial judge thereafter summarized his findings and contusions as to the appellant\u2019s guilt and mental condition. He found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-14\">That the crime [s] charged were committed and that appellant participated in them. (Tr. 200.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-15\">That appellant\u2019s participation was to such an extent that he could be found guilty if there was no causal connection between the crime and the mental disease. (Tr. 200.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-16\">That appellant is suffering from an anxiety reaction and was suffering from an anxiety reaction at the time the crime[s] were committed. (Tr. 199. )</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-18\">That the anxiety reaction is recognized in psychiatric journals and bulletins as a mental disease. (Tr. 200.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-19\">That the anxiety reaction from which appellant suffered was a \u201cmild\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d one which permitted the appellant or any other person \u201cin a like situation to exercise control over himself, to restrain himself, and otherwise to function in a normally acceptable way within society.\u201d (Tr. 200. )</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-21\">That appellant \u201cis and was\u201d a narcotic addict at the time the crime [s] were committed. (Tr. 200.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>That the record was unclear as to whether appellant used drugs to alleviate his anxiety reaction or for some other reason. (Tr. 201.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">That, whatever was the reason for appellant\u2019s narcotic addition, the use of narcotics can under certain circumstances alleviate the anxiety which is the mental disease from which appellant suffered. (Tr. 201.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">That at the time of the perpetration of the crime [s] and although appellant was then suffering from \u201ca mental disease * * * a moderate form of anxiety reaction,\u201d he was nevertheless \u201ca highly intelligent person, he was able to plan, he was able to execute\u201d and he was \u201ccapable of refraining from doing the acts which constitute the crime[s].\u201d (Tr. 201-202.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">That at the time appellant committed the crime [s] \u201che was not suffering any withdrawal symptoms so that there was no compulsive or impulsive situation which caused him to do the acts which constitute the crime [s],\u201d and that \u201c[h]e was able to plan and to execute it, and he was able to refrain [from doing it].\u201d (Tr. 202.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">That the testimony indicated that appellant was at the time of the commission of the offense \u201chigh\u201d on drugs, and that \u201ca drug addict who is in such a condition is more capable of controlling his behavior than the average person since the anxiety reaction from which all of us suffer to some degree was completely blanketed by the effect of the drugs.\u201d (Tr. 202.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">From these findings of fact the trial judge concluded that \u201cthe crime became one of convenience rather than a crime of necessity.\u201d (Tr. 202.) He rejected, upon the basis of these findings and this conclusion, the theory of appellant that the crime was \u201ctied\u201d to the mental disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">We have reviewed the entire record of the testimony offered upon the subject of appellant\u2019s mental condition prior to and at the time of the commission of the offenses. With this testimony, as with almost all testimony, it is possible to select excerpts out of context and to argue forcefully in support of any conclusion which the advocate seeks; obviously the trial judge, acting also as the trier of facts in this case, is far more accurate in his appraisal of the credibility of the witnesses and the factual elements establishing truth than we, faced with a cold record, can possibly be. It is, of course, the sole responsibility of the trier of facts to evaluate the testimony of the witnesses and to determine what weight, if any, should be given to the testimony of each witness. This basic principle was forcefully stated by Chief Judge Bazelon in his recent opinion for this court in Adams v. United States, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 137, 142, 413 F.2d 411, 416 (1969) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-12\">The decisions of this jurisdiction have made clear * * * our reluctance to require a directed acquittal for insanity. We have upon occasion refused to find that the Government has not borne its burden even when the evidence of mental illness was un-contradicted. * * * We have emphasized time and again that \u201cin view of the complicated nature of the decision to be made \u2014 intertwining moral, legal and medical judgments \u2014 \u201d the insanity defense is peculiarly apt for resolution by the jury. As part of its task, \u201cThe jury is free to believe any reasonable \u2018estimate\u2019 even though different or contrary views may also be reasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">The <em>Adams </em>decision also makes clear that the governing principles are identical when the court rather than the jury is the trier of fact. <em>(Id.) </em>We cannot say upon the basis of our review of the testimony that the above findings and conclusions are not reasonable or that they are not supported by substantial testimony. We therefore have no authority to ignore or overrule them.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Appellant also challenges his sentence in this case upon the ground that the trial judge should have referred the ease to the Legal Psychiatric Service for presentence evaluation. We noted above that appellant was committed to St. Elizabeths Hospital for mental observation on November 21, 1967 and was reported competent to stand trial on February 20, 1968. These data were before the trial judge at the time of sentencing. During the trial, the presiding judge heard the testimony of several witnesses as to appellant\u2019s mental condition. (Tr. 123-124, 129-154, 160-171, 179-196.) Some six weeks elapsed between the finding of guilt and the imposition of sentence, during which the probation office conducted an investigation and submitted a report which was before the trial judge when sentence was imposed, and which had been \u201cgone over * * * rather carefully.\u201d (Sent. Tr. 4.) In addition, the court considered a sentencing report prepared in appellant\u2019s behalf by the Offender Rehabilitation Project (Sent. Tr. 4), and at the sentencing appellant made no request for further psychiatric examination. Upon the basis of this record we are unable and unwilling to conclude that the trial judge in any way abrogated or abused the discretion residing in him in the imposition of these sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b275-13\">BAZEL\u00d3N, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AEi\">(concurring) :</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">I agree that under our present case law the evidence in this case provided no single answer to the complex question of criminal responsibility raised by the insanity defense, and that in consequence that question had to be decided by the trier of fact.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, I join the opinion of the Court. In my view, however, our responsibility for the proper administration of the insanity defense in the District of Columbia can best be fulfilled by a somewhat fuller discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-16\">The charges in this case arose out of the armed robbery of a liquor store. Three men, including the appellant here, participated in the robbery. Two police officers observed the robbers leaving the store and gave chase; the episode ended when the robbers\u2019 automobile struck a tree and overturned. Appellant did not seek to challenge the substance of the government\u2019s version of the offense,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the facts of the robbery were stipulated. The only issue at trial was that of criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-17\">The expert testimony at trial, while sparse,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was not in substantial conflict. When appellant was four years old, his mother died. His father, who until then had been a good provider, took to drink. There was from that time no one specif - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>ic person taking care of the children: appellant was cared for in sequence by one of the several different women living with his father during the next few years. Eventually, he ran away; when he was returned, his surrogate mother beat him so badly that he was hospitalized. At this point he was made a public ward; the remainder of his childhood, he shuttled among five different foster homes and Boys\u2019 Village.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the age of 17, he was found to have been involved in a housebreaking; when he subsequently attempted to join the Army, he was rejected because of his record. Nevertheless, he made for some time a good adjustment: he took employment as a skilled laborer, and had found a girl whom he planned to marry. When their son died of meningitis at the age of four months, however, the relationship broke up.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The doctors agreed that appellant was plagued by \u201cfear without an apparent rational basis for this fear.\u201d The two psychiatrists characterized his symptoms as \u201canxiety reaction\u201d or \u201canxiety neurosis\u201d:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">[This] means a person is in a continual state of tension or anxiety. Most of the time there is no overt \u2014 there is no logical reason for the anxiety. It comes from internal conflicts, and this anxiety may express itself in many ways, at many different times, inability to hold a job, inability to stick to anything, and the degree of anxiety has to do with the degree of impairment in the individual\u2019s functioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">\u2022X- * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">Ordinarily there is no specific behavior that goes along with anxiety. A person who has anxiety either suffers it or tries some-way of getting away from it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">Appellant found a way. He had grown up and lived in an environment where drugs were readily available; and, on occasion, he had taken narcotics. After the death of his son and the breakup of his impending marriage, his anxieties became worse. But he \u201cfound something which worked very well in terms of alleviating the symptoms of anxiety, and that was taking narcotics.\u201d As Dr. Baughmann testified,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0S\">most drug addicts that I have talked to describe a good feeling, a high feeling that they get when taking the drugs. They take it because it makes them feel good, because they get kicks out of it; whereas Mr. Carter takes drugs, I believe, in order not to feel bad. He doesn\u2019t seem to be the type of individual that especially enjoys the drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6\">[D]rug addiction to Mr. Carter is like the medicine that he takes because of his anxiety reaction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agv\">[Without drugs, h]e would feel very anxious and very uncomfortable. He might even, if he took neither drugs nor got any other kind of help for his mental illness, he might even become a psychotic, schizophrenic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">At the time of the robbery, appellant\u2019s habit required some twenty capsules of heroin per day. Regarding his character structure apart from the anxiety and the addiction, the expert testimony conflicted. Both doctors agreed that appellant was brighter than normal; his I.Q. had .been measured at the hospital as being 119, and there was evidence that his performance might have been higher had not his abilities been impaired by his anxiety. According to Dr. Baugh-mann,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">Mr. Carter shows some evidence of fearfulness of people, which is often associated with a schizophrenic individual. Indeed, there is some evidence that if the anxiety became very great and he had no way of dealing with it, that he might indeed become schizophrenic, that is, become actually psychotic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">Mr. Carter has a certain weakness in his ego, that is, in his conscious control of his behavior that makes it very difficult for him to control his impulses, the impulses that come from the more primitive or animal-like part of his personality. He does, however, have a rather strong, although not particularly effective conscience. That is, his conscience may not be strong enough to keep him from doing things that he would judge he would not want to do because they would be against his moral code but he would then tend to suffer a great deal of guilt because of what he has done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">\u2022X- if * \u25a0Jfr if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">If you are asking me is he more or less able than the average person to control his impulses, he is eonsidera-bly less able than the average person to control his impulses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">In Dr. Hamman\u2019s view, however, appellant was overall a fairly well-integrated individual:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-13\">Mr. Carter\u2019s self is reasonably well intact. In fact better probably than a lot of people under stress. He had a series of unfortunate situations from about 1962 to \u201965 [the death of his son and breakup of his intended marriage] when he did not stand up as well against them as some people, yet a lot better than some of the others. I would say, in terms of ego strength, probably average and that\u2019s a very loose concept. I think it would stand up under psychiatric cross-examination for about two seconds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-14\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-q\">Well, he is less impulsive, too. He is able to plan ahead. He doesn\u2019t wait until the last minute and go off impulsively and do something. He is in better control than a lot of people on the streets. For that matter, certainly, better control than probably the average addict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-15\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-16\">Q Is this while he is under the influence or while he is not under the influence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-17\">A Well, certainly, his character structure would be the same if he were sobered up. Now, when he is in withdrawal, of course, anybody\u2019s condition in withdrawal is pretty bad but narcotics doesn\u2019t give him anything that he doesn\u2019t have. The average addict when he is under the influence of drugs is still a pretty impulsive guy because that is his basic character structure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-18\">Mr. Carter is not an impulsive neurotic ; he is a man of an anxiety reaction who has higher intelligence, less impulsive, better able to plan than the average individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Furthermore, it was agreed that appellant was under the influence of narcotics when the robbery occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">Let me point something out, too. While under the influence of drugs, by the way, and prior to withdrawal, a person\u2019s behavior controls are better than they would be when he is stone sober because drugs tend to suppress anxiety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">When questioned about the relationship between appellant\u2019s mental illness and the robbery, the psychiatrists responded with somewhat different emphasis. In Dr. Baughmann\u2019s view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">Well, to begin with, I think Mr. Carter\u2019s drug addiction is fairly directly related to his anxiety neurosis. That is, I think that he takes the drugs because they alleviate the feeling of anxiety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">Then the next step is \u2014 well, I will just describe it as I see it \u2014 that is, Mr. Carter has, by virtue of taking narcotics to alleviate his anxiety, become addicted to narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">Now, this means that if he doesn\u2019t get some narcotics every six to 12 hours, he feels extremely bad and has pain, suffering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">I think that Mr. Carter stated very clearly and I have no reason to doubt that the reason he robbed the liquor store was to get money in order to buy narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\">It is not specific that he had to rob a liquor store to get the narcotics but he knew, with his educational background, he would need to get the money from somewhere and this was the place where he got the money for his narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-11\">* * \u2022* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">Q Would he commit the crime of robbery if he were not addicted ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-13\">A I would doubt it. I would see no other motive in his character which would specifically lead him to commit robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-14\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-15\">In my opinion, the relationship would be essentially the same * * * whether he was actually in withdrawal or whether he was two or three hours away from being in withdrawal, his motives would be the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-17\">Dr. Hamman, on the other hand, although describing a similar process expressed far less certainty about the several elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-18\">Mr. Carter has been taking drugs since 1963. Mr. Carter has had an anxiety reaction which, obviously, because of the nature of the disease goes back to adolescence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-19\">Now, if Mr. Carter had not had an anxiety reaction, would he have taken drugs ? I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-20\">A lot of people without anxiety reaction takes drugs. And he grew up in an environment where drugs were available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-21\">Nonetheless, the anxiety reaction\u2014 the anxiety was subdued initially by drugs. Of course, the evil of drug addiction is that after a while the drugs can no longer serve this effect and, of course, it has to go out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-22\">Mr. Carter supported his drug addiction habit by stealing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-23\">Now, as I say, although he did not necessarily start taking drugs initially because of the anxiety, they did give him some relief initially.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-24\">Once he becomes addicted, he is aware that if he does not have drugs, he will go into withdrawal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-25\">Now, in my opinion, in the hypothetical type of situation, if a man is on the verge of going into withdrawal, I think he has almost an irresistable impulse to get drugs, to do anything to get drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-27\">Mr. Carter, at the time of this offense, was not in withdrawal symptoms. He knew that he would get them eventually, just like you and I know that if we don\u2019t eat, after a while we start to starve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>They were driving by this liquor store \u2014 this is based on Mr. Carter\u2019s testimony \u2014 they went in initially to buy some liquor and then one of them said, \u201cWe had just as well rob this place because we are going to have some money later anyway.\u201d So, they robbed it and left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">Now, as I see this, certainly they were robbing this place to get money to buy drugs but this was a robbery of convenience. They had just as well do it now. It showed a certain amount of foresight, planning. They did not do it under the stress of the moment; it was not an irresistable means [sic] at this point to rob the store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">So, again, I think the causal relationship is extremely tenuous. It\u2019s there but it is very tenuous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">-X- *****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">Q [Y]ou do agree that Elroy Carter took drugs to relieve pain ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-19\">A I think he did after he started using them. I don\u2019t know why he started using them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-21\">Under our law, once a defendant has introduced some evidence that he was suffering from mental illness at the time of the offense, he must be acquitted unless the government can show beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense was not a product of a mental disease or defect.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In this case, the trial court sitting without a jury made specific findings of fact<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and rejected three theories whereby it could be said that the crime in this case was the product of appellant\u2019s mental illness. I cannot say that, under present case law, this resolution was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-22\"><em>First. </em>The evidence was uncontradicted that appellant was, at the time of the robbery, suffering from a mental illness, and the trial court so found.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>rejected, however, any suggestion that the robbery came as a direct response to the tensions with which appellant was plagued. In fact, the record contains little evidence to support such a theory. Dr. Williams, the psychologist, did testify that appellant \u201ccould not cope\u201d with the tensions within him and that, as they built up, he \u201cwould then act out\u201d; but no effort was made to follow up this line of inquiry, and the record is bare of any indication how appellant\u2019s participation in the robbery might be regarded as the acting out of internal tensions. On the other hand, both psychiatrists indicated a view of appellant\u2019s personality inconsistent with any direct causal connection between his illness and the robbery. Dr. Baughmann testified that appellant\u2019s illness would not lead to any specific behavior pattern: he would \u201ceither suffer * * * it or tr[y] some way of getting away from it\u201d; and that in his view, appellant\u2019s \u201cway of getting away from it\u201d was the taking of drugs as medicine to relieve his pain. Dr. Hamman, when questioned about the relationship of appellant\u2019s illness to his behavior, mentioned only his addiction. Furthermore, the only symptoms of appellant\u2019s illness discussed by the psychiatrists were internal tensions which, they agreed, were substantially reduced or eliminated by his self-administered \u201cmedicine\u201d of narcotics; and appellant\u2019s own theory of the case was that he was under the influence of drugs at the time the robbery\"was perpetrated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, Dr. Hamman several times characterized appellant\u2019s illness as \u201cmoderate,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which would indicate that it did not so dominate appellant\u2019s personality as to compel a finding of productivity from the very fact of the existence of the illness.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In light of this testimony, I cannot say that the trial court improperly concluded that the crime was not a direct response to the anxieties from which appellant suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\"><em>Second. </em>The trial court found that appellant was addicted to narcotics. Furthermore, the psychiatrists appeared to agree that, had appellant been on the verge of withdrawal at the time of the offense, he would have had in Dr. Ham-man\u2019s words \u201can almost irresistable impulse to get drugs, to do anything to get drugs.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But appellant was several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>hours away from withdrawal when the robbery was committed. In Dr. Baugh-mann\u2019s view, this made no difference: \u201cwhether he was actually in withdrawal or whether he was two or three hours away from being in withdrawal, his motives would be the same.\u201d Dr. Hamman, however, felt that this made a substantial difference. \u201cHe knew that he would get [withdrawal] symptoms eventually, just like you and I know that if we don\u2019t eat, after a while we start to starve. * * * certainly they were robbing this place to get money to buy drugs but this was a robbery of convenience. They had just as well do it now. * * * They did not do it under the stress of the moment; it was not an irresistable means [sic] at this point to rob the store.\u201d Furthermore, he testified, while appellant was under the influence of narcotics his \u201cbehavior controls are better than they would be when he is stone sober.\u201d Basing his conclusion primarily upon Dr. Hamman\u2019s testimony in this regard, the trial court concluded that \u201cthe drug addiction as such * * * was not so closely related to the perpetration of the crime as to be a factor in that this man at the time of the perpetration was in control of his faculties. * * * \u201d \u201c[T]here was no compulsive or impulsive situation which caused him to do the acts which constitute the crime. He was able to plan and to execute it, and he was able to refrain.\u201d I do not find this conclusion compelled by the present record, but neither do I find it barred under our present case law. Accordingly, it may not be disturbed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\"><em>Third. </em>The psychiatric testimony indicated, and the trial court so found, that narcotics served appellant as medicine for his anxieties.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The primary thrust of his attempt at trial to avoid criminal responsibility for the robbery was a chain of causation that led from his illness through his addiction to the robbery. This argument, however, was rejected as \u201ctoo tenuous\u201d by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Certainly there is substantial truth in appellant\u2019s theory. Despite Dr. Ham-man\u2019s speculations that appellant might have become addicted for other reasons if he had not become addicted because of his illness, the fact remains that uncontradicted testimony established the link between appellant\u2019s illness and his addiction. And given appellant\u2019s addiction, it is difficult indeed to see how it could be supported other than through criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Yet our decisions have made clear that the question of criminal responsibility may not be answered by a simple logical leap, no matter how compelling.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As was said in King v. United States,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cThe question for the jury requires the application to medical knowledge * * of the understanding and judgment of the community as reflected in the jury.\u201d The same must be true of a district judge when he sits as trier of fact; in such cases he serves as the repository of community values as well.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the present case, the trial court found that appellant at the time of the offense had that capability for choice which is a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>requisite for blameworthiness. I cannot say that, in so doing, the trial court either misapplied the law or departed from community standards to such an extent that reversal would be warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">It is nevertheless difficult indeed to look at this record arid believe that, in any real sense, appellant could have acted otherwise than he did. Of course he could have robbed another store \u2014 or a man on the street. He could have turned to pimping, or become a pusher; perhaps, with his intelligence, he could have been a successful confidence man. But his addiction alone would require $10,000 to $15,000 a year to support;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the likelihood that appellant could earn this money \u2014 to say nothing of money for food and clothing \u2014 at any honest trade strikes me as vanishingly small.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">If we are to assign criminal responsibility by drawing a line between those who can, and those who cannot exercise meaningful choice in their behavior, surely we mean something other than a mere choice between equally criminal alternatives. In the present case, we cannot even salve our consciences by the fiction of the voluntary addict: for appellant\u2019s addiction, on the evidence, stemmed from his need for \u201cmedicine\u201d to alleviate the pain of his mental illness.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It may well be that we simply lack the resources \u2014 to say nothing of the understanding \u2014 that would be required if those who stole to feed their addiction were removed from the criminal process on the ground that they are not responsible for their actions. But if this is so, we should recognize the fact, and not rationalize our treatment of narcotics addicts on the false premise that their crimes are the result of a wrongful exercise of free will. It is to me intolerable that persons already crippled by an almost hopeless cycle of poverty, ignorance, and drugs should be further burdened by the moral stigma of guilt, <em>not </em>because they are blameworthy, but merely because we cannot afford to treat them as if they are not. If we are to maintain the insanity defense as a device for allocating criminal responsibility,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we should live up to its terms. If we can not do so, we should not pretend that we can.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">I cannot pretend to have found a satisfactory solution even to that minuscule portion of our problems that can be affected by the criminal process. But I have no difficulty in concluding that the present system is unsatisfactory. I doubt that we have either enough jails or enough hospitals to hold this city\u2019s estimated 6,000 to 30,000 addicts.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Even if we did, I question whether we have enough knowledge to do anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>for them.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Even if we could, we would still have to deal with the scores of new addicts that come with every new day. But I do know that our problems are not solved by sweeping them under the rug of a doctrine that saves our face by hiding our troubles. If they are to be solved at all, they must first be brought into the open for confrontation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\">. Adams v.

I cannot commend this procedure too highly. In cases tried to a jury, of course, points of law may be preserved and examined by an examination of the instructions given the jury.

It may well be that, regardless of the instructions juries are given, as a matter of fact they will acquit a defendant on grounds of insanity only if they are convinced that it would be unjust to treat him as a criminal.
