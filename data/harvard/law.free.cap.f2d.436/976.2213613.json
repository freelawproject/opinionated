Gen. and Edward E. Collister, Jr., Asst. Atty.

It is apparent from the record that Leigh is confined in the Kansas State Penitentiary and we have accordingly substituted the warden thereof as the proper respondent-appellee. An examination of the file and records in this cause prompts the conclusion that the questions presented have been correctly determined by the district court and that they are so unsubstantial as not to warrant further argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">Accordingly, the motion of appellee is granted and the judgment of the District Court is affirmed for the reasons stated in the Memorandum and Order of the district court, 321 F.Supp. 195 (D. Kan., 1970).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
