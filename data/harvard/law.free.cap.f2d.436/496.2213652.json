Appellants provoked an interference between their parent application and a patent to Kimberlin et al. by copying the following claims from the patent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-17\">1. A process for upgrading hydrocarbons which comprises contacting a hydroearbonaceous fluid in a conversion zone at elevated temperatures with a crystalline metallic alumino-silicate catalyst having uniform pore openings between about 6 and about 15 Angstrom units, said material being the sole conversion catalyst in said zone and recovering an upgraded hydrocarbon product having a molecular weight no higher than said first named hydroearbonaceous fluid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-18\">2. The process of claim 1 wherein said catalyst comprises a member of the alkaline earth group.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-19\">These became the two counts of the interference and reveal the nature of the invention there involved. Catalysts such as those recited in the claims are called molecular filters or sieves.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-20\">During the motion period appellants moved to substitute a count under Rule 231(a) (2), which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-21\">(a) Within the period set in the notice of interference for filing motions any party to an interference may file a motion seeking:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap7l\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-22\">(2) To amend the issue by addition or substitution of new counts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-23\">The proposed substitute count would have changed count 1, supra, solely by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>amending the lower limit of the pore size from \u201cabout 6\u201d to \u201cabout 5\u201d Angstrom units and the upper limit from \u201cabout 15\u201d to \u201cabout 13\u201d Angstrom units.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In support of their motion to substitute, appellants filed a brief stating that the proposed count was necessary to permit them to establish their best date of priority, and referring to the Commissioner\u2019s Notice of April 5, 1954 (681 O.G. 864). This notice stated that in some cases the disclosure in an application, \u201calthough for the same invention in fact as the patent claim, is somewhat broader than the claim of the patent.\u201d In such cases, the notice said, an applicant may be permitted to substitute a count wherein language based upon his slightly broader disclosure replaces the corresponding limitation in the patent claim, if he \u201cmakes a satisfactory showing, as by demonstrating that his best evidence lies outside the exact limit of the patent claim.\u201d In re-declaring an interference in such cases, \u201cit should be indicated that the claim in the patent corresponds substantially to the [substituted] interference count.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">The examiner denied the motion, for reasons which are entirely unclear. He first stated that the 6-15 Angstrom sieve was usable to treat a broad range of hydrocarbons, including straight and branched chain paraffins and olefins, acyclics and ring hydrocarbons, whereas the 5 Angstrom sieve was capable of treating only straight-chain paraffins and olefins. He concluded that the substitute count would somehow \u201climit\u201d the Kimberlin claims \u201cto the latter group of hydrocarbons and it is not within the jurisdiction of this Office to do so.\u201d He further concluded that \u201cthe utility of the 5 Angstrom sieve is to a separate invention,\u201d and that appellants would have an opportunity to establish their earliest dates in another interference then pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Whatever the soundness of the examiner\u2019s reasons for denying the motion to substitute, the important thing to note is that it was in fact denied, and the denial was unappealable (see Rule 244 (d)). It does not appear that appellants petitioned the Commissioner to reverse the examiner\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Appellants proceeded through the interference on the original counts set forth above. Kimberlin stood on his filing date. The board held that appellants had failed to prove that they had invented the subject matter of the counts earlier than Kimberlin\u2019s filing date, and awarded priority to Kimberlin. On appeal to this court, we affirmed. Frilette v. Kimberlin, 412 F.2d 1390, 56 CCPA 1242 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Appellants then filed the divisional application which is now before us. We find claim 1 to be suitable for developing the issues here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">A process for upgrading hydrocarbons which comprises contacting a hy-drocarbonaceous fluid in a conversion zone at elevated temperatures with a crystalline metallic aluminosilicate having uniform pore openings between about 5 and about 13 Angstrom units, said material being the sole conversion catalyst in said zone, and recovering an upgraded hydrocarbon product having a molecular weight no higher than said first-named hydrocarbonaceous fluid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">It will be noted that this claim is the very one appellants sought to substitute for count 1 of the interference. It differs from count 1, set out supra, only in that the pore-size range is here recited as about 5-13 Angstroms, as against about 6-15 Angstroms in the count. The issues developed below revolved around the change in recitation of the pore-size range.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">a. <em>The Rejection on the Kimberlin Patent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">The examiner rejected all the claims here on appeal \u201cunder 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Kimberlin et al.\u201d Appellants conceded the pertinence of the Kimberlin teaching, but sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>antedate Kimberlin by a Rule 131 affidavit. The board, in affirming the rejection, declined to consider the affidavit insofar as it pertained to pore sizes between 6 and 13 Angstroms. The board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">We will also keep in mind the circumstance that affidavit evidence directed to subject matter embraced by the counts in the aforementioned interference is not here available to appellants, since such evidence should have been presented during the interference proceedings. Thus, for appellants to prevail, we must find that their affidavit contains sufficient evidence to support the allowance of the claims here on appeal, <em>wpart from any evidence directed to the subject matter of the interfering counts. </em>[Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">This holding was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The Kimberlin patent is being used under \u00a7 103 as a prior art reference of the type described in \u00a7 102 (e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An applicant may remove such a reference, i. e., show that it is not \u201cprior\u201d art, by showing that he made the claimed invention before the patentee\u2019s filing date. In the present case, appellants rightly contend that they had no opportunity to do so in the interference proceeding, since the Patent Office would not permit a claim of the present scope to be substituted in the interference. Accordingly, the interference decision is of no relevance to the rejection on the Kimberlin patent, and the patent should be treated as any other patent used as a \u00a7 102(e) reference. Appellants\u2019 loss of priority in the interference was not based on their failure to show broad conception of subject matter within the overlapping range of 6-13 Angstroms, but on their failure to show reduction to practice or diligence as to the subject matter of count 1. See Frilette v. Kimberlin, supra, 412 F.2d at 1396, 56 CCPA at 1250. It is apparent that evidence of appellants\u2019 work with 5 Angstrom sieves, while not relevant with respect to the invention of the interference count, would be relevant evidence of reduction to practice or diligence with respect to the invention now claimed. We must therefore conclude that the fact that appellants suffered an adverse award of priority (a \u00a7 102(g) issue), as to an invention which the Patent Office determined was not \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as that now claimed, is of no relevance in determining whether they made the invention now claimed before the Kimberlin filing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">b. <em>The Rejection on the Interference Counts</em></p>\n<p id=\"Adn\">The board also affirmed the examiner\u2019s rejection of certain claims, including claim 1, as <em>unpatentable over the interference counts, </em>under \u00a7 103. The board said: \u201cWe find no patentable distinction between the claims and the counts.\u201d Appellants complain bitterly that in so holding the \u201cBoard of Appeals has, in effect, reconsidered the Examiner\u2019s decision on the motion and has reversed it.\u201d They further state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANL\">In essence, what the Board of Appeals is doing is to say that the Examiner was wrong in denying the Motion to Substitute thereby precluding appellants from showing their best date but that this denial, although regrettable, is not binding on the Board of Appeals. Clearly, such a position runs afoul of common principles of equity and justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">The solicitor counters this as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-11\">There is a certain finality to such a termination of an interference and it is incredible that appellants could believe that they are entitled to a patent which <em>embraces the same subject </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number><em>matter </em>as the established <em>prior </em>art. * * * In fact, neither appellants, the Board of Appeals, nor the examiner believes that there is any <em>patentable distinction </em>between a catalyst pore size of 5-13 Angstroms as claimed by appellants and 6-15 Angstroms as claimed by Kimberlin. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">We agree with appellants that the board erred in affirming this rejection. We find, however, that appellants, the board and the solicitor have each failed to perceive the precise nature of a Patent Office interference, and have failed to perceive the effects of a decision in such a proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">From the excerpts we have set forth from the Commissioner\u2019s Notice of April 5, 1954, it is clear that at the time in question an interference would not be declared merely on the ground that an applicant and a patentee were claiming inventions which were each obvious in view of the other\u2019s disclosure under \u00a7 103. The claims had to be \u201csubstantially the same invention.\u201d Certain \u201cimmaterial\u201d limitations could be omitted in copying claims from a patent, but the tests for materiality were not necessarily the same tests used in judging obviousness. Thus, we disagree with appellants\u2019 contention that the examiner\u2019s ruling on the motion, and the board\u2019s conclusion here, are necessarily inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">We also disagree with the solicitor\u2019s position as set forth above, which states that the present claims, to be allowable, must be patentably distinct (\u00a7 103) from the interference counts. If it is true that the public should not be doubly burdened with overlapping patent claims in this case,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it is manifest from the language of \u00a7 102(g) and \u00a7 103 that the single valid patent should go to whomever was first to make his respective invention. The interference decision in this case does not tell us that. The fallacy in the solicitor\u2019s position is in referring to Kimberlin\u2019s act of inventing (\u00a7 102(g)) the subject matter of his claims as \u201cprior art.\u201d It may be \u201cart,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but from the interference decision we do not know if it was \u201cprior\u201d to appellants\u2019 act of inventing the subject matter of the claims now on appeal. Appellants now seek to show by affidavit that Kim-berlin\u2019s act of inventing was not prior to theirs, a showing which they were prevented from making in the interference. They must be permitted to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">Our conclusions are in harmony with previous case holdings. In In re Risse, 378 F.2d 948, 54 CCPA 1495 (1967), we held that the losing party to an interference was estopped <em>ex parte </em>from presenting a claim which could have been made a count of the interference. To the same effect, see In re Kyrides, 159 F.2d 1019, 34 CCPA 920 (1941). That is clearly not the situation here, since appellant tried to get claim 1 into the interference and was prevented by the examiner from doing so. We also note that there was no attempt in <em>Risse </em>to antedate <em>ex parte </em>the invention date established by the adverse party to the interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">In Ex parte Des Rosiers, 17 USPQ 272 (P.O.Bd.App.1933), the appellant was permitted to swear behind a patent and thereby remove it as a reference against claims which were broader in some respects than the counts which had been lost by the appellant in an interference with the patentee. The board noted that the claims had been present in the appellant\u2019s case at the time of the interference and that the patentee had made no attempt to file a reissue application containing claims of that scope. The board held that the appellant was not estopped by the interference, since his adversary was on notice of what the appellant was claiming and made no effort to stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>him. We think the present case presents an <em>a fortiori </em>situation as compared with <em>Des Rosiers, </em>for here not only did Kimberlin fail to provoke an interference on the claims now before us, but resisted appellants\u2019 attempt to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">We appreciate and commend the desire of the Patent Office to prevent the issuance of two patents where, at least in its view, only one can be valid. However, the limited scope of a Patent Office interference prevents the Office from logically using the result of such a proceeding against an applicant in a situation such as the present case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">c. <em>Sufficiency of the Affidavit in Other Respects</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Quite apart from the issues thus far discussed, the board found that certain limitations in various claims were not met by the facts shown in the affidavit. Most of these objections were removed from our consideration by appellants\u2019 limiting their appeal to claims 1, 2, 12, 13, 20-22 and 24. The board\u2019s criticisms still remaining for consideration pertain to the following limitations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANj\">The major portion of the cation content of the aluminosilicate being supplied by a cation other than sodium. (Claims 20-22)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">The aluminosilicate being substantially free of exchangeable sodium. (Claim 24)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Appellants contend that these limitations are inherently shown in the affidavit, since it shows the use of a catalyst known commercially as \u201cMolecular Sieve 5A,\u201d manufactured by Linde Air Products. We agree with appellants\u2019 position. Their specification clearly states that the \u201cMolecular Sieve 5A\u201d is a \u201ccrystalline aluminosilicate salt * * * in which substantially all of the 12 ions of sodium [in the 4A sieve] are replaced by calcium.\u201d This has never been questioned at any stage of the proceedings. The documentation submitted with appellants\u2019 affidavit verifies that the 5A sieve used by appellants was a calcium-containing material.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">\n<em>Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">Since we have found that the board\u2019s bases for affirming the rejections of the claims on appeal were unsound, its decision as to those claims is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-13\">.
