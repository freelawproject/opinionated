Federal agents entered the apartment of Vargas through an open door, announcing an arrest of an associate (who later pleaded guilty). After entry a search followed the arrest, which uncovered heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-16\">In our view, the thrust of Section 3109 (a request to permit entry) is aimed at the closed or locked door. Here we think the advance announcement of the officers\u2019 identity and statement of purpose was sufficient. A significant factor here was the immediate presence of Vargas and his friend (about to be arrested) right inside the door. It was not a case of officers sneaking in and going prowling.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
