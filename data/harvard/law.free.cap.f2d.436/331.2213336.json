Thomas E. Fairchild, Circuit Judge, has disqualified himself, noting that he was a member of the three-judge court which decided Groppi v. Froehlich, 311 F.Supp. 765 (W.D.Wis.1970), a closely related case arising out of the same <em>events as </em>Groppi v. Leslie, 311 F.Supp. 772 (W.D. Wis.1970), and heard at the same time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>PELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">This matter being before the court <em>en banc </em>following reargument pursuant to the granting of Groppi\u2019s petition for rehearing, we are not persuaded that the result, and reasoning in support thereof, reached by the panel originally hearing this appeal, as set forth in the court\u2019s decision of October 28, 1970, is other than correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The basic and simple issue remains whether the judicial power of summary punishment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for direct contempt is constitutionally exercisable by the legislative branch. We hold that it is for the reasons advanced in the original opinion of this court, which opinion we now adopt and confirm. Groppi v. Leslie, 436 F.2d 326 (7th Cir. October 28, 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">While the resolution adopted by the Wisconsin Assembly might well have spelled out the alleged misconduct of Groppi with greater particularity, it nevertheless is couched in terms of ultimate fact which we do not find lacking in adequate specificity. There is no indication to us that the contemnor failed to be fully and explicitly informed of the charge leveled against him and the exact nature of his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Our decision is reached on the narrow issue before us, involving direct interference with \u201cconducting public business\u201d in \u201cthe immediate view of the legislative body.\u201d We do not purport to reach any decision on the matter of contemptuous behavior occurring outside the legislative chamber itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Other means for punishing contempts are available to the legislature and resort to such other procedures may be found sufficiently efficacious in the future. We here hold, however, that the basic public need for inviolability of the legislative processes of our government dictates the availability of the power of summary contempt punishment to the legislative branch. The Wisconsin legislature has seen fit in the circumstances of the case before it to exercise that power and we do not deem it in the public interest to interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">It is to be noted that Groppi\u2019s term of imprisonment under the resolution does not extend beyond the end of the legislative term, i. e., January 7,1971. Both petitioner\u2019s and respondent's counsel have argued that the issue here involved is not mooted by this fact. This is our opinion also. See United States ex rel. Lawrence v. Woods, 432 F.2d 1073, 1074-1075 (7th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">STEVENS, Circuit Judge, with whom SWYGERT, Chief Judge, and KILEY, Circuit Judge, join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">At no time in this proceeding has petitioner asserted any claim of innocence, or any claim that his sentence was excessive. It may be assumed, as the Wisconsin Supreme Court plainly stated, that any such claim would have been promptly and fairly heard in some form of post conviction trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the disposition of an isolated controversy, therefore, no one could criticize this court\u2019s judgment as unfair or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">The case, however, must be decided in the context of our legal traditions. It raises only a procedural issue, but in my judgment that issue is of fundamental importance and requires that petitioner\u2019s conviction be set aside. <em>Cf. </em>Rex v. Justices of Bodmin [1947] 1 K.B. 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution limits the procedures which a state may employ prior to the imprisonment of any person. The applicable clause states: \u201c* * nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d One of the oldest and most consistently accepted maxims in our legal tradition is the proposition that \u201cno man shall be punished before he has had an opportunity of being heard.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>King v. Benn and Church, 6 T.R. 198 (1795) (Lord Kenyon, Ch. J.); see United States v. Galante, 298 F.2d 72, 77 (2d Cir. 1962) (Friendly, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The procedure which Wisconsin employed to deprive the petitioner of. his liberty violated that ancient maxim. Oh October 1, 1969, without any prior notice to petitioner, and without giving him or his counsel an opportunity to be present or to be heard, the Wisconsin Assembly cited him for contempt, found him guilty of an offense which had been committed two days earlier, and sen-teneed him to imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although I recognize that the due process clause tolerates flexible procedures in varying situations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in my opinion the label \u201clegislative contempt\u201d does not exclude this <em>ex parte </em>conviction from the coverage of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-17\">Disorderly conduct on the floor of a legislative body is a well recognized species of legislative contempt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Historically acts of violence,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> like other legislative contempts such as attempted bribery,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> refusal to answer questions or produce documents before a legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>committee,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the destruction of subpoenaed documents,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> have been prosecuted by the Legislature itself. In such cases the accused has been brought before the bar of the House and given an opportunity to speak in his own defense before any punishment was imposed. As this type of proceeding was no doubt somewhat cumbersome, and since the duration of any imprisonment was limited to the remainder of the legislative session, Congress long ago provided for the prosecution of contempts in judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Apparently Congress never considered the possibility of avoiding the inconvenience of a prolonged legislative hearing by simply eliminating the accused\u2019s traditional opportunity to be heard in his own defense.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Prior to October 1, 1969, no American legislature had found it necessary to employ <em>ex parte </em>procedures to punish disorderly or other contemptuous conduct. The fact that the exercise of summary contempt powers has been accepted as a necessary and appropriate aspect of our judicial processes does not support an argument that the Wisconsin Legislature needs or possesses like powers. Indeed, a comparison of the legislative and judicial experience with contempts leads to a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">It is the business of judges to decide particular cases, to make determinations of guilt or innocence, to listen to argu ments in mitigation, and to impose appropriate punishments. Although occasional abuses have required correction on review, by and large the judicial contempt power has proved useful in advancing the orderly disposition of litigation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The conclusion that judges can safely be trusted with such powers is supported by analysis of the judicial function and by years of experience. The multitude of judicial contempt cases which have been decided in our history apparently include none in which a judge, two days after the offense, without giving the contemnor notice or any opportunity to be heard, entered an <em>ex parte </em>order sentencing him to prison.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>But that is the nature of the procedure employed by the Wisconsin Assembly in this case. This departure from tradition should itself point to the danger of entrusting summary contempt powers to bodies not accustomed to their exercise. The contempt power has been described as \u201cperhaps, nearest akin to despotic power of any power existing under our form of government.\u201d State ex rel. Attorney General v. Circuit Court, 97 Wis. 1, 8, 72 N.W. 193, 194 (1897), and its exercise has been narrowly limited.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Without reflecting adversely on the importance and dignity of the legislative function, it must be recognized that legislators are more responsive to the temporary moods of the body politic than are judges.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, history\u2019s recognition of a frequent need for summary punishment of judicial contempts does not establish a need for co-extensive legislative contempt powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">It is argued that there was no risk of error or abuse in this case because petitioner\u2019s disorderly conduct occurred \u201cin the immediate view of\u201d the Wisconsin Assembly. It is contended that no purpose could have been served by hearing from petitioner or his counsel because the Assembly already knew all the facts. This may or may not be true. It is entirely possible that conduct which certain legislators found particularly offensive was committed by other members of the \u201cgathering of people\u201d led by petitioner;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> it is possible that some legislators were particularly offended by insulting speech (perhaps even speech on other occasions)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> rather than conduct; and that certain conduct was viewed by some legislators but not by others. Even if each member of the Assembly who voted in favor of the resolution had perfect knowledge of the facts, a valid purpose would have been served by hearing from petitioner before voting on the resolution. It is presumed that argument may persuade judges even when they know the facts.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> I would give legislators the benefit of the same presumption.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">It is suggested that even if summary legislative contempt powers have been unnecessary historically, the modern day \u201cpolities of confrontation\u201d have created a new necessity that requires abandon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>ment of traditional procedures. I question the validity of the argument, even if limited in application to plenary sessions of state legislative bodies, for prompt police action is probably an adequate means of terminating disorder and enabling the legislative body to resume its work. If the argument of necessity were valid, it would prove too much. Confrontations occur in legislative committee hearings, union meetings, stockholders meetings, public parks, college campuses, and the streets. Violent, disorderly conduct in all these settings should be firmly and promptly punished. I am not convinced that the effective administration of justice will be enhanced by using <em>ex parte </em>procedures to deal with any of these situations, or by providing an unusual protective procedure available only to legislative assemblies.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">If punishment is to serve as an effective deterrent to repeated or widespread disorder, it is important that the community at large have confidence in the fairness of the proceedings which lead to conviction and sentencing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">\u201cAt the foundation of our civil liberty lies the principle which denies to government officials an exceptional position before the law and which subjects them to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen. And in the development of our liberty insistence upon procedural regularity has been a large factor. Respect for law will not be advanced by resort, in its enforcement, to means which shock the common man\u2019s sense of decency and fair play.\u201d Burdeau v. McDowell, 256 U.S. 465, 477, 41 S.Ct. 574, 576, 65 L.Ed. 1048 (1921) (Brandeis J. dissenting).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In my opinion the preservation of order in our communities will be best ensured by adherence to established and respected procedures. Resort to procedural expediency may facilitate an occasional conviction, but it may also make martyrs of common criminals.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b404-16\">.

That legislative finding not only deprived petitioner of his liberty; it also had a material impact on his procedural rights. Even assuming the availability of a post conviction remedy in which petitioner could have presented evidence or argument denying the rather vague charge in the resolution, the legislative finding eliminated his presumption of innocence and shifted the burden of proof. It would have been necessary for him to go forward with the task of proving a negative before he heard the evidence against him. As a practical matter the valu\u00e9 of his privilege against self-incrimination and of his right to be confronted with the .witnesses against him would have been debased, if not destroyed entirely. .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\">. \u201cExpressing as it does in its ultimate analysis respect enforced by law for that feeling of just treatment which has been evolved through centuries of Anglo-American constitutional history and civilization, \u2018due process\u2019 cannot be imprisoned within the treacherous limits of any formula. Representing a profound attitude of fairness between man and man, and more particularly between the individual and government, \u2018due process\u2019 is compounded of history, reason, the past \u2022 course of decisions, and stout confidence in the strength of the democratic faith which we profess.\u201d Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v.

Perhaps the most famous instance of violence directed against a member of Congress occurred in 1856. Brooks, a member of the House of Representatives from South Carolina, who was offended by a speech, attacked Senator Charles Sumner in the Senate Chambers after adjournment, and beat him with a cane inflicting serious injuries. The Senate determined that the matter properly should be punished by the House, and a hearing was conducted by a Committee of the House which afforded Brooks the opportunity to appear and contest the evidence against him.

In that case, however, the Court expressly reserved decision on the question whether a circuit court would have had the power on \u201ca subsequent day\u201d to proceed to order the arrest and imprisonment of the contemnor \u201cwithout first causing him to be brought into its presence, or without making reasonable efforts by rule or attachment to bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>him into court, and giving him an opportunity to be heard before being fined and imprisoned, * * 128 U.S. at 314, 9 S.Ct. at 83.

In Anderson v.

This rule is implicit in Ex parte Terry, 128 U.S. 289, 305, 9 S.Ct. 77, 32 L.Ed. 405 (1888) ; and is stated in Tauber v. Gordon, 350 F.2d 843 (3rd Cir. 1965); Parmelee Transportation Co. v. Keeshin, 294 F.2d 310 (7th Cir. 1961); and Hallinan v. United States, 182 F.2d 880 (9th Cir. 1950). In Great Lakes Screw Corp. v.

Respondent-appellant\u2019s brief concedes that legislative exercise of its summary contempt power parallels judicial exercise of that power, and I see no reason why the legislature should not be similarly required to state facts constituting the contempt. this</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\">Here the contempt resolution states that \u201cGroppi led a gathering of people * * * which by its presence on the floor of the Assembly during a meeting * * * prevented the Assembly from conducting public business and performing its constitutional duty\u201d and that the \u201cabove-cited action\u201d constituted \u201cdisorderly conduct in the immediate view\u201d of the Assembly, an offense under Sec. 13.-26(1) (b) Wis.Stat. and Art. IV, See. 8 of the Wisconsin Constitution. According to the Resolution, anyone \u2014 however innocently \u2014 who leads a \u201cgathering of people\u201d on the Assembly floor is ipso facto guilty of contempt. There is no statement, for example, of what activities Groppi or the \u201cgathering\u201d engaged in, how they obtained admission to the floor of the Assembly, or how the Assembly was prevented from performing its constitutional functions. All of this is left to the speculation of the reviewing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">A complaint for disorderly conduct drawn in words similar to the Resolution before us would not support a conviction.
