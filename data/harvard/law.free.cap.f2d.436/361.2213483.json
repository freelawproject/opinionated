Metcalf is a prisoner of the State of Illinois and is presently incarcerated in the Illinois State Penitentiary, Joliet-Stateville Branch. He has acted <em>pro se </em>throughout these proceedings and on this appeal. He was granted leave to proceed in forma pau-peris in the district court and has attempted to bring an action under the Federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-24\">On July 1, 1969, he filed a pleading in the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the nature of a complaint entitled \u201cPetition For Three Judge Court Injunction\u201d. In broad con-clusionary terms he alleged that he was subject to solitary confinement solely because of his religion and race. He sought to enjoin defendants <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from confining him in the segregation unit of the state penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-25\">He further alleged in conclusionary terms that the Illinois enabling statute, Ill.Rev.Stat.1967, Ch. 108, \u00a7 10,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> delegat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>ing to the Department of Public Safety <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the authority to make and enforce general rules, regulations and orders for the government and discipline of the penitentiary, although not unconstitutional on its face, was unconstitutional as applied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Plaintiff requested the district court to convene a three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2281,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to determine the merits of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">On August 19, 1969, in a memorandum opinion, the district court denied the request for a three-judge court for the reason that it found the claim of unconstitutional application of the enabling statute, <em>supra, </em>to be <em>clearly without merit. </em>The trial court went on to consider the substance of the claim of racial and religious discrimination and found it to be wholly conelusionary and without support in the documentary correspondence submitted. Finding that plaintiff was entitled to no relief, the court dismissed the complaint. Plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The sole question before us on this appeal is whether the district court erred in denying plaintiff\u2019s request for a three-judge district court. Plaintiff seeks a remand for the convening of such a court. There are a number of reasons why plaintiff\u2019s appeal must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">One of the prerequisites of \u00a7 2281, <em>supra, </em>requiring the convening of a three-judge district court is that a substantial federal constitutional question must be presented. The district court found and held the claim of unconstitutional application of the subject enabling statute to be \u201cclearly without merit.\u201d The Supreme Court has held that essential to the jurisdiction of a three-judge court is the question of its jurisdiction; that essential to jurisdiction is a substantial claim . of federal unconstitutionality; and that three judges are not required to pass upon this initial question. Ex parte Poresky, 290 U.S. 30, 31-32, 54 S.Ct. 3, 78 L.Ed. 152 (1933). The Court further held that the constitutional question may be plainly unsubstantial if it is \u201cobviously without merit.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>In order to state a cause of action under the Federal Civil Rights Act a complaint must set forth more than bare unsupported conclusionary allegations in support of constitutional deprivation. Ortega v. Ragen, 7 Cir., 216 F.2d 561, 563 (1954). In liberally construing a <em>pro se </em>pleading, as we do here, we conclude the district court was correct in finding that the complaint failed to state a cause of action. In so failing, plaintiff failed to present a substantial constitutional question. As Judge Kiley stated in an analogous situation: \u201cIt follows that * * * the district court did not err in refusing the request for a three-judge court * * Brown v. Dunne, 7 Cir., 409 F.2d 341, 344 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">All parties agree that the instant enabling statute is constitutional on its face and thus properly vests control of the management of state penitentiaries in a state agency (State Department of Public Safety) with wide discretion to safeguard and discipline prisoners. See Cooper v. Pate, 7 Cir., 382 F.2d 518, 521 (1967). Here the specific challenge to the enabling statute is in reality to the alleged unconstitutional conduct of the prison officials in ordering plaintiff held in solitary confinement. Section 2281, <em>supra,, </em>is not \u201ca measure of broad social policy to be construed with great liberality, but as an enactment technical in the strict sense of the term and to be applied as such. * * * But an attack on lawless exercise of authority in a particular case is not an attack upon the constitutionality of a statute conferring the authority even though a misreading of the statute is invoked as justification.\" Phillips v. United States, 312 U.S. 246, 251-252, 61 S.Ct. 480, 484, 85 L.Ed. 800 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">In the instant case, it would appear that the present distinction is between a challenge to a statute as <em>applied </em>and a challenge to the <em>result </em>of the use of a constitutional statute. The Court has said: \u201cIt is necessary to distinguish between a petition for injunction on the ground of the unconstitutionality of a statute as applifed, which requires a three-judge court, and a petition which seeks an injunction on the ground of the unconstitutionality of the result obtained by the use of a statute which is not attacked as unconstitutional. The latter petition does not require a three-judge court.\u201d Ex parte Bransford, 310 U.S. 354, 361, 60 S.Ct. 947, 951, 84 L.Ed. 1249 (1940). <em>Cf., </em>Turner v. Fouche, 396 U.S. 346, 353-354, footnote 10, 90 S.Ct. 532, 24 L.Ed.2d 567 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Finally, as best we can decipher plaintiff\u2019s claims in his complaint and attached exhibits of correspondence with state officials, he asserts he is a member of \u201cJehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u201d and has been seeking certain religious materials by mail; that he has been denied such materials and placed in solitary confinement because of his insistence upon his right to receive them. On the other hand, the trial court found that explanations made to plaintiff by the Director of Public Safety and the Prison Sociologist \u201cclearly show that the reason for the petitioner\u2019s confinement is his poor institutional record and difficulties arising from failure to abide by prison regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">In any event, it becomes clear that the official conduct complained of was that related to a single state prison and was not the result of any legislative direction to impose statewide policy. Not being statewide in its application, the challenge to the prison rules was properly decided by a single judge. Hatfield v. Bailleaux, 9 Cir., 290 F.2d 632, 635 (1961), citing, <em>inter alia, </em>Rorick v. Board of Com\u2019rs, 307 U.S. 208, 59 S.Ct. 808, 83 L.Ed. 1242 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is in all respects affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-12\">.
