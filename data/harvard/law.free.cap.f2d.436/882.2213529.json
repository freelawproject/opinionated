ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">This appeal follows upon the District Court\u2019s dismissal of an action challenging demotions and discharges of civil service employees integrally with a reduction in force by the National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) at its George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (Marshall) in Huntsville, Alabama. Appellants are six of the civil servants whose employment was altered by the reduction in force,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Lodge 1858, American Federation of Government Employees (the Union), suing in its own right and on behalf of all affected civil service jobholders at Marshall, whom it represents as exclusive bargaining agent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellees are the Administrator of NASA,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the members of the Civil Service Commission,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the National Council of Technical Service Industries (NCTSI), a nonprofit corporation with a membership of companies supplying personnel pursuant to contracts with various federal agencies, including NASA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-18\">The gravamen of appellants\u2019 action is that NASA has bypassed controlling congressional enactments by procuring, through its service support contracts with private firms, manpower outside the civil service to perform tasks assigned by law to federal civil servants only. Their complaint charges that NASA, in curtailing its work force at Marshall, demoted some civil service employees and discharged others, while retaining in their preexisting positions contractor employees engaged in the same or similar activities. This, the complaint says, violated legislation restricting NASA\u2019s hir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>ing of contractor personnel,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the civil service laws and implementing regulations,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Union\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with NASA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The complaint seeks declarations that, under these circumstances, the demotions and discharges of civil service employees are prohibited and the service support contracts are illegal, and injunctive relief with regard to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">For further details, I look to the now dismissed complaint, the factual allegations of which must be accepted as true for purposes of this appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At the end of 1966, NASA had approximately 7,300 civil service employees at Marshall and, in addition, a dozen private concerns supplied some 5,900 contractor employees in a variety of job classifications.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Congress has ordained, subject to certain exceptions,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that \u201cofficers and employees as may be necessary to carry out [NASA\u2019s] functions * * * shall be appointed in accordance with the civil-service laws * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Marshall\u2019s contractor employees allegedly work on NASA property with NASA equipment side by side under common governmental supervision with civil service employees on exclusively NASA tasks that are identical or substantially so.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On this basis, appellants contend that nongovernment personnel work in direct job competition with government personnel at Marshall, and in direct violation of law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>The complaint also informs us that in the recent past the Civil Service Commission and the General Accounting Office have criticized some of NASA\u2019s service support contracts as illegal and wasteful.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It informs additionally that NASA responded with a pledge of rectification but that, before taking any action in reference to the Marshall contracts, it announced that budgetary cuts necessitated reduction of its force of civil servants there,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> whereupon many, including the six individual appellants, were notified that they would either be separated from federal service or assigned to inferior positions at reduced rates of pay. The complaint avers that these appellants had served long and satisfactorily, but were subjected to the reduction in force although in each instance contractor employees performing substantially the same work were retained in their positions without any loss of pay whatsoever.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Appellants sought relief against the reduction in force from NASA\u2019s Administrator, and then from the Civil Service Commission, requesting its intercession in the matter. The Commission replied that it was powerless to act because \u201cNASA is solely responsible.\u201d The individual appellants and other affected civil service employees thereupon initiated appeals with the Commission\u2019s Atlanta Regional Office. Before rendition of any decision on the appeals, appellants filed their complaint in the District Court and moved for a preliminary injunction against the reduction in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">At the hearing on the motion, the District Judge expressed concern that NASA\u2019s service support contracts might be out of tune with governing statutes, but found that NASA and the Civil Service Commission were cooperating in efforts to reconcile NASA\u2019s operational needs and its service support contract practices with legal requirements and Commission policies under the civil service laws.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> To maintain the status quo during that endeavor, the judge granted the requested injunction, but with a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>viso for its dissolution in the event that the two agencies reached an accord. NCTSI, the nongovernmental appellee, was permitted, over objection by NASA and appellants, to intervene for the purpose of defending its members\u2019 contracts with NASA.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">Shortly thereafter, NASA and the Commission agreed that the great majority of the proposed demotions and separations should be canceled,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and that the remaining personnel actions appeared tentatively to be legal.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Appellants disagreed with the latter conclusion, but the judge dissolved the injunction without prejudice to any administrative remedies possessed by the individual employees,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and later granted NASA\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The grounds stated for dismissal were non-exhaustion of remedies open to the individual appellants before the Civil Service Commission, and non-reviewability of demotions in and separations from the civil service save on judicial examination of Commission action after exhaustion of such remedies.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">Appellants challenge the dismissal, and urge a reversal and a remand in order that the District Court may hear and determine the litigation on the merits. Appellees argue that dismissal was proper, not only for non-exhaustion of administrative remedies <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> but also for lack of individual or organizational standing to question NASA\u2019s deployment of contractor personnel,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> an issue which, as I analyze the case, must be reached.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> I conclude in appellants\u2019 favor on standing,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and find it unnecessary to resolve the exhaustion issue.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">I consider first the contention that the Union and the individual appellants are without standing to litigate the issues the resolution of which is central to the disposition appellants seek on the merits. NASA takes the position that the Union lacks standing to press any viewpoint on the case. NCTSI argues that neither the Union nor the individual appellants have standing to assert the il<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>legality or inefficacy, as against civil service jobholders, of the service support contracts its member companies have made with NASA.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> My treatment of the problems starts with identification of the precise role those contracts play in the controversy appellants have submitted for judicial determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">The essence of appellants\u2019 claim is that federal statutes, civil service regulations and the Union\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with NASA invalidate the service support contracts or at least, when reductions in force are undertaken, confer preference rights on civil service employees vis-a-vis contractor employees doing similar work. The gist of the countervailing argument is that appellants\u2019 complaint comes ultimately to an assault on NASA\u2019s service support contracts with outside concerns, which appellants have no standing to maintain.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Undeniably, the complaint launches a major attack on the legality of the contracts, and the relief sought would in one aspect consist in a declaration and injunction outlawing them. Even assuming NASA\u2019s authority to enter into such contracts, a matter I do not address on this appeal, there would remain for judicial decision the question whether federal civil servants have job retention rights superior to those of competing nonfederal employees. Appellants\u2019 complaint thus inevitably draws the efficacy of the service support contracts into the maelstrom of the controversy, and the standing issue is brought into sharp focus as a query as to whether appellants may assail the contracts by which non-eivil service manpower is procured for Marshall.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">The argument against standing is pitched on the premise that appellants have no legally safeguarded right to freedom from governmental action creating employment competition for them. Of course, neither the Union nor the individual appellants are parties to the service support contracts, nor are they affected by the contracts otherwise than by the economic consequences wrought. Injury resulting from rivalry over jobs, it is urged, is not enough; appellants, it is claimed, must demonstrate that the action complained of constitutes an invasion of interests commanding legal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-12\">There is a well known body of precedent supporting the proposition that standing is lacking \u201cunless the right invaded is a legal right, \u2014 one of property, one arising out of contract, one protected against tortious invasion, or one founded on a statute which confers a privilege.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Indeed, to be found among our own past decisions are holdings seemingly requiring a legally protected right as a condition precedent to achieving standing.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>Appellants have not pointed to any specific source, nor have I been able to detect any, from whence one could say, without assaying the case on the merits, that such a right in their favor clearly and unquestionably springs.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\">Canvassing the complaint for possibilities, I note initially the Union's collective bargaining agreement with NASA, but on examination find reason for pause. This compact was promulgated under Executive Order 10988,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> which requires a provision in all such agreements that \u201c [management officials of the agency retain the right, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, * * * (b) to hire * * * and retain employees in positions within the agency, and * * * (c) to relieve employees from duties because of lack of work or for other legitimate reasons. * * * \u00bb <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The agreement in suit contains this language, and none to the contrary, so that, related problems aside,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> there is an immediate confrontation with the question whether Marshall\u2019s civil service employees have greater rights than they would derive from the \u201capplicable laws and regulations.\u201d Only by proceeding to decide on the merits whether the collective agreement is so limited could it be ascertained whether a legally protected right is created by the agreement itself.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">I look next for laws and regulations explicitly conferring standing, and the complaint refers merely to statutory provisions specifying certain retention preferences among \u201ccompeting employees.\" <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Again there is cause for hesitation, arising from congressional delegation to the Civil Service Commission of the task of implementing those provisions,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and the concomitant question whether initial resort to the Commission\u2019s administrative processes is a condition to their judicial consideration.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> While Marshall\u2019s adversely affected civil service employees could undoubtedly invoke such provisions on individual reviews of Commission determinations,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> appellants embarked upon their quest for relief against the service support contracts without awaiting prior action by the Commission, and have insisted throughout upon the propriety of that course. Only by treating the statute and regulations on the merits could one deal with this potential hurdle to \u201clegally protected right\u201d standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">This case thus illustrates a difficulty all too frequently encountered in undertakings to rule on standing by application of the \u201clegally protected right\u201d test. Identification of such a right may neces-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>s\u00edtate a full investigation and decision on the merits, the party\u2019s standing to litigate which is the question at the threshold. A threshold resolution on standing via a \u201clegally protected right,\u201d even if otherwise proper,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> may have to forego the values that only close scrutiny on the merits can provide. Such is the case here, where satisfaction of the \u201clegally protected right\u201d standard is not immediately apparent but thorough consideration on the merits might develop not only the outcome advocated by appellants but also their standing in terms of that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">It so happened, however, that quite fortuitously a rescue from that dilemma was provided. While this appeal was pending resolution, a rehearing by the court era <em>banc </em>was ordered in a case, Cur-ran v. Laird,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> wherein a principal question was the continuing, potency of the doctrine preconditioning standing to sue on the existence of a legally protected right. With that question, so crucial to this appeal, destined for settlement by the court as a whole, decision in the case at bar was deferred to enable an evaluation of appellants\u2019 standing in accord-anee with the principles <em>Curran </em>would enunciate.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> I am also benefited greatly by even more recent opinions wherein the \u201clegally protected right\u201d criterion was further examined and assessed.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Now, with the much needed enlightenment those decisions afford, I am able to proceed confidently to a definitive conclusion on the standing issues at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b962-16\">In Curran v. Laird,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> the president of the National Maritime Union sued on behalf of its members to enforce a provision of the Cargo Preference Act<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> requiring utilization of American flag ships in preference to foreign ships in the transportation of military supplies.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> It was held that he had standing to do so despite the absence of a perceptible \u201clegally protected right,\u201d in the traditional sense,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> either in the Union or the seamen comprising its membership. Recognizing that \u201c[t]he * * * expansion of judicial review\u201d by the Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> \u201cinter-meshes with and reenforces a judicial trend liberalizing standing through discernment of a protected interest,\u201d <footnotemark>52</footnotemark> but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>that \u201c[t]he area where the judicial liberalization of standing has made least headway relates to actions by one competitor complaining of another\u2019s lack of authority,\u201d <footnotemark>53</footnotemark> the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hardin v. Kentucky Utilities Company <footnotemark>54</footnotemark> became pivotal. There, in supporting a private utility\u2019s standing to test the Tennessee Valley Authority's expansion of its service area, the Court applied the rule <footnotemark>55</footnotemark> \u201cthat when the particular statutory provision invoked * * * reflect [s] a legislative purpose to protect a competitive interest, the injured competitor has standing to require compliance with that provision.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> This court summarized the governing principles as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-4\">* * * [A] person aggrieved in fact may properly invoke not only the letter of the Administrative Procedure Act and its \u2018generous\u2019<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> review provisions, but a broad conception that Congress is \u2018hospitable\u2019<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> to the maintenance of complaints against officials charged with disregarding its substantive mandate. And it does appear that in the absence of a contrary indication the courts will entertain even an action brought by an aggrieved competitor if there can fairly be attributed to Congress, expressly or impliedly, a purpose of protecting competitive interests like those of complainants <footnotemark>59</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-17\">Upon examination of the Cargo Preference Act against this doctrinal backdrop, the congressional objectives inspiring the choice of American flag vessels over foreign vessels on military freight-age were isolated. One was to promote the vitality and emergency availability of American ships and crews. Another, more important to the litigation, was to provide employment protection for American seamen since, by reason of other legislation,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> American ships must car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>ry American crews. That, it was held, was enough to enable the Union to complain of a disregard of the cargo preference requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">One is bound to spot instantly a striking parallel between <em>Curran </em>and the instant case. The National Maritime Union was aggrieved by the failure to make maximum use of American flag vessels, and thus to expand employment opportunities for the Union\u2019s members who would man those vessels. Similarly, in this case, the Union and its members\u2014 all civil service employees \u2014 are aggrieved by NASA\u2019s policies respecting the hiring of contractor employees and the retention preferences allegedly accorded them on reductions in force. Stripping appellants\u2019 claim down to one of economic injury from unlawful competition, and irrespective of the consequent aggrievement in fact to alone confer standing,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Marshall\u2019s federal civil servants here, no less than the Union\u2019s seamen in <em>Curran, </em>have standing to challenge the contracts giving rise to that competition where the scheme of the statute on which the challenge is based reflects a legislative purpose to protect their competitive interests.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">When Congress created NASA and authorized it \u201cto appoint and fix the compensation of such officers and employees as may be necessary to carry out such functions,\u201d it mandated explicitly that \u201c[s]uch officers and employees shall be appointed in accordance with the civil-service laws.\u201d <footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Even to give NASA a degree of flexibility in staffing, Congress has excepted but 425 of the many thousands of NASA jobs <footnotemark>64</footnotemark> from the civil service laws.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> And while thus so overwhelmingly subjecting NASA to the civil service laws, Congress has specifically rejected Administration requests that the federal salary laws be waived for all officers and employees of the new agency.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">It remains for this litigation on the merits to define the degree to which twin goals in enacting this legislation may have been to restrict outside hiring by NASA and, by the same token, to confer employment benefits upon civil service personnel in the NASA organization.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The problem is standing, and <em>Curran </em>teaches that standing is no longer to depend upon a threshold identification of a right irrefutably demanding legal vindication. And since <em>Curran </em>was decided, the Supreme Court has taught much the same lesson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-10\">The \u2018legal interest\u2019 test goes to the merits. The question of standing is different. It concerns, apart from the \u2018case\u2019 or \u2018controversy\u2019 test, the question whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>ably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"> By my appraisal, the congressional mandate limiting NASA\u2019s employment of contractor employees arguably brings its civil service employees, within the zone of interests it protects, and bestows standing upon the individual appellants to contest the legality of NASA\u2019s implementation of its work force at Marshall through service support contracts <footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-16\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b965-17\">I find, too, standing in the Union to enter the contest as the representative of its members authorized to safeguard their employment interests. As quite lately we observed, \u201ccourts have come increasingly to recognize the standing of associations to raise in some circumstances the rights of their members,\u201d <footnotemark>70</footnotemark> and this they have done as well where the members\u2019 interests were statutory in origin <footnotemark>71</footnotemark> as where they were founded on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>constitutional predicate.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Here, in the Union\u2019s relationship with its members, are the ingredients that make for organizational standing to litigate in the members\u2019 behalf the dispute at hand, with or without the presence of individual members as parties to the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Organizational representatives, like their constituents were they themselves prosecuting the action alone, must survive the exactions of the \u201ccase or controversy\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> \u201cWhere the principle of avoidance of constitutional issues is not involved,\u201d we have said, \u201cthe primary requisite for a grant of standing is an interest sufficient to insure that the questions will be framed with the necessary specificity, that the issues will be contested with the necessary adverseness and that the litigation will be pursued with the necessary vigor.\u201d <footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Organizational representation, we added, is calculated to produce the intelligent, vigorous, adversary representation of interests required when the \u201cassociation is an authorized spokesman organized to promote these interests for its individual members.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> And \u201c[i]n such cases, absent evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to assume that the representative speaks effectively for his constituency.\u201d <footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-16\">Lately, in United Federation of Postal Clerks, AFL-CIO v. Watson,<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> we had occasion to apply these standards in a factual matrix quite similar to that obtaining here. There we noticed a number of characteristics possessed by the union involved, and we held them sufficient to confer standing upon it although we expressed no opinion as to whether they would always be prerequisites to standing.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> On close examination, I find that our union appellant has the self-same characteristics. It is recognized by NASA, the governmental employer, as the exclusive bargaining agent for all civil service employees at Marshall.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>By the presidential order underpinning that status, it is charged with representing the interests of those employees without discrimination.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> It bears the responsibility for consulting with NASA on the issues at the core of the controversy at bar.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Already in administrative contexts it has represented its constituency in regard to those issues.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">On this showing, I have no reason to doubt that the Union will represent its membership effectively in this litigation. As we felt in <em>Watson, </em>\u201cit [is] artificial and pointless to cut off its representative functions at the courthouse door.\u201d <footnotemark>83</footnotemark> In my view, the Union<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> has standing to assert the interests of its employee members.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b967-13\">I come now to the District Court\u2019s holding that appellants\u2019 action therein was premature because instituted prior to exhaustion of individual efforts to obtain relief from the Civil Service Commission against the demotions and discharges threatened by the reduction in force at Marshall. Appellants sought the Commission\u2019s aid before coming into court, and during the pendency of the suit numerous employees at Marshall filed individual appeals with the Commission. Those appeals were still under consideration when the District Court entered its order of dismissal, and were pursued by the employees long thereafter. It was only after the appeal to this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>had been perfected, and a week before oral argument therein, that the Commission\u2019s Board of Appeals and Review rendered the final administrative decision. Appellees now press the argument that in these circumstances the District Court\u2019s dismissal should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Resort to the courts must ordinarily be postponed until administrative remedies available for rectification of the errors complained of have been exhausted.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> And the court, as a general rule, must stay its hand in reduction in force controversies until administrative resolution of the matters in issue in a proceeding efficacious to that end.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> The exhaustion doctrine \u201cdoes not require merely the initiation of prescribed administrative procedures. It is one of exhausting them, that is, of pursuing them to their appropriate conclusion and, correlatively, of awaiting their final outcome before seeking judicial intervention.\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> And, \u201c[t]hat fact that administrative action is probably erroneous does not create an exception to the rule that administrative processes must be exhausted before judicial relief is sought.\u201d <footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Congress has imposed upon the Civil Service Commission the duty of administering and enforcing the civil service laws,<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> including the prescription of \u201cregulations for the release of competing employees in a reduction in force.\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> Compliably, the Commission has promulgated regulations specifying standards for determining whether particular employees are to be subjected to reductions in force,<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> and providing for corrective steps in instances of deviation<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s regulations also afford procedures whereby civil service employees affected by reductions in force may challenge personnel actions adverse to them. An employee aggrieved by a reduction in force is afforded an initial appeal to the Commission<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> and, if dissatisfied with the initial decision, a further appeal to the Commission\u2019s Board of Appeals and Review.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> Vindication of the employee\u2019s position entitles him to reinstatement with \u201call or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials\u201d that would have been forthcoming had the action complained of not occurred.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-15\">On the other hand, the exhaustion requirement contemplates an efficacious administrative remedy, and does not obtain when it is plain that any effort to meet it would come to no more than an exercise in futility.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>lants have directed attention to circumstances that raise combinationally a serious question as to whether the Civil Service Commission possessed the necessary authority to determine the central legal issue \u2014 legality of Marshall\u2019s service support contracts \u2014 posed in the District Court litigation. By way of recapitulation, after the court\u2019s preliminary injunction was entered, NASA and the Commission agreed that 598 of the 764 reductions in force then scheduled would be canceled because of \u201cimproper service contract operations.\u201d When, promptly thereafter, intercession by the Commission was sought as to the remaining 166 civil service employees, its then Chairman professed a lack of power to deal with the situation unilaterally, stating that \u201cNASA is solely responsible\u201d for the action complained of. After the District Court had passed its order of dismissal, the Commission\u2019s Atlanta Region, on initial appeal by the individual appellants, subscribed to the view that the legality of the service support contracts was an issue beyond the scope of reduction in force appeals,<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> as did the Commission\u2019s Board of Appeals and Review upon the final administrative appeal that followed.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">So, throughout the administrative process, the Commission has disclaimed jurisdiction to correct, on the employees\u2019 appeals, the alleged improprieties in NASA\u2019s contract employment policies or to alter NASA\u2019s employment decision effectuating those policies. Appellants argue with considerable force that in actuality they never had a meaningful or effective administrative remedy before the Commission, and so were entitled to immediate recourse to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">I find it unnecessary, however, to address this question since, however the District Court should properly have ruled upon it, the administrative remedy has now been fully exhausted. One week before oral argument here, the Board of Appeals and Review handed down the decision that signals the end of the administrative route for at least some of the appealing employees.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> Any resolution now made of the exhaustion issue would entail the rendition of an essentially advisory opinion and, even if adverse to appellants, would not now warrant affirmance of the District Court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">The duty of an appellate tribunal is to fashion dispositions \u201cas may be just under the circumstances,\u201d <footnotemark>101</footnotemark> and that mission has frequently been ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>complished by a remand even to afford a litigant a second opportunity to do something he should have done in the first place.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> That course becomes all the more appropriate where, as here, appellants\u2019 obligation to first seek relief from the Civil Service Commission remains enshrouded in uncertainty. Under present circumstances, and particularly with the Civil Service Commissioners as well as NASA\u2019s Administrator parties before the District Court, the ends of justice would be best served by a remand to enable appellants to pave the way to full litigation of their claims. Nonexhaustion as a problem can easily be accommodated by granting appellants leave to file a supplemental pleading alleging exhaustion of administrative remedies,<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> and the District Court can then proceed to solve all aspects of the ease on the merits.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> The process of resolution will involve, to the extent that the Commission had administrative jurisdiction of the controversy, review of the proceedings before the Commission on the administrative record made,<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> and to any further extent in an orthodox hearing or trial.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">In concluding that the doctrines of standing and exhaustion erect no barrier to prosecution of this suit on the merits. I have delved neither into the sufficiency of the allegations of the complaint to state a cause of action nor the ramifications of statutory interpretation that underlie such an inquiry. That is initially the function of the District Court, whose earlier disposition foreclosed consideration of those matters,<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> and this court could not in any event now do more than enable that function to go forward.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> Ostensibly in recognition of this need, appellants\u2019 prayer in this court is for an annulment of the judgment of dismissal and a remand for proceedings on the merits; and it is perhaps in consequence of this that only NCTSI has presented a brief addressed squarely to the ultimate question of statutory construction. I wish to make it clear that in discharging my responsibilities on the present appeal, I intimate no view on the merits of the controversy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-12\">.

The complaint alleges a proposal to eliminate approximately 640 civil service jobs and to lower an unspecified number of civil service employees in position. NASA\u2019s statistics are fuller and somewhat variant. The agency\u2019s overall civil service personnel ceiling would be trimmed by approximately 1,700 from 34,126 to 32,422, and the ceiling at Marshall would be cut by 700 to 6,386. In contemplation for Marshall, after subtracting voluntary resignations and retirements, were 560 separations, 300 reductions in grade, and reassignment offers to 260 other civil servants. However, as hereinafter appears, see notes 20, 23, <em>infra, </em>the reduction in force at Marshall eventuated as something much less drastic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b958-10\">. NASA claims a reduction by 400 in contractor employees during the last seven months of 1967, and a projected additional cut by approximately 1,000 by the end of fiscal year 1968.

The District Judge also found that NASA was itself in process of evaluating its operations at Marshall with a view to insuring that no civil service employee would be separated or reduced in grade or pay by reduction in force actions while nongovernmental employees performing the same activities continued to work on site at Marshall under service contracts then currently in effect with private contractors. The judge further found that Marshall\u2019s management, in cooperation with the Civil Service Commission, had established a positive out-placement program the primary purpose of which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>to place separated civil service employees in other positions within the NASA organization.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b959-6\">.

About 150 wage board employees who received reduction in force notices would be retained for retraining for placement at Marshall, and 69 technicians who received separation notices would be offered reassignment elsewhere within NASA at the same grades and to comparable positions with payment of moving expenses.

In the latter connection, the District Judge stated that \u201cthe Court may not enjoin a Government agency from discharging any of its employees, nor may it issue a declaratory judgment.\u201d Appellees do not press this argument on appeal.

In the District Court, NASA contested the Union\u2019s standing, and NCTSI the standing of the Union and the individual appellants as well.

Unlike the District Court, see note 24, supra, I detect no encounter with the doctrines of judicial non-reviewability and sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">As to the former, I draw upon the Supreme Court\u2019s delineation in Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, <em>supra </em>note 52, 387 U.S. at 140-141, 87 S.Ct. at 1511:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-9\">[A] survey of our cases shows that judicial review of a final agency action by an aggrieved person will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of Congress. * * * Early cases in which this type of judicial review was entertained, <em>e. g. </em>Shields v. Utah Idaho Central R. Co., 305 U.S. 177, 59 S.Ct. 160, 83 L.Ed. 111; Stark v. Wickard, 321 U.S. 288, 64 S.Ct. 559, 88 L.Ed. 733, have been reinforced by the enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act, which embodies the basic presumption of judicial review to one \u201csuffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, so long as no statute precludes such relief or the action is not one committed by law to agency discretion, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a). The Administrative Procedure Act provides specifically not only for review of \u201c[ajgency action made reviewable by statute\u201d but also for review of \u201cfinal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. The legislative material elucidating that seminal act manifests a congressional intention that it cover a broad spectrum of administrative actions, and this Court has echoed that theme by noting that the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s \u201cgenerous review provisions\u201d must be given a \u201chospitable\u201d interpretation. * * * Again in Rusk v. Cort, [369 U.S. 367, 379-380, 82 S.Ct. 787, 7 L.Ed.2d 809 (1962)], the Court held that only upon a showing of \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review. See also, Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 336-359 (1965) (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-19\">I have discovered no such evidence, and it goes without saying that NASA has no discretion in the area mandated by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2473(b) (2), quoted <em>supra </em>note 12, the scope of which is yet to be determined.

As put by the Board, \u201c[a] decision to carry out some of its functions by using other than Federal civilian employees is a matter solely within the administrative discretion of the agency and the propriety of such a decision is not subject to review or modification by the Civil Service Commission in the adjudication of the reduction-in-force appeal of any federal civilian employee affected thereby.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"100\">\n<p id=\"b969-6\">. The decision of the Board of Appeals and Review is the terminal step in the administrative process.

That section further provides that \u201c[e]xeept as otherwise expressly required by statute, agency action otherwise final is final for the purposes of this section whether or not there has been presented or determined an application for * * * any form of reconsideration, or, unless the agency otherwise requires by rule and provides that the action meanwhile is inoperative, for an appeal to superior agency authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>I am aware of no statute requiring Commission consideration beyond the Board of Appeals and Review, and the Commission\u2019s regulations themselves provide that \u201c[t]he decision of the Board is final and there is no further right of appeal.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 772.307(c) (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"101\">\n<p id=\"b969-13\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"102\">\n<p id=\"b970-6\">.

The teachings of Scanwell Laboratories, Inc. v. Shaffer, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 371, 424 F.2d 859 (1970), Association of Data Processing Serv. Organizations v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970), and Barlow v. Collins, 397 U.S. 159, 90 S.Ct. 832, 25 L.Ed.2d 192 (1970) are that the only conditions necessary to establish standing are a showing of ag-grievement in fact, a prima facie showing of some administrative illegality, a case or controversy under Article III of the Constitution, and sufficient review of the relevant statutes to establish that there is no manifestation of a congressional intent that judicial review should be withheld. These criteria being met in the present case, I feel that the appellants have the necessary standing to maintain this action and that the case consequently must be remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
