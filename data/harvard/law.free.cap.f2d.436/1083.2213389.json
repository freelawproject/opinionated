After a trial, the District Court found that the Hotel was paying its day-shift bellmen too little, but refused to enjoin the Company from future violations, and refused to order restitution of back pay, on the grounds that: the Hotel did not have a history of Fair Labor Standards Act violations; the proof of wages wrongfully withheld was inadequate; it would be inequitable to issue an injunction. The District Court did enjoin the Hotel to keep regular records on how much its bellmen received in tips. The Secretary appeals; the Hotel cross appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">Upon a review of the record in its entirety, we are of the opinion that the \u25a0District Court\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous, and its conclusions in accordance with the law. Its refusals to grant restitution for the tipped employees and to grant a permanent injunction against future violations are supported by facts, circumstances, and equities sufficient to indicate proper exercise of discretion. <em>See </em>Shultz v. Mistleto Express Service, Inc., 434 F.2d 1267 (10th Cir., filed December 8, 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">Each party to pay its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
