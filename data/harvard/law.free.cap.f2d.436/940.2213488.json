He has taken the opportunity afforded him to op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>pose such disposition in a memorandum addressing the underlying merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">A thorough examination of the files and records in this cause at this time convinces us that the judgment of the district court was correct in result and should be affirmed. See 322 F.Supp. 424 (D.C.Kan.1970). Additionally, the Civil Rights Act cannot be used by a state prisoner to circumvent the requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 that state remedies must be exhausted. Smartt v. Avery, 411 F.2d 408 (6th Cir. 1969). See also Denney v. State of Kansas, 436 F.2d 587 (10th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
