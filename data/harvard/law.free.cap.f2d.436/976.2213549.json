In a detailed and well-reasoned opinion Judge Orma R. Smith denied the principal item of recovery by holding that the additional work was mere difficulty in performance which could have been foreseen before acceptance of the contract since defendants\u2019 plans and specifications adequately revealed the type of soil conditions to be expected. The district court granted plaintiff\u2019s claim for a sum over and above the price paid for the new spur inlets but disallowed recovery of interest on money admittedly owed plaintiff for the reason the defendant had made a tender without prejudice. Finally, the district court refused plaintiff\u2019s claim for compensation for clearing work on the entire area to be cleared as shown on defendants\u2019 maps. There is nothing we can add to the opinion of the district court. See 304 F.Supp. 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
