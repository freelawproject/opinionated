Under notice pleading concepts, the complaint is sufficient to create a conflict between the First Amendment and a Texas statute regulating conduct concerning the flag of the United States. Article 152, Vernon\u2019s Ann. Texas Penal Code. A question is also presented as to plaintiff\u2019s standing to assert the First Amendment question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-16\">We are without a settled record as to the facts relating to plaintiff\u2019s arrest and the state charges which were pending, if any, at the time the federal suit was filed. In sum, we are not able to consider the questions presented in the absence of the basic facts surrounding the claimed events. On remand, the district court is directed to take such action as may be necessary to result in findings of fact having to do with those matters relating to standing, the anti-injunction statute, 28 USCA \u00a7 2283, and the constitutional question presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-18\">Vacated and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1454-19\">JONES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ANqt\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-20\">I do not find as does the majority any conflict between the Texas statute and any provision of the United States Constitution. I would leave the appellant where the district court truncated him.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
