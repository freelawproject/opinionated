App. \u00a7\u00a7 454 and 460. United States v. Brown, 300 F.Supp. 627 (E.D.Pa.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">In June, 1964 appellant applied to his local board for reclassification as a conscientious objector. Thereafter during the same month he was baptized and became a member of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. On July 21, 1964 appellant\u2019s local board retained him in class I-A. Appellant appeared before the local board on October 5, 1964, pressing his conscientious objector claim and for the first time claiming a ministerial exemption. In connection with this latter claim, the minutes taken at his personal appearance reveal that appellant was directed to obtain a letter from Watchtower headquarters and send it to the board. The board voted to retain appellant in class I-A on the same day as his hearing. He never submitted the requested letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-5\">Following his unsuccessful efforts at the local board level, appellant appealed on November 20, 1964. After the appeal board tentatively determined that appellant was not entitled to conscientious objector status, it referred his file to the Department of Justice for investigation of the <em>conscientious objector </em>claim pursuant to regulations then in effect. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1626.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-6\">Some sixteen months later, on March 26,1966, appellant appeared before a Special Hearing Officer of the Department of Justice for a hearing on his conscientious objector claim. The Justice Department report relates that appellant claimed \u201cthat at the time of the hearing, he was devoting full time to his Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses ministry as a \u2018pioneer.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This assertion, which appellant may have believed supported his conscientious objector claim as well as his claim for a ministerial exemption, was in contrast to his concession to the local board in June 1964 that he had not achieved pioneer status. Indeed, there is no evidence that appellant ever asserted pioneer status before the local board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-9\">In addition appellant submitted four letters from co-religionists to the hearing officer. Among those letters was one from the Overseer of a, Philadelphia congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses dated March 22, 1966. The letter in part stated: \u201cMr. Brown has recently begun to serve as a full-time minister; that is, he will be devoting at least 100 hours per month to actual preaching, not counting time spent in preparing for and attending meetings, and such incidentals as travel time to and from ministerial territory, etc.\u201d The other three letters from co-religionists as well as his own letter further tended to substantiate appellant\u2019s claim to full-time ministerial status within the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses sect. These documents were attached as exhibits to the Justice Department\u2019s negative report on appellant\u2019s conscientious objector claim which was presented to the appeal board on September 22, 1966. Appellant was sent a copy of the report and was given an opportunity to respond to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-10\">In his response appellant briefly attempted to rebut the Justice Department recommendation on his conscientious objector claim. However, he addressed himself primarily to pressing his ministerial exemption claim. He submitted several statements asserting his full-time ministerial status and detailing his activities and responsibilities. He also requested an opportunity to present additional substantiation of his full-time ministerial status. The appeal board re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>viewed all these materials and rejected both the conscientious objector and ministerial exemption claims. Appellant was subsequently convicted of a refusal to submit to induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-5\">Initially we are faced with the question whether the appeal board had authority to review materials, not before the local board, which were offered both in support of a ministerial exemption claim and a conscientious objector claim to the Justice Department Hearing Officer and to the appeal board. It is clear that there could be no review of such materials today.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time appellant\u2019s case was before the appeal board, however, the regulations provided for review of <em>conscientious objector </em>claims by the Department of Justice. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1626.25. The appeal board was at that time empowered to consider both the Department\u2019s report on the registrant\u2019s <em>conscientious objector </em>claim and the registrant\u2019s reply to that report. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1626.24. We are convinced that these regulations were not intended to allow new information, not related to the conscientious objector claim, to be considered in the first instance by the appeal board simply because it was included in the Department's report or the registrant\u2019s reply. Such information must be submitted to the local board for its initial consideration. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.-1 (b). Appellant, however, submitted evidence at the appeal level tending to substantiate his claim that he had achieved full-time ministerial status within his religion some time after the local board refused to reclassify him. Under the circumstances of this case, we believe that the appeal board should have recognized this procedural irregularity and referred such information to the local board for treatment as a request for a reopening of appellant\u2019s classification. We think such action was implicitly dictated by selective service regulations, which provide that an appeal board must, in reviewing classifications,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-6\">\u201ccarefully check each file to determine whether all steps required by the regulations have been taken, whether the record is complete, and whether the information in the file is sufficient to enable it to determine the registrant\u2019s classification. If any steps have been omitted by the local board, if the record is incomplete, or if the information is not sufficient to enable the appeal board to determine the classification of the registrant, the appeal board <em>shall </em>return the file to the local board with a request for additional information or action.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1626.23 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1391-7\">Since we are convinced that appellant could have made out a prima facie case for the ministerial exemption based upon his newly acquired pioneer status, we conclude that he could have compelled a reopening of his classification and was therefore substantially prejudiced by the appeal board\u2019s failure to comply with 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1626.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-8\">Moreover, we do not believe that appellant was required to prove a sufficient case for IV-D classification during his criminal prosecution. The determination whether appellant was entitled to a ministerial exemption was to be made initially by the Selective Service System acting in compliance with its own regulations \u2014 not by the district court in a criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-9\">To the extent that it permits an appeal board to consider in the first instance new evidence in support of a ministerial claim, we overrule United States v. Brown (Gerald Lee), 423 F.2d 751 (3d Cir. 1970). In so doing, however, we note that the defendant in that case suffered no prejudice by the appeal board\u2019s failure to remand, since his new evidence was insufficient to show a prima facie case and would not have required a reopening of his classification at the local board level.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-10\">We conclude that the induction order which appellant refused to obey was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>valid and that his subsequent conviction must be reversed. Our disposition of this case does not require us to decide the other issues raised on this appeal, including that as to the correctness of the district court\u2019s action in quashing the subpoena addressed to the chairman of the local board for the purpose of examining him at the trial concerning his alleged prejudice against those of appellant\u2019s religion. However, we feel compelled to add that we have no doubt that the local board members are subject to the subpoena power. The scope of their examination when responding thereto is, of course, a matter to be determined by the district court in accordance with proper evidentiary principles. Neither do we decide whether appellant\u2019s conscientious objector claim was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">The judgment of the district court will be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1390-7\">. All members of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are considered \u201cordained ministers,\u201d but this does not entitle all to a ministerial exemption for draft purposes. Camp v. United States, 413 F.2d 419 (5th Cir. 1969). Here, we are using the term \u201cpioneer\u201d only to refer to full-time minis-fers devoting an average of at least 1200 hours per year to the field ministry. Even the Watehtower Society of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses has accepted this as the minimum standard for a IV-D exemption as a pioneer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1391-11\">. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1626.24.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1392-5\">VAN DUSEN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AuF\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-6\">My examination of the record before the appeal board as it was returned to the local board in October 1966 indicates to me that it could not support a prima facie case of entitlement to the ministerial exemption provided in 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(g), despite the conviction of the majority to the contrary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 466(g) (1) defines a \u201cduly ordained minister of religion\u201d as \u201ca person * * * who. as his regular and customary vocation preaches and teaches the principles of religion and administers the ordinances of public worship as embodied in the creed or principles of such church, sect, or organization.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In Dickinson v. United States, 346 U.S. 389, 394-395, 74 S.Ct. 152, 156, 98 L.Ed. 132 (1953), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-10\">The ministerial exemption, as was pointed out in the Senate Report accompanying the 1948 Act, \u201cis a narrow one, intended for the leaders of the various religious faiths and not for the members generally.\u201d S.Rep. No. 1268, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. 13. Certainly all members of a religious organization or sect are not entitled to the exemption by reason of their membership, even though in their belief each is a minister. Cf. Cox v. United States, 332 U.S. 442 [68 S.Ct. 115, 92 L.Ed. 59] (1947). On the other hand, a legitimate minister cannot be, for the purposes of the Act, unfrocked simply because all the members of his sect base an exemption claim on the dogma of its faith. That would leave a congregation without a cleric. Each registrant must satisfy the Act\u2019s rigid criteria for the exemption. Preaching and teaching the principles of one\u2019s sect, if performed part-time or half-time, occasionally or irregularly, are insufficient to bring a registrant under \u00a7 6(g). These activities must be regularly performed. They must, as the statute reads, comprise the registrant\u2019s \u201cvocation.\u201d And since the ministerial exemption is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>matter of legislative grace, the selective service registrant bears the burden of clearly establishing a right to the exemption.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1393-4\">Due to the following data in the file, I believe there was sufficient information (see 32 C.F.R. 1626.23) for the appeal board to determine that the registrant had not made out a prima facie case of entitlement to the IV-D ministerial exemption and hence that remand with a request for additional information was not required.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-5\">I. Failure Of Registrant To Comply With Draft Board Request To Submit Certification Of His Status From Watchtower Society As Requested At October 5, 1964, Local Board. Hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-6\">After the registrant, in October, 1964, took the position orally during his hearing before the Local Board that he \u201cwanted classification as a minister of religion \u2014 Jehovah Witnesses,\u201d the Board asked him if he had a congregation, to which question he gave no answer, and then asked him how many hours he worked,to which he answered \u201c24 hours a day,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and then instructed him to \u201cget a letter from the Watch Tower headquarters and send same to the Local Board.\u201d The registrant never complied with this instruction and produced no certificate from the \u201cHeadquarters\u201d until his criminal trial in 1969.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-15\">II. The Confusing Evidence Submitted By The Registrant To The Hearing Officer And The Appeal Board In 1966.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-16\">In describing his religious activities in his March 1966 letter delivered to the hearing officer, the registrant conceded that he had only been a full-time minister during four nonconsecutive months of 1965 and the highest number of hours spent preaching<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in the other months from September 1964 through January 1966 was 45 hours in March 1965, and that in January 1966 he only spent 17 hours in this activity with no time listed for teaching. At this time, he stated that he did \u201coccasional janitorial work.\u201d There is nothing in the file to substantiate the prediction of the Overseer that registrant \u201cwill be devoting at least 100 hours per month to actual preaching,\u201d which is the minimum standard for a IV-D exemption under the position of registrant\u2019s own church.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In fact, the following information submitted by the registrant negatives the majority opinion assumption that he spent at any time in 1966 100 hours per month in the \u201cfield ministry.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-17\">There was enclosed with registrant\u2019s letter of October 3, 1966, which made the claim that he was entitled to be classified as a minister (IV-D) un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>der 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 466(g), a <em>2% </em>sheet \u201csummary I would like to add to my testimony.\u201d This described on the first page his \u201citemized and extensive training for the ministry,\u201d including \u201cthe delivery of bible sermons\u201d and \u201cpublic speaking,\u201d apparently as part of this training. On the second page it stated that his \u201cvocation * * * not only covers actual time preaching but time spent pursuing all my ministerial activities,\u201d which he listed under six headings, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-4\">1. Text in morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-5\">2. Time missionary work among my congregation of laymen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-6\">3. Time spent calling on each of my congregation (spiritual, physical as well as with associate ministers of local congregation of Jehovah Witnesses).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aem-dedup-0\">4. Time for preparing for local congregation meetings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-9\">5. Time attending, officiating at or participating in local congregation meeting (see service program).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-10\">6. Time counseling and aiding visitors or associates within local congregation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses before and after meeting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-11\">A fourth sheet described \u201cas a final word\u201d included this language:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-12\">* * * since the overall time spent in pursuit of ministerial vocation can be determined by my field service record and general curriculum. I offer in evidence thereto the following information to be added to my file. * # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-14\">The \u201cfollowing information\u201d apparently referred to four sheets of paper on which were typed at the top: \u201cMy ministerial activity for the month of Apr<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in behalf of my congregation.\u201d Under this was a form entitled \u201cPublisher\u2019s Weekly Field Service Report. * * # \u201d with seven headings to show a figure for each day of the week in each of the seven categories. The total weekly time varied from three to five under \u201cHours of Field Service,\u201d and unexplained numbers from 18 to 24 appeared under \u201cIndividual Magazines.\u201d Even assuming five-week months and that the documents referred to a week, rather than a month as indicated at the top of the sheet, far less than 100 hours per month was spent on field service. The most reasonable conclusion from the file is that registrant was devoting far less than 100 hours per month to the \u201cfield ministry,\u201d which, as stated in footnote 1 of the majority opinion, is \u201cthe minimum standard for a IV-D exemption\u201d for a Pioneer under the position of registrant\u2019s own church. <em>See </em>United States v. Stidham, 248 F.Supp. 822, 839 n. 9 (W.D.Mo.1965). Hence, the majority\u2019s assumption that registrant had \u201cnewly acquired pioneer status\u201d is conclusively rebutted by registrant\u2019s own evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1394-19\">As stated in McCoy v. United States, 403 F.2d 896, 902 n. 6 (5th Cir. 1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"akf-dedup-0\">Here the file affirmatively showed that appellant * * * did not have the recognized standing of a minister or leader of lesser members of his congregation sufficient in his own sect (the Watchtower Society) to justify the IV-D ministerial exemption, and the extent of his activities was largely unsupported and conflicting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1394-20\">In order to obtain an exemption, a registrant must stand in the relation of a minister to a congregation. He must be a leader of a group of lesser members of his faith.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Fitts v. United States, 334 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>F.2d 416, 421 (5th Cir. 1964). <em>See </em>Robertson v. United States, 417 F.2d 440 (5th Cir. 1969); Sturgis v. United States, 342 F.2d 328 (3d Cir. 1965). The evidence placed in the file by the registrant demonstrated that he did not have such standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-5\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion and its conclusion. I believe that there was a basis in fact for the denial of the defendant's conscientious objector claim, but I would remand to the district court in order to permit the examination of the subpoenaed Chairman of the Local Board and any witnesses called- by the Government on this issue raised by the registrant:<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Was the Local Board or its Chairman biased and prejudiced against Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and/or the registrant? <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1395-6\">Circuit Judge ALDISERT joins in the foregoing opinion and adds the following additional dissenting opinion, with which I agree.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1392-8\">. <em>See </em>p. 1319 of opinion. Initially, it should be noted that-the registrant was 21 years of age (his birthdate being 6/3/43) and had completed 3 years of junior high school, 1 year of high school and 1 year of trade school (Automotive Maintenance) when he had\u2018his hearing before the local board in October 1964 and thereafter filed his appeal to the Appeal Board in November 1964. This case does not concern a teenage registrant whose -education terminated ; prior to junior high school, but rather the record Shows considerable educ\u00e1tion and advice furnished by the Watchtower Society, including adviee on Selective Service procedures. Cf. United States v. Deans, 436 F.2d 596 (3d Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1392-11\">. Subsection 3 of 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 466(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-12\">The term \u201cregular or duly ordained minister of religion\u201d does not include a person who irregularly or incidentally preaches and teaches the principles of religion of a church, religious sect, or organization and does not include any person who may have been duly ordained a minister in accordance with the ceremonial, rite, or discipline of a church, religious sect or organization, but who does not regularly, as a vocation, teach and preach the principles of religion and administer the ordinances of public worship as embodied in the creed or principles of his church, sect, or organization.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1393-7\">.

United States, 397 F.2d 901, 915 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1395-7\">ALDISERT, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A2D\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-8\">While I join in the dissenting opinion of Judge VAN DUSEN, I add that I am not persuaded that Regulation 1626.23 requires the appeal board to do what Regulation 1625.2 requires the registrant to do, namely, to present \u201cwritten information presenting facts not considered when the registrant was classified\u201d to the local board. As I read Regulation 1626.23 the appeal board is required to return the record to the local board only (1) if steps have been omitted by the local board, (2) if the record is incomplete before the appeal board, or (3) if the information is not sufficient to enable the appeal board to determine the classification of the registrant. I do not see any of these circumstances present in the case at bar. Circuit Judge VAN DUSEN joins in this expression.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
