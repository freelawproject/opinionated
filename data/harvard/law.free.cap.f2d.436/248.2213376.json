Hill\u2019s Department Store of Ashtabula, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Ohio, (Hill\u2019s Ashtabula) is one of a chain of such stores in northeastern Ohio and southwestern .Pennsylvania operated by the Shoe Corppration of America. In April 1965, appellant Union was certified by the National Labor Relations Board as the bargaining agent for employees of Hill\u2019s Ashtabula.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Late in that year or early in the next,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> after some months of bargaining, the Union determined to seek its objectives by going on strike. Hill\u2019s Ashtabula was struck, and a boycott beginning there spread to other Hill\u2019s stores in the area, including Youngstown, Warren, and San-dusky, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">During this period, Hill\u2019s regularly purchased radio air time for advertising. Although no samples of Hill\u2019s advertisements are before us, the parties are agreed that the advertising was standard commercial copy, extolling the virtues of Hill\u2019s stock, bargains, and service, and on that basis urging listeners to patronize the various Hill\u2019s outlets. Seventy such announcements were run by WREO between January 10 and February 22, 1966. Similar copy was carried by stations WFMJ of Youngstown, WHHH of Warren, and WLEC of Sandusky. Beginning in February, 1966, the Union undertook to support its .'boycott by purchasing time for one-minute spot announcements stating that a strike was in progress against Hill\u2019s Ashtabula, and urging listeners to respect the picket lines at that and the other Hill\u2019s Department Stores.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Three hundred and twenty-two such announcements were carried by WREO between February 16 and April 7, 1966. In addition, WFMJ of Youngstown carried two such spot announcements (both on March 22), and WLEC of Sandusky carried one hundred and seventy such announcements from February 23 through March 28.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> WHHH of Warren, Ohio, although approached by the Union, refused to accept any of the Union\u2019s advertisements upon the advice of its counsel that \u201cno fairness question was presented\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that the station was therefore not compelled to run the proffered advertisements.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">As the spring wore on, however, the Union experienced more and more difficulty in purchasing air time for its advertisements. Despite continuing attempts by the Union, through an advertising agency, to purchase further time, by early April of 1966 it could find no station serving the area around Ashta-bula willing to run its advertisements. Apparently the last of the stations to cancel was WREO of Ashtabula, which on April 5 wrote the advertising agencies representing the Union and Hill\u2019s Ash-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>tabula to inform them that WREO \u201cwould accept no further commercial copy from either party concerning the strike between Hill\u2019s and the union.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Subsequently, after counsel for the Union informed WREO that he had filed a complaint regarding this action with the FCC, the station on April 22 offered free time to both parties for a single \u201cround table discussion\u201d of the issues presented by the strike.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This offer was never accepted by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Some time in April, the Union filed complaints with the FCC, charging \u201cvarious Ohio and Pennsylvania radio stations\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (including WREO) with violations of the fairness doctrine. The Commission, in an unreported letter of April 29, 1966, \u201cfound no controversial issue of public importance involved in the factual situation and * * * pointed out that a broadcaster is not a common carrier in the sense that he must accept advertising from all comers. * * * \u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> About the same time, the Union formally charged Hill\u2019s with a violation of the National Labor Relations Act for exerting economic pressure against some of these radio stations to persuade them to cancel the Union\u2019s advertising. This charge was ultimately rejected by the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s Office of Appeals on March 14, 1967.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">In the meantime, WREO continued to broadcast advertisements for Hill\u2019s Ash-tabula. One hundred and twenty-three announcements and six sponsored programs were run during the month of April, and from April 1 to the end of the year, the station broadcast 1,088 spot announcements, 176 sponsored programs, and fourteen sponsored one-third segments of football games on behalf of the store.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Similarly, it appears that advertising on behalf of Hill\u2019s continued to be broadcast by WFMJ, WHHH, and WLEC.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, on August 9, 1967, the Union filed with the FCC unverified<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> petitions to deny renewal of the licenses of stations WFMJ, WHHH, WLEC, and WREO. The petitions alleged that the stations had succumbed to economic pressure from Hill\u2019s and therefore cancelled the Union\u2019s strike advertising ; and that, in any event, refusal to carry advertising by the Union while continuing to carry advertising from Hill\u2019s urging listeners to patronize its stores was a violation of the fairness doctrine. The FCC wrote each of the affected stations inquiring, <em>vnter alia, </em>why Union advertising had been rejected.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> After receiving replies to its inquiry,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the Commission in a memorandum opinion and order <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> denied the Union\u2019s petitions regarding WFMJ, WHHH, and WLEC. The Commission, apparently relying upon its letter to the Union of April 29, 1966,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> found no fairness question presented. With regard to the Union\u2019s charges of economic pressure, the Commission noted that similar charges had been rejected by the National Labor Relations Board after investigation; <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that each of the three stations had categorically denied that any such pressure had been exerted against them; and that the Union had provided no specific allegations of particular economic pressure exerted against any of the stations.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Commission denied the petitions and granted the stations\u2019 request for renewal.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> No appeal was taken from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Action on the Union\u2019s petition regarding WREO was deferred pending \u201cfurther inquiries\u201d by the Commission.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Subsequently, the Commission wrote the Manager of Hill\u2019s Ashtabula requesting a statement regarding \u201cyour part, if any\u201d in the controversy between the Union and WREO, and asking him to state \u201cwhether Hill\u2019s, or any of Hill\u2019s employees or agents, at any time during 1966 sought to influence WREO directly or indirectly to cancel spot announcements by Local 880 concerning the Ashtabula strike.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The manager replied that no such efforts had been made by the store.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In addition, the Commission requested further information from WREO regarding its \u201cpolicy\u201d decision to cancel the Union\u2019s advertising, and regarding a conversation between the station manager and Hill\u2019s advertising agency at which the agency representative had contended that \u201csome of the ads of Local 880 were possibly illegal.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">Shortly thereafter, WREO replied. It categorically denied that any agent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Hill\u2019s at any time during 1966 sought to influence WREO concerning the cancellation of the Union\u2019s advertising. It explained the conversation regarding the \u201cpossibly illegal\u201d Union advertisements as an uninfluential, isolated remark made during the course of a normal sales call.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> With regard to the station\u2019s decision to cancel the Union\u2019s advertising, the letter provided the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\">WREO has been operating as an independently owned radio station since 1937. During these years we afforded the public a service compatible with good taste and minimal irritation. We never permitted ourselves to be influenced or coerced in the use of air time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">Our policy also has been to avoid airing private controversies since statements might be made of a possibly damaging nature to persons or businesses, and as a generality such controversies were of a private and not of a public interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">WREO had carried about 322 of Local 880\u2019s announcements when it became apparent, from complaints of the public, that the continuous repetition of these partisan announcements had become an irritant to WREO\u2019s listening audience. The advertisements concerned a controversy in which the public and WREO were not a part of [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">We therefore notified both parties that we would accept no more announcements concerning the strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">The Union then sent a letter to WREO and stated that the public had a right to have information concerning this private labor dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">WREO bent over backwards then to offer the union free time on the air at a WREO sponsored round table to discuss the labor dispute with Hill\u2019s, so if there was any possible public interest the matter could be heard. The union did not accept this opportunity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_R\">This response appeared to satisfy the Commission. On December 2, 1968, it released a Memorandum Opinion and Order <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> in which it found \u201cno unresolved questions of fact remaining,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and therefore no necessity for a hearing. It accepted Hill\u2019s and WREO\u2019s denials of improper influence, noting that the Union had come forward with no further factual material to support its allegations. As to the Fairness Doctrine aspect of the Union\u2019s claim, the Commission noted that WREO \u201chas presented the [Union\u2019s] advertisements,\u201d and that after refusing to accept further copy on the subject it nevertheless offered free air time for a roundtable discussion. \u201cIn the circumstances,\u201d the Commission concluded, \u201cthere is no need to consider further issues under the fairness doctrine.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> From this decision the Union appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"> We have previously had occasion to point out that the Federal Communications Commission was intended by Congress to function as far more than a mere referee between conflicting parties.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Regardless of the formal status of a party, or the technical merits of a particular petition, the FCC \u201cshould not close its eyes to the public interest factors\u201d raised by material in its files.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We have noted that, as a general matter, the federal regulatory agencies should construe pleadings filed before them so as to raise rather than avoid important questions. They \u201cshould not adopt procedures that foreclose full inquiry into broad public interest questions, either patent or latent.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">As a rule, \u201can administrative approval without the benefit of a hearing is to be avoided.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> As we said in Clarksburg Publishing Co. v. FCC,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"a0h-dedup-0\">The statute contemplates that, in appropriate cases, the Commission\u2019s inquiry will extend beyond matters alleged in the protest in order to reach any issue which may be relevant in determining the legality of the challeged grant, [<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>] Clearly, then, the inquiry cannot be limited to the facts alleged in the protest where the Commission has reason to believe, either from the protest or its own files, that a full evidentiary hearing may develop other relevant information not in the possession of the protestant.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-18\">We need not here decide whether the Union\u2019s allegations that im.proper economic pressure had been exerted upon WREO to cause it to cancel Union advertising raises an issue of \u201csuch overriding public interest that the Commission would have been bound to consider [it] on its own initiative.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We are convinced, however, that on the present record something more than summary treatment of the Union\u2019s allegations was required.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The Union\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>claim that no radio station serving Ash-tabula would carry its advertisements stands undisputed. It can hardly be said that the proffered advertisements were objectionable on their face.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> WREO had, in fact, carried 322 such announcements without any apparent hesitation. Nothing in the record suggests that mere repetition was the basis for discontinuing the advertisements, and the station did not offer to broadcast a more limited number of spot announcements, or suggest to the Union that it change its copy more frequently than had been its practice. Moreover, in the nine months following cancellation WREO broadcast more than a thousand spot announcements for Hill\u2019s Ashtabula, an average of over one hundred per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Nor can we or the Commission be oblivious of the attitudes of other stations in the area.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> It strikes us as curious, at least, that the general attitude of enterprises whose very existence was dependent upon advertising revenues appears to have been that the proffered advertising would be rejected unless the public interest <em>compelled </em>its presentation.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Certainly these circumstances may validly be considered as giving rise to a justifiable suspicion that something might have been amiss. Viewed against this background, we cannot say that the responses of Hill\u2019s Ashtabula<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and WREO<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> satisfactorily disposed of the matter. Explaining is decision to cancel the Union\u2019s advertisements, WREO merely stated that it had become \u201capparent, from complaints of the public, that the continuous repetition of these partisan announcements had become an irritant to WREO\u2019s listening audience.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The station never undertook to explain how many complaints it had received, or from whom they came; whether complaints had been received regarding other advertisements carried by the station; whether its general policy was to cancel all advertising that was the subject of some listener complaints; or whether the public\u2019s objections might have been cured by less frequent broadcasting of the announcements, or more frequent changes in the Union\u2019s copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">In light of these ambiguities in the station\u2019s response, some further investigation was certainly necessary. It may well be that, with proper use of the discovery mechanisms available in such matters,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> an adequate record can be made without the necessity for a full-dress evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> We hold only that, on the present record, the undisputed facts raise questions adequately answered neither by the station\u2019s ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>planations nor by the Commission\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> In these circumstances, we cannot say that the renewal of WREO\u2019s license is properly supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">We are likewise concerned by the Commission\u2019s summary treatment of the fairness question.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Since the case is to be remanded in any event, there is no need for a full discussion of the question here. But in light of the inadequacy of the Commission\u2019s opinion on this point, we believe it wise to provide a brief indication of some of the issues the Commission should face in this regard upon remand.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">A. Since its inception, federal regulation of radio and television broadcasting has been premised in large part upon the assumption that physical factors unique to this means of communication make both appropriate and necessary special means of regulation that will take into account the particular characteristics of the medium. The limited number of channels available for broadcast, and the possibility of interference among neighboring stations, of necessity required restrictions upon persons seeking to make use of the airwaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">These restrictions could, perhaps, have been limited to technical matters : allocation of broadcast frequencies, transmitter power, and the like. This, however, has not been the case. Instead, the Commission has interpreted its statutory mandate to insure that broadcasting serves the \u201cpublic interest, convenience, and necessity\u201d <footnotemark>51</footnotemark> as authority for at least limited regulation of the content of broadcast material.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The bulk of this regulation has been subsumed under the Commission\u2019s \u201cfairness doctrine.\u201d Simply stated, the doctrine requires each broadcaster to afford \u201creasonable opportunity for the presentation of contrasting viewpoints on controversial issues of public importance.\u201d <footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>As the doctrine has developed, its central purpose has become increasingly clear. That purpose has been to insure both that the listening public is presented with information regarding controversial issues of public importance,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> and that facts, analysis, and argument supporting all reasonable positions on a given issue are aired by the broadcasters.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> That is, central to the fairness doctrine is the promotion of informed decision-making by the public by insuring that the facts and arguments relevant to decision are made available to the listening audience.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">If this were the whole of the doctrine, it might well be that no substantial question would be raised by WREO\u2019s denial of air time to the Union for its advertisements. More than three hundred spot announcements had been broadcast by the station in less than two months. Taking the sample before us <footnotemark>56</footnotemark> as typical, the advertisements merely stated that a strike was in progress, listed the issues in dispute but without giving any indication of the positions of the opposing parties, and urged without giving any reasons that listeners support the Union by boycotting Hill's Department Stores. It is difficult to see how repetition of this or similar copy would add to public knowledge, except perhaps that each repetition of the advertisement would inform the public that the strike was still in progress \u2014 information that we may well assume was sufficiently presented by regular broadcasts of local news.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">But the Supreme Court,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> this court,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> and the Commission itself have all recognized that the fairness doctrine is not an island whole unto itself. It is merely one aspect of the Commission\u2019s implementation of the requirement that broadcast stations serve the public \u201cinterest, convenience, and necessity.\u201d Accordingly, although as a general matter equal time is not required so long as a reasonable opportunity is afforded for the presentation of opposing viewpoints,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> the Commission has upon occasion recognized that time, rather than information, is of the essence. Thus, in regard to broadcast spot announcements soliciting campaign contributions, the Commission has recognized that at least with regard to two major party candidates, \u201cfairness would obviously require that these two be treated <em>roughly </em>the same with respect to the announcements.\u201d <footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Presumably, the additional <em>information </em>presented to the public by repeated announcements would be minimal; the value of repetition would be solely in the additional coverage obtained.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Similarly, in Times-Mirror<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> a station had aired more than 20 broadcasts by commentators favoring one major-party candidate for governor, and 2 broadcasts by commentators favoring his opponent. Summarizing its ruling, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the Commission stated that \u201c[t]he continuous, repetitive opportunity afforded for the expression of the commentators\u2019 viewpoints on the gubernatorial campaign, in contrast to the minimal opportunity afforded to opposing viewpoints, violated the right of the public to a fair presentation of views.\u201d <footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Most recently, in the Commission\u2019s landmark ruling on cigarette advertising,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> the Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\">We think that the frequency of the presentation of one side of the controversy is a factor appropriately to be considered in our administration of the Fairness Doctrine. * * * For, while the Fairness Doctrine does not contemplate \u201cequal time\u201d, if the presentation of one side of the issue is on a regular continual basis, fairness and the right of the public adequately to be informed compels the conclusion that there must be some regularity in the presentation of the other side of the issue.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">In the present case, it seems clear to us that the strike and the Union boycott were controversial issues of substantial public importance within Ashtabula, the locality primarily served by WREO. The ultimate issue with regard to the boycott was simple: whether or not the public should patronize Hill\u2019s Ashtabula. From April through December, Hill\u2019s broadcast over WREO more than a thousand spot announcements and more than a hundred sponsored programs explaining why, in its opinion, the public should patronize its store. During that same period, the Union was denied any opportunity beyond a single roundtable broadcast to explain why, in its opinion, the public should not patronize the store. We need not now decide whether, as the Union would have us hold, these facts make out a <em>per se </em>claim of a violation of the fairness doctrine. We do believe, however, that the question deserves fuller analysis than the Commission has seen fit to give it.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">B. Central to the Union\u2019s argument on this point is the proposition that, in urging listeners to patronize Hill\u2019s Ash-tabula Department Store, Hill\u2019s advertisements presented one side of a controversial issue of public importance. Hill\u2019s copy, of course, made no mention of the strike or boycott, or of the unresolved issues between the Union and the store. But the advertisements did urge the listening public to take one of the two competing sides on the boycott question \u2014they urged the public to patronize the store, <em>i. e., </em>not to boycott it. It seems to us an inadequate answer to this argument merely to point out that Hill\u2019s copy made no specific mention of the boycott. In dealing with cigarette advertising, the Commission has recognized that a position represented by an advertisement may be implicit rather than explicit<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> And although the Commission repeatedly emphasized that its holding in that ease \u2014that stations broadcasting cigarette advertisements must regularly provide free time if necessary for the presentation of arguments opposing cigarette smoking \u2014 was limited to cigarette advertising, the reasons advanced by the Commission to support that limitation seem to us not to imply that other advertisements may not carry an implicit as well as an explicit message, but rather that the implicit and explicit messages normally carried by advertising do not concern controversial issues of public importance.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>C. The Commission\u2019s ruling with regard to cigarette advertising relied heavily upon the judgment of other branches of government that, in light of the possible dangers of smoking \u201cto the health of millions of persons,\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> the question whether or not to smoke cigarettes was one of substantial importance to the public.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> In its regulation of. labor-management relations, Congress has indicated substantial concern with equalizing the bargaining power of employees and their employers.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Stripped to its essentials, this dispute is one facet of the economic warfare that is a recognized part of labor-management relations: the Union, in urging a boycott of Hill\u2019s Department Stores, was seeking to put economic pressure upon management to accede to its demands; management, on the other hand, was seeking to resist the Union\u2019s pressure by continuing profitable operations. Part of the Union\u2019s campaign was publicity for its boycott; part of management\u2019s arsenal was advertising to persuade the public to patronize its stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">If viewed in this light, it could well be argued that the traditional purposes of the fairness doctrine are not substantially served by presentation of advertisements intended less to inform than to serve merely as a weapon in a labor-management dispute. But the fairness doctrine, as we have pointed out, is only one aspect of the FCC\u2019s implementation of the statutory requirement that broadcast stations operate to serve the public interest.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> The public policy of the United States has been declared by Congress as favoring the equalization of economic bargaining power between workers and their employers.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> It is at the very least a fair question whether a radio station properly serves the public interest by making available to an employer broadcast time for the purpose of urging the public to patronize his store, while denying the employees any remotely comparable opportunity to urge the public to join their side of the strife and boycott the employer. If the Union\u2019s claim is to be rejected, we believe this question should be dealt with by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">In summary, we believe that the Union\u2019s evidence of denial of access to radio air time raised questions regarding possible improper influence by Hill\u2019s that were not adequately answered by Hill\u2019s bare denial and the station\u2019s letter of denial and explanation. With regard to the Union\u2019s fairness question, we recognize the primary responsibility, of the FCC in assuring that radio broadcasters operate their stations in the public interest. We have not here attempted a full canvass of the issues raised by even a good-faith denial to the Union of access to broadcast time; we have merely sought to indicate some of the questions that must be answered. We do believe, however, that these issues deserve far more comprehensive treatment than was afforded them by the FCC.

The picket line is in support of the strike at <em>Hill\u2019s Department Store </em>in Ashtabula. This strike now in progress at <em>HilVs </em>comes after seven months of continuous negotiations, during which no agreement has been reached between the Retail Store Employees Union Local 880 \u2014 and the management of HILL\u2019S DEPARTMENT STORE. Important issues still unresolved include Union Security, Arbitration and Grievance Procedure, Health and Welfare, Funeral Leave, and Visitation Rights to the store. These, and other, issues are vital to the betterment of the store employees working conditions. <em>Some </em>Hill\u2019s employees are still working because if they <em>all </em>go out \u2014 the Company would try to replace them with non-union help who could be granted a vote in subsequent elections. The 2,000 members of Retail Store Employees Union Local 880 request that <em>all </em>union members, their families and friends observe and respect the picket line now at HILL\u2019S DEPARTMENT STORE.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b322-13\">.

In this regard we would emphasize that, even assuming that Hill\u2019s Ashtabula made neither direct nor indirect suggestions that Union advertising be cancelled, there remains the question whether WREO\u2019s action was nevertheless motivated by a desire to gratify the unspoken wish of what appears to have been a major advertising client.

The Commission found that, since WREO had presented some of the Union\u2019s advertisements, had refused to accept copy regarding the strike from either party, and had offered free time for a roundtable discussion of the issues, there was \u201cno need to consider further issues under the fairness doctrine.\u201d No authority was cited for this statement; <em>of. </em>The Evening News Association, 6 P &amp; F Radio Reg. 283 (April 21, 1950).

With commendable candor, the Union on this appeal has stated its belief, that, even if a violation of the fairness doctrine has occurred, this single violation in the circumstances of this case would not warrant denial of WREO\u2019s application for renewal of its license. Should the Commission agree, and should it find upon proper investigation that WREO\u2019s cancellation of Union advertising was otherwise not improper, it might wish to consider the advisability of separating the question of WREO\u2019s compliance with the fairness doctrine from the license renewal proceedings. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 312(b) (1964) ; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(e) (Supp. V, 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b328-12\">. <em>See, e. g\u201e </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(a), (d) (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b328-13\">.

So far as material here the ground of the petition was that the station had violated the Commission\u2019s Fairness Doctrine. It was alleged that: After a long campaign the Union organized the retail store employees of Hill\u2019s Department Store in Ashtabula, Ohio, and in April 1965 the Union was certified as the collective bargaining agent for the employees. After some ten months of unsuccessful bargaining the Union placed pickets in front of Hill\u2019s store and undertook to present its case by means of newspaper and radio advertisements. Commercial time was purchased from Station WREO and from stations located in other communities where Hill\u2019s operated stores. The radio message explained that a strike was in progress, that certain issues were unresolved and that Hill\u2019s Department Store was being picketed. In conclusion the message urged that all union members, their families and friends observe and respect the picket line.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">According to the petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">\u201cWhen [the Union\u2019s] commercial message was first offered to the stations in early 1966, there was no difficulty, no objection, no hesitation in using it. Then, suddenly, without warning, or without adequate explanation, all within a period of a few days, station after station in Northeast Ohio found it necessary to cut off the Union\u2019s advertising.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">\u201cAn important consideration is that at the same time, Hill\u2019s was engaged in commercial advertising over the stations involved, broadcasting its message of bargains for the consumer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">* * * -X- * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">\u201cOne needs to be neither cynic nor seer to understand why the Union was deprived of its right to advertise to the public on an issue of such a controversial nature. The answer is as old as the history of human pressure: one may assume that Hill\u2019s passed the \u2018word\u2019 to the Station, and that was enough.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">In its answer to the petition Station WREO denied that it had violated the Fairness Doctrine and said that the station had offered to present without charge a program on which both the Union and Hill\u2019s Department Store could express their views.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">The Union\u2019s petition was not supported by affidavit as required by \u00a7 309(d) (1) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(d) (1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless the Commission, as it was empowered to do under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 308(b), by written questions required further written statements of fact from Station WREO.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From these statements it appeared that between February 16 and April 5, 1966, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>WREO carried approximately 322 of the Union\u2019s announcements. The announcements were discontinued on April 5, 1966. According to the station the reason for the discontinuance was that \u201cthe continuous repetition of these partisan announcements had become an irritant to WREO\u2019s listening audience\u201d; that the station felt it would \u201chave no further part in the controversy which was going on between the Union and Hill\u2019s Department Store\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Both the station and Hill\u2019s flatly denied that the store or anyone on its behalf had sought to influence WREO in the matter of the cancellation of the Union\u2019s announcements. It was conceded that commercial advertisements on behalf of Hill\u2019s Department Store were carried by the station throughout the year 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">On these facts the Commission in its Memorandum Opinion concluded first that the Union\u2019s petition to deny was defective, in that it was not supported by a statement under oath that the allegations contained therein were true to the personal knowledge of the affiant. The Commission concluded further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">\u201cAs to the fairness aspect, .the licensee has presented the Local 880\u2019s advertisements, and after notifying Hill\u2019s and Local 880 that it would air no more announcements on the subject of the Ashtabula strike, it issued both sides an invitation to air their respective views on the strike over its facilities free of charge. In the circumstances, there is no need to consider further issues under the fairness doctrine. Further, we hold that WREO\u2019s refusal to accept additional ads from Local 880 after April 1966 was, for the reasons advanced by the station, within the proper limits of its discretion (Mclntire v. Wm. Penn Broadcasting Co., 151 F.2d 597, (1945)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOYs\">Finally, the Commission found that there were no unresolved questions of fact remaining and that the grant of the WREO renewal would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity; and accordingly, the Union\u2019s petition was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">On this appeal the Union in its brief concedes that, \u201cThe Union was unable to substantiate its claim that Hill\u2019s had brought pressure on the stations, which reduces the issues here primarily to the fairness doctrine and collateral legal questions involved, including that of a hearing.\u201d In substance the Union argues that the Commission was arbitrary and capricious in finding, without a hearing, that WREO had not violated the Fairness Doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The Communications Act provides that no hearing on a petition to deny the renewal of a broadcast license need be held if the petition fails to contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to show that the petitioner is a party in interest and that the renewal would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309 (d) (1). If there are no substantial and material questions of fact and the renewal would be consistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity the petition shall be denied and the renewal granted without a hearing. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(d) (2). If the Commission cannot make such a finding, however, and if a substantial and material question of fact is presented, the application for renewal shall be set for hearing on the issues raised. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(e). <em>See </em>Southwestern Operating Company v. F. C. C., 122 U.S.App.D.C. 137, 351 F.2d 834 (1965). The question before us therefore is whether the Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding that there was no substantial and material question of fact with respect to the alleged violation of the Fairness Doctrine by Station WREO, and in finding without a hearing that a renewal of the station\u2019s license would be consistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The essential facts material to the alleged violation of the Fairness Doctrine by the station are plain. Over a period of approximately seven weeks in 1966 the station broadcast some 322 of the Union\u2019s announcements. The announcements were then discontinued by the sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>tion for the assigned reason that they were annoying to listeners and that the station did not choose to become involved in the labor dispute. During this same period the station broadcast commercial advertising for Hill\u2019s Department Store, and these broadcasts were continued after the Union announcements were stopped. On these facts the Commission held as a matter of law that there had been no violation of the Fairness Doctrine by Station WREO.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The Fairness Doctrine promulgated by the Commission requires that a broadcaster give adequate coverage to public issues and that coverage must be fair in that it reflects the opposing views. Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. F. C. C., 395 U.S. 367, 377, 89 S.Ct. 794, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969). The interpretation and application of the Doctrine are primarily matters confided to the sound judgment and discretion of the Commission. <em>Cf. </em>Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965). In the administration of the Doctrine the Commission has stated that the selection and presentation of program material are the responsibility of the licensee, not the Commission; and all the Commission requires is that the licensee make a reasonable effort in good faith to give a fair and well-rounded presentation of public issues. <em>See </em>Report on Editorializing by Broadcast Licensees, 13 F.C.C. 1246 (1949); Letter to Oren Harris, 3 Pike &amp; Fischer, R.R.2d 163, 167 (1963); Applicability of the Fairness Doctrine in the Handling of Controversial Issues of Public Importance (Fairness Primer), 29 Fed.Reg. 10415, 10416 (1964). In many decisions applying these principles to specific cases the Commission has held that broadcasters have a wide area of discretion in which to exercise their journalistic judgment in complying with the Fairness Doctrine, and that review by the Commission of the actions of licensees in this area is limited to a determination of the good faith and reasonable nature of such actions. <em>See </em>Citizens Against Proposition 15, 3 Pike &amp; Fischer, R.R.2d 777 (1964) ; Mid-Florida Television Corp., 4 Pike &amp; Fischer, R.R.2d 192 (1964); Mrs. Madalyn Murray, 5 Pike &amp; Fischer, R.R.2d 263 (1965); American Friends of Vietnam, Inc., 6 Pike &amp; Fischer, R.R.2d 126 (1965); Miss Geri Tully, 6 Pike &amp; Fischer, R.R.2d 123 (1965). It is established law that the scope of this court\u2019s review in such cases is limited and that when there is a rational basis in the record for the result reached by the Commission its action should be affirmed. <em>See </em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. F. C. C., 395 U.S. 367, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969); Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 351 U.S. 192, 76 S.Ct. 763, 100 L.Ed. 1081 (1956); McCarthy v. F. C. C., 129 U.S.App.D.C. 56, 390 F.2d 471 (1968); Philadelphia Television Broadcasting Co. v. F. C. C., 123 U.S.App.D.C. 298, 359 F.2d 282 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">The Commission in its brief, and for the purposes of this litigation, assumes that the Fairness Doctrine applies in the circumstances of this case. Assuming that the Fairness Doctrine applies, I would hold that the Commission\u2019s decision to renew WREO\u2019s license has a rational basis in the record and is a reasonable application of the Doctrine. I would hold further that on the undisputed facts no hearing was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">There is a reasonable basis in the record for the Commission\u2019s conclusion that WREO dealt with the Union fairly and in good faith. The station carried the Union\u2019s message on 322 occasions over a period of weeks, so that the public was fully advised as to the Union\u2019s views with respect to the pending labor dispute. In addition, the station offered free time to the Union to present its views in a discussion program with representatives of the store. The offer was rejected by the Union. Finally, as the Union now concedes, investigation disclosed that there was no basis in fact for the allegation that in terminating the Union\u2019s announcements the station acted in bad faith as a result of pressure by the department store. On such a record I can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>not say that the Commission was arbitrary or capricious in finding that there was no violation of the Fairness Doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The Commission\u2019s decision with respect to the station\u2019s alleged violation of the Fairness Doctrine was based upon the facts disclosed in the pleadings and developed by the Commission\u2019s own investigation. In this situation it was not unreasonable for the Commission to conclude that no hearing was necessary; for the facts having been established, there was nothing to hear. In my judgment a \u201csuspicion that something might have been amiss\u201d, upon which the majority opinion relies, was not enough to call for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The only remaining question was whether the Union alleged facts sufficient to make a prima facie showing that renewal of WREO\u2019s license would not serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. Since the Union\u2019s petition was based wholly on an alleged violation of the Fairness Doctrine, a violation the Commission did not find, the answer to this question was plainly no. I conclude, therefore, that renewal of WREO\u2019s broadcasting license was not arbitrary or capricious and that the action of the Commission should be affirmed on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Although for the purposes of discussion I have accepted the Commission\u2019s assumption that the Fairness Doctrine could be applied in this case, I think the assumption is invalid. Specifically, I cannot accept the implicit premise of the majority opinion, that when a radio station has broadcast advertisements of the goods or services of a private business which is engaged in a dispute with a labor union, the Fairness Doctrine requires the station to broadcast the union\u2019s views on the labor dispute. In my judgment this case illustrates the fallacy of that premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">According to the Union\u2019s broadcast message the important unresolved issues in its dispute with the \u00a1\u00a1store were \u201cUnion Security, Arbitration and Grievance Procedure, Health and Welfare, Funeral Leave, and Visitation Rights to the store\u201d. See Note 1, above. The store\u2019s routine advertisements of goods and wares for sale were not relevant to the issues thus formulated by the Union, that is, the advertisements were not a presentation of the store\u2019s side of the labor controversy. Accordingly, there was no occasion to invoke the Fairness Doctrine to assure that the Union\u2019s side would be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">The theory of the majority would extend to the store\u2019s advertisements the rule applied by the Commission in the case of cigarette advertising. In the Matter of Television Station WCBS-TV, New York, New York (Applicability of Fairness Doctrine to cigarette advertising) 9 F.C.C.2d 921 (1967). As the Commission in its opinion emphasized, however, \u201ccigarette advertising presents a unique situation\u201d. (9 F.C.C.2d at 942, 943.) I cannot agree that the principle of that decision ought to be applied to the commercial advertising of a department store simply because the store at the moment is involved in a labor dispute.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\">. The full text of the Union\u2019s message was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">\u201cANNCR: Here is an important message from RETAIL STORE EMPLOYEES UNION LOCAL 880 \u2014 regarding the picket line now at HILL\u2019S DEPARTMENT STORE in Youngstown. The picket line is in support of the strike at HILL\u2019S DEPARTMENT STORE in Ashtabula. This strike now in progress at HILL\u2019S comes after seven months of continuous negotiations, during which no agreement has been reached between the Retail Store Employees Union Local 880 \u2014 and the management of HILL\u2019S DEPARTMENT STORE. Important issues still not resolved include Union Security, Arbitration and Grievance Procedure, Health and Welfare, Funeral Leave, and Visitation Rights to the store. These, and other issues are vital to the betterment of the store employees working conditions! <em>Some </em>Hill\u2019s employees are still working because \u2014 if they <em>all </em>go out \u2014 the Company would try to replace them with non-union help who could be granted a vote in subsequent elections.
