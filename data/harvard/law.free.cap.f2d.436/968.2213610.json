Pardo was sentenced to serve ten years in the custody of the Attorney General; Mrs. Martinez, six years. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-22\">Armed with a valid warrant to search the premises, and such automobiles as might be on the premises, officers arrived at 251 Linares Street, San Antonio, Texas, early on the morning of September 4, 1969. The officers proceeded. to the front of the house and knocked on the door. After waiting a few seconds, one officer shouted, \u201cPolice officers. Search warrant.\u201d Agent Vollmer testified that he waited several more seconds and then heard a noise inside the house that \u201csounded like springs on the bed or scuffling.\u201d The officers forced their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>way into the house and found the defendants in the bedroom. An agent testified that about fifteen seconds elapsed between the first knock and their entry into the defendants\u2019 bedroom. Subduing the defendants, the officers announced their purpose and presented the search warrant. Their subsequent search of the premises uncovered a substantial quantity of heroin not in the original stamped package.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">On appeal Pardo and Mrs. Martinez contend that in executing the search warrant the officers failed to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the district court therefore erred in denying their motion to suppress the evidence seized in the search. The defendants argue that the officers did not give them an opportunity to open the door before the forcible entry and that no circumstances existed to justify the officers\u2019 failure to do so. <em>See </em>Miller v. United States, 1958, 357 U.S. 301, 78 S.Ct. 1190, 2 L.Ed.2d 1332; Munoz v. United States, 9 Cir. 1963, 325 F.2d 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">We need not decide the issue whether the officers violated the standards set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109. The search warrant, admittedly valid, authorized the officers to search such automobiles as might be found on the premises at 251 Linares Street. At that address the officers found a 1959 Chevrolet automobile parked in the driveway. Their search of the car uncovered not only unstamped containers of heroin, but also balloons, cellophane papers, measuring spoons, and razor blades \u2014 items used in the preparation of heroin for resale. These items were all introduced as evidence of the defendants\u2019 trial. Agent Hambrick testified that after being given the required warnings, the defendants admitted that the automobile was theirs. Section 3109, of course, does not apply to the search of an automobile, and we can perceive of no constitutional objections that could be lodged against the search of the automobile in question. Since we have thus found sufficient admissible evidence to warrant the defendants\u2019 convictions, any error in the admission of the evidence found inside the house would be harmless. <em>See </em>Harrington v. California, 1969, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284; Chapman v. California, 1967, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-11\">Therefore, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">. \u00a7 3109. Breaking doors or windows for entry or exit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-8\">The officer may break open any outer or inner door or window of a house, or any part of a house, or anything therein, to execute a search warrant, if, after notice of his authority and purpose, he is refused admittance or when necessary to liberate himself or a person aiding him in the execution of the warrant.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
