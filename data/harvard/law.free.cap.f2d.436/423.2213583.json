They appeal from the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-22\">For the reasons stated by the district court,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> we are persuaded that the defendants were entitled to discharge the plaintiffs for any reason other than for their exercise of constitutionally protected rights, and that there was no requirement that any administrative hearing be held. In the face of the record demonstrating without contradiction that the plaintiffs had refused to perform their duties under conditions of extreme peril to users of the state\u2019s highways, we agree that the district court correctly held that their exhibits and other supporting papers failed to show the existence of any triable issue of fact relating to the reason for their discharge. The grant of summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b495-35\"> Kirker v.
