(29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, et seq.). Respondent cross-petitions for a decree enforcing its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-15\">A discussion of the facts would add nothing to the existing law on the issues before us. After an examination of the entire record, we hold that there is substantial evidence supporting the Board\u2019s findings: (1) that petitioner violated Sections 8(a) (5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act by refusing to bargain in good faith with reference to wages; (2) that the March 4, 1968, strike was an unfair labor practice strike; (3) that petitioner violated Sections 8(a) (5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act by withdrawing recognition from the union on March 19, 1968, and (4) that petitioner unlawfully promised benefits to employees in return for their not supporting the union.

Katz, 369 U.S. 736, 747, 82 S.Ct. 1107, 8 L.Ed.2d 230 (1962), and many other authorities, support our conclusion that the order of the Board must be enforced in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-18\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
