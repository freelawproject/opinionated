Maryland, 1969, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707. The district court denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">We affirm on the opinion of the district court, Staggers v. Stynchcombe, Sheriff, N.D.Ga., 1970, 319 F.Supp. 1305, and with the following additional statement. Appellant narrows his position to the following argument. His first trial was reversed on the basis of insufficiency of evidence \u2014 the failure of the state to prove an element of the offense charged. He would thus have been entitled to a direct verdict of acquittal. He was required to proceed by motion for new trial inasmuch as there is no Georgia procedure for moving for a directed verdict. He is entitled to have his case considered as if he had moved for a directed verdict, and it follows that there could be no retrial if state reversal had been for error in failing to direct a verdict of acquittal. We conclude that this argument is foreclosed from a double jeopardy standpoint by Bryan v. United States, 1950, 338 U.S. 552, 70 S.Ct. 317, 94 L.Ed. 335. See also Gilmore v. United States, 5 Cir., 1959, 264 F.2d 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
