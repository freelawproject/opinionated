On this appeal they attack an in-custody identification under non-lineup circumstances following their arrest and in the absence of counsel, which allegedly furnished the basis of their identification in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">Although the case has been accorded full consideration on the record and briefs, no need for argument or detailed opinion is found here.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">The question of the in-court personal identification was imported into the ease through the cross-examination by appellants\u2019 counsel of the government\u2019s main witness whose related testimony on direct had been rather narrowly confined to the appearance of certain clothing observed at the time of the crime and at the time of a scene-of-arrest confrontation. Assuming that appellants now have standing to complain, we believe that the scene-of-arrest identification, if it mhy be called that, shortly following the crime was warranted under the particular circumstances of this case, was not unduly suggestive, and the doctrine of Russell v. United States, 133 U.S.App.D.C. 77, 408 F.2d 1280, cert. denied, 395 U.S. 928, 89 S.Ct. 1786, 23 L.Ed.2d 245 (1969), is controlling. <em>See also </em>Stewart v.

United States, 133 U.S.App.D.C. 103, 408 F.2d 1306 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-11\">Accordingly, the judgments of the District Court are</p>\n<p id=\"aib-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
