It includes an express provision for punishment of receipt of the stolen government property. In Milan-ovich v. United States, 865 U.S. 551, 554, 81 S.Ct. 728, 729, 5 L.Ed.2d 773 (1961), the Supreme Court held that a person could not be convicted of both theft and receipt of the same government property under section 641 because in adding the prohibition against receipt to the earlier prohibition against theft, \u201c \u2018Congress was trying to reach a new group of wrongdoers, not to multiply the offense of the * * * robbers themselves.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ah3-dedup-0\">In this case the theft was not charged under section 641 but rather under section 2114, a special statute applicable only to theft of government property from the person of the lawful custodian of such property. Section 2114, however, has no provision punishing receipt of the stolen property. See note 1. Of necessity, therefore, the receiving charge was lodged under section 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">But, as we have seen, Congress adopted the receiving prohibition of section 641 to punish a new group of wrongdoers \u2014 those who received the stolen government property \u2014 and <em>not to </em>increase the punishment of the thieves themselves. <em>Milanovich, supra. </em>It would be a remarkable feat of statutory construction indeed to hold that these very words in this same statute have exactly the opposite meaning when applied to thieves charged under section 2114. At the very least, such an interpretation would require some evidence to support it, and the government has offered none.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">We conclude that, under <em>Milanovich, </em>the jury should have been instructed that O\u2019Neil could be convicted of robbery or receiving but not of both. Failure to so instruct was plain error affecting O\u2019Neil\u2019s substantial rights. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). <em>See </em>Thomas v. United States, 418 F.2d 567, 568 (5th Cir. 1969); Baker v.

United States, 403 F.2d 1013, 1015-1016 (9th Cir. 1968), is not inconsistent with our disposition here. In <em>McCullough, </em>the defendant was convicted of the theft, receipt, and sale of government property. He was sentenced to two years on each count, the sentences to run concurrently. The court refused to hold the absence of the required instruction plain error because reversal on the theft and receiving counts would not affect the valid conviction on the sale count. O\u2019Neil, in contrast, is in the same position as the defendant in <em>Milanovich.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
