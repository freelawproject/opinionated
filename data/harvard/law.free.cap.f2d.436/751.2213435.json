JOSEPH SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b824-19\">Petitioner, a cadet at West Point, sought separation from the Academy at the end of his third year because he had become a conscientious objector. A cadet may not withdraw from the Academy after his second year without incurring an immediate military duty requirement unless excused by separation as a conscientious objector. The Army rejected his conscientious objector claims on the grounds that his beliefs lacked the necessary depth of sincerity. Petitioner brought an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for a writ of habeas corpus, attacking both the substance of and procedure leading up to the Army\u2019s decision. The court, Marvin E. Frankel, <em>Judge, </em>denied the writ. We find error and reverse and remand with instructions to stay active duty orders pending further proceedings by the Army.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-20\">The points in issue on appeal are, basically, three: what is the applicable standard of judicial review; was the Army\u2019s decision supportable under the correct standard; and in any case, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>the Army fail to follow its own regulations, to the prejudice of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">It has long been established that the proper standard of review in Selective Service cases has been whether the deciding body had any basis in fact for its decision. Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 122-123, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1946). Originally, it seems that both sides in this case accepted the application of that standard here. However, petitioner, subsequent to the initial hearing in the district court, argued that the \u201cno basis-in-fact\u201d standard is unconstitutional as applied here, and that the proper standard of review is the one familiar in the administrative law area, \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d Judge Frankel rejected the argument. Petitioner argues that although the standard may be constitutional in the Selective Service area, it is not when applied to an in-service conscientious objector applicant. This is so because \u201call of the officers conducting interviews and making decisions are in the Army, and there is no right to appeal from the Army determination.\u201d It is contended that the Army officer who hears the applicant\u2019s case generally possesses views that \u201cconcededly do not embrace conscientious objection and whose very position in the Army may make it impossible for him to be objective.\u201d In Selective Service cases, on the other hand, the local board consists of volunteer civilians, and there is a right of appeal to the State Appeal Board. This argument, however, is based on unproven assumptions. We cannot say that fair determination is not possible within the military, and the Army regulations themselves are designed to provide it. However, even though the standard is the same as in draft cases, and review is limited to the narrow issue of whether there is a basis in fact for the Army determination, the courts have, of course, required the Army to base its findings upon objective evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">In any case, petitioner argues that there was no basis in fact for the Army\u2019s decision. This claim we must reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">Judge Frankel expressed the opinion that if he had been commissioned to decide independently petitioner\u2019s application for discharge, petitioner\u2019s arguments might have prevailed. Judge Frankel felt, however, that given the court\u2019s more limited role, he was forced to uphold the Army\u2019s decision, since there did exist a basis in fact to support it. Were there complete compliance with the Army requirements in reaching the determination, we would be constrained to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">Petitioner filed his application for discharge on May 29, 1970. He stated that his \u201cbeliefs concerning war stem from a belief in God and in the New Testament teachings of Christ.\u201d He believed that he had no right to take the life of any other person, yet in the Army, one is taught that killing is not only necessary but is also acceptable. He said his beliefs stemmed from childhood, but, somewhat surprisingly, he went on to note that \u201cWest Point has been a goal of mine for many years,\u201d for the prestige, because it provided a way to serve his country and because it \u201cseemed to offer everything worthwhile in an education.\u201d Although the bayonet training was disturbing at the outset, he pushed it to the back of his mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>It was a combination of several factors, petitioner claimed, that combined to cause his ultimate \u201ccrystallization.\u201d First, when he was called upon to teach plebes the use of the bayonet, he found himself thinking \u201csomber thoughts.\u201d Secondly, the yietnam moratorium of that fall and news of the My Lai incident \u201cboth had a profound effect\u201d on him. Finally, the news that one of the boys with whom he had gone to high school was. killed in Vietnam made him realize that people really die in wars. A number of those with intimate contacts with Donham certified to the sincerity and depth of his evolving scruples of conscience.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">In accord with Army regulations, petitioner was interviewed by a chaplain, a psychiatrist, and an Army officer. Both the chaplain and the psychiatrist expressed the view that petitioner was sincere in his convictions and a man of integrity. The Army officer, Lt. Col. Gleason, however, felt quite differently. Colonel Gleason\u2019s major concern was the fact that petitioner had waited until after final examinations his third year to file his application, even though he admitted that his beliefs against war had crystallized at least several months earlier. At his interview with Colonel Gleason, petitioner candidly admitted that he waited until after final examinations because \u201cI did not know whether I would be permitted to' finish the school year.\u201d Judge Frankel concluded that the Army\u2019s decision had a basis in fact, since, \u201cwhile petitioner postponed disclosure, he continued to serve in an establishment and learn and teach things he then claimed to find intolerable as a matter of conscience and basic conviction.\u201d We agree that this provided a basis in fact for the Army\u2019s decision. However, the Army\u2019s determination can stand only if it was arrived at in pursuance of the law and regulations, and there we differ with the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Department of Defense Directive 1300.6 VI.B.4 requires the hearing officer who hears the applicant requesting discharge to be \u201cknowledgeable in policies and procedures relating to conscientious objector matters.\u201d Petitioner cites numerous instances of Colonel Gleason\u2019s total lack of knowledge concerning conscientious objection. He found that the applicant\u2019s religion must advocate conscientious objection, although this had apparently not been the law since the First World War. He was not aware of the elimination of religious requirements for conscientious objection. Moreover, Colonel Gleason apparently lacked the necessary objectivity to be a fair, knowledgeable hearing officer. He obviously and no doubt honestly could not believe that a West Point cadet could possibly develop conscientious scruples against war and assumed more the role of advocate than judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">The government argues, however, that Colonel Gleason was not the one to make the final decision on petitioner\u2019s application. Further, that those making the ultimate decision disregarded Colonel Gleason\u2019s findings concerning petitioner\u2019s lack of religious convictions and concerning his opposition to the Vietnam war, as opposed to all war. Yet if all three officers who had seen and heard petitioner (i. e., the psychiatrist and the chaplain who interviewed him and the hearing officer who observed him) had found petitioner sincere, the Army would have been hard pressed to justify its finding of insincerity (cf. United States ex rel. Tobias v. Laird, 413 F.2d 936 (4 Cir. 1969)), where the court, in overturning the Army\u2019s refusal to discharge the petitioner on conscientious objector grounds, emphasized that all three officers making recommendations recommended classification as a conscientious objector. \u201cWe think the Army\u2019s own directives demonstrate a policy of reasonable common sense fairness to its soldiers \u2014 which policy has not been followed in this case.\u201d 413 F.2d at 940. See also, United States ex rel. Brooks v. Clifford, 409 F.2d 700, 706 (4 Cir. 1969): \u201cSuch regulations [for discharge of conscientious objectors] once issued must be followed scrupulously.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>Moreover, the failure to include a recommendation by Donham\u2019s unit commanding officer was violative of the Army\u2019s own regulations, which provide that recommendations will be forwarded to department headquarters. The unit commander is required by regulation (Army Regulation 635-20 H4.b(4) 1.) to make a recommendation. Major Baker, petitioner\u2019s tactical officer (who petitioner contends is the unit commander) failed to make the required recommendation, though he submitted the reports of the chaplain and psychiatrist and other required forms. The government contends that the petitioner\u2019s unit commander for the purposes of the regulations was the commandant of cadets or the superintendent of West Point, who did make the appropriate recom- \u25a0 mendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Petitioner\u2019s contention appears to us correct. While 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4334(b) and (c) provide that the superintendent is the commanding officer of the Academy and of the military post at West Point, and that the commandant of cadets is the immediate commander of the Corps of Cadets, \u00a7 4349(a) provides that the Corps of Cadets shall be divided into companies and that each company shall be commanded by a commissioned officer of the Army. For the purpose of the regulation the unit commander would appear to be the company commander. The obvious purpose of the regulation requiring a recommendation from the unit commander is to obtain an opinion from someone in close personal contact with the applicant. Clearly the company commander is in a far better position for this than the commandant who has the entire Corps of Cadets under his general supervision. The company commander\u2019s recommendation should be obtained and a hearing officer knowledgeable in accordance with regulations appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">We reverse and remand with instructions to stay Donham\u2019s orders to active military duty pending further proceedings by the Army in accord herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-5\">. See, for example, United States ex rel. Brooks v. Clifford, 409 F.2d 700, 707 (4 Cir. 1969), in which it was held that although the scope of review was sharply limited to determining whether there was a basis in fact for the Army\u2019s decision rejecting an enlisted man\u2019s conscientious objector claim, \u201cThe fact that petitioner delayed the assertion of his claim until after bis views had been formulated and that that did not occur until after his military service had begun and he had completed basic training and advanced or special weapon training is no ground to deny him discharge * * * if in reality his views are sincerely held and are the result of religious training and belief.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
