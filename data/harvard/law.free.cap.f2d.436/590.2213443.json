Prasse, 433 F.2d 449 (3rd Cir. 1970). Under these circumstances, it is unnecessary to discuss the other reasons<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> relied on by the District Court in the Memorandum filed with its June 27, 1969, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-30\">. The absence of an allegation of conspiracy makes 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b663-14\">. The trial resulted in a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree on January 21, 1959, and the conviction was affirmed on appeal on May 23, 1960. This complaint was filed on April 25, 1969, while plaintiff was still in prison under a life sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b663-15\">. Although the complaint initially alleges that Indictment, 39-58 was not a \u201cTrue Bill,\u201d the last part of the complaint (pages 3-4) alleges that \u201cDuring the past several weeks, your Plaintiff decided * * * that he had in fact never been indicted by an Essex Grand Jury * * \u201d and explains why he made this decision, namely, there was no evidence to go before the Grand Jury except his confession which he believes was clearly insufficient [cf. Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 76 S.Ct. 406, <em>100 </em>L.Ed. 397 (1956) ]; if the indictment were valid, the authorities would have given him more proof of (1) a True Bill, (2) a court order assigning \u201cthe Indictment for disposition,\u201d and (3) a certified transcript of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceedings, etc. This latter part of the complaint concludes: \u201cFor all the reasons expressed herein, your Plaintiff leans heavily upon the belief that he had never been under Grand Jury Indictment. # * * <em>\u00bb</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b663-26\"><em>. </em>For example, the District Court pointed out that an attorney appointed for a defendant in a criminal case does not act under color of state law so that he is not liable to suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See Pugliano v. Staziak, 231 F.Supp. 347, 350-351 (W.D.Pa.1964), aff\u2019d 345 F.2d 797 (3rd Cir. 1965) ; Reinke v. Richardson, 279 F.Supp. 155 (E.D.Wis.1968) ; Elders v. Consolidated Freightways Corp. of Delaware, 289 F.Supp. 630, 634 (D.Minn.1968) ; cf. Rhodes v. Meyer, 225 F.Supp. 80, 93-94 (D.Neb.1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
