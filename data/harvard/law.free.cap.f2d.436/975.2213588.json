Petitioner\u2019s convictions and sentences, totalling a term of twenty-five years imprisonment, followed his guilty pleas in the Western District of Missouri in 1955 on charges of bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113. Petitioner alleged that the proceedings at which the district judge accepted his pleas of guilty failed to comply with the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, specifically Rule 7(a) (waiver of indictment) and Rule 11 (guilty pleas). In denying petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court, Judge Elmo B. Hunter, carefully and adequately demonstrated why appellant Farr is entitled to no relief. Farr v. United States, 314 F.Supp. 1125 (W. D.Mo. 1970). We adopt that opinion on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-29\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
