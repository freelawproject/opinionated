We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-16\">The merchandise consists of rolled-up bamboo blinds, each having a package of mounting hardware within the rolled blind. The issue before us is the classification of the mounting hardware. The blinds comprise a number of horizontal split bamboo slats supported by vertical strings and having attached cords and metal pulleys to roll up or lower the blind. The package of mounting hardware includes 2 metal screw hooks, a metal cleat and 2 metal screws. A printed instruction sheet within the rolled blind directs one to look for the package containing the 2 hooks, a cleat and 2 screws, to screw the hooks into a horizontal beam, to fasten the cleat to a vertical post, and to place the round bamboo bar in the screw hooks. After the cord is used to adjust the blind to the desired height, the cord is fastened to the cleat.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-17\">The collector classified the merchandise under item 222.50 of TSUS, which provides for assessment of duty at 40 per centum ad valorem on blinds of un-spun fibrous vegetable materials, with or without their hardware. The importer protested that the hardware mountings had other uses and should have been separately classified under items 647.00 of TSUS, which provides for assessment of a duty at 19% ad valorem on fittings and mountings not specially provided for, suitable for furniture, doors, windows, blinds and other uses. These provisions read:</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-18\">Schedule 2, part 2, subpart B:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-19\">222.50 Blinds, shutters, curtains, screens, and shades, all the foregoing, of unspun fibrous vegetable materials, with or without their hardware . . . . 40% ad val.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-20\">Schedule 6, part 3, subpart D:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-21\">Hinges; and fittings and mountings not specially provided for, suitable for furniture, doors, windows, blinds, staircases, luggage, vehicle coach work, caskets, cabinets, and similar uses; all the foregoing, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>base metal, whether or not coated or plated with precious metal:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1118-4\">Not coated or plated with precious metal:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1118-5\">647:00 Of iron or steel, of aluminum, or of zinc.......191% ad val.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">The testimony of the importer\u2019s import manager indicates that the hardware is packed inside the rolled-up blind when imported and that the hardware is utilized in mounting said blind, but that the importer also imports and sells similar hardware mountings separately and that such mountings can be utilized with blinds of other materials or with awnings or plaques. The witness testified that the mountings do not have to be used to mount the imported blinds but that most of the time they are so utilized. He testified further that the blinds and mounting hardware are imported \u201cwrapped together for merchandising * * * and for the convenience of the customer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">Appellant United States asserts that blinds imported together with their hardware are dutiable as one commercial entity under item 222.50 of the TSUS, whether or not the hardware is dedicated to use with the particular blinds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">Appellant further contends that the addition of the words \u201cwith or without their hardware\u201d in item 222.50 was intended to eliminate problems connected with the determinations of the component material of chief value, that it does not materially affect imports, and that the purpose of the additional language was to remove from the classification the issue of \u201centireties.\u201d We agree that the issue of \u201centireties\u201d has been eliminated here and that the elimination precludes classification of the mounting hardware elsewhere in the schedules. If the Congress did not intend that blinds imported with their hardware be classified as one commercial entity, the added words \u201cwith or\u201d are extraneous and unnecessary and there would be no reason for including the word \u201cwithout,\u201d since blinds imported without hardware would be classified under item 222.50 in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-9\">In Broadway Hale Stores, Inc. v. United States, 62 Cust.Ct. 507, C.D. 3816 (1969), cited by both appellant and ap-pellee, the Customs Court found that imported mirrors and mirror frames were properly classified separately as \u201cmirrors * * * with or without frames\u201d and as \u201cmirror frames of wood.\u201d In that case, however, the mirrors and the wood frames were separately invoiced and separately packed. There the importer successfully argued that \u201cmirrors * * * with or without frames\u201d was intended to include \u201cframed mirrors,\u201d but did not include separately packed mirror frames. In this case the blinds and their hardware were not separately packaged, and it would be absurd to read the phrase \u201cwith their hardware\u201d as requiring that the hardware be <em>affixed </em>to the blinds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-11\">We conclude that, under the facts of the present case, the mounting hardware contained in the rolled blind with instructions for mounting the blind with said hardware is just what the Congress intended to include by inserting in item 222.50 the words \u201cwith or without their hardware.\u201d The judgment of the Customs Court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-12\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-13\">BALDWIN, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
