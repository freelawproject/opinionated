We grant enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>We find substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the Board\u2019s determination that by June 12, 1967, the date of the demand for recognition as bargaining representative, the union<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> possessed a sufficient number of employee authorization cards to give it majority status. At this time the company alleged a good faith doubt as to the union\u2019s majority and requested an election, which was held on August 25, 1967. The union lost by a vote of 75 to 57. The union thereafter filed objections to the election, but a hearing was not held because on January 3, 1968, the union filed the present 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (5) charges. The Board found that from July 3, 1967, to the date of the election the company engaged in pervasive unfair practices in violation of 8(a) (1) of the Act which effectively undermined the employees\u2019 sentiment for' the union and impeded a fair election process. Upon a review of the record as a whole, we find substantial evidence to support these findings and to justify the issuance of an 8(a) (5) bargaining order. See N. L. R. B. v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969); N. L. R. B. v. Noll Motors, Inc., 433 F.2d 853 (8 Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">On this appeal the company asserts that any 8(a) (5) violation must relate to the date of June 12, 1967, when the union made its demand known to the company to act as bargaining representative. The company claims that Section 10(b) of the Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> serves as a bar to the 8(a) (5) charge and the bargaining order since the union filed its unfair practice charges on January 3, 1968, more than six months after the company\u2019s refusal to bargain. The 8(a) (5) charge is premised, however, not on the June 12, 1967, company refusal to accede to the union\u2019s demand for recognition. At that time the company was entitled to an election regardless of its subjective motivation in requesting one. See N. L. R. B. v. Gissel Packing Co., supra. As the <em>Gissel </em>decision points up, the bargaining order arises because of the company\u2019s subsequent misconduct in unfairly undermining the union\u2019s majority status. These unfair practices and the defeat of the union at the election all occurred within six months of the time of the filing of the charge with the Board. The company likewise urges that there exists no evidence of a \u201ccontinuing demand\u201d for recognition after June 12, 1967. This court\u2019s decision in N. L. R. B. v. Arkansas Grain Corp., 390 F.2d 824 (8 Cir. 1968), is clearly distinguishable. There, in a pre-Gissel ruling, we rejected a finding of an 8(a) (5) violation based upon the company\u2019s alleged lack of good faith in refusing to bargain. We did so because there was no competent proof that the union possessed a majority status at the time of its original demand for recognition. More important here, however, is the fact that a \u201ccontinuing demand\u201d is no longer relevant where the charge rests upon unfair practices occurring within six months of the charge; and the Board has further found the company\u2019s conduct to have so undermined union sentiment as to make the possibility of a fair rerun election slight.
