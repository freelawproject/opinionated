(RKO) brought this suit against the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company (Mellon Bank), the City of Pittsburgh, and the Urban Redev\u00e9lopment Authority of the City of Pittsburgh. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>The complaint sought to enjoin the City of Pittsburgh from vacating the public sidewalk and from issuing a building permit for the construction of a new building over the sidewalk, and further sought to enjoin Mellon Bank from constructing a building over the. land formerly constituting the sidewalk.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The City of Pittsburgh and the Urban Redevelopment Authority of the City of Pittsburgh moved pursuant to Rule 12 (b) (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and Mellon Bajik filed an answer and moved pursuant to Rule 12(c) for judgment on the pleadings. The district court granted all three motions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since this is an appeal from the dismissal of the complaint as to all defendants, the allegations of the complaint must be taken as true.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-4\">The complaint charges that the plaintiff, RKO, owns and operates a motion picture theatre in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The theatre building, with a marquee extending over the sidewalk in front of it, was erected in 1912. One of the defendants, Mellon Bank, owned and operated a bank adjacent to the theatre from 1935 until 1968. Prior to demolition of Mellon Bank\u2019s building in 1968, the theatre and the bank building existed on a common building line. Paragraph 6 of the complaint alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-5\">From the time the said theater and marquee were erected and the time when said bank building was erected the Plaintiff, and the predecessor operators of said theater, have used the sidewalk in front of said bank building and the air space above the same for the maintenance of and the changing of signs on, the said marquee; the use of said sidewalk and said air space has been uninterrupted, continuous and adverse for a period in excess of twenty-one (21) years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"adn-dedup-1\">In May 1969 the defendant City of Pittsburgh vacated the sidewalk in front of the bank building.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Vacation of the sidewalk relieved Mellon Bank of an easement in favor of the public and gave Mellon Bank a fee simple title, free of all encumbrances, to the 10-foot wide strip of land that formerly constituted the public sidewalk. In August 1969 RKO learned that Mellon Bank planned to construct a new building on its property that would extend over this 10-foot wide strip, and that the City of Pittsburgh would issue a building permit for the building as planned. Construction of a building over the 10-foot wide strip that formerly constituted the public sidewalk would physically block one side of RKO\u2019s marquee from public view and would prevent RKO from maintaining its marquee and changing the signs thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-13\">THE DISMISSAL AS TO MELLON NATIONAL BANK AND TRUST COMPANY</p>\n<p id=\"Atx\">We must decide whether these allegations, taken as true, would estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>lish an easement in favor of RKO to maintain its marquee and change the signs thereon.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> RKO does not claim an easement to light and air, but rather an easement to go upon the sidewalk in front of Mellon Bank and erect ladders in order to maintain its marquee and change the signs thereon.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, RKO does not claim an easement against the City of Pittsburgh, but rather against the abutting fee owner Mellon Bank.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cases holding that rights against a city or the public cannot be gained by prescription therefore have no application to the claim against Mellon Bank.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-11\">The basic question is whether easements can be acquired by prescription in property constituting a public sidewalk, which is \u201cfor all intents and purposes a part of the [abutting] owner\u2019s premises subject only to the public\u2019s easement of passage.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Ease<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>ments by prescription are created by adverse, open, notorious, continuous, and uninterrupted use of land for 21 years.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The factual allegations of the complaint and the reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom could, if proven, establish that RKO's use of the sidewalk in front of Mellon Bank\u2019s building was open and notorious.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The complaint also alleges that RKO\u2019s use of the sidewalk was continuous<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and uninterrupted <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> for a period in excess of the prescriptive period, and that RKO\u2019s use was at all times adverse to Mellon Bank.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The complaint thus alleges that all of the requirements necessary to establish a prescriptive easement are present. The difficulty posed by this case is the presence of the public easement. Any use of the sidewalk within the scope of the public easement is not adverse to Mellon Bank and cannot serve as the basis for the acquisition of a prescriptive easement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-12\">The Pennsylvania courts have not precisely defined the scope of the public easement in sidewalks. The early Pennsylvania decisions characterized the easement as an \u201ceasement of passage,\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> but added that the public\u2019s right of passage comprehended \u201cthe powers incident to such a right.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The powers incident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>to the right of passage include the right to obstruct temporarily the public way for business necessity, accidents, or the ordinary exigencies of travel.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> There is some support in the- Pennsylvania decisions for the proposition that the right to obstruct temporarily is merely incidental to the right of passage, and belongs only to members of the public engaged in traveling over the public way.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Other Pennsylvania decisions indicate that the right to obstruct temporarily belongs to members of the public whose reasonable commercial needs require such temporary obstruction,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and the authorities are generally in agreement with this interpretation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> But the scope of the public easement is not broad enough to allow constantly recurring, although temporary, obstructions to the public way. While the abutting fee owner may have power to impose frequent temporary obstructions on the public way in order to serve his own reasonable commercial needs,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the Pennsylvania decisions clearly establish that an abutting fee owner may not obstruct the public sidewalk owned by another abutting fee owner on a recurring basis in order to serve commercial needs.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>use of the public sidewalk would amount to an appropriation of another\u2019s property for private commercial purposes.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-4\">Recent Pennsylvania decisions have expanded the scope of the public easement, holding that the rights of the public are regarded as being in the exclusive possession of the municipality, which may authorize the use of any public sidewalk for any public purpose.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> But in. order to fall within this expanded scope of the public easement, a use must be specifically authorized by the municipality; and such authorization \u201cmust be by legislative grant in clear words or by unavoidable implication.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">While the public\u2019s lawful use of a sidewalk is restricted to uses within the scope of the public easement, the abutting fee owner is not so restricted in his use of the sidewalk. The abutting owner has the right to use the sidewalk in any manner not inconsistent with the public easement.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> He also has the right to use a portion of the sidewalk in a reasonable manner for a temporary period, and this right is not subservient to the right of the traveling public.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-15\">No use outside the scope of the public easement may be made of a sidewalk in opposition to or over the objection of the abutting fee owner. The abutting fee ' owner\u2019s private right is superior to any other private right, and any private use of a sidewalk constitutes a trespassory invasion of the property rights of the abutting fee owner.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The Pennsylvania decisions have long made clear that the abutting owner can prevent such uses of the public way.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-16\">These principles demonstrate that the complaint states a claim against Mellon Bank upon which relief can be granted. Easements against the abutting owner can be established by prescription in a sidewalk, so long as the use is outside the scope of the public easement. The abutting fee owner retains certain primary rights in the sidewalk, and those rights can be lost by prescription.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The public policy which prevents the acquisition of rights against a municipality or the public by prescription <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> does not prevent the acquisition of rights by prescription against a private entity.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, that portion of the January 28, 1970, district court order dismissing the complaint as to Mellon Bank will he vacated and the ease remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">THE DISMISSAL AS TO THE URBAN REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF PITTSBURGH</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-6\">Aside from a general prayer for \u201csuch other order as the Court, in its discretion, deems necessary,\u201d the complaint requests no specific relief against the Urban Redevelopment Authority of the City of Pittsburgh, whereas injunctive relief is sought against the City of Pittsburgh and Mellon Bank. Rule 8(a) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-7\"><em>Claims for Relief. </em>A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief * * * shall contain * * * a demand for judgment for the relief to which [the pleader] deems himself entitled. Relief in the alternative or of several different types may be demanded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1376-8\">The complaint clearly does not meet the requirements of this rule with respect to the defendant Urban Redevelopment Authority of the City of Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-9\">The complaint alleges only that the Authority, together with the City of Pittsburgh, contacted RKO in bad faith to propose the remodeling of RKO\u2019s theatre, without mentioning the proposed vacation of the sidewalk in front of the bank building, and that the Authority and the City of Pittsburgh led RKO to believe that a new bank building would be erected only on the site of the earlier bank building. Aside from this alleged misleading, the complaint does not charge the Authority with any action whatsoever. The complaint does not indicate how RKO was harmed by this alleged misleading, or otherwise indicate the basis of RKO\u2019s claim against the Authority. The Urban Redevelopment Authority of the City of Pittsburgh is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and, as such, is not liable for damages resulting from torts committed in the exercise of governmental powers or in the performance of governmental duties.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Furthermore, it is difficult to imagine how injunctive relief against the Authority could help RKO in its effort to nullify the vacating ordinance and the building permit, and to prevent construction of the new bank building.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-17\">For the above reasons, the dismissal of the complaint as to the Urban Redevelopment Authority of the City of Pittsburgh will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-18\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-19\">THE DISMISSAL AS TO THE CITY of PITTSBURGH</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-20\">As noted above at page 5, public policy prevents the acquisition of prescriptive rights against a municipality and the public. The Courts will not inquire into the motive of a city in passing an ordinance, and a city cannot forfeit its right and duty to vacate public ways under appropriate circumstances, even though its employee may take misleading action.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> It is clear that the City had the authority to vacate the sidewalks,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and no claim is made that there were technical defects in the passage and advertising of the vacating ordinance or in the issuance of the build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>ing permit.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Furthermore, RKO\u2019s property rights against Mellon Bank are not affected by such authorized governmental actions.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">The dismissal of the complaint as to the City of Pittsburgh will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-6\">The January 28, 1970 order of the district court will be affirmed except insofar as it dismisses the complaint as to Mellon Bank, which dismissal will be vacated, and the case will be remanded to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. Costs shall be divided equally between RKO and Mellon Bank.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">. In the alternative, the complaint sought to order the City of Pittsburgh to revoke the vacation of the public sidewalk and the issuance of the building permit.-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1371-7\">. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) (6) the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s motion to dismiss, supported by an affidavit, was treated as a motion for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. The affidavit in support of the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s motion to dismiss recites that the Urban Redevelopment Authority of the City of Pittsburgh obtained the consent of Mellon Bank to the vacation of the public sidewalk, and that the affi-ant, a representative of the Bureau of Engineers, Division of Surveys, Department of Public Works of the City of Pittsburgh, considered Mellon Bank\u2019s letter of consent as a petition of an abutting property owner for the vacation of the public sidewalk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1371-15\">. <em>See </em>Walker Process Equip., Inc. v.

In appraising the sufficiency of a complaint, the accepted rule is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1372-5\">a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, <em>78 </em>S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1372-6\">Since on appeals from dismissals for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, we must accept as true all of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations of fact, together with such reasonable inferences as may be drawn therefrom in the plaintiff\u2019s favor <em>(see </em>Murray v. City of Milford, Conn., 380 F.2d 468 (2d Cir. 1967)), the complaint is not insufficient for failure to allege detailed facts surrounding the erection of EKO\u2019s marquee over the public sidewalk. The Pennsylvania courts have followed the general rule that an abutting fee owner may maintain a marquee over the public sidewalk so long as it does not interfere with the public easement or constitute a public nuisance, and subject to power in the state to regulate or forbid altogether for the public benefit. <em>See </em>Walnut &amp; Quince St. Corp. v. Mills, 303 Pa. 25, 154 A. 29, appeal dismissed, 284 U.S. 573, 52 S.Ct. 16, 76 L.Ed. 498 (1931). <em>See generally </em>10 E. McQuillen, Municipal Corporations, \u00a7 30.92 (3d ed. 1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1372-9\">. RKO\u2019s claim is more than a claim for an easement to light and air, which can be acquired by express grant but not by prescription. <em>See </em>Maioriello v. Arlotta, 364 Pa. 557, 73 A.2d 374 (1950). Absent an express grant, RKO cannot therefore establish an easement to light and air. We thus do not mean to suggest that RKO can establish a right by prescription to have the side of its marquee facing the bank building seen by the public; we note, however, that the marquee has other functions such as protecting theatre patrons from inclement weather, supporting signs on the side of such marquee facing the street, etc., and the complaint alleges use of the sidewalk in front of the bank to maintain it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1372-13\">. RKO claims a right to go upon the sidewalk in front of Mellon Bank\u2019s building. Unless clearly noted by express exception in a deed, title to real property bounded by streets generally extends to the center of the street in Pennsylvania. <em>See </em>City of Scranton v.

Mellon Bank\u2019s title to the property to which the alleged easement attaches has not at this point been denied.

Most authorities generally treat the requirement that use be open and notorious as one element or condition of adverse use. The Pennsylvania courts have apparently carved the open and notorious use requirement out of the adverse use requirement, treating it as a separate requirement necessary to establish a prescriptive easement. <em>Compare, e. g., </em>Restatement of Property \u00a7 458 (1944) <em>and </em>2 American Law of Property \u00a7 8.53 (A. J. Casner ed. 1952) <em>with </em>Shaffer v. Baylor\u2019s Lake Ass\u2019n, Inc., 392 Pa. 493, 141 A.2d 583 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1373-7\">.

On the contrary, the right of the public to the free and unobstructed use of a street or way is subject to reasonable and necessary limitations. The carriage and delivery of fuel, grain, goods, etc., are legitimate uses of a street, and may result in the temporary obstruction to the right of public transit. * * * And so of the improvements of adjoining lots by digging cellars, by building, etc.; this may occasion a reasonable necessity for using the street or sidewalk for the deposit of material. Temporary obstructions of this kind are not invasions of the public easement, but simply incidents to, or limitations of it.
