At the time of his conviction, Ochoa was subject to a ten-year term of registration. The statutes have since changed to require lifetime registration for certain classes of sex offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Ochoa sought declaratory relief in 2010, claiming that he had satisfied the ten-year registration requirement accompanying his conviction and that he was not subject to lifetime registration under Section ll-707(a)(4)(iii) of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d). Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2010 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 ll-707(a)(4)(iii) of the Criminal Procedure Article. The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County denied Ochoa\u2019s claim and declared he was subject to lifetime registration. Ochoa appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, but this Court, on its own motion, granted <em>certiorari </em>to hear his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Ochoa appealed on the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Is the Appellant subject to life time registration as a Tier III sex offender, pursuant to \u00a7 11-701, <em>et seq, Criminal Procedure Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland </em>when the offenses for which the Appellant is compelled to register are not listed in the statute?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">We shall hold that Ochoa is required to register for life as a sex offender under CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 707(a)(4)(iii) because his 1998 convictions make him a tier III sex offender under the current statutory scheme, and he was subject to lifetime registration on September 30, 2010, making retroactive application of the statute proper by its own terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Facts and Legal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Angel Ochoa was indicted in August 1997 on one count of child abuse and three counts of third degree sexual offense, stemming from sexual contact he had with his eleven-year-old stepdaughter \u201con or about between January 1, 1997 and June 30, 1997.\u201d On January 30, 1998, Ochoa pleaded guilty to the child-abuse count and one count of sexual offense, and prosecutors entered a <em>nolle 'prosequi </em>to the other two counts. Specifically, Ochoa pleaded guilty to violations of Article 27, Section 35C (child sexual abuse) and Article 27, Section 464B (third-degree sexual offense) of the Annotated Code of Maryland. He was convicted and sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment, with all but one day suspended, and three years of supervised probation, which he successfully completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Upon conviction, Ochoa was required to register as a sex offender for ten years. Since his conviction, however, the statutory framework governing sex-offender registration has changed significantly, requiring lifetime registration for those convicted of many sexual offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 6, 2010, Ochoa filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, seeking a declaration that he had not committed a crime that required lifetime registration under CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 707(a)(4)(iii). After the Department of Public Safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>and Correctional Services (\u201cthe Department\u201d) answered the complaint, Ochoa moved for summary judgment, which the Department opposed. After a hearing, the Circuit Court issued an order on July 12, 2011, denying Ochoa\u2019s motion and entering judgment in favor of the Department. The Circuit Court declared that Ochoa is required to register as a tier III sex offender for life pursuant to CP \u00a7 ll-707(a)(4)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Ochoa timely appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, but on March 6, 2012, this Court, on its own motion, issued a writ of certiorari before review by the intermediate appellate court. <em>See Ochoa v. Dep\u2019t of Corr. &amp; Pub. Safety, </em>425 Md. 227, 40 A.3d 39 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">We are tasked with deciding whether the lifetime sex-offender registration requirements of CP Section 11-707(a)(4)(iii), effective October 1, 2010, apply to Ochoa based on his 1998 sex-offense convictions. By its own terms, CP \u00a7 11-707 applies only to sex offenders who were \u201csubject to registration [under Title 7 of the Criminal Procedure Article] on September 30, 2010.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2010 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 11-702.1 of the Criminal Procedure Article. Under CP \u00a7 11-707, the term of registration for sex offenders varies depending on the severity of their crimes. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 11-707. The longest term of registration \u2014 for \u201cthe life of the registrant\u201d \u2014 is required of \u201ctier III sex offender[s.]\u201d CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 707( a) (4) (iii). Accordingly, in determining whether Ochoa is subject to lifetime registration under CP Section 11-707(a)(4)(iii), we must decide first whether he was required to register as a sex-offender on September 30, 2010 and second whether he is a tier III offender. We answer both questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>in the affirmative and conclude that Ochoa is subject to lifetime registration based on his 1998 convictions of sexual child abuse and sexual offense in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Sex-Offender Registration Requirements at the Time of Ochoa\u2019s Conviction in 1998</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">When Ochoa was convicted in 1998 of violating sections 35C (child sexual abuse) and 464B (third degree sexual offense) of the former Article 27, he became subject to a ten-year registration requirement. The statute in effect at the time required \u201cchild sexual offenders\u201d to \u201cregister with a local law enforcement agency annually for 10 years[.]\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 792(i). A \u201cchild sexual offender\u201d was defined as a person who had \u201cbeen convicted of violating \u00a7 35C ... for an offense involving sexual abuse\u201d or who had \u201cbeen convicted of violating any of the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 462 through 464B ... for an offense involving an individual under the age of 15 years.\u201d Art. 27, \u00a7 792(a)(2)\u00ae <em>&amp; </em>(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">As Ochoa was convicted of violating both of these statutes in 1998, he was considered a \u201cchild sexual offender\u201d under the statutory scheme then in effect and was subject to the ten-year registration requirement. He was therefore required initially to register as a sex offender from January 30, 1998 to January 30, 2008. <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 792\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Sex-Offender Registration Requirements as of 1999</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">In 1999, for the purpose of amending \u201cthe laws concerning the registration requirements and procedures concerning individuals convicted of certain crimes against children, sexually violent offenses, or other sexual offenses,\u201d the General Assembly made significant revisions to sex-offender registration requirements. <em>See </em>Chapter 317 of the Acts of 1999. Specifically, it subjected to lifetime registration three types of sex offenders: sexually violent predators, child sexual offenders and sexually violent offenders, convicted of certain crimes. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Cum.Supp.), Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>27, \u00a7 792(d)(2), (3), (4) &amp; (5)(ii). The statute continued to define a \u201cchild sexual offender\u201d the same way it did at the time of Ochoa\u2019s conviction in 1998 as an individual \u201cconvicted of violating \u00a7 35C of [Article 27] for an offense involving sexual abuse\u201d or \u201cany of the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 462 through 464B ... for an offense involving an individual under the age of 15 years.\u201d <em>Compare </em>Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 792(a)(2)\u00ae &amp; (ii), <em>with </em>Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Cum.Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 792(a)(2)(i) &amp; (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The statute further defined a \u201csexually violent offender\u201d as an individual who had been convicted of a \u201csexually violent offense,\u201d which was in turn defined as a violation of \u201cany of the provisions of \u00a7 462, \u00a7 463, \u00a7 464, \u00a7 464A, \u00a7 464B, or \u00a7 464F of [Article 27].\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 792(a)(10) &amp; (11). Under the statute, sexually violent offenders convicted of a \u201csecond or a subsequent sexually violent offense\u201d were considered \u201csexually violent predators.\u201d Art. 27, \u00a7 792(a)(12).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Under Section 792(d)(5), sexually violent predators were automatically required to register for life, and sexually violent offenders and child sexual abusers were required to do so if they were convicted of \u201ca violation of any of the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 462 through 464B of this article.\u201d Chapter 317 of the Acts of 1999; Art. 27, \u00a7 792(d)(5)(i) &amp; (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Upon making these changes, the General Assembly limited the retroactive application of the statute to \u201csexually violent offenders\u201d who have committed offenses \u201con or after July 1, 1997,\u201d but expressly stated that it does apply retroactively to child sexual offenders like Ochoa who (1) were already subject to the ten-year registration requirement under Article 27, Section 792\u00ae and (2) \u201cwho committed the sexual offense before the effective date of this Act.\u201d <em>See </em>Chapter 317 of the Acts of 1999, Sections 4 &amp; 5; Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 792(i) (\u201c[Be it further enacted, that] a child sexual offender who is subject to the requirements of Chapter 142 of the Acts of the General Assembly of 1995 and who committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the sexual offense before the effective date of this Act is subject to the requirements of this Act.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Under the 1999 revisions, as an individual who violated Sections 35C (child sexual abuse) and 464B (third degree sexual offense) of the former Article 27, Ochoa was both a \u201csexually violent offender\u201d and a \u201cchild sexual offender.\u201d Although as a \u201csexually violent offender\u201d who committed the qualifying offenses prior to July 1, 1997, Ochoa was not subject to the statute\u2019s application, as a \u201cchild sexual offender,\u201d Ochoa met both requirements that triggered retroactivity: he was subject to the ten-year registration requirement at the time of the revision and committed his crimes before the effective date of the revision. <em>See </em>Chapter 317 of the Acts of 1999, Sections 4 &amp; 5; Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 792(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">It is clear to this Court, then, that Ochoa was subject to lifetime registration as of these 1999 revisions. Furthermore, as sex offender required to register for life since 1999, Ochoa continued to be subject to lifetime registration on September 30, 2010, making the retroactive application of CP \u00a7 11-707(a)(4)(iii) proper in this case. Because, Ochoa argues, however, that subsequent amendments to sex-offender registration requirements somehow absolved him of his registration responsibilities, we will examine these subsequent revisions as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Sex-Offender Registration Requirements After the 2002 Amendments</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Ochoa directs us to CP \u00a7 11-707 that came into effect on October 1, 2010 and argues that under that law he was not required to register for life based on his 1998 convictions. As stated above, for the lifetime registration requirement of CP \u00a7 11-707 to apply retroactively, the sex offender had to be \u201csubject to registration [under Title 7 of the Criminal Procedure Article] on September 30, 2010.\u201d Md.Code (2001, 2008 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Repl.Vol., 2010 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 11-702.1 of the Criminal Procedure Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">In accordance with CP \u00a7 11-707 in effect on September 80, 2010, the following classes of sex offenders were required to register for life: \u201csexually violent predator[s],\u201d offenders \u201cconvicted of a sexually violent offense,\u201d offenders \u201cconvicted of a violation of \u00a7 3-602 of the Criminal Law Article for commission of a sexual act involving penetration of a child under the age of 12 years,\u201d and offenders who had been convicted of \u201ca prior crime as a child sexual offender, an offender, or a sexually violent offender.\u201d Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2009 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 ll-707(a)(4)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Article. Ochoa argues that his 1998 convictions do not fall under either of these listed categories of sex offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Ochoa\u2019s arguments require us to delve further into the legislative history and analyze how these registration provisions became codified. In doing so, we must fulfill our obligation to \u201cascertain and effectuate the real and actual intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>McCloud v. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>426 Md. 473, 479, 44 A.3d 993, 996 (2012) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Since the 1999 revisions to the sex-offender registration laws that required Ochoa to register as a sex offender for life, the General Assembly has made several other changes. First, in 2002 the General Assembly enacted a major overhaul of the State\u2019s criminal law statutes, where it moved many provisions of Article 27 into a new Criminal Law Article. <em>See </em>Chapter 26 of the Acts of 2002. As a result, the Article 27 crimes of which Ochoa was convicted received different code numbers. Specifically, the former Article 27, Section 35C (child sexual abuse) became Section 3-602 of the Criminal Law Article, and the former Article 27, Section 464B (sexual offense in the third degree) became Section 3-307 of the Criminal Law Article. <em>See id. </em>Both sections were accompanied by a revisor\u2019s note stating the new sections consisted of \u201cnew language derived without substantive change from\u201d the former sections.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>This recodification of the State\u2019s criminal laws necessitated revisions to the criminal law references in the Criminal Procedure Article. The General Assembly thus also updated the Criminal Procedure Article, which details the sex-offender registration term requirements, by replacing cross-references to the repealed provisions of Article 27 with cross-references to the provisions transferred to the new Criminal Law Article. <em>See </em>Chapter 213 of the Acts of 2002 (\u201c[For] the purpose of correcting certain cross-references to the Criminal Law Article in the Annotated Code of Maryland.... \u201d). Specifically, the requirement of a lifetime \u201cterm of registration\u201d for sexual offenders \u201cconvicted of any violation of Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 462 through 464B of the Code\u201d \u2014 which includes Ochoa\u2019s conviction for third degree sexual offense \u2014 was replaced by \u201cany violation of \u00a7\u00a7 3-303 through 3-307 of the Criminal Law Article.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Second, during the same 2002 legislative session, as part of the effort to alter the definition of \u201c <em>\u2018a </em>sexually violent offense\u2019 to include certain crimes committed against a person under a certain age,\u201d the General Assembly also changed the description of the offenses subject to a lifetime registration requirement from the code-specific reference to codified offenses, <em>ie. </em>\u201cany violation of Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 462 through 464B of the Code,\u201d to a general term of \u201ca sexually violent offense.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Chapter 194 of the Acts of 2002; Md.Code (2001, 2001 Repl.Vol., 2002 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 11 \u2014 707(a)(4)(ii)(2) of the Criminal Procedure Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Section ll-701(k) of the Criminal Procedure Article further provided definitions of sexually violent offenses subject to the lifetime registration requirement of CP \u00a7 ll-707(a)(4)(ii). One such definition of a \u201csexually violent offense\u201d was \u201ca violation of \u00a7\u00a7 3-303 through 3-307 or \u00a7\u00a7 3-309 through 3-312 of the Criminal Law Article.\u201d CP \u00a7 ll-701(k)(l). Another definition included an \u201cassault with intent to commit rape ... or a sexual offense ... as prohibited on or before September 30, 1996, under the former Article 27, \u00a7 12 of the Code.\u201d CP \u00a7 ll-701(k)(2). The General Assembly provided that these changes were to apply retroactively to sex offenders like Ochoa, who were \u201cconvicted of an offense committed before July 1, 1997, and who [were] under the custody or supervision of a supervising authority on October 1, 2001.\u201d CP \u00a7 11-702.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">In Ochoa\u2019s opinion, however, he has not been convicted of a \u201csexually violent offense.\u201d With respect to the first definition of \u201csexually violent offense\u201d under CP Section ll-701(k)(l), Ochoa posits that he:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">ha[d] not been convicted of a sexually violent offense as it was defined by the <em>Annotated Code of Maryland </em>on September 30, 2010. While Ochoa had been convicted of two offenses under Article 27 he had not been convicted of violating any provision of the <em>Criminal Law Article.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">To be sure, Ochoa was not literally convicted of violating any provision of the current Criminal Law Article, if only for the strikingly obvious reason that the Criminal Law Article did not exist at the time of his violation or conviction. As we discussed above, however, the third degree sexual offense under Section 464B of Article 27 \u2014 one of the crimes of which Ochoa was convicted in 1998 \u2014 was recodified as Section 3-307 of the Criminal Law Article. <em>See </em>Chapter 26 of the Acts of 2002. Thus, at least one of Ochoa\u2019s 1998 convictions falls under the first definition of \u201csexually violent offense,\u201d requiring Ochoa to register as a sex offender for life under CP \u00a7 11\u2014 707(a)(4)(ii)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Ochoa supplements his legislative-intent argument by directing our attention to the second definition of a \u201csexually violent offense.\u201d As Ochoa correctly states, this definition included \u201cassault with intent to commit rape in the first or second degree or a sexual offense in the first or second degree as prohibited on or before September 30, 1996, under former Article 27, \u00a7 12 of the Code[.]\u201d Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2009 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 ll-701(k)(2) of the Criminal Procedure Article. Under Ochoa\u2019s reading of this statute, however, because the statute refers to Article 27, Section 12, if the General Assembly had intended to classify as \u201csexually violent offenses\u201d other offenses under Article 27 \u2014 like his convictions under former Article 27, Sections 35C and 464B \u2014 it would have expressly stated so as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">This argument misinterprets the General Assembly\u2019s reason for specifying the former Article 27, Section 12 in the statute. The crimes in that section were abolished in 1996 when the General Assembly substantively revised the State\u2019s assault laws. <em>See </em>Chapter 632 of the Acts of 1996. As the Department argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">Thus, there is no directly analogous statute in the new Criminal Law Article to Article 27, \u00a7 12 and, therefore, no cross-reference that could have been updated. In other words, convictions under Article 27, \u00a7 12 were the only ones that the General Assembly continued to refer to by the old statutory reference because they were the only ones that did not have a new statutory reference. The General Assembly\u2019s goal was to ensure that individuals convicted of Article 27, \u00a7 12 violations before the statute\u2019s abolition in 1996 would still be required to register, not to ensure everyone convicted of any other sexual offenses before September 30, 2002 be relieved from this requirement. We agree with this explanation and the view of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN7\">The General Assembly has increased the length of the registration terms and added retroactivity provisions with an eye toward strengthening this State\u2019s sex-offender laws. It is a reasonable interpretation of the statute then, consonant with legislative intent, that certain convictions under the former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Article 27 \u2014 including Ochoa\u2019s conviction for third degree sexual offense \u2014 are not excluded from the definition of a \u201csexually violent offense,\u201d as defined on September 30, 2010. <em>See, e.g., McCloud, </em>426 Md. at 480, 44 A.3d at 997 (\u201cAdditionally, we must always give the statute a reasonable interpretation, not one that is absurd, illogical, or incompatible with common sense.\u201d (quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The 2002 revisions were intended to be \u201cnonsubstantive,\u201d unless expressly provided, and \u201cmay not otherwise be construed to render any substantive change in the criminal law of the State.\u201d <em>See </em>Chapter 26, Section 13 of the Acts of 2002. We have already seen that the sections relevant to Ochoa were \u201cderived without substantive change\u201d from the former laws. <em>See id. </em>As the Department argues, \u201c[tjhere is no indication in the statute or elsewhere of any intent by the General Assembly to use those \u2018nonsubstantive revisions\u2019 to radically alter the law as to who was required to register as a sex offender and for how long registration was required.\u201d This is plainly true, and we cannot imagine that when the General Assembly made clerically necessary updates to statutory cross-references, it would have intended to strip away the registration requirements for <em>all </em>sexual offenders convicted under the former Article 27. Such an interpretation would directly undermine the clear legislative intent to gradually strengthen sex-offender statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Accordingly, regardless of which version of the sex-offender registration statute we apply, we find that Ochoa\u2019s 1998 convictions of child sexual abuse and third degree sexual offense made him subject to lifetime registration on September 30, 2010, requiring retroactive application of Title 7 of the Criminal Procedure Article. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2010 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 11-702.1 of the Criminal Procedure Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Ochoa\u2019s 1998 Crimes Under the Tier System</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Having found that Ochoa was required to register as a sex offender on September 30, 2010, making retroactive appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>cation of the statute proper in this case, we next turn to Ochoa\u2019s status under the tier sex offender classification of CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 707(a) (4) (iii). The tier-based system replaced the former sex-offender designations of \u201csexually violent predator,\u201d \u201csexually violent offender,\u201d and \u201cchild sexual offender\u201d in 2010. <em>See </em>Chapters 174 and 175 of the Acts of 2010. Section 11-701(q) of the Criminal Procedure Article defines a \u201ctier III sex offender\u201d as a person who has been convicted of a number of offenses, including Section 3-602 (\u201cSexual abuse of a minor\u201d) and Section 3-307(1)-(3) (\u201cSexual offense in the third degree\u201d) of the Criminal Law Article. Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2010 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 11-701(q)(1) &amp; (2) of the Criminal Procedure Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">As discussed above, during the 2002 recodification of Maryland\u2019s criminal laws, Section 3-602 (\u201cSexual abuse of a minor\u201d) of the Criminal Law Article replaced the former Article 27, Section 35C (child sexual abuse), and Section 3-307(1)-(3) (\u201cThird degree sexual offense\u201d) of the Criminal Law Article replaced the former Article 27, Section 464B (\u201cThird degree sexual offense\u201d). <em>See </em>Chapter 26 of the Acts of 2002. Both of these newly codified offenses were accompanied by a revisor\u2019s note stating the new sections consisted of \u201cnew language derived without substantive change from\u201d the former sections. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">As a sex offender convicted both of a violation of Article 27, Section 35C and a violation of Article 27, Section 464B, Ochoa cannot escape classification as a tier III sex offender under CP Section 11-701(q)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(2). In the eyes of the General Assembly, whether codified under the former Article 27 or the current Criminal Law Article, the offenses of which Ochoa was convicted \u2014 child sexual abuse and third-degree sexual offense \u2014 are the types of sex offenses that require the longest period of registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Thus, Ochoa\u2019s 1998 convictions for child sexual abuse and third degree sexual offense make him a tier III sex offender under CP \u00a7 ll-701(q)(l) and (2). As a sex offender subject to registration on September 30, 2010, Ochoa must comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the registration requirements of CP \u00a7 ll-707(a)(4)(iii) and register for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Ochoa\u2019s Assertion That Sex-Offender Registration Is Penal in Nature</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">As a final argument, Ochoa also insists that the sex-offender registration statute is penal and must be \u201cstrictly construed against the State.\u201d Although Ochoa quotes at length one case in support of this proposition, he makes no effort in his brief to apply it to his own case or develop it in any meaningful way. For example, he does not argue that the alleged penal nature of the statute bars retroactive application of the 1999 law imposing a lifetime registration under the principles of due process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-504(a)(5) (requiring \u201c[ajrgument in support of a party\u2019s position\u201d).

Considering these principles, we need not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">We agree with the Department that the 2002 revisions left unchanged the requirement in place since 1999 that all sex offenders convicted of child sexual abuse \u2014 a group that includes Ochoa \u2014 register for life. Furthermore, even under the 2002 revisions, Ochoa was required to register for life as an offender who has committed a \u201csexually violent offense.\u201d Finally, under the most recent version of the sex-offender registration statute, Ochoa continues to be required to register for life because he is a tier III sex offender who was required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>to register on September 30, 2010. His term of registration remains at life, as it has been since the 1999 revisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Agreeing with the State, that CP \u00a7 11-707(a)(4)(iii) applied to the petitioner retroactively and that, therefore, he was, indeed, required to register for life, the Circuit Court denied the petitioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and entered the opposite declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The petitioner noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Prior to its review, however, this Court, on its own initiative, issued a writ of certiorari, <em>Ochoa v. Department of Corrections and Public Safety, </em>425 Md. 227, 40 A.3d 39 (2012), to decide the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">\u201cIs the Appellant subject to life time registration as a Tier III sex offender, pursuant to \u00a7 11-701, <em>et seq, Criminal Procedure Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland </em>when the offenses for which the Appellant is compelled to register are not listed in the statute?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The majority, siding with the Circuit Court, answers this question in the affirmative, and holds that CP \u00a7 11\u2014 707(a)(4)(iii) applies retroactively to require the petitioner to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>register for life as a Tier III sex offender. <em>Ochoa v. Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, </em>430 Md. 315, 319, 61 A.3d 1, 3 (2012). Because I believe that a criminal statute may not be applied retroactively in the absence of express language permitting such application and that, in this case, there is no such express language, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Upon his conviction in 1998, the petitioner was subject to the requirements of Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) Article 27, \u00a7 792, the statutory scheme then applicable to sexual offender registration criteria, terms and procedures. Therefore, upon conviction of child abuse, he became and was considered a \u201cchild sexual offender,\u201d defined by \u00a7 792(a)(2), in relevant part, as a person convicted either under Article 27, \u00a7 35C, or under \u00a7 464B. Consequently, the petitioner was required to comply with \u00a7 792\u2019s registration requirements, set forth in subsection (i), that a child sexual offender \u201cregister with a local law enforcement agency annually for 10 years....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">In 1999, the Legislature revised Article 27, \u00a7 792 and, for the first time, introduced life term registration for certain classes of sexual offenders. Specifically, Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.) Article 27, \u00a7 792(d)(5) required a child sexual offender to register annually in person with a local law enforcement agency for</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u201c(ii) Life if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">\u201c1.

The registrant has been previously required to register and has been convicted of a subsequent violation of any offense listed in subsection (a)(2), (6), or (11) of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">This revision modified the term of registration for those who were convicted of a violation of \u00a7 464B, the same crime of which the petitioner was found guilty, from 10 years, to life. It also provided that \u00a7 792(d)(5)(ii)(3) applied retroactively under some, very limited circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The Legislature again revised Maryland\u2019s sex offender registration law in 2010, this time creating a tier system for categorizing sex offenses and delineating the specific term of registration for each tier. CP \u00a7\u00a7 11-701 \u2014 11-707. It also prescribed the conditions under which the new statutory scheme would apply retroactively. The new scheme, which took effect on October 1, 2010, includes in the category of Tier III sex offenders those individuals, like the petitioner, who have been convicted of \u201cconspiring to commit, attempting to commit, or committing a violation\u201d of CP \u00a7\u00a7 3-307 and 3-602. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 701(q)(1)(ii). CP \u00a7 ll-707(a)(4) then sets forth the following registration terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">\u201c(i) 15 years, if the registrant is a tier I sex offender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">\u201c(ii) 25 years, if the registrant is a tier II sex offender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">\u201c(iii) the life of the registrant, if the registrant is a tier III sex offender....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">The retroactive application of Title ll\u2019s provisions is expressly limited by CP \u00a7 11-702.1, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-12\">\u201c(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, this subtitle shall be applied retroactively to include a person who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-13\">\u201c(1) is under the custody or supervision of a supervising authority on October 1, 2010;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u201c(2) was subject to registration under this subtitle on September 30, 2010;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\">\u201c(3) is convicted of any felony on or after October 1, 2010, and has a prior conviction for an offense for which registration as a sex offender is required under this subtitle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">\u201c(4) was convicted on or after October 1, 2010, of a violation of \u00a7 3-324 of the Criminal Law Article, regardless of whether the victim was a minor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The majority does not disagree that this language clearly limits retroactive application to those individuals who were already subject to registration under Title 11, subtitle 7 upon its enactment in October 2010. Nevertheless, it concludes, reasoning, based on the 1999 statutory revision, that the petitioner was required by that legislation to register for life and, thus, because he was so required when the 2010 legislation was enacted, he is, in fact, subject to subsection (a)(2), notwithstanding that the term of his registration obligation\u2014 pursuant to the 1996 version of Article 27, \u00a7 792(a)(2)(i), <em>supra </em>note 4, the statute under which the obligation originally arose \u2014 was terminated in 2008. <em>Ochoa, </em>430 Md. at 319, 61 A.3d at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">In arriving at this conclusion, as indicated, the majority relies primarily on the Legislature\u2019s 1999 revisions of the sex offender registration requirements as set forth in Article 27, \u00a7 792. <em>Id., </em>430 Md. at 319-20, 61 A.3d at 3-4. More particularly, the majority reasons that, although the petitioner was only required to register annually for ten years under the version of \u00a7 792 that was in effect upon his conviction in 1998, Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) Article 27, \u00a7 792(i), the Legislature\u2019s 1999 revisions retroactively adjusted the term of his registration obligation to the duration of his life. <em>Ochoa, </em>430 Md. at 320-22, 61 A.3d at 4-5. This conclusion is required, the majority explains, because of uncodified language \u2014 language that nowhere appears in the statute itself \u2014 in Ch. 317, Laws of 1999: \u201ca child sexual offender who is subject to the requirements of Chapter 142 of the Acts of the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Assembly of 1995<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and who committed the sexual offense before the effective date of this Act is subject to the requirements of this Act.\u201d <em>Id., </em>430 Md. at 320-21, 61 A.3d at 4 (quoting Chapter 317 of the Acts of 1999). Since, it then reasons, the petitioner was subject to Chapter 142 at the time of the 1999 revisions, and had committed the relevant crime prior to the enactment of those revisions, the term of his registration was, therefore, modified from 10 years to the duration of his life. <em>Id., </em>430 Md. at 319-20, 61 A.3d at 3-4. It is this analytical step that allows the majority to conclude, pursuant to CP \u00a7 11-702.1, that the petitioner is properly within the retroactive reach of the life term registration requirement of CP \u00a7 11-707(a)(4)(iii), being thus \u201csubject to registration under [Title 11, Subtitle 7] on September 30, 2010,\u201d when it took effect. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">When we undertake to interpret a statute, our primary objective is, and must be, \u201cto ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995); <em>Witte v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 525, 801 A.2d 160, 165 (2002); <em>Board of Education v. Zimmer-Rubert, </em>409 Md. 200, 214, 973 A.2d 233, 241 (2009). In doing so, \u201cwe look first to the words of the statute, on the tacit theory that the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant.\u201d <em>Witte, </em>369 Md. at 525, 801 A.2d at 165. Accordingly, when the words of the statute \u201care clear and unambiguous, there is no need to search further\u201d to determine legislative intent. <em>Smack v. Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>378 Md. 298, 304-5, 835 A.2d 1175, 1178 (2003) (citation omitted). We must also be mindful that \u201c[wjords may not be added to, or removed from, an unambiguous statute in order to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature chose to use.... \u201d <em>Id., </em>378 Md. at 305, 835 A.2d at 1179 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>In our effort to ascertain legislative intent, only when that intent is not clear on the face of the statute do we seek, from sources other than the words the Legislature used, to \u201cdiscern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision.... \u201d <em>Barbre v. </em>Pope, 402 Md. 157, 172, 935 A.2d 699, 708 (2007) (citation omitted); <em>see also Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 274, 987 A.2d 18, 28 (2010). Moreover, then other cardinal rules of statutory interpretation must be considered. One particularly applicable here is, we generally presume that \u201call statutes, state and federal, are intended to operate prospectively and the presumption is found to have been rebutted <em>only </em>if there are clear expressions <em>in the statute </em>to the contrary.\u201d <em>Bell v. State, </em>236 Md. 356, 369, 204 A.2d 54, 61 (1964) (emphasis added); <em>see also Mason v. State, </em>309 Md. 215, 219, 522 A.2d 1344, 1346 (1987); <em>Rigger v. Baltimore County, </em>269 Md. 306, 310, 305 A.2d 128, 131 (1973). Where the Legislature does not express a clear intention that a statute be applied retroactively, we adhere to the \u201crule of lenity\u201d, which provides that \u201ccourts will not interpret a ... criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what [the legislature] intended.\u201d <em>Gardner v. State, </em>420 Md. 1, 16, 20 A.3d 801, 811 (2011) (quoting <em>White v. State, </em>318 Md. 740, 744, 569 A.2d 1271, 1273 (1990)) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 437, 639 A.2d 675, 679 (1994). This rule \u201conly informs our interpretation of a criminal statute when the standard tools of statutory interpretation fail to discern the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Id., </em>420 Md. at 17, 20 A.3d at 811. Thus, the rule, rather than replacing the traditional process of statutory construction, \u201cprovides a mechanism for resolving ambiguity when legislative intent cannot be determined to any degree of certainty.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Applying these principles to the statutes before us, I arrive at the opposite conclusion from that reached by the majority. The 1999 revisions to Article 27, \u00a7 792 do not expressly provide for retroactive application of life term registration to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>individuals, like the petitioner, who were convicted prior to the implementation of those changes. The uncodified bill language upon which the majority relies to establish such retro-activity is, at best, ambiguous. Furthermore, this uncodified language is in conflict with the revised codified statutory language of \u00a7 792(d)(5)(ii)(3). This ambiguity fails to provide individuals such as the petitioner with sufficient notice as to the status of their original registration obligation under the 1996 version of the sex offender registration statute. In the absence of express language indicating a clear intent to apply a statute retroactively, we must adhere to our oft enunciated presumption against retroactive application. Furthermore, where, as here, the Legislature has not made its intent to increase retroactively the punishment for a conviction clear, the rule of lenity, which requires that we interpret the ambiguity in favor of the defendant, must apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">The uncodified bill language of Chapter 317 of the Acts of 1999, on which the majority relies to establish retroactivity, is ambiguous. That language provides for retroactive application to \u201ca child sexual offender who is subject to the requirements of Chapter 142 of the Acts of the General Assembly of 1995 and who committed the sexual offense before the effective date of [the] Act.\u201d Chapter 317, \u00a7 5 of the Acts of 1999. As the majority sees it, \u201cOchoa met both requirements that triggered retroactivity\u201d because \u201c[h]e was subject to those requirements at the time of the revision and committed his crimes before the effective date of the revision.\u201d <em>Ochoa, </em>430 Md. at 321, 61 A.3d at 4. The uncodified language is unclear, however, as to what these requirements are, in other words, what triggers \u2014 what is the predicate for \u2014 retroactivity. Stated differently, the uncodified language leaves unclear what it means to have \u201ccommitted\u201d the offense before the effective date of the act, such that one is \u201csubject to the requirements\u201d of the pre-1999 version of \u00a7 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Implicit in the majority\u2019s conclusion that the petitioner falls within the ambit of this provision is an inference that the provision seeks to include not only those who committed their crimes prior to the date of enactment, but those who have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>already been convicted and sentenced for those crimes. The language of the provision provides an insufficient basis for that conclusion. I agree that the first requirement \u2014 that the accused have committed his crimes prior to the effective date of the Act \u2014 is applicable to individuals such as the petitioner. The second, however, that the accused be subject to the requirements of Chapter 142 of the Acts of the General Assembly at the time the Act took effect, is much less clear. This is because Chapter 142, codified as Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 792, is not only applicable to those who have been convicted of a sexual offense, but those who have been found not guilty of such offenses. <em>See </em>\u00a7 792(a)(2)(v) (stating that \u201cchild sexual offender\u201d includes those who have been found <em>not </em>criminally responsible for violations of \u00a7 35C or any of the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 462 through 464B). It would appear, then, that the uncodified language seeks to include, within the reach of the 2000 statute, all individuals charged with a child sexual offense under the 1996 version of \u00a7 792. The language of \u00a7 792 as codified in the 2000 statute, however, suggests a different result. Specifically, given the opportunity to state, explicitly, within the body of the statute, its conditions for retroactive application, the Legislature only elected to permit, in \u00a7 792(d)(5)(ii)(3), retroactive application to those individuals who were \u201cpreviously required to register\u201d under the former statutory scheme, <em>and </em>who had then been \u201cconvicted of a subsequent violation of any offense listed in subsection (a)(2), (6), or (11)\u201d of \u00a7 792. This is in clear conflict with the uncodified language, which purports to extend retroactive application to all individuals charged with a sexual offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">An individual such as the petitioner, having been convicted as a sexual offender and, thus, already subject to the registration requirements under the former statute, could reasonably conclude, looking to the language of the statute, as he must, that his registration obligation remained unchanged. Without looking at the uncodified language, he would have no notice of the possibility that a larger group of sexual offenders were intended to be included within the statute\u2019s retroactive reach. Furthermore, looking to the uncodified language would only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>further confuse the analysis: the uncodified language seeks to reach, retroactively, all individuals charged with a sexual offense under the 1996 version of the statute, while the actual language of the statute only extends retroactive application to those individuals who were required to register under the previous statute <em>and </em>who also have been convicted of a subsequent offense. This conflict renders the intent of the Legislature with regard to retroactivity ambiguous and, under the circumstances, makes its ascertainment not just difficult, but impossible. Had the Legislature intended to extend retroactive application to <em>all </em>individuals previously charged with a child sexual offense, rather than limit it to the specific circumstances set forth in Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.) subsection (d)(5)(ii)(3) of Article 27, \u00a7 792, it simply could have said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The matter is further muddied when we look to the evolution of the statutory scheme as a whole. The 1996 version of \u00a7 792, pursuant to which the petitioner\u2019s original ten-year registration obligation arose, made no mention of retroactive application. Indeed, the Attorney General, in a letter dated May 8, 1995, recognized that \u201cany ex post facto problems with the bill were cured by \u00a7 3 of the bill, which provides that it is to be construed to apply <em>prospectively only.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). <em>See </em>Section 3, Chapter 142 of the Acts of 1995 (\u201cthis Act shall be construed only prospectively to apply to offenses that are committed after the effective date of this Act, and may not be applied or interpreted to have any effect on or application to any individual who commits an offense before the effective date of this act.\u201d). Pursuant to revisions made in 1999, the 2000 version of \u00a7 792 extended the registration period for a specific group of individuals who were previously required to register for a ten-year term only. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.) \u00a7 792(d)(5)(ii)(3). This very limited expansion did not include individuals who had only been convicted once. The uncodified language of the bill which resulted in those revisions, however, appears to provide otherwise, prescribing retroactive application to all individuals charged with a child sexual offense under the former version <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>of the statute, whether or not they were found criminally responsible. <em>See </em>Chapter 317, \u00a7 5 of the Acts of 1999; Md. Code (1957,1996 Repl.Vol.) Article 27, \u00a7 792(a)(2)(v). The sex offender registration statute in place today, set forth in CP \u00a7\u00a7 11-701 \u2014 11-707, does, in contrast, address retroactivity in great detail, delineating four specific categories of previously convicted offenders who will be subject to the statute after its enactment. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 11-702.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">An individual in the petitioner\u2019s position, looking to all these statutes, at best, would have a very difficult time ascertaining the current status of his registration obligation. Indeed, each of the statutes creates new designations for the purpose of categorizing sex offenders \u2014 \u201cchild sexual offender\u201d in 1995, \u201csexually violent offender\u201d in 1999, and the tier system in 2010. Each of the statutes also adopts a distinct stance on retroactivity which, as we have seen, is often unclear without one having to look to uncodified bill language for clarification. In the case of the 1999 revisions, looking to that uncodified language only creates greater ambiguity for the reader. It is simply unfair for this Court to hold the petitioner responsible for deciphering the complicated and often inscrutable history of Maryland\u2019s sex offender registration laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In such instances, where \u201cthe standard tools of statutory interpretation fail to discern the intent of the Legislature,\u201d <em>Gardner, </em>420 Md. at 17, 20 A.3d at 811, we must rely on other relevant guiding principles; namely, the rule of lenity, and the presumption against retroactive application. These principles, taken together, require this Court to presume, in the absence of clear language indicating otherwise, that the Legislature did not intend for Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.) Article 27, \u00a7 792 to apply retroactively, outside of the expressly enumerated exception in (d)(5)(ii)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the majority\u2019s reading is correct, and that the 1999 revisions to \u00a7 792 establish that the Legislature intended them to have retroactive application so that individuals, such as the petitioner, who were convicted of certain sexual offenses prior to its effective date, would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>subjected to life-term registration, such a reading would violate the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws set forth in Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Article 17 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\">\u201cThat retrospective laws punishing acts committed before the existence of such Laws, and by them only declared criminal, are oppressive, unjust and incompatible with liberty; wherefore, no <em>ex post facto </em>Law ought to be made; nor any retrospective oath or restriction be imposed or required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We have recognized that Article 17 is intended \u201c \u2018to assure that legislative acts give fair warning of their effect and permit individuals to rely on their meaning until <em>explicitly </em>changed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Booth v. State, </em>327 Md. 142, 174, 608 A.2d 162, 177 (1992) (quoting <em>Weaver v. Graham, </em>450 U.S. 24, 28-29, 101 S.Ct. 960, 964, 67 L.Ed.2d 17, 23 (1981)). Accordingly, its prohibition, though limited to criminal statutes, <em>Spielman v. State, </em>298 Md. 602, 609, 471 A.2d 730, 734 (1984), \u201cextends broadly to \u2018any law passed after the commission of an offense which ... in relation to that offense, or its consequences, alters the situation of a party to his disadvantage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anderson v. Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>310 Md. 217, 224, 528 A.2d 904, 908 (1987) (quoting <em>Kring v. Missouri, </em>107 U.S. 221, 235, 2 S.Ct. 443, 455, 27 L.Ed. 506, 511 (1883)) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the majority reads it, the 2000 version of Article 27, \u00a7 792 altered the consequences of the petitioner\u2019s crime. This alteration, requiring him to register for life, rather than for the ten years previously statutorily prescribed, was clearly to his disadvantage. It is just this sort of retroactive change that is prohibited by Article 17. <em>Anderson, supra. </em>Furthermore, the 1999 revisions to \u00a7 792 failed to provide the petitioner with fair warning regarding his registration status. Not only would he be unable to determine, by looking to the statutory language, that the term of his registration obligation had changed, but additional investigation, possibly leading him to the uncodified bill language of Chapter 317, would only further confuse the issue since, this language, as we have seen, clearly contradicts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the statutory language on the matter of retroactive application. For these reasons, the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 792, even if accurate, is nonetheless constitutionally impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The petitioner was not subject to life term registration under revised \u00a7 792. His ten-year obligation properly ended in 2008, well before the enactment of CL Title 11, Subtitle 7 in October, 2010. As such, not being subject to registration on September 30, 2010, the petitioner did not meet any of the requirements for retroactivity set forth in CL \u00a7 11-702.1, and is not required to register for life pursuant to \u00a7 11\u2014 707(a)(4)(iii). In reaching an opposite conclusion, the majority employs an attenuated interpretation of the provision before us, impermissibly \u201cadd[ing terms] to, [and] removing terms] from, an unambiguous statute in order to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature chose to use.... \u201d <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 305, 835 A.2d at 1179. In keeping with the presumption against retroactive application of a statute, the rule of lenity, and the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws, the majority should have concluded that the petitioner had properly satisfied his ten-year registration obligation in 2008, and was not retroactively subject to an increased life term registration requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Judge GREENE has authorized me to state that he joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-9\">.
