On October 25, 2011, the Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cBar Counsel\u201d), acting pursuant to Maryland Rule leATilla),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a \u201cPetition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Chapman, which incorporated two separate complaints filed by Ms. Barbara Bogarosh and Mr. John Butler. The factual bases of these charges arose out of Chapman\u2019s consulting agreement with James Weiskerger to perform loan-modification work through Chapman\u2019s law firm, Chapman Law Group, LLC. Through this arrangement, Bar Counsel alleged, Chapman cloaked JW Capital, Mr. Weiskerger\u2019s loan-modification business, with the authority of Chapman\u2019s law firm. Further, Bar Counsel alleged that Chapman\u2019s conduct \u201coperated to misrepresent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>mislead clients into believing they engaged the services of a law firm, rather than an unlicenced foreclosure consultant.\u201d Chapman was charged with violations of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, Rules 1.1 (Competence),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1.2 (Scope of Representation),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1.3 (Diligence),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 1.4 (Communication),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 1.5 (Fees),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 1.15 (Safekeeping Property),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 5.3 (Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>sponsibility Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 5.4 (Profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>sional Independence of a Lawyer),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 5.5 (Unauthorized Practice of Law),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 8.4 (Misconduct).11</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Pursuant to Rule 16-757,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in an order dated October 20, 2011, we referred the petition to Judge Kathleen Gallogly Cox <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for a hearing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Judge Cox heard testimony from Ms. Bogarosh, Mr. Butler, and Chapman himself, and, thereafter, issued the following Memorandum Opinion, in which she determined that Chapman violated Rules 1.4, 5.3, 5.4,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and 8.4, but did not violate Rules 1.1,1.3,1.5,1.15, and 5.5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">\n<em>Memorandum Opinion</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">This matter came before the Court for hearing on April 23, 2012, on the Petition for Disciplinary Action filed against Gerald F. Chapman. The Court has considered the testimony and evidence presented, together with post-trial submissions and arguments of Mr. Chapman and the Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Grievance Commission. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757, the Court makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">I. Findings of Fact</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">The facts giving rise to this Petition all stem from a consulting arrangement between the Respondent, Gerald F. Chapman, and JW Capital to do loan modification work. The only testimony concerning the law firm structure and the implementation of that consulting relationship came from Mr. Chapman himself. The only other testimony produced at the hearing was from two clients who filed complaints regarding services they received, as supplemented by Mr. Chapman\u2019s files concerning those representations. Given the evidence presented, the factual background giving rise to the Petition is really not in dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">A. Facts Pertaining to Mr. Chapman\u2019s Legal Practice</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">The Respondent, Gerald F. Chapman, graduated from the University of Baltimore School of Law and was admitted to practice law in Maryland in 1978. Mr. Chapman has not been the subject of any prior disciplinary proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">Throughout the early phases of his career, Mr. Chapman worked in the banking industry. He worked prior to law school as a bank examiner. Following his admission to practice, Mr. Chapman became an enforcement attorney with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (\u201cthe FHLBB\u201d), which regulates thrift institutions. He served as the deputy director of enforcement for the FHLBB from 1981 through 1985, when he left to become the vice president of Vista Federal Bank in Reston, Virginia. Mr. Chapman left that position to become the president of City National Bank in Washington, D.C. in 1992. Thus he had extensive experience within the banking industry before entering private practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">Mr. Chapman joined the law firm of Cooter, Mangold, Tompert <em>&amp; </em>Chapman, LLC in 1993 as a partner in their commercial litigation practice. He remained with that firm until 1998, doing primarily commercial litigation and some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>transactional real estate and corporate work. In 1998, Mr. Chapman became a solo practitioner, operating as the Chapman Law Group LLC (\u201cthe Firm\u201d). The majority of his practice involves commercial real estate transactions, particularly the purchase, sales, and leases for shopping centers and other commercial parcels, with some associated litigation practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">In approximately 2007 or 2008, following the dramatic decrease in commercial real estate work, Mr. Chapman\u2019s practice expanded to include loan modification work that was initially referred to him through existing clients. In contrast to his prior commercial practice, this work was mostly residential.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">The loan modification work increased, as residential defaults \u201cskyrocketed\u201d in the 2008-2009 time frame. In Mr. Chapman\u2019s experience, lenders were inundated with modification requests, and navigating the process was a challenge. He noted that lenders were \u201cunderstaffed, overworked, and started to compartmentalize.\u201d It was particularly difficult to deal with the same person within a bank, or to get a consistent approach or a response to a modification request. Around 2008, Mr. Chapman became acquainted with James Weiskerger, who was also regularly involved in loan modification work. Mr. Weiskerger is not a lawyer. Mr. Chapman indicated he believed Mr. Weiskerger had a good reputation in the loan modification field. Following several meetings and discussions concerning mutual business opportunities, the two agreed to enter into a consultant agreement. Mr. Chapman testified that he did not consider loan modification work to be legal work. He also readily acknowledged that a major impetus for the arrangement was a change in the law that prohibited non-lawyers from collecting fees up front for loan modification work. In his opinion these new provisions expressly excluded lawyers from this prohibition. Therefore he discussed a business arrangement with Mr. Weiskerger where Mr. Chapman\u2019s firm would manage the loan modification work, utilizing Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Weiskerger\u2019s firm, JW Capital, LLC (\u201cJW Capital\u201d), as a consultant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\">Ultimately, a Consulting Agreement was executed on November 1, 2008 between JW Capital and the Chapman Firm. Pursuant to that Agreement, JW Capital was to use its best efforts to secure clients for the Chapman Firm. The agreement specifically provided, \u201cIn the event that the Consultant shall use the Firm\u2019s name in connection with any advertising or solicitation, Consultant agrees to clear such advertising or solicitation in advance with Client [sic].\u201d In addition, the Agreement contemplated that JW Capital would have potential clients execute a retainer agreement for a fixed fee arrangement for representation by the Chapman Firm. Specifically, the Agreement states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">The Retainer Agreement shall contain a lump sum fixed price which shall be for services to be rendered by the Firm as well as the fees which the Firm will pay to the Consultant for its Services to the Firm for the benefit of the client. The Retainer Agreement shall set forth the manner of payment of any fees by the Client. All fees collected from any Clients shall be promptly deposited into the Firm\u2019s escrow trust fund checking account, and such fees as to which Consultant shall be entitled for its services shall be paid to Consultant by the Firm after the deposits have fully cleared. At the time that Consultant submits the initial Retainer Agreement, Consultant shall set forth on a separate form the amount of the retainer and any proposed fee that Consultant intends to charge for its Services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">Pursuant to the Agreement, the Chapman Firm agreed to utilize the services of JW Capital \u201cto the extent that the Firm deems it in the best interests of the Client.... \u201d Additionally, the Agreement outlined that the Firm and the Consultant shall meet at least weekly to review and discuss the status of each case referred to the Consultant. Mr. Chapman acknowledged that he managed the Chapman Firm out of a home office in Bethesda, but the loan modification work was done in Baltimore. The rent for that office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>was paid by JW Capital or an affiliated entity. The periodic case reviews were conducted at the Baltimore office. The unrefuted testimony from Mr. Chapman was that he met weekly with Mr. Weiskerger to go over their caseload, talk about any problems, and discuss files that needed review. He also testified they were in regular email communication. Mr. Chapman emphasized that he encouraged Mr. Weiskerger to minimize phone communications with clients, and to utilize email to create a paper trail of actions taken in the representation. Mr. Chapman testified that he believed Mr. Weiskerger did an excellent job keeping him informed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\">Mr. Chapman testified that the consulting arrangement with JW Capital began in November 2008. He stopped the consulting arrangement and wound down the loan modification following the complaints giving rise to this Petition. During those two years, Mr. Chapman estimated the Firm handled loan modifications for as many as 200 clients, and generated gross revenues of approximately $800,000. He believed that many of their clients came through referrals from prior clients. He also testified that his firm satisfactorily resolved 95-98% of these matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">At the time the consulting Agreement was implemented, Mr. Chapman and Mr. Weiskerger agreed to price the work around $1,500 for a loan modification, out of which JW Capital would receive $1,300 as a consulting fee, and the Chapman Firm would receive the remaining $200. The Retainer Agreement was structured so fees were due up front, or in a series of installments paid in the beginning of the representation. In Mr. Chapman\u2019s opinion, anyone doing loan modification work without getting a fee in advance was \u201ccrazy.\u201d His practice was to deposit the check for fees into the Firm\u2019s escrow account, and then pay the consulting fee to JW Capital after the check cleared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">Mr. Chapman stated he reviewed applicable statutes and the professional conduct rules before entering this arrangement. In his view, Mr. Weiskerger and JW Capital were not doing legal work, and he was paying them for the consulting services they provided for clients they secured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>B. The Bogarosh Loan Modification</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\">Barbara Bogarosh employed the Chapman Firm to assist with a loan modification. Ms. Bogarosh testified that she was delinquent on the mortgage on her home as a result of various financial strains. In part, she was unemployed for a period, she was unable to work while caring for a disabled parent out of state for another period, and she was caught up in a familial dispute regarding guardianship for her father. Although she was initially interested in pursuing a modification when she was unable to meet her payment obligation, her financial situation changed following the death of her father and the resolution of his estate. Ms. Bogarosh was aware she would inherit funds that would enable her to bring her mortgage current. However she was still interested in pursuing a loan modification to restructure the debt and reduce her payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">Initially Ms. Bogarosh spoke to her lender\u2019s attorney at Shapiro and Burson. When she explained that she wanted to secure a loan modification, she was told she may qualify for certain modification programs. After looking for resources on various websites, she contacted the Chapman Law Group, whom she understood to be doing business as \u201cKeep Our Homes.\u201d She contacted the firm by phone and by email and eventually spoke to James Weiskerger. Ms. Bogarosh could not recall what Mr. Weiskerger represented his position to be within the firm, but she was aware he was not a lawyer. Mr. Chapman utilized business cards for the Chapman Firm, with information for both the Bethesda and Baltimore offices. Those cards identified Mr. Weiskerger as a \u201cSenior Consultant\u201d. Ms. Bogarosh was told the Firm was experienced in loan modifications. However, unlike other groups, she was told they had an attorney as part of the group. Ms. Bogarosh met with Mr. Weiskerger, checked two of his three references, and eventually agreed to hire the Firm. Ms. Bogarosh had prior experience with foreclosure and loan modification, as she had faced foreclosure on the same property in 2007. She discussed her current situation with Mr. Weiskerger and understood it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>was not clear whether she would qualify for a modification, based upon her projected inheritance following her father\u2019s death. Although she discussed the possibility of simply paying the delinquent amount, as she would have the funds to do so, she understood Mr. Weiskerger counseled against that course of action, as she could buy a comparable property for less money in the current market. Therefore, she agreed to pursue loan modification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">On October 19, 2009, Ms. Bogarosh signed a retainer agreement, and agreed to pay a fixed fee of $1,500, to be paid in three installments, for assistance with the loan modification. The retainer agreement with the Chapman Firm was executed and returned to the firm. Ms. Bogarosh said it was a critical factor to her that she was dealing with a law firm, as other groups she talked to were simply debt consolidation firms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">Ms. Bogarosh had no direct communications with Mr. Chapman. Primarily she dealt with Mr. Weiskerger or one of the assistants who worked for him. Ms. Bogarosh paid the initial retainer fee of $500, and the follow up first installment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">At the outset of the representation, a foreclosure sale was set for Ms. Bogarosh\u2019s home on January 6, 2010. That foreclosure was postponed, and the Firm continued to try to get her loan restructured. A second foreclosure sale was set for April 28, 2010, and was again postponed. Ms. Bogarosh communicated with Mr. Weiskerger and his assistants primarily through emails. As the process continued, Ms. Bogarosh expressed concern that there seemed to be a lot of delay, and nothing was finalized. In addition, the home was in need of some substantial repairs, yet she was uneasy about investing money in repairs if the house would be lost to foreclosure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">Starting around April 2010, Ms. Bogarosh testified that she started to leave frequent messages at the Firm but often did not receive a response. She stated she never got a live answer, but had to resort to voice messages and email.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>After the April 2010 foreclosure was postponed, Ms. Bogarosh was told the Firm would prepare a Statement of Facts on her behalf, and that might help resolve the impasse with the bank. During the summer of 2010, Ms. Bogarosh testified generally about frustration with the lack of progress. Her initial contact person, Rebecca Eberwein, was no longer involved, and she was then communicating with Katie Ricketts, both of whom worked for Mr. Weiskerger. She testified that she was asked for duplicates of information previously provided, and she seemed to have to repeat the production of information previously sent to the Firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-4\">During her representation by the Firm, Ms. Bogarosh secured a new cell phone number. She communicated the new number to the Firm through phone and email messages, on more than one occasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">On August 3, 2010, Ms. Bogarosh received notice that a third foreclosure date was set for August 11, 2010. She forwarded this information to the Firm by email on August 3, 2010 at 12:20 p.m., asking, \u201cCan U make certain this is stopped?\u201d In response to requests for additional documentation on August 4, 2010, she responded to Katie Ricketts the following day, reiterating her employment status and the documentation previously provided. She then stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aic\">Again, I want to meet with you and James. I feel like I keep saying and sending the same things over and over and over again &amp; no one seems to be seeing the documents or putting the whole picture together. If we meet in person, I can hand hold U through all the documents <em>&amp; </em>U can know that U have everything....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">On August 9, 2010, Ms. Bogarosh contacted the foreclosure attorneys directly seeking a postponement of the sale based upon the pending modification request with the Chapman Firm. She again emailed the Firm noting the pending foreclosure stating, \u201cPlease take care of this.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) She sent a follow up email to James Weiskerger on August 9, 2010 at 4:53 p.m. stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Have spent the last hour on the phone with 5 different people at PHH \u2014 and I still do not have an indication that the house has been removed from the foreclosure sale list. Can U please take care of this? I can\u2019t get through to U directly. I can\u2019t understand why this was not taken care of last week. We need to talk. Barbara</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">A similar, urgent email was forwarded to the Firm, with a copy to Mr. Weiskerger on August 10 at 9:08 a.m., stating in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjF\">This is the third time I\u2019ve produced the same documents, albeit updated. Again, I want to meet with James (who I hired to do this) and you so that we have a time line and a game plan where we are all on the same page. I thought we were on the same page last April, but it appears things have spun out of control again. Pis suggest some times when we can meet. I really want to move this process to the finish line &amp; now that we have PHH\u2019s attn, let\u2019s do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">Later at 6:18 p.m. on August, 9, 2010, Ms. Bogarosh received a follow up from Katie Ricketts as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">I contacted the bank. Fortunately, they have received the documents we sent them, and they have been uploaded into the system____The representative I spoke with, Mr. Joe Pennah, made a request to have a hold placed on your sale date so as to allow the bank enough time to review your file. Due to your pending sale date, this request was made with priority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">I have been advised to call back <em>tomorrow </em>and make certain that the request for the hold on your sale date has gone through. Please check your email frequently tomorrow as I plan to call upon your file many times. I will be following up with you via email.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-10\">Ms. Bogarosh testified she tried, without success, to get confirmation of postponement from the bank the next morning, but was told the request was still pending.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The next email produced from The Chapman Firm is dated August 10, 2010 at 6:23 p.m. from Katie Ricketts stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\">Please confirm that you have filed a chapter 13 bankruptcy with Crystal Barnett in order to stop your sale date. Also; the only number we have on file for you is 240-4400-0079[sw; ]. I have been calling this number but it does not work. Please let me know a number where you can be reached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">Again, please file a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy with Crystal. Time is of the essence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">Upon receipt the next day, Ms. Bogarosh responded at 10:59 a.m.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">I picked up your emails this morning. I\u2019ve called Crystal, but she is busy. It think it is too late. I am just unspeakably angry about this. This should have been taken care of last week. I would have had time to file BR had I known you\u2019d not been vigilant in guarding my interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">Three minutes later, Katie responded that the Firm typically does not advise to file bankruptcy until the evening before the foreclosure, as they see it as a last option. She then provided names of possible firms for use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">The foreclosure sale occurred as scheduled on August 11, 2010. Later communications from Ms. Bogarosh that day, and in the ensuing couple of days, simply reiterated the breakdown that occurred. As documented in prior emails, she had communicated and verified a new phone number months before the August foreclosure date. Her frustration is summarized in her email from August 11, 2010 at 11:43 a.m.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">I have called CLG multiple times in the last 10 days and left my phone number, 240.444.0178, but no one returns my calls. It is too late. The foreclosure sale time has passed. My understanding is that once the house is sold, bankruptcy law cannot save it. If U know differently, tell me. I\u2019ve filed Chap. 13 before to save the house from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>foreclosure &amp; could have done it this time, if you\u2019d been on top of this &amp; I\u2019d heard from you earlier. You have your own inhouse lawyer, yes? Why didn\u2019t you pass this to Gerald Chapman? Could he not have filed on my behalf at the last minute? Does he think filing Chap. 13 now would save the house from the hands of a buyer who has just purchased?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\">Ms. Bogarosh reiterated she could have paid the arrearages in August to avoid foreclosure. She acknowledged that she was never guaranteed that she would obtain a modification, but she felt she was led to believe the process would be relatively easy. Until the date of the actual sale, bankruptcy was not discussed, and in her mind, it was not an option based upon the inheritance she received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">At the hearing, Mr. Chapman expressed that he was \u201caghast\u201d at the Bogarosh situation. Mr. Chapman stopped doing modification work within thirty days after learning what occurred. However he noted that 95% of the time, in his experience, foreclosures are not postponed until the day before they are set. In most instances, he found that postponements occurred when modification requests were pending.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">Mr. Chapman contended Ms. Bogarosh had to have been aware that bankruptcy was an alternative, as she had followed that course in the past. Based upon his file review, the problem occurred because Ms. Bogarosh\u2019s new telephone number was not properly logged into their system. The \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of their communications with her were by email, but by the time she reviewed the critical email to pursue bankruptcy, it was too late. Efforts to communicate by phone were ineffective since the wrong number was still maintained for her. While not excusing the miscommunication and resulting foreclosure that could have been avoided, Mr. Chapman essentially contended it was an isolated failure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">C. The Butler Loan Modification</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5k\">During the fall of 2009, John Butler was in default on four of the seven properties he owned in Maryland. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>referred to Mr. Weiskerger by his sister, who was also attempting to obtain a loan modification. Following an initial meeting, Mr. Butler signed a retainer agreement on October 19, 2009, and agreed to pay $4,500 for assistance to modify the loans on all four delinquent properties. He paid $3,375, which was all but the final installment of that fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\">Mr. Butler communicated directly with Mr. Chapman on only one occasion concerning an unrelated suit in Prince George\u2019s County. Mr. Chapman suggested he should get an attorney in the county to handle that matter. All communications concerning the loan modification were with Mr. Weiskerger or his assistant. Mr. Butler claims he was told to stop making payments on his loans. Essentially he was told that if he demonstrated he was able to pay the loans, it would delay the modification process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">Mr. Chapman adamantly denied it was the practice of the Firm to advise clients not to pay their mortgages. He testified that he harped on this with Mr. Weiskerger, stating the Firm had an absolute policy not to tell clients to stop paying their mortgages. He also indicated he spoke to both of Mr. Weiskerger\u2019s assistants on numerous occasions to reiterate this policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">Mr. Butler received numerous requests for information concerning the loan modifications, and he responded promptly with the requested information. Eventually he was referred by Mr. Weiskerger to an attorney to file bankruptcy to stop the foreclosure process. Ultimately, he filed for bankruptcy in May 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">Throughout the process, Mr. Butler was frustrated by repeated requests for duplicate information. At one point, out of frustration, he faxed information, mailed a duplicate copy, and called to confirm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">As of August 2010, the Firm was unsuccessful in obtaining loan modifications for any of the Butler properties. Rather they recommended that he attempt to sell at least one of the properties with some equity, and utilize the proceeds to reduce his debt and then see if he qualified for modification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The major impediment to obtaining the modifications for Mr. Butler was his credit card debt. Mr. Butler testified he was never advised that his credit card debt would prevent him from obtaining a loan modification. He acknowledged that he was advised that short sales of the properties were probably his best option, but he noted that he did not owe much more than the fair market value for at least some of the properties, so he did not want to pursue that option.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">Ultimately Mr. Butler believed the Firm did not assist with his difficulties. Mr. Butler stated he would not have engaged the firm if he was aware that he had too much credit card debt to qualify for a loan modification. Mr. Butler eventually filed a complaint with the Attorney Grievance Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">Mr. Chapman testified that Mr. Butler\u2019s file reflects that his credit card debt eventually posed an insurmountable difficulty. An initial tally faxed from Mr. Butler on November 3, 2009 listed nearly $72,000 in credit card debt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">D. Facts in Mitigation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">Following receipt of the complaints concerning the Bogarosh and Butler properties, Mr. Chapman wound down his loan modification work. He estimated that a portion of his practice was concluded within thirty days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">Mr. Chapman was candid in his assessment that the communication with Ms. Bogarosh was mishandled, and the house should not have been lost to foreclosure when Ms. Bogarosh had funds to pay the deficiency. He testified generally that it is the nature of loan modification work that foreclosure dates are pulled at the last minute, and that it is difficult to get a definitive answer from a bank. He also testified that the use of bankruptcy proceedings at the last minute to stop a sale is a practice that is employed, but it is done as a last resort. He did not try to justify the Bogarosh lapse on this basis, but did try to explain the reason activities seem to-stall, and then snowball.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">Mr. Chapman refunded the $1,500 fee to Ms. Bogarosh. He also refunded $2,000 to Mr. Butler. Finally, these do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>appear to be isolated failures. Mr. Chapman testified that he believed his firm successfully negotiated loan modifications for approximately 95% of the clients that engaged their services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">II. Legal Analysis</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">The Attorney Grievance Commission contends that it presented clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Chapman violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.15, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 8.4 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d) in his representation of Ms. Bogarosh, and that he violated all of the same, with the exception of Rule 1.1, in his representation of Mr. Butler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">A. MRPC 1.1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiD\">MRPC 1.1 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">The Commission contends that Mr. Chapman failed to provide competent representation to Ms. Bogarosh, essentially arguing that he provided no legal services whatsoever by delegating to others. In addition, the Commission argues Ms. Bogarosh should have been advised earlier that she may need to file for bankruptcy to delay the foreclosure proceeding. In response, Mr. Chapman argues that he retained JW Capital to provide consulting services, and that they diligently pursued the loan modification on behalf of Ms. Bogarosh. Further, he argues Ms. Bogarosh was well aware of the bankruptcy option, as she had pursued that approach in an earlier loan modification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">The evidence presented does not support a finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that the representation was not competent. Curiously, throughout these proceedings, there was no evidence of any different strategy or approach that should have been employed. Clearly the nature of the loan modification practice is a labor intensive effort to present information to a bank to endeavor to persuade it not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>to pursue foreclosure and to modify the terms of an existing loan. There was no testimony that Ms. Bogarosh qualified for a modification option that was not pursued. Similarly, there was no evidence that the bank\u2019s failure to grant the modification request, or its failure to grant the request to delay the foreclosure sale were based upon some fault or neglect in the manner this was pursued. In fact, review of the Chapman Firm file for this representation documents regular follow up with the bank by the JW Capital associate, generally on a weekly basis, in an attempt to advance the efforts. JW Capital appears to have taken the appropriate steps to seek modification. The simple fact that a modification was not obtained does not necessarily imply a lack of competence in the pursuit. This allegation is simply not supported by the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\">B. MRPC 1.3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGS0\">MRPC 1.3 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">The Commission argues that Mr. Chapman failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in pursing the Bogarosh and Butler loan modifications. In the Bogarosh matter, they point primarily to the ten month delay, with no result. In the Butler matter, they argue that Mr. Butler would not have continued to pursue representation if he had been told that credit card debt was an impediment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">The Court does not find clear and convincing evidence of a violation of MRPC 1.3. The fact that the Firm was unable to achieve a desired outcome is not, in and of itself, evidence of a lack of diligent pursuit. As noted above, the Firm files from both the Bogarosh and the Butler representations clearly document a persistent series of contacts with lenders in an effort to advance the modification requests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">Fundamentally, neither of these cases presented circumstances where the client was entitled to the requested relief. Both clients acknowledged they were told at the outset that the Firm could not guarantee they would receive a loan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>modification. It is the nature of the foreclosure and loan modification practice that even diligent efforts are thwarted at times by a lack of response from a lending institution, or by their failure to negotiate a modification, even in the face of a persuasive request. Again, lack of diligence is not adequately demonstrated on this record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">C. MRPC 1.4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anp\">MRPC 1.4 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">(a) A lawyer shall: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">(2) keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">(3) promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">The Commission contends that Mr. Chapman violated MRPC 1.4 in that he failed to respond to requests for information, and to return calls from clients. In the Bogarosh matter, the Commission argues she was not timely advised that the foreclosure sale in August 2010 remained pending, or given sufficient time to pursue bankruptcy. In the Butler matter, the Commission argues he was not timely advised of the difficulties posed by his consumer debt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">In the Butler matter, the Court does not find clear and convincing evidence of a failure to respond to requests for information or to return calls. In fact, Mr. Butler acknowledged that he spoke repeatedly with Mr. Weiskerger. While Mr. Butler denies he was advised that his consumer debt was an impediment to the modification, that recollection seems inconsistent with the strategy he acknowledges that the Firm advised him to employ, which included a bankruptcy petition to eliminate some of the debt. It also seems inconsistent with the acknowledged recommendation to pursue a sale of one or more of his properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">In the Bogarosh matter, the records clearly document key lapses in timely communication in late July and August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>2010. As detailed above, as the August 2010 foreclosure date approached, Ms. Bogarosh clearly and repeatedly requested a meeting to discuss the status of her case and the strategy. She also clearly communicated her new telephone number which was never recorded in the firm\u2019s system. During the most critical time frame, on a day when Katie Ricketts acknowledged in an email that she may be in frequent communication, and later acknowledged that she tried repeatedly to call, the inability to communicate was caused by the consultants acting for the Firm. Of greater concern, despite repeated requests to schedule a meeting, there was no response by the Firm. Throughout the critical time frame, Ms. Bogarosh\u2019s only substantive communications were with the support staff for the Firm\u2019s consultant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-2\">[430 Md. 238 (2013).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">Mr. Chapman argues Ms. Bogarosh should have been well aware of the possibility of a bankruptcy filing at the last minute, based upon her prior experience. Clearly her financial circumstances were different in 2010 than at the time of her prior bankruptcy, as she had an inheritance and an ability to pay the deficiency on the property. It is not at all clear that a bankruptcy petition could have been filed in good faith in 2010. Clearly there was no communication concerning the possibility of filing bankruptcy in a timely manner so it could have been pursued by the client. Thus the Court finds that Mr. Chapman violated MRPC 1.4 in his representation in the Bogarosh matter based upon the failure to timely communicate with the client and the failure to respond to requests to meet in the late July and August 2010 time frame.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">D. MRPC 1.5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">MRPC 1.5 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">(a) A lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses. The factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\">(2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment of the lawyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">(4) the amount involved and the results obtained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">(5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">(6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">(7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">(8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\">The Commission argues the fees charged in these matters were unreasonable, as no legal services were provided. The Court is not persuaded by this argument. Clearly significant work was done in both cases to pursue loan modifications. Whether that work required legal talent or skill is not the issue. The fees charged are not unreasonable, based upon the nature of the work that was anticipated at the time the fee was set. Similarly, they are not unreasonable in light of the efforts undertaken to pursue these matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-12\">E. MRPC 1.15</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABu\">MRPC 1.15 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">(a) A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property. Funds shall be kept in a separate account and records shall be created and maintained in accordance with Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules. Other property shall be identified specifically as such and appropriately safeguarded, and records of its receipt and distribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>shall be created and maintained. Complete records of the account funds and of other property shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of at least five years after the date the record was created....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\">(c) Unless the client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing, to a different arrangement, a lawyer shall deposit legal fees and expenses that have been paid in advance into a client trust account and may withdraw those funds for the lawyer\u2019s own benefit only as fees are earned or expenses incurred....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">The Commission argues Mr. Chapman violated MRPC 1.15 by setting an \u201cup front\u201d fee for the services for Ms. Bogarosh and Mr. Butler. In part, it argues that MRPC 1.15(c) requires written consent from the client to any arrangement other than withdrawal of fees and expenses from an escrow account only after they are earned by the lawyer. Since no successful modification was obtained, the Commission argues the fees were not earned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">This argument is not persuasive. The Retainer Agreements signed by both clients, while not extensive, contain the following language: \u201cThe Retainer shall be deemed earned upon receipt by the Firm in light of the commitment in time and resources that the Firm will have to invest in the Retained Matter, because the Firm will be securing the services of one or more consultants and because such retention precludes or limits the Firm\u2019s ability to pursue other client matters.\u201d Based upon the evidence, including this written agreement, the Court finds that both clients were aware the fee was paid up front, and they consented to that arrangement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">The Commission also argues there was a violation of MRPC 1.15 based upon the timing in which funds, once deemed earned, were paid out from the escrow account. On this issue, there was no evidence to verify when funds were deposited, and when they were actually disbursed. The general practice described by Mr. Chapman was that he waited for the checks to clear, then disbursed $200 for his fee with the balance to JW Capital for their Consulting Fee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>This does not appear to violate MRPC 1.15, given written consent to a fixed fee arrangement that is deemed earned upon receipt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">F. MRPC 5.3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjpE\">MRPC 5.3 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">With respect to a nonlawyer employed or retained by or associated with a lawyer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">(a) a partner, and a lawyer who individually or together with other lawyers possesses comparable managerial authority in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that the person\u2019s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">(b) a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over the nonlawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the person\u2019s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">(c) a lawyer shall be responsible for conduct of such a person that would be a violation of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct if engaged in by a lawyer if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\">(1) the lawyer orders or, with the knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\">(2) the lawyer is a partner or has comparable managerial authority in the law firm in which the person is employed, or has direct supervisory authority over the person, and knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take reasonable remedial action; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-12\">The Commission essentially argues that Mr. Chapman abdicated his professional responsibility by ceding all responsibility for the loan modification work to Mr. Weiskerger and his associates. In response, Mr. Chapman argues that he established a system to oversee the loan modification work through regular email communication and weekly review meetings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>While I found Mr. Chapman\u2019s testimony credible that he and Mr. Weiskerger were in regular communication, and that they met weekly for a half hour or so to discuss matters, there was no evidence that he had any familiarity with either the Bogarosh or the Butler matters until after the complaints were filed. Rather, the testimony demonstrated that Mr. Weiskerger was responsible for generating much, if not all of the loan modification business. He conducted the initial client meetings, he set the strategy, and his associates processed the necessary papers, called the banks, and communicated with the clients. Mr. Chapman had essentially no contact with these clients. Other than isolated instances, he met with none of the loan modification clients and all of the substantive loan modification work was managed and directed by his consultant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">Certainly a firm can engage consultants to assist in representation without violating an ethical obligation. Similarly, lawyers and firms can, and often do delegate responsibility for much of the file or case processing to paralegals or other paraprofessionals. In the latter instance, the lawyer clearly has an ethical obligation to oversee and manage the work delegated to junior lawyers and non-lawyers within an office. The distinction in this case, and the flaw in the arrangement, is that virtually all core case responsibility was ceded to the consultant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">The Consulting Agreement recites that, \u201cat all times, Consultant shall be providing its Services to the Firm and to no third party, including any Client.\u201d Similarly, it states, \u201cConsultant shall at all times only be rendering consulting services to the Firm.\u201d Had that approach been employed, and the Consultant was called upon to assist in representation, the arrangement would not be problematic. However, the clear reality is that the Consultant obtained the client, staffed the case, directed the approach, and only tangentially updated Mr. Chapman. The fee arrangement underscores the finding that Mr. Chapman\u2019s involvement was de minimis. In the standard case, where the fee was set at $1,500, a scant 13%, or $200, was the payment to the Firm. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Given the arrangement between the parties, Mr. Chapman would only learn of problems in cases for his own clients if they were drawn to his attention by his consultant. Although the relationship between Mr. Chapman and JW Capital was described as a Consulting Agreement, the reality is that JW Capital did not \u201cconsult\u201d so much as it managed the work from start to finish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Consulting Agreement, as implemented by Mr. Chapman, violated MRPC 5.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">G. MRPC 5.4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">MRPC 5.4 provides, in pertinent part, that, \u201c[a] lawyer or law firm shall not share legal fees with a non lawyer[.]\u201d The Commission argues this entire consulting arrangement was simply an improper agreement to share legal fees with a non-lawyer. Somewhat ironically, Mr. Chapman responds that the services JW Capital provided were not legal services, and thus the consulting fees were not legal fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">Clearly, these clients believed they were engaging the services of a law firm to assist with their foreclosure and loan modification problems. The fees were paid to the law firm, and a reasonable client would believe them to be for services rendered by the law firm. While the firm could consult and pay an appropriate fee to a consultant or expert, this arrangement operated more as a pass through or sharing of the fees obtained for this work to the consultant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">Once again, there may be occasions where a lawyer or firm repeatedly engages an expert to assist in representation, for a flat fee, and the fee for that expert is paid as part of a fixed fee set at the outset of the engagement. If the fees are disclosed and agreed to by the client, there would be no ethical violation. However the flaw in the Chapman arrangement is that, in operation, it really was a payment of $200 per case to run the loan modification work done by JW Capital through the Chapman Firm, thereby avoiding legal requirements that would otherwise be imposed on JW Capital. Regardless of how this arrangement was characterized, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>it really was a fee sharing arrangement for work contracted through a law firm, and therefore violated MRPC 5.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">H. MRPC 5.5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">MRPC 5.5 provides, in pertinent part, that, \u201c[a] lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction, or assist another in doing so.... \u201d The Commission argues that the consulting arrangement employed by Mr. Chapman enabled Mr. Weiskerger and his assistants to engage in the unauthorized practice of law. The Court does not find clear and convincing evidence to support this claim. In fact, the statutes relied upon by the Commission that seek to limit fee and billing practices for nonlawyers that engage in the precise type of business clearly demonstrate that one is not required to have a law license to provide assistance in this field.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">I. MRPC 8.4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">MRPC 8.4 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">(a) violate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-11\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-12\">The Commission argues' that Mr. Chapman engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, deceit and misrepresentation in the representation of Ms. Bogarosh and Mr. Butler. In essence, it argues that the provision of services through Mr. Weiskerger and JW Capital, under the guise of representation as a law firm, was a sham. Mr. Chapman defends the practice as a bona fide consulting arrangement that he monitored and supervised within his Firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-13\">As stated in the discussion above, the arrangement between the parties did mislead clients into believing they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>were obtaining representation through a law firm, when in reality JW Capital directed the representation. This Consulting Agreement was also designed to shield JW Capital from the requirements imposed under the Protection of Homeowners in Foreclosure Act (\u201cPHFA\u201d). <em>See, </em>Maryland Real Property (\u201cRP\u201d) Law, \u00a7 7-801 et. seq. A \u201cforeclosure consultant\u201d includes a person who solicits a homeowner to assist to delay or postpone a foreclosure sale, or to assist in refinancing a loan that is in foreclosure and for which a notice of foreclosure has been published. RP \u00a7 7-301(c). Clearly the nature of the work done by JW Capital falls within that definition. Unless excluded from coverage under this Act, the PHFA requires a foreclosure consultant to be licensed, and to utilize very specific engagement contract. RP \u00a7\u00a7 7-306; 7-308. In addition, a foreclosure consultant is prohibited from receiving compensation until \u201cafter the foreclosure consultant has fully performed each and every service the foreclosure consultant contracted to perform or represented that the foreclosure consultant would perform.\u201d RP \u00a7 7-307(2). However the PHFA specifically excludes \u201can individual admitted to practice law in the State while performing any activity related to the individual\u2019s regular practice of law in the State.\u201d RP \u00a7 7-302(a)(l).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\">The Consulting Arrangement enabled JW Capital to avoid the clear statutory requirements for license, contract disclosures, and fees, in exchange for a fee paid to Mr. Chapman, with no expectation that he would directly undertake to direct the work to be done. However earnestly Mr. Chapman believed that arrangement comported with the statutory or his ethical requirements, it operated to misrepresent and mislead clients into believing they engaged the services of a law firm, rather than an unlicensed foreclosure consultant. For that reason, the Court finds clear and convincing evidence of a violation of MRPC 8.4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">III. Conclusion</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">Although many of the violations alleged arise out of the substance of the representation of Ms. Bogarosh and Mr. Butler, having considered the testimony and the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>presented, professional competence is not, in my view, the major focus of concern. As outlined above, there were clearly lapses in the communication between the Firm and Ms. Bogarosh at a time that was critical and time sensitive. As a result, her home was lost in foreclosure. The outcome was occasioned, in large part, by what appears to be an isolated failure to update firm records with a current phone number. With Mr. Butler, there\u2019s no convincing suggestion that the Firm could or should have done something to improve the outcome. It appears that loan modification was not a viable option until Mr. Butler\u2019s consumer debt was reduced. This obstacle dictated the strategy that was pursued. The fact that little progress was made does not reflect that the matter was not competently handled. For that reason, the Petitioner dropped its contention that representation in that instance was not competent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\">While the lapse in communication with Ms. Bogarosh did rise to the level of an ethical lapse, these problems with the substance of the Firm\u2019s representation appear isolated. There is no evidence to suggest a pattern of sub-par representation by the Firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">The real thrust of the viable grievances derives from the practice of lending the dignity of a law office to help to promote what is, in essence, a non-legal service. Mr. Chapman repeatedly acknowledged that he did not consider the loan modification services done under the auspices of the Firm to be real \u201clegal service.\u201d In fact, clearly one is not required to be a lawyer in order to provide loan modification services. However if those services are provided in a setting other than a law firm, the provider must be licensed, and there are restrictions on the ability to require fees to be paid up front.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">The business association between Mr. Weiskerger and Mr. Chapman was designed to allow Mr. Weiskerger to continue to provide loan modification services without a license, and to demand fees in advance. Mr. Chapman\u2019s involvement served to cloak those services with the aura of a law firm, thereby allowing Mr. Weiskerger to continue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>a manner that would not otherwise be permitted. While there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with a lawyer engaging a consultant, or with passing through a payment of a fee for the reasonable value of those consulting services, the operation in this instance is not that model. It is more akin to payment of a fee by a business for use of the cache of the law firm. The law firm is not much more than a prop to attract business that does not require special legal acumen or skill. Of particular concern in this case, the affiliation with the law firm enabled those non-legal loan modification services to be done by non-lawyers not affiliated with the firm in a manner that would not otherwise be permitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\">While I find that Mr. Chapman researched and attempted to structure an arrangement that complied with statutory and ethical requirements, I believe his judgment was in error. For that reason, and for those detailed above, I find clear and convincing evidence of violations of MRPC 1.4, 5.3, and 8.4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">(internal footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u201cThis Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings in Maryland.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v.Seltzer, </em>424 Md. 94, 112, 34 A.3d 498, 509 (2011), quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v.

Nelson, </em>425 Md. 344, 358, 40 A.3d 1039, 1047 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Bar Counsel\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Chapman did not violate Rule 1.5(a) is premised on Chapman\u2019s representation of Ms. Bogarosh, wherein she entered into a retainer agreement with the Chapman Law Group, LLC, that stated that its purpose was for the \u201cadvising and counseling [of Ms. Bogarosh] as to appropriate or alternative courses of action as well as attempting to negotiate with any lenders with secured interests in the Premises.\u201d Bar Counsel argues that Chapman, however, testified that he never provided Ms. Bogarosh with any legal services, never discussed alternative courses of action, and never negotiated on her behalf. Moreover, Bar Counsel asserts that while the retainer agreement does state that \u201cthe firm [would] be securing the services of one or more consultants[,]\u201d Ms. Bogarosh was not informed that the loan modification services \u201cwould be provided exclusively by the consultants or that the consultants would receive all but $200 of the $1,500 fee.\u201d According to Bar Counsel, these facts, taken together, inexorably lead to the conclusion that Chapman did not provide any legal services, yet received a fee, in violation of Rule 1.5(a), which requires that fees charged by attorneys be reasonable. The hearing judge disagreed, determining that Chapman did not violate Rule 1.5(a) because, while no legal services were rendered by the firm, non-legal services were provided to the clients that were commensurate with the fees charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We shall sustain Bar Counsel\u2019s exception. The critical difference between the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion and Bar Counsel\u2019s assertion is that the judge determined that the fee was reasonable because services were rendered, albeit by Mr. Weiskerger, a non-lawyer, while Bar Counsel emphasizes that no legal services were provided by Mr. Chapman to justify the fee. Rule 1.5 was violated because, in the instant case, Chapman never anticipated, nor did he do, any actual legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>work to justify a fee of $1,500. When asked at the hearing whether the loan modification services were legal services, Chapman responded simply \u201cNo,\u201d and acknowledged that Ms. Bogarosh did not receive any legal services.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The uncontroverted findings in this case support that a \u201ccritical factor\u201d to Ms. Bogarosh when she decided to engage Chapman\u2019s firm was that the Chapman firm was a law firm, as opposed to a loan modification business, because she was concerned about having legal advice in addition to loan modification services. The retainer agreement between Ms. Bogarosh and the firm explicitly detailed legal services that would be provided, including negotiation on her behalf, that, by Chapman\u2019s own testimony at the hearing, he never provided. In fact, Chapman testified that he knew it was not possible to negotiate with the lenders on behalf of the borrowers early in this practice but, \u201cjust never changed the document\u201d to eliminate that language to reflect the actual legal services he was capable of providing.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The hearing judge also found that, \u201c[cjlearly, these clients believed they were engaging the services of a law firm to assist with their foreclosure and loan modification problems. The fees were paid to a law firm, and a reasonable client would believe them to be for services rendered by the law firm.\u201d With respect to oversight of the clients\u2019 matters, the judge specifically noted that, \u201cthe arrangement between the parties did mislead clients into believing they were obtaining representation through a law firm, when in reality JW Capital directed the representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The violation of Rule 1.5 occurred in the present case because it is well established that a fee arrangement is unreasonable if the attorney fails to perform any meaningful work on behalf of the client in exchange for the fee. In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Monfried, </em>368 Md. 373, 794 A.2d 92 (2002), we considered whether an attorney who had entered into retainer agreements to provide legal services in two criminal matters, but did not actually provide any legal services, had violated Rule 1.5. We held that Monfried violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the Rule, stating that \u201c[although the fee may have been reasonable for the services that [the hearing judge] found were to be provided, respondent did little or no work for [the client].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394, 794 A.2d at 104. <em>See also Attorney Grievance v. Stinson, </em>428 Md. 147, 166-67, 50 A.3d 1222, 1233-34 (2012); <em>Attorney Grievance v. McLaughlin, </em>372 Md. 467, 504-05, 813 A.2d 1145, 1165-66 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">In the instant case, there is no question that work was performed by the consultant, who was a non-lawyer, hired by Chapman. The retainer agreement, however, sets forth the appropriate scope of the representation and, in this case, anticipated and explicitly referred to legal services that were to have been provided. Chapman never provided such services, nor could have so delivered the negotiating services. The facts as found by the hearing judge illustrate that the only work done for any of the clients was non-legal work performed by Mr. Weiskerger, rather than any legal work undertaken by Chapman. Thus, Rule 1.5(a) was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Bar Counsel\u2019s second exception relates to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Chapman did not violate Rule 1.15(c), which requires that all fees and expenses paid in advance by a client be kept in a trust account and withdrawn as actually earned, unless the client gives informed consent in writing. The hearing judge and Bar Counsel diverge in their opinions because Chapman did inform Ms. Bogarosh in the retainer agreement that the fee would be \u201cearned upon receipt,\u201d to which she consented by signing the agreement; Bar Counsel asserts, however, that Rule 1.15(c) requires more than mere consent because it requires \u201cinformed consent,\u201d defined in Rule 1.0(f) as \u201cthe agreement by a person to a proposed course of conduct after the lawyer has communicated adequate information and explanation about the material risks of and reasonably available alternatives to the proposed course of conductf,]\u201d which the retainer agreement failed to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The retainer agreement in the instant case purported to justify the fee being \u201cearned upon receipt\u201d because Chapman was precluded from, or limited in, representing other clients <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>by virtue of undertaking representation and because of the need to engage consultants. There is no evidence, however, that the retainer agreement explained the risks associated with paying a fee that would not be held in trust \u2014 namely that the fee would be considered earned upon receipt, no matter the level of effort undertaken by the lawyer, and that return of any portion of the fee, thus, could be precluded. Although we have not decided a case involving whether a writing was sufficient to constitute informed consent, the definition in Rule 1.0(f) makes clear that an attorney <em>must </em>communicate the risks associated with a fee arrangement that varies from the standard escrow arrangement. As the hearing judge noted, the retainer agreement only contained a small section informing the client that the fee was earned upon receipt. Neither the retainer agreement, nor Chapman personally, explained the material risks associated with entering into an \u201cearned upon receipt\u201d fee agreement, in violation of Rule 1.15(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">The only matter that remains is to determine the appropriate sanction for Chapman\u2019s conduct. As mitigating facts, the hearing judge found that Chapman \u201cwound down\u201d his loan modification services as soon as he was informed about the complaints, that he refunded the fees paid to him by Ms. Bogarosh and Mr. Butler and that Chapman had no prior disciplinary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We have often stated that the purpose of sanctioning attorneys is, principally, to protect the public, not to punish the errant attorney. E.g., <em>Attorney Grievance v. Khandpur, </em>421 Md. 1, 17, 25 A.3d 165, 175 (2011). Bar Counsel recommends 'an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in 180 days, directing our attention to <em>Attorney Grievance v. Kimmel and Silverman, </em>405 Md. 647, 955 A.2d 269 (2008) and <em>Attorney Grievance v. Brennan, </em>350 Md. 489, 714 A.2d 157 (1998). In <em>Kimmel and Silverman, </em>we disciplined two attorneys for violating Rules 5.1 and 1.4, noting that the attorneys had failed to supervise attorneys within their own firm, by imposing an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in 90 days. In <em>Brennan, </em>we imposed a 90 day suspension for an attorney who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>had violated Rules 1.3,1.4, 5.4, 5.5, 8.1, and 8.4 by sharing fees with an attorney who was suspended and misleading his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">We agree that Chapman\u2019s conduct is similar to that of the attorneys in the cases cited by Bar Counsel, in that similar, although not identical, Rules were violated. Their similarity supports the imposition of an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in 90 days in the instant case, especially in light of the mitigation found by the hearing judge. In each of those cases cited by Bar Counsel, the errant attorneys failed to adequately supervise those performing work for them, to the detriment of their clients. Moreover, <em>Brennan </em>involved not only an attorney who split fees with a non-lawyer but also nearly identical Rules violations, and, as Bar Counsel stated in his recommendation for sanction, \u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct was analogous to that of Mr. Brennan.\u201d We believe, as a result, that the appropriate sanction in this case is an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply after 90 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST GERALD FREDERICK CHAPMAN.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">McDONALD, J., concurs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-9\">.

I do differ, however, with the Court\u2019s ruling on one of the exceptions, which does not affect the disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Many homeowners caught up in the recent foreclosure crisis have sought assistance in negotiating a modification of their mortgage to avoid foreclosure for the ultimate benefit of both the homeowner and the lender. Attorneys may provide such assistance. Examples can be found in the Foreclosure Prevention Project endorsed by this Court, which provides in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>struction to attorneys in loan modification, among other things. <em>See </em>http://probonomd.org/about-us/104-foreclosureprevention-pro-bono-project. But attorneys are not the exclusive providers of such assistance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Many homeowners who could benefit from such assistance cannot afford to pay the typical fees charged by attorneys but also do not qualify for free legal services; not all can be accommodated by the Foreclosure Prevention Project. According to the findings of the hearing judge, Mr. Chapman was apparently trying to develop a practice that would meet this need in a way that he apparently believed would comply with the relevant law. Although he was able to achieve favorable outcomes for many clients, he failed to comply with certain provisions of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">One of the alleged violations was based on Rule 1.5(a), which concerns the reasonableness of fees and expenses charged by an attorney. In the case of Ms. Bogarosh, the client agreement revealed that Mr. Chapman would be retaining a consultant to assist with the loan modification efforts, and that a portion of the client\u2019s payment would be used to pay that expense. And it was undisputed that loan modification efforts were actually undertaken on behalf of Ms. Bogarosh, although they proved unsuccessful, in part due to miscommunication. The hearing judge concluded that Mr. Chapman did not violate Rule 1.5(a) because \u201c[t]he fees charged are not unreasonable, based upon the nature of the work that was anticipated at the time the fee was set. Similarly, they were not unreasonable in light of the efforts undertaken ...\u201d Although this was one of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, it was very much bound up in the particular facts of the case. In this context, I would defer to the judgment of the hearing judge and overrule the exception.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\">.
