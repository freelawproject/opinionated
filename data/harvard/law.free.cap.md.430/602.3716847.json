Initially, Petitioner charged Respondent, stemming from his representation of Pamela Jackson (\u201cMs.Jackson\u201d), with violating various Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or \u201cRule\u201d), including Rule 1.1 (Competence)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; Rule 1.3 (Diligence)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; Rule 1.4(a) and (b) (Communication)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; Rule 1.15(a) and (c) (Safe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>keeping Property)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; Rule 1.16(a) and (d) (Declining or Terminating Representation)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; Rule 5.5(a) and (b) (Unauthorized Practice of Law; Multijurisdictional Practice of Law)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Rule 8.4(a), (c) and (d) (Misconduct)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>. In the amended petition, Bar Counsel charges Respondent made false representations in his \u201cPetition for Reinstatement\u201d to this Court and violated Rule 3.3(a)(1) (Candor Toward the Tribunal)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>; Rule 8.1(a) (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; and Rule 8.4(a), (c), and (d) (Misconduct). This Court referred the matter to Judge Katherine D. Savage of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for a hearing to determine findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757 (Judicial Hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">On May 16, 2012, Judge Savage conducted an evidentiary hearing, during which Respondent was represented by counsel, and thereafter, the hearing judge issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, in which she found, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent\u2019s acts and omissions constituted violations of MLRPC 1.1; 1.3; 1.4(a) and (b); 1.15(a) and (c); 1.16(a) and (d); 5.5(a), (b)(1) and (b)(2); 3.3(a)(1); 8.1(a); and 8.4(a), (c) and (d). In so doing, Judge Savage made the following findings of fact regarding Respondent\u2019s background, representation of Ms. Jackson and the filing of Respondent\u2019s \u201cPetition for Reinstatement\u201d to this Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Findings of Fact</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">Respondent was admitted to the Maryland Bar on June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>24, 1998.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Page holds an undergraduate degree in accounting from Towson University, a Master\u2019s degree in finance from the University of Baltimore and a <em>Juris Doctor </em>degree from the University of Maryland. Respondent is also a Certified Public Accountant and has taught accounting and paralegal studies at Montgomery College since 1988.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\">At trial, Petitioner offered the testimony of Respondent and Ms. Jackson. Petitioner\u2019s documentary exhibits were admitted without objection. Respondent testified in his defense and also offered documentary exhibits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The Jackson Complaint</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">On May 25, 2006, Respondent entered into a retainer agreement with Ms. Jackson for the purpose of representing her in a dispute over alleged defects in the construction of Ms. Jackson\u2019s new home. Ms. Jackson agreed to pay Respondent $5,000 as an \u201cinitial fee\u201d with the proviso that an additional fee may be required to meet unforeseen circumstances [citations omitted here and throughout]. Respondent testified that, at the time the agreement was executed, he knew that the claim between Ms. Jackson and the builder was contested. The retainer agreement further provided that \u201cno hourly billings will be kept nor shall be expected.\u201d Mr. Page did not keep time records regarding his work on Ms. Jackson\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">Ms. Jackson made an initial payment to Mr. Page of $2,500, which Respondent deposited into his attorney trust account on June 12, 2006. The funds were subsequently removed from the trust account. Mr. Page presented no credible evidence that the funds were earned at the time they were removed from the trust account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Less clear is what happened to the second payment of $2,500 Ms. Jackson made to Respondent on March 12, 2007 by check number 7858805. When questioned by Petitioner\u2019s counsel, Respondent testified that the signature endorsing check number 7858805 was his. When questioned by his own counsel, Respondent testified that he had no recollection of receiving check number 7858805 and that he had no idea who owned the account into which the check was deposited. In response to the Court\u2019s question as to whether or not the signature was his, Respondent testified, \u201cYour Honor, I\u2019ve got a crazy signature. I have to say that it looks, when I\u2019m writing fast, it could very well be, but as to the signature on it, it appears to be, it looks like my signature. It appears to be my signature.\u201d Mr. Page later changed his testimony to state that the signature was not his. Respondent also testified that he frequently endorsed checks with a stamp and not a handwritten signature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-4\">On balance, and after weighing the credibility of both Mr. Page and Ms. Jackson, the Court accepts Ms. Jackson\u2019s testimony. Her memory of events was cogent, clear and internally consistent. Mr. Page, on the other hand, appe\u00e1red confused as to some events, forgetful of others, and evidenced an overall lack of clarity in recalling basic facts about this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">The Court therefore finds that Respondent both received and endorsed check number 7858805, and caused the check to be deposited in a non-trust account held at Wachovia Bank. Respondent presented no evidence that the funds from either payment were maintained in trust <em>until earned. </em>By his own admission, Respondent agreed that he did not maintain a client ledger, time records or any other documentation relating to the receipt, maintenance or disbursements of funds received from Ms. Jackson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">From May 25, 2006 through December 7, 2006, Ms. Jackson forwarded all relevant documents relating to her claim to Respondent. Despite Ms. Jackson\u2019s repeated requests to move her case along, Respondent continually delayed. Respondent would tell Ms. Jackson that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>working on her case, that he was going out of town or that he was waiting for the resolution of the case filed by the county in the District Court for Prince George\u2019s County related to building permit violations. Mr. Page claims that during this time he was accumulating evidence on Ms. Jackson\u2019s behalf and meeting with Prince George\u2019s County building inspectors to evaluate their potential usefulness as witnesses in the lawsuit he was preparing to file. Respondent informed Ms. Jackson that her complaint would be filed before the end of the year, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\">The Court notes that the resolution of the Prince George\u2019s County case was not necessary to Ms. Jackson\u2019s case because it did not involve work that was the subject of her complaint against the builder. Despite arguing that he was accumulating evidence on Ms. Jackson\u2019s behalf between May 2006 and the time of filing, Respondent presented no billing records or communications to demonstrate his work on the case. On February 23, 2007, nearly nine months after being retained, Respondent filed a complaint on behalf of Ms. Jackson in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. The complaint contained six counts: breach of contract, negligence, breach of implied warranty of good and workmanlike construction, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">Respondent testified that at the time the complaint was filed, he did not know that an expert witness would be required to establish the standard of care, breach or causation. Ms. Jackson made requests for a copy of the complaint by voicemail and e-mail. Respondent never provided Ms. Jackson with a copy of the complaint. She eventually went to the courthouse and purchased a copy from the clerk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">The Defendants were served on April 11 and 18, 2007. On May 16, 2007, Respondent filed a premature Motion for Default alleging that <em>all </em>Defendants were served on April 11, 2007. On May 17, 2007, the Defendants filed an Answer denying all material facts and any liability and asserting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>number of affirmative defenses. Respondent received the Defendants\u2019 Answer, but at the instant hearing could not recall whether he had reviewed it. The trial court denied the Motion for Default.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\">Beginning in or before July 2007, Respondent made multiple representations to Ms. Jackson that he would prepare and file a motion for summary judgment. He initially represented that a motion would be filed on or before October 18, 2007. Mr. Page eventually filed the motion in March 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">In October 2007, Respondent began employment with the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). IRS policy prohibited Respondent from maintaining a private practice or representing any client without first obtaining approval from the IRS. Both Mr. Page and Ms. Jackson, who had previously been employed by the IRS, testified that they were both aware of the IRS policy. Mr. Page testified that he reported his active cases to his IRS manager, as required, and that he received permission to wrap-up matters with several clients. Mr. Page agrees with Petitioner that he never received clearance to continue work on Ms. Jackson\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">On October 28, 24, 25 and November 27, and 29, 2007, Ms. Jackson attempted to contact Respondent for updates on her case. Respondent did not respond to any of her requests for information. On December 4, 2007, Ms. Jackson was finally able to contact Respondent and Respondent assured her that the motion would be filed before Christmas. On December 18 and 19, 2007, Ms. Jackson left messages for Respondent to call her. Respondent did not return the messages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">On January 7, 2008, while Ms. Jackson\u2019s case was still pending, Mr. Page consented to a thirty (30) day suspension from the practice [of] law in the State of Maryland. On January 15, 2008, Ms. Jackson left a voicemail message for Respondent. On January 16, 2008, Ms. Jackson reached Respondent by telephone. Respondent did not inform Ms. Jackson of his suspension but did, for the first time, inform Ms. Jackson that he had begun employment with the IRS in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>October 2007<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and noted that he would need to receive IRS approval to continue her case. The Court finds that Respondent led Ms. Jackson to believe that he had requested approval to continue her case. Mr. Page also acknowledged that Ms. Jackson repeatedly asked if approval had been granted. Respondent admitted at the instant hearing that he never sought the necessary IRS approval to continue Ms. Jackson\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">Respondent conducted no discovery in Ms. Jackson\u2019s case. In his testimony, Mr. Page demonstrated that he did not understand what the discovery process entailed. On March 6, 2008, while suspended from the practice of law and without IRS permission to continue representing Ms. Jackson, Respondent filed \u201cPlaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment on the Issue of Liability\u201d (hereafter \u201cMotion\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mr. Page never fully explained the delay in filing the Motion, but he did testify that he believed it was unlikely the motion would be granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">The Motion contained facts outside the record and was not supported by an affidavit. The complaint itself was not verified. Respondent testified at trial that he did not know what a \u201cverified complaint\u201d was. The Motion contained the following misrepresentations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">1. Paragraph 1 of the Motion states \u201cNo dispute of material facts exists on the issue of whether Plaintiff contributed to the [sic] neither Breach of Contract nor negligence.\u201d The statement is a misrepresentation. Defendant\u2019s answer at paragraph 73 provides \u201cThe Plaintiffs claims are barred by contributory negligence.\u201d Because Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>did not propound any discovery, at the time the Motion was filed, he had no evidence to prove the facts disputed by the Defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">2. Paragraph 3 of the Motion states \u201cNo dispute of material fact exists as to whether or not Plaintiff sustained damages from the breach of contract and negligence committed by the defendants.\u201d The statement is a misrepresentation. The Defendants denied all damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">3. Paragraph 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the Motion all contain facts alleged by Respondent as \u201cnot in dispute.\u201d Each fact alleged was specifically denied by the Defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">When questioned by Petitioner\u2019s counsel on the issue of \u201cdisputed facts\u201d in the summary judgment motion, he stated that the facts were not disputed <em>by his client. </em>He further explained that he accepted <em>his own facts </em>and documents referenced in his argument for summary judgment. Clearly, Mr. Page has little to no understanding of summary judgment law. At one point, he testified that he did not even recall when he actually filed the Motion for Summary Judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">The Prince George\u2019s County court denied the Motion in an order dated May 21, 2008. On May 27, 2008, Respondent left a voicemail message for Ms. Jackson informing her that the court had denied the Motion. Mr. Page stated that \u201c[he\u2019s] not gonna be able to proceed in litigation at this point, \u2018cause I still haven\u2019t received clearance from IRS to do, to do any further litigation.\u201d Ms. Jackson sent Respondent a termination letter dated June 17, 2008, requesting that her file be transferred to substitute counsel and that Respondent provide an itemized statement of all expenses incurred with a check for the balance remaining from the retainer of $5,000. Several weeks later, and after Ms. Jackson paid $50 for copying costs, Respondent delivered Ms. Jackson\u2019s file to substitute counsel. Respondent never provided Ms. Jackson with an itemization of fees and expenses, nor did he refund any unearned fees. Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>never informed Ms. Jackson that he had been suspended from the practice of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Petition for Reinstatement</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">On January 7, 2008, Petitioner and Respondent filed a Joint Petition for Suspension of Respondent, by Consent, for 30 Days in the Court of Appeals. The Joint Petition was signed by Respondent under penalty of perjury and upon personal knowledge and states \u201cRespondent agrees to comply with Maryland Rule 16-760.\u201d Respondent testified that he reviewed the Petition prior to signing it and that he had an opportunity to and did, in fact, discuss the Petition with his attorney. The Court of Appeals, by order dated January 7, 2008, suspended Respondent from the practice of law for thirty days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">Respondent did not comply with Maryland Rule 16-760. Specifically, Mr. Page admitted at trial that he failed to adhere to subsection (c)(1) by continuing to represent Ms. Jackson. In doing so, Respondent also violated subsection (c)(2) by failing to take any steps to protect Ms. Jackson, and subsection (c)(3) by failing to conclude Ms. Jackson\u2019s matter within 15 days of the order of the Court of Appeals. In violation of subsection (c)(4), Mr. Page did not identify to Bar Counsel any currently pending client matters. Mr. Page violated subsection (c)(5) by failing to mail to Ms. Jackson and opposing counsel a letter notifying each of them of the order and the fact that he would be unable to practice law after the effective date of the order. Respondent violated subsection (c)(6) by failing to withdraw within 60 days from Ms. Jackson\u2019s pending lawsuit in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Respondent violated subsection (c)(8) by failing to deliver promptly to Ms. Jackson any papers or other property to which she was entitled, and subsection (c)(10) by failing to file an affidavit with the Commission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>On March 28, 2011, Respondent filed a Petition for Reinstatement in the Court of Appeals. Respondent prepared and filed the Petition for Reinstatement <em>pro se. </em>Respondent asserted, at Paragraph 3, that he \u201chas abided by Md. Rule 16-760 since the 7th day of January, 2008.\u201d Contrary to this assertion, Respondent admitted at trial that he did not comply with Md. Rule 16-760. Mr. Page also stated in his Petition for Reinstatement, at Paragraph 4, that he \u201chas not had any cases pending before any court in the State of Maryland or any other court in the United States since the 7th day of January, 2008.\u201d Respondent admitted at the hearing that the statement was \u201cincorrect.\u201d Respondent asserted, at Paragraph 5 of the Petition for Reinstatement, that he \u201chas not had any legal clients or engaged in the practice of law in the State of Maryland or anywhere in the United States since the 7th day of January, 2008.\u201d Respondent again admitted at the instant hearing that the statement was \u201cincorrect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">On April 5, 2011, Petitioner filed a Response to Petition for Reinstatement stating in part that Respondent failed to file an affidavit pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-760(c)(10) and did not provide any information concerning his compliance with Maryland Rule 16-760. On April 8, 2011, Respondent filed a Response under penalty of perjury in which he stated that, at the time of his suspension, he had \u201cceased the active practice of law and did not have any legal clients.\u201d Respondent admitted at hearing that the statement was false.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">On April 18, 2011, Petitioner filed a Supplemental Response to Petition for Reinstatement alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that Respondent had failed to advise Ms. Jackson or opposing counsel in Ms. Jackson\u2019s case of his suspension, that Respondent filed a Motion for Summary Judgment in Ms. Jackson\u2019s case while suspended from the practice of law and that Respondent had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law following his suspension on January 7, 2008. The Court of Appeals denied Respondent\u2019s Petition for Reinstatement by Order dated April 21, 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>On April 27, 2011, Respondent filed a Motion to Modify Order for Reinstatement under MD Rule 16\u201460(k)(2)(l) and request for Reconsideration of Order Denying Petition for Reinstatement under penalty of perjury. In his Motion to Modify, Respondent stated: \u201cprior to voluntary suspension on or before December 31, 2007, [Respondent] informed [Ms. Jackson] that legal representation would be terminated as a condition of employment with the federal government.... \u201d The Court finds that Respondent\u2019s statement was false. Respondent first told Ms. Jackson of his employment with the IRS sometime in early 2008, and Respondent informed Ms. Jackson that the representation would be terminated because of the IRS policy in a voice-mail message on May 27, 2008. In his Motion to Modify, Respondent stated that he \u201chas substantially complied with sections (c) and (d) of MD Rule 16-760 for 36 months.... \u201d At the instant hearing, Respondent admitted that he had failed to comply with subsections (c) and (d), as discussed above, and that the statement in his Motion to Modify \u201cwould be a presumed inaccurate statement.\u201d The Court finds that Respondent failed to comply with Rule 16-760 at all, and that the representation that he had \u201csubstantially complied\u201d was false. The Court of Appeals denied Respondent\u2019s Motion to Modify by Order dated May 20, 2011.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Bar Counsel Investigation of Ms. Jackson\u2019s Complaint</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">\u201cBy letter dated April 5, 2011, Respondent provided a response to Bar Counsel regarding the complaint filed by Ms. Jackson. Respondent\u2019s April 5 letter contained multiple misrepresentations. Respondent stated: I represented Ms. Jackson up through the Summary Judgment phase, which was denied. Subsequently, after I received the Summary Judgment denial I was offered and I accepted a position with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\u201d The undisputed testimony at the hearing was that Respondent\u2019s employment \"with the IRS began in October 2007, seven months prior to the denial of the Motion for Summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Judgment. Respondent admitted at trial that his statement to Bar Counsel was a misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\">In his letter of April 5, 2011, Respondent stated to Bar Counsel that he, \u201capplied for permission to continue [Ms. Jackson\u2019s] case along with my teaching as an adjunct professor at an area college. IRS granted me my continued teaching employment but never granted permission to continue any legal cases, including Ms. Jackson\u2019s case.\u201d At trial, Respondent admitted that he had never applied to the IRS for permission to continue Ms. Jackson\u2019s case following his employment with them in October 2007. Further, in his letter of April 5, 2011, Respondent stated to Bar Counsel that \u201cto the best of my knowledge, I closed all of my legal cases on or before December 31, 2007, including Ms. Jackson\u2019s case.\u201d At trial, Respondent admitted that this statement to Bar Counsel was false.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"AOYN\">The Jackson Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Judge Savage entered detailed conclusions of law concerning both complaints. As to Ms. Jackson\u2019s complaint, the hearing judge began by pointing out that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1 on numerous occasions. According to Judge Savage, Respondent\u2019s Motion for Default in the Jackson case was premature, and his Motion for Summary Judgment did not meet the requirements of Maryland Rule 2-501. Page did not understand fully the requirements for filing a Motion for Summary Judgment because he claimed that there were no disputes of material fact when, in reality, the builder disputed all the facts in Ms. Jackson\u2019s complaint. Further, Judge Savage concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">Respondent\u2019s testimony made it clear that he did not understand the legal meaning of \u201cfacts not in dispute.\u201d When questioned on the subject, Respondent admitted that Defendants did, in fact, dispute all facts asserted by Ms. Jackson in her complaint. Respondent attached the Consent Order to Enforce Compliance with the Building Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>from the District Court case to the Motion. The Consent Order was not certified or authenticated. Mr. Page testified that he \u201cfelt the County proved my case.\u201d He later testified that it was not \u201cproof positive\u201d but rather \u201cstrong evidence for a complaint.\u201d The Consent Order addressed permit violations of the builder, and did not constitute proof of either a breach of contract claim or a negligence claim in Ms. Jackson\u2019s case. Additionally, Respondent testified that he \u201cdidn\u2019t think [the summary judgment motion] was going to be approved\u201d but that he wanted to \u201cpreserve the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\">Respondent failed to pursue any discovery on behalf of Ms. Jackson\u2019s claim. At trial, Respondent testified that his \u201cdiscovery\u201d consisted of exhibits attached to the original complaint and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have any other additional discovery to produce because [he] provided it with the complaint.\u201d Respondent did not request any discovery from the defendants and it is unclear whether or not Respondent even understands the legal meaning of discovery. These facts combined establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that Mr. Page violated MRPC 1.1 in his handling of Ms. Jackson\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">MLRPC 1.3. Diligence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">Respondent violated Rule 1.3 on multiple instances in the course of Ms. Jackson\u2019s representation. At the outset of the representation, Respondent represented to Ms. Jackson that he would gather documents, prepare and send a demand letter to the builder and investigate whether the potential defendants had filed for bankruptcy protection. Respondent failed to do any of the tasks outlined. The Court finds that Respondent\u2019s nine-month delay in filing Ms. Jackson\u2019s complaint is a violation of Rule 1.3. Ms. Jackson provided Mr. Page with multiple documents at the outset of their relationship, and Respondent could provide no creditable explanation for the delay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">The complaint eventually filed by Respondent required expert witness testimony to establish either a breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>contract or negligence. Respondent failed to consult with or retain an expert. Additionally, and as noted above, Respondent failed to prepare or propound any discovery on behalf of Ms. Jackson after the complaint was filed. The record indicates that the Circuit Court never issued a scheduling order in Ms. Jackson\u2019s case but, given Ms. Jackson\u2019s repeated requests to Respondent to move the case forward, the Court finds that Respondent\u2019s failure to pursue discovery of Ms. Jackson\u2019s complaint in any meaningful manner following its filing was a violation of Rule 1.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">Mr. Page\u2019s claim that he spent the time between May 2006 and February 2007 investigating Ms. Jackson\u2019s claim is not credible. It is clear to the Court that he did little to nothing in furtherance of his client\u2019s claim, and is therefore found to be in violation of MRPC 1.3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">MLRPC 1.4. Communication.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">The Court finds Respondent violated Rule 1.4(a)(2) and (3) by faffing to keep Ms. Jackson reasonably informed about the status of her case, by failing to promptly return her phone calls and emails, by failing to promptly respond to her requests for information and by failing to provide copies of documents requested. The Court finds Respondent violated Rule 1.4(a)(4) by failing to inform Ms. Jackson that he could no longer represent her in October 2007 when his employment with the IRS began and by failing to inform her that he was suspended from the practice of law in January 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-8\">The Court finds Respondent violated Rule 1.4(b) by failing to explain the terms of his representation to Ms. Jackson to the extent reasonably necessary to permit her to make informed decisions about the representation. The retainer agreement prepared by Respondent and executed by Ms. Jackson fails to adequately outline the terms of the representation and the fees that would be associated with the representation. The retainer agreement refers to the $5,000 fee as an \u201cinitial fee\u201d and then as a \u201cflat rate.\u201d The retainer agreement goes on to provide that, \u201cAn additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>fee or retainer may be required if [sic] becomes evident that I must prepare for unforeseen contestion [sic].\u201d The retainer agreement does not in any [way] define what \u201cunforeseen contestion\u201d is or provide what additional fee may be required, whether an additional flat fee or hourly fee and if so how that fee would be calculated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\">The Court finds that Respondent violated Rule 1.4(b) by failing to adequately explain the summary judgment process to Ms. Jackson. Respondent admitted at trial that, at the time the Motion for Summary Judgment was filed, he did not think it would be successful. Respondent failed to convey that information to Ms. Jackson, depriving her of the ability to make informed decisions about her case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">Respondent testified that he maintained appropriate communication with Ms. Jackson, noting that she frequently sent him documents and e-mails prior to the filing of the lawsuit. The Court finds that, while there may have been communication prior to the filing of the suit, the bulk of this communication was from Ms. Jackson to Mr. Page and that during the pendency of the suit, during the transition to employment with the IRS, and during the suspension, Mr. Page violated MRPC 1.4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">MLRPC 1.15. Safekeeping Property.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">The Court finds Respondent violated Rule 1.15(a) by failing to deposit and maintain certain funds received in trust. While the initial payment of $2,500 was deposited into Respondent\u2019s IOLTA account, Respondent was unable to provide any documentation or other credible evidence that the fees were maintained in trust until earned. There is no evidence that the second payment of $2,500 was either deposited or maintained in trust until earned. The Court has previously found that Ms. Jackson did, in fact, make the second payment of $2,500 to Mr. Page. He acknowledged his endorsement on the check, albeit in a contradictory fashion; the amount was debited from Ms. Jackson\u2019s account; and Mr. Page made no further request for any unpaid balance. Mr. Page has failed to maintain the necessary and appropriate documentation of this receipt of funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>The Court finds Respondent violated Rule 1.15(e). Ms. Jackson did not give her informed consent, confirmed in writing, for Respondent to deposit unearned funds in any account other than a trust account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">MLRPC 1.16. Declining or Terminating Representation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">The Court finds Respondent violated Rule 1.16(a) by failing to terminate the representation and withdrawing from Ms. Jackson\u2019s matter following his suspension from the practice of law on January 7, 2008. Additionally, the Court finds Respondent violated Rule 1.16(d) by failing to promptly deliver to Ms. Jackson her papers, property and requested accounting following her termination of the representation on June 17, 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">Respondent\u2019s suggestion of perhaps obtaining a new attorney in early 2008 falls short of the expectations of MRPC 1.16, which requires a lawyer to cease representation and take reasonably practicable steps to protect a client\u2019s interests. While Mr. Page did eventually provide a copy of his case file to Ms. Jackson, for a fee, Respondent did not return unearned fees, or provide any accounting as to how said fees were earned. Mr. Page failed to provide reasonable notice of his inability to continue in the representation either because of the IRS prohibition, which became apparent in October 2007, or when his license to practice law was suspended in January 2008. Instead, Respondent informed Ms. Jackson that the representation would be terminated because of the IRS policy in a voicemail message on May 27, 2008.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">MLRPC 5.5. Unauthorized Practice of Law; Multijurisdictional Practice of Law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">Respondent conceded at trial that he violated Rule 5.5 and the Court finds accordingly. The Court of Appeals suspended Respondent from practice for a thirty-day period on January 7, 2008. Respondent failed to apply for reinstatement at the expiration of the thirty-day period. At trial, Respondent testified that he worked on the Motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Summary Judgment in January and February of 2008. On March 6, 2008, while suspended from the practice of law, Respondent filed the Motion for Summary Judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">MLRPC 8.4. Misconduct.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">The Court, having concluded that Respondent violated several of the Rules of Professional Conduct including MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.15, 1.16 and 5.5, concludes that Respondent has also committed misconduct in violation of Rule 8.4(a). <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Foltz, </em>411 Md. 359, 411, 983 A.2d 434, 465 (2009).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">The Court finds Respondent violated Rule 8.4(c) during the course of his representation of Ms. Jackson. In January 2008, Respondent first notified Ms. Jackson that he had accepted and begun employment with the IRS. Respondent chose to deceive Ms. Jackson as to whether he actually had permission from the IRS to continue the representation. Respondent admitted at trial that he never sought permission from the IRS to continue Ms. Jackson\u2019s case. Respondent knew, based on Ms. Jackson\u2019s repeated requests as to whether or not the IRS had granted approval, that Ms. Jackson believed that he had requested permission to continue the representation. In May 2008, Respondent left a voicemail message for Ms. Jackson in which he stated that he \u201cstill [hadn\u2019t] received clearance from IRS to do, to do any further litigation.\u201d This voicemail message was an intentional misrepresentation. He, by his own admission, had never sought such clearance. The Court finds Respondent\u2019s conduct, as it relates to his employment with the IRS and the information that he provided to Ms. Jackson, to be basically dishonest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">The Court further finds that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(d) for the reasons outlined as violations of 8.4(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Bar Counsel Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">MLRPC Rule 3.3. Candor Toward the Tribunal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">The Court finds Respondent violated Rule 3.3(a)(1) for the reasons stated in the MRPC 8.1 analysis below.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>MLRPC 8.1. Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">The Court finds Respondent knowingly made false statements of material fact to the Court of Appeals in his Petition for Reinstatement filed March 28, 2011.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, the statement made by Respondent in paragraph 3 that he \u201chad abided by Md. Rule 16-760 since the 7th day of January, 2008\u201d was false. Respondent did not comply with subsections (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(8)(9)(10)(12) of Rule 16-760(c). The statement made by Respondent in paragraph 4 that he \u201chas not had any cases pending before any court in the State of Maryland or any other court in the United States since the 7th day of January, 2008\u201d was false. As admitted at trial, Respondent continued to represent Ms. Jackson, whose matter was pending in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County until June 2008, five months following his suspension from the practice of law. Finally, the Court finds the statement made in paragraph 5 that he \u201chas not had any legal clients or engaged in the practice of law in the State of Maryland or anywhere in the United States since the 7th day of January, 2008\u201d is false. As discussed, Respondent continued to represent Ms. Jackson after January 7, 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">As established at trial, Ms. Jackson\u2019s complaint was not forwarded to Respondent until after he filed his Petition for Reinstatement. It is clear to the Court that when Respondent filed his petition, he knew that he had represented Ms. Jackson while suspended. The totality of the evidence and the particular timeline involved here, leads this Court to conclude that Respondent made his misrepresentations to the Court of Appeals while having no reason to believe that Bar Counsel already knew of his unauthorized practice. Once Respondent was put on notice that Bar Counsel, in fact, knew about his unauthorized practice, Respondent made additional intentional misrepresentations to the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>of Appeals in an attempt to cover up and excuse his unauthorized practice of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\">The Court finds Respondent knowingly made false statements of material fact to the Court of Appeals in his Response to Bar Counsel filed April 8, 2011. Specifically, the statement of Respondent in paragraph 2 that he \u201cdid not have any legal clients at the time of the agreed suspension\u201d was false.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">The Court finds Respondent also knowingly made false statements of material fact to the Court of Appeals in his Motion to Modify Order filed April 27, 2011. Specifically, Respondent stated in paragraph 3 of the motion that prior to his suspension, Respondent \u201cinformed client [sic] that legal representation would be terminated as a condition of employment with the federal government before any suspension was contemplated.\u201d The Court finds that the first time Respondent informed Ms. Jackson that the representation would be terminated was in his voicemail message to Ms. Jackson on May 27, 2008, more than five months following his suspension. Additionally, the Court finds Respondent\u2019s statement in paragraph 4, that he had \u201csubstantially complied with sections (c) and (d) of 16-760\u201d to be false. As discussed above, Respondent did not comply with any subsection of Rule 16-760.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">The Court finds Respondent knowingly and intentionally made false statements of material fact to the Court of Appeals in violation of Rule 8.1(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">Additionally, the Court finds Respondent knowingly made false statements of material fact to Bar Counsel during the course of the investigation of Ms. Jackson\u2019s complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">Respondent, in his reply to Ms. Jackson\u2019s complaint stated that he accepted a position with the IRS following the receipt of the denial of the summary judgment motion. The undisputed evidence at trial supports a finding that Respondent began employment with the IRS in October 2007, more than seven months prior to the denial of the summary judgment motion. Additionally, Respondent stated to Bar Counsel: \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, I closed all of my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>legal cases on or before December 31, 2007, including Ms. Jackson\u2019s case.\u201d Respondent\u2019s position that he misunderstood the Court of Appeals or Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiry is not credible. The Court finds that the statements to Bar Counsel were false and made purposefully with the intent to deceive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In attorney discipline proceedings, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an independent review of the record. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Jarosinski </em>411 Md. 432, 448, 983 A.2d 477, 487 (2009). We review the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo. </em>Rule 16-759(b)(1). In our review of the record, the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. Rule 16-759(b)(2); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 50, 891 A.2d 1085, 1095 (2006). Petitioner takes no exception to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Respondent, however, raises various exceptions both to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Respondent acknowledges that the hearing judge found that Page \u201creceived an additional twenty-five hundred ($2,500.00) dollar retainer fee, in the form of a bank check from M <em>&amp; </em>T Bank, ... purportedly mailed by the bank to Page, ... on behalf of [Ms. Jackson].\u201d According to Respondent, the evidence presented was not clear and convincing that he received or deposited the second check for $2,500.00. Respondent assails Bar Counsel for failing to obtain the M &amp; T Bank records concerning the disputed check, as well as Respondent\u2019s history concerning his bank account with M &amp; T bank. We overrule Respondents\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Further, Respondent acknowledges that the \u201c[h]earing [j]udge concluded that Jackson\u2019s testimony that she sent Page the [second] check for [$2,500.00] was more credible than Page\u2019s testimony that he did not receive the check.\u201d Notwithstanding the hearing judge\u2019s finding of fact, the Respondent contends that Ms. Jackson\u2019s testimony alone was not sufficient to satisfy the clear and convincing standard of proof. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>hearing judge, however, did not see the issue as one of quantum of proof, but one of credibility of the witness\u2019s testimony. We agree with the hearing judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">On many occasions we have said that the hearing judge may \u201cpick and choose\u201d what evidence to believe. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Byrd, </em>408 Md. 449, 473, 970 A.2d 870, 883 (2009) (stating that it is firmly established that a hearing judge \u201cmay elect to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon, when assessing the credibility of witnesses\u201d and factual findings are \u201centitled to significant deference\u201d). Here, Judge Savage was persuaded that \u201cRespondent both received and endorsed check number 7858805, and caused the check to be deposited in a non-trust account held at Wachovia Bank.\u201d Initially, Respondent testified that the endorsement on the check \u201cappears to be, it looks like my signature.\u201d Thereafter, when asked again by the court, \u201c[d]o you think that\u2019s your signature or not[,]\u201d Respondent changed his testimony and said, \u201c[n]o, your honor.\u201d The hearing judge was not bound to accept Respondent\u2019s response as truthful. As the hearing judge found, Respondent admitted that \u201che did not maintain a client ledger, time records or any other documentation relating to the receipt, maintenance or disbursements of funds received from Ms. Jackson.\u201d The evidence presented was sufficient to satisfy the clear and convincing standard of proof. Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law as to MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.15, 1.16, 8.4(c) and (d). He concedes that the hearing judge was correct in concluding that he violated Rules 1.4, 5.5 and 8.4(a). As to the challenges raised, we overrule Respondent\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Rule 1.1 requires an attorney to provide competent representation. According to Respondent, he did not violate Rule 1.1 because, in his view, the legal skill he provided on behalf of Ms. Jackson was reasonable under the circumstances, even if he filed a premature motion for default (incorrectly cited as a motion to dismiss in Respondent\u2019s Request for Exceptions), the motion for summary judgment had deficiencies and he did not conduct any discovery. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>example, the hearing judge considered the reasons offered for Respondent\u2019s decision to file a motion for summary judgment. The hearing judge deduced from Respondent\u2019s explanation that Respondent did not understand that summary judgment would not be an appropriate remedy in a case where there was a genuine dispute between the parties as to the material facts. The hearing judge also noted that Respondent filed, as an attachment to his summary judgment motion, a Consent Order that was neither certified nor authenticated. Also, based on Respondent\u2019s testimony during the disciplinary proceedings, he apparently did not understand the meaning of discovery as a tool for gathering information to prosecute his client\u2019s case. Given Respondent\u2019s explanation for the legal decisions he made during Ms. Jackson\u2019s trial court proceedings and his failure to properly use the legal tools available to advance his client\u2019s case, we overrule Respondent\u2019s exception to Rule 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Rule 1.3 requires that \u201cA lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d Respondent concedes that his services to Ms. Jackson may not have been prompt, yet he challenges the conclusion that his services were unreasonable. According to Respondent, \u201c[t]here was no evidence offered by Bar Counsel as to what effect, if any, the \u2018delay of time between Page\u2019s retention, and the filing of the Jackson complaint had upon the litigated matter.\u201d Furthermore, Respondent contends, although the hearing judge rejected as not credible Respondent\u2019s assertion that the delay in filing the complaint was related to Respondent\u2019s investigation of Ms. Jackson\u2019s complaint, the evidence was not \u201cclear and convincing [ ] that the delay was solely from a lack of Page\u2019s diligence.\u201d In other words, \u201cPage contends that the delay, if any, in filing the complaint for [Ms.] Jackson herein, and the lack of discovery herein were reasonable under the circumstances.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The hearing judge concluded that Respondent\u2019s nine-month delay in filing Ms. Jackson\u2019s complaint violated Rule 1.3. She also found that Respondent \u201crepresented to Ms. Jackson that he would gather documents, prepare and send a demand letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>to the builder and investigate whether the potential defendants had filed for bankruptcy protection.\u201d The hearing judge also found that Respondent failed to perform any of the tasks mentioned above. The hearing judge pointed out that the complaint that Respondent filed on behalf of Ms. Jackson required expert testimony to prove a breach of contract or negligence. Respondent never consulted with nor retained an expert. Similarly, Respondent never conducted any discovery, in a situation where discovery was necessary, to advance his client\u2019s case. From these missteps in the representation of Ms. Jackson, the hearing judge concluded that Respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing Ms. Jackson\u2019s interests. Accordingly, we overrule Respondent\u2019s exception to Rule 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Respondent challenges the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated the safekeeping Rule. Rule 1.15 essentially requires an attorney to hold a client\u2019s property separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property. The lawyer is also required to create and maintain records of the account funds and property kept by the lawyer. And, \u201c[u]nless the client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing, to a different arrangement, a lawyer shall deposit legal fees and expenses that have been paid in advance into a client trust account and may withdraw those funds for the lawyer\u2019s own benefit only as fees are earned or expenses incurred.\u201d Rule 1.15; <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. James, </em>385 Md. 637, 653, 870 A.2d 229, 239(2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In the present case, the hearing judge found that Respondent received an initial payment of $2,500.00, in advance, for his services to Ms. Jackson and approximately nine months later received an additional advance of $2,500.00 for a total advanced fee of $5,000.00. The initial payment was deposited in trust, however, there was no credible evidence that the funds had been earned at the time of withdrawal. As to the second payment, although Respondent disputes that it was ever received by him, the hearing judge concluded from the evidence that Respondent endorsed the check for the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>payment of $2,500.00 and deposited the funds into a non-trust account. Even if we were to assume for purposes of argument that Respondent did not receive the second payment of $2,500.00, he fails to address his removal of the initial payment of $2,500.00 from trust before those funds were earned. Similarly, Respondent fails to address his lack of recordkeeping, accounting or lack of information in relation to the initial retainer fee paid. Not only is it a violation of Rule 1.15 to remove unearned fees from trust before the fees are earned, but it is also a violation of Rule 1.15 for an attorney to fail to maintain records and to monitor or maintain client funds in the lawyer\u2019s possession. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mba-Jonas, </em>397 Md. 690, 701, 919 A.2d 669, 676 (2007). We overrule Respondent\u2019s exception to Rule 1.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Page violated Rule 1.16, both because he failed to terminate his relationship with Ms. Jackson after Page was suspended on January 7, 2008, and because Page did not promptly return Ms. Jackson\u2019s file to her after that professional relationship had terminated. The hearing judge explained that Respondent did not comply with the expectations of Rule 1.16 when he failed to cease representation and take reasonable steps to protect his client\u2019s interests under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Respondent had a duty to protect his client\u2019s interests. Under the circumstances, as the hearing judge found, protecting the client\u2019s interest required Respondent to cease representation and take reasonable steps to protect Ms. Jackson\u2019s interests. Giving paramount consideration to Ms. Jackson\u2019s interests, she was entitled, under the rules of professional responsibility, to the benefit of adequate representation during the period of Respondent\u2019s suspension from the practice of law and to the return of any unearned portion of attorney fees that she paid in advance, upon Respondent\u2019s withdrawal from her case. Respondent had an obligation also, as the hearing judge concluded, \u201cto provide reasonable notice of his inability to continue in the representation either because of the IRS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>prohibition, which became apparent in October 2007, or when his license to practice law was suspended in January 2008.\u201d Respondent did not inform Ms. Jackson that he would terminate his representation because of the IRS policy until May 27, 2008, approximately four months after his suspension and more than seven months after Respondent was aware of the IRS policy. Although \u201cPage did eventually provide a copy of his case file to Ms. Jackson, for a fee, [Page] did not return unearned fees, or provide any accounting as to how said fees were earned.\u201d We overrule Respondent\u2019s exception to the Rule 1.16 violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Respondent excepts to the conclusion that he violated Rules 8.4(c) and (d). He concedes that \u201che was careless and negligent in his overall handling of the Jackson case, but he contends that the import of Rule 8.4 requires conduct that is somewhat more contumacious than merely falling below the standards that the public normally expects of attorneys.\u201d According to Respondent, his misconduct was neither \u201cegregious Ln]or intentional.\u201d As to Ms. Jackson\u2019s complaint, the hearing judge found that Respondent \u201cchose to deceive Ms. Jackson as to whether he actually had permission from the IRS to continue the representation.\u201d Judge Savage explained that Respondent\u2019s conduct was dishonest and that he intentionally misrepresented to Ms. Jackson that he had not received approval from the IRS to work on her case. This is so because throughout the course of his representation of Ms. Jackson, Respondent never sought the necessary approval from the IRS and Respondent knew that Ms. Jackson believed that he had requested approval, but was merely waiting for the IRS to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">We agree with the hearing judge that, as it relates to Respondent\u2019s employment with the IRS and the information that Page provided to Ms. Jackson, Respondent\u2019s conduct was infected with dishonesty. In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zeiger, </em>428 Md. 546, 556, 53 A.3d 332, 338 (2012), we pointed out that a misrepresentation is made when an attorney knows that a statement is false and cannot be the product of mistake, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>misunderstanding, or inadvertence. We held in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Webster, </em>402 Md. 448, 473-74, 937 A.2d 161, 175-76 (2007) that \u201cunlike matters relating to competency, diligence, and the like, intentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse.\u201d Finding no reason to set aside the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, we overrule Respondent\u2019s exception to the conclusion that his violation of Rules 8.4(c) and (d) were intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">As to Bar Counsel\u2019s complaint, Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent \u201cknowing[ly] and intentionally made false statements to the Court of Appeals in his reinstatement petition filed on March 28, 2011.\u201d Again, Respondent concedes that his \u201cfalse representations in his reinstatement petition, and to Bar Counsel during the Jackson Complaint investigation, w[ere] careless and negligent. ...\u201d Nonetheless, he contends that the evidence presented at his disciplinary hearing was not clear and convincing. According to Respondent, the evidence \u201cthat the false statements were made deliberately or with such reckless disregard for the facts [to support] a violation of Rules 3.3 and 8.1\u201d was not clear and convincing. To bolster his argument, Respondent asserts that he did not believe he was still suspended thirty (30) days after January 7, 2008, or when he filed his reinstatement petition on March 28, 2011. He maintains that he erroneously \u201cbelieved [that his license to practice] was \u2018automatically\u2019 reinstated thirty (30) days after his suspension.\u201d In addition, Respondent argues that he was not aware of-the existence of the Jackson complaint, filed on June 26, 2008, \u201cuntil Bar Counsel\u2019s response to his reinstatement petition disclosed that the Complaint had been filed three (3) years previously.\u201d In essence, according to Respondent, it was his lack of awareness and confusion that precipitated his reinstatement misrepresentations and his responses to Bar Counsel. Thus, Respondent maintains, because he was confused, \u201chis conduct was devoid of the conscious, deliberateness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>designed to intentionally deceive contemplated by the Rules 3.3 and 8.1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">In applying Rules 3.3(a) and 8.1(a) to the facts of the case, Judge Savage found from the evidence that on January 7, 2008, Respondent was suspended by consent from the practice of law in Maryland for a period of thirty (30) days. On March 6, 2008, while Respondent was still suspended from the practice of law, he continued to represent Ms. Jackson and filed a motion for summary judgment on her behalf in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. The hearing judge concluded that when Respondent asserted in his Petition for Reinstatement that he \u201chad abided by Md. Rule 16-760 since the 7th day of January, 2008,\u201d he made a knowingly false statement of fact. She also found that Respondent\u2019s statement in paragraph 4 of the Petition for Reinstatement that he \u201chas not had any cases pending before any court in the State of Maryland or any other court in the United States since the 7th day of January, 2008\u201d was also a knowingly false statement of fact because Respondent continued to represent Ms. Jackson after January 7, 2008. The hearing judge was further convinced that Respondent \u201cmade additional intentional misrepresentations to the Court of Appeals in an attempt to cover up and excuse his unauthorized practice of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Judge Savage reasoned that when Respondent filed his Petition for Reinstatement he \u201cha[d] no reason to believe that Bar Counsel already knew of [Page\u2019s] unauthorized practice.\u201d Thus, unaware that Bar Counsel knew in April 2011 that Respondent had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, Judge Savage concluded that Respondent knowingly made a false statement in paragraph 2 of his response to Bar Counsel\u2019s allegation when Respondent stated he \u201cdid not have any legal clients at the time of the agreed suspension.\u201d The hearing judge also concluded from the evidence that Respondent knowingly made false statements of material fact in his \u201cMotion to Modify Order filed April 27, 2011.\u201d In paragraph 3 of the motion addressed to this Court, Respondent stated that prior to his suspension, he \u201cinformed client [sic] that legal representation would be terminated as a condition of employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>ment with the federal government before any suspension was contemplated.\u201d According to Judge Savage, this assertion was knowingly false because Respondent did not inform Ms. Jackson \u201cthat the representation would be terminated\u201d until \u201chis voicemail message to Ms. Jackson on May 27, 2008, more than five months following his suspension.\u201d Notably, the hearing judge concluded that Respondent\u2019s assertions in his Petition for Reinstatement that he had \u201csubstantially complied with sections (c) and (d) of 16-760\u201d were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Finally, the hearing judge concluded that \u201c[Page] knowingly made false statements of material fact to Bar Counsel during the course of the investigation of Ms. Jackson\u2019s complaint[,]\u201d and the statements to Bar counsel were \u201cmade purposefully with the intent to deceive.\u201d Judge Savage found that Respondent stated in his reply to Ms. Jackson\u2019s complaint that \u201che accepted a position with the IRS following the receipt of the denial of the summary judgment motion.\u201d That statement, as the hearing judge found, was false because Respondent began employment with the IRS in October 2007, prior to the denial of the motion for summary judgment. Further, as Judge Savage found, Respondent\u2019s written response to Bar Counsel was also false when he stated: \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, I closed all of my legal cases on or before December 31, 2007, including Ms. Jackson\u2019s case.\u201d Ultimately, based upon the hearing judge\u2019s assessment of Respondent\u2019s credibility, she rejected Respondent\u2019s position that he misunderstood Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiry. Accordingly, we cannot say that Judge Savage\u2019s conclusions in this regard were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">We have held that Rules 3.3 and 8.1 are violated when a lawyer makes an admission to a tribunal he or she knows is untrue and makes false statements to induce Bar Counsel to believe the lawyer did not violate the MLRPC. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Pak, </em>400 Md. 567, 602, 929 A.2d 546, 566-67 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lee, </em>393 Md. 385, 409-13, 903 A.2d 360, 374-77 (2006). Judge Savage\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated Rules 3.3 and 8.1 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>legally correct. Therefore, we overrule Respondent\u2019s exceptions to those violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In the case, <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bleecker, </em>414 Md. 147, 994 A.2d 928 (2010), we outlined our task in evaluating the appropriate sanction to impose in attorney disciplinary matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">We evaluate every attorney grievance matter on its own merits, taking into account the facts and circumstances involved. We have consistently iterated that the goal of attorney discipline is protection of the public, rather than the punishment of the erring attorney. We protect the public through sanctions against offending attorneys in two ways: through deterrence of the type of conduct which will not be tolerated, and by removing those unfit to continue in the practice of law from the rolls of those authorized to practice in this State. The public is protected when the sanction imposed is commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed. Therefore, we must consider the nature of the ethical duties violated in light of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">414 Md. at 176, 994 A.2d at 945 (internal citations and quotation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">The essence of the misconduct in the instant case is Respondent\u2019s dishonesty as it relates to his communications with Ms. Jackson regarding his employment with the IRS and his suspension from the practice of law. The dishonest communications with Ms. Jackson are compounded by Respondent\u2019s intentional misrepresentations to this Court in Respondent\u2019s effort to gain reinstatement to practice law and in response to Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation of Ms. Jackson\u2019s complaint. Although Respondent maintains that his misconduct is the result of negligence rather than intentional misrepresentations of facts, the hearing judge found to the contrary on the basis of clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Petitioner recommends that we impose a sanction of disbarment and Respondent recommends that we impose a sanction of indefinite suspension, with the right to reapply after ninety (90) days. Respondent, however, cites to no cases where we have imposed such a sanction for an attorney\u2019s intentional deceitful conduct. In determining the appropriate sanction, we have looked to the aggravating factors found in Standard 9.22 of the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions. These include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-4\">(a) prior disciplinary offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">(b) dishonest or selfish motive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">(c) pattern of misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-7\">(d) multiple offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">(e) bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-11\">(f) submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-13\">(g) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-14\">(h) vulnerability of victim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-15\">(i) substantial experience in the practice of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-16\">(j) indifference to making restitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-17\">Bar Counsel asks that we consider the aggravating factors mentioned above in arriving at the appropriate sanction. Notably, this is not Respondent\u2019s first disciplinary offense. In January 2008, Respondent consented to a suspension from the practice of law for thirty (30) days for failing to timely respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information in violation of MLRPC 8.1(b). Secondly, Respondent\u2019s misconduct, involving the Petition for Reinstatement and Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation, was motivated by dishonesty and selfishness. The hearing judge found that once Respondent became aware that Bar Counsel knew that he was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, he made additional intentional misrepresentations to this Court in an attempt to conceal and/or excuse his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>According to Bar Counsel, as to the third and fourth factors, Respondent engaged in a pattern of misconduct and committed multiple offenses, including failing to represent his client competently, failing to keep the client reasonably informed, misrepresentation of the facts to the client, failing to preserve client funds and account for those funds while in the attorney\u2019s possession, failing to protect the client\u2019s interest when the attorney had been suspended from the practice of law and failing to be an honest and trustworthy attorney. Fifth, Respondent admitted at the disciplinary hearing that he made false statements to Bar Counsel during the disciplinary process. Sixth, Bar Counsel contends that, although Respondent conceded at his disciplinary hearing that he filed a motion for summary judgment on behalf of his client at a time when he was suspended from the practice of law, Respondent fails to acknowledge or appreciate the wrongful nature of his conduct in any other respect. According to Bar Counsel, Respondent \u201chas substantial experience in the practice of law, having been admitted to the Maryland Bar on June 24, 1998[,]\u201d and Respondent harbors \u201can indifference to making restitution to Ms. Jackson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">We agree that the aggravating factors are implicated. Respondent has a prior suspension and his motives in this case were dishonest and selfish. He has engaged in a pattern of deceit and has committed multiple offenses. Respondent obstructed the disciplinary investigation by intentionally misrepresenting the facts to Bar Counsel and further obstructed the disciplinary proceedings by making false assertions in his Petition for Reinstatement filed in this Court. He fails to acknowledge or does not appear to appreciate the wrongful nature of his conduct in representing his client during a time when it was unlawful or when he was conflicted by his employment with the IRS. The client deserved better. Respondent has failed to reimburse the client any portion of the $5,000.00 advanced fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">As to mitigation, the hearing judge found that Respondent \u201cadmitted that many of his assertions to the Court of Appeals and Bar Counsel were incorrect.\u201d In addition, the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>judge concluded that because \u201cPage\u2019s computer \u2018crashed\u2019 during the time period following his handling of the Jackson case and the subsequent investigation of the Attorney Grievance Commission,\u201d Respondent <em>\u201cmay </em>have lost evidence that could have assisted in his defense, although nothing specific was suggested at the instant hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Taking into consideration the overwhelming nature of the deceitful conduct and the aggravating factors, the appropriate sanction is disbarment. Respondent\u2019s concealment of his inability to represent Ms. Jackson because of the IRS policy and his suspension from the practice of law is most egregious. This is compounded by Respondent\u2019s dishonesty when dealing with Bar Counsel during the investigation phase of the proceedings and his misrepresentation of the facts in his Petition for Reinstatement filed in this Court. In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bleecker, </em>414 Md. at 180, 994 A.2d at 947 (involving violations of MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16(a), 3.3(a)(1), 8.1(b), and 8.4(a), (c) and (d)), we held that an attorney who \u201csystematically concealed from his client and the court that the statute of limitations had expired on [his client\u2019s] claim ... warranted] the gravest sanction, disbarment, for the protection of the public.\u201d Likewise, disbarment is warranted in this case. Often we have said that \u201c[c]andor and truthfulness are two of the most important moral character traits of a lawyer.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Myers, </em>333 Md. 440, 449, 635 A.2d 1315, 1319 (1994) (citations omitted). Intentional dishonest conduct, involving misrepresentations to the courts, can warrant disbarment. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McClain, </em>406 Md. 1, 19-21, 956 A.2d 135, 145-46 (2008). Absent any compelling extenuating circumstances warranting a sanction less than disbarment, we have consistently said that disbarment is the appropriate sanction. Accordingly, we impose the sanction of disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST ALFRED AMOS PAGE, JR.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-10\"><em>. </em>Effective July 1, 2005, <em>the </em>title, Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC) was changed to Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (MLRPC).
