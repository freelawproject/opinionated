While the Public Information Act makes access to government information generally available to the public, it also shields some government information from disclosure. The present case involves the exemption from disclosure in \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i) of the Public Information Act, which requires that custodians of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>records \u201cshall deny inspection of a personnel record of an individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The relevant events in this case commenced when the Maryland State Conference of NAACP Branches (hereafter \u201cNAACP\u201d), pursuant to the Public Information Act, requested certain records from the Maryland State Police Department (hereafter the \u201cState Police\u201d). The NAACP claimed that the requested records would allow it to verify whether the State Police had been complying with its obligations under a federal court consent order designed to ensure that State Police officers did not rely on racial attributes when deciding whether to conduct a traffic stop and search.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State Police produced many of the documents requested by the NAACP but declined to produce a few specified categories of requested records.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>At issue in this case is the refusal of the State Police to provide the documents requested in item number 6 of the NAACP\u2019s request. In item number 6, the NAACP asked to inspect and copy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">\u201c6. All documents obtained or created in connection with any complaint of racial profiling, including but not limited to any complaint filed with or investigated by the MSP\u2019s [Maryland State Police\u2019s] Department of Internal Affairs, including all complaints filed, all documents collected or created during the investigation of each complaint, and all documents reflecting the conclusion of each investigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atf\">The State Police replied that the records requested in item 6 \u201cconstitute portions of personnel records\u201d and that, \u201cpursuant to Section 10-616(i),\u201d the State Police \u201cden[ied] an inspection of\u201d those records. Section 10 \u2014 616(i) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201c(i) <em>Personnel records. </em>\u2014 (1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a custodian shall deny inspection of a personnel record of an individual, including an application, performance rating, or scholastic achievement information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">(2) A custodian shall permit inspection by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">(i) the person in interest; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">(ii) an elected or appointed official who supervises the work of the individual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">Although the State Police refused to disclose further records pursuant to NAACP\u2019s request number 6, pursuant to the earlier federal consent decree, the NAACP did receive regular reports from the State Police detailing the number and status of all racial profiling complaints, including the complaint\u2019s ultimate disposition. The reports, however, did not contain information concerning the State Police\u2019s own internal investigations of these complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">On May 2, 2007, the NAACP wrote a letter to the State Police stating that the Maryland Public Information Act should \u201cbe construed in favor of permitting inspection of a public record,\u201d and clarifying that the NAACP was not seeking \u201cthe private, confidential personal information of particular [State Police] troopers,\u201d but rather was focusing on informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>tion related to how the State Police \u201cat the institutional and management levels, ha[ve] responded to racial profiling complaints.\u201d In this respect, the NAACP said that it would be willing to accept redacted documents relating to request number 6, if each trooper was given \u201ca unique number or code\u201d so that the NAACP could \u201cascertain whether a particular trooper is referenced in more than one complaint ... without divulging that particular trooper\u2019s identity.\u201d The State Police, in a letter five days later, rejected the NAACP\u2019s request once again and reiterated its position that the records were exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i) of the Public Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Subsequently, the NAACP commenced the present action by filing in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County a complaint alleging that the State Police had violated the Maryland Public Information Act by refusing to allow the NAACP to inspect and copy the requested records. The NAACP sought, <em>inter alia, </em>a declaratory judgment that the State Police violated the Public Information Act and an order requiring the State Police to allow inspection and copying of the records. In its complaint, the NAACP stated that its right to access the \u201crequested information is especially significant where, as here, the [State Police\u2019s] obligation to follow the law \u2014 that is, its obligation to act in a race-neutral manner \u2014 is compelled not only by the state and federal Constitutions, but by a still-extant, well-known federal court Consent Decree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Both parties filed motions for summary judgment which were denied. Subsequently, the Circuit Judge heard oral arguments from both parties and thereafter ordered the State Police to submit the disputed records to the Judge for his <em>in camera </em>review. After reviewing many of the disputed documents <em>in camera, </em>the Circuit Judge determined that \u201cthese are the kinds of files that are personnel in nature and represent a thrust against an individual trooper.\u201d He decided, however, that if information was redacted from the records so that \u201cyou don\u2019t know who the trooper was, it really can\u2019t be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>personnel in nature, and it can\u2019t be an invasion of a trooper\u2019s privacy.\u201d The Judge continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">\u201cI did not feel it appropriate ... to just claim them all exempt and say NAACP, you\u2019re not getting any of it. I did not feel it fair to say you\u2019re getting all of them and risk privacy rights of the troopers being invaded and all kinds of other problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">\u201cI believe the fair approach is to find that middle ground which is what I\u2019m going to do. * * * I honestly feel that when the NAACP sees these documents, they will not want a lion\u2019s share of them for various reasons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The Circuit Court issued a written interlocutory order stating that the \u201c[rjecords responsive to Request No. 6 of Plaintiffs Maryland Public Information Act (\u2018MPIA\u2019) request ... constitute personnel records under the MPIA,\u201d but that they should \u201cbe disclosed provided that the names and any identification number of individual Maryland State Police ... troopers and the names and identifying information of any complainants are redacted from such records.\u201d The court ordered that the State Police \u201cshall provide Plaintiff with such records,\u201d with the above-described redactions. The Circuit Court stated at one point that, \u201c[i]f you don\u2019t know who the trooper was, it really can\u2019t be personnel in nature.\u201d The court\u2019s order stated that other issues in the case would be resolved after another hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Because of the volume of documents encompassed by the NAACP\u2019s request, the Circuit Court order also instructed the parties on a procedure for redaction. The court ordered the State Police to make the documents available to the NAACP, for an \u201cAttorneys\u2019 Eyes Only\u201d inspection. The NAACP was to designate three attorneys who would have 120 days to review the unredacted records. The court stated that \u201cthe documents can be provided in a safe place, and if the State Police wants to have somebody there monitoring them, ... they can certainly do so....\u201d At the end of their inspection of the records, the attorneys were to indicate which records they wanted copied, and the State Police were to produce copies of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>those records with all identifying information redacted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The State Police appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and the Circuit Court granted a stay of its order pending appeal. A three-judge panel of the Court of Special Appeals initially heard oral argument, but, before an opinion was issued, a rehearing was held before ten Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judges sitting <em>en banc.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In the Court of Special Appeals, the State Police argued that the Circuit Court erred \u201cby ordering release of all of the requested ... records with redaction of names and identification\u201d when the Circuit Court had determined that the documents constituted \u201cpersonnel records\u201d which \u00a7 10-616(i) of the Public Information Act exempts from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">A majority of the Court of Special Appeals, characterizing the records sought by the NAACP as \u201cinvestigative files concerning ... racial profiling complaints,\u201d vacated the \u201cportion\u201d of the Circuit Court\u2019s order stating that the requested documents were \u201cpersonnel records\u201d of individuals within the meaning of \u00a7 10-616(i) of the Public Information Act. The intermediate appellate court affirmed the remainder of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Circuit Court\u2019s order. <em>State Police v. NAACP, </em>190 Md.App. 359, 367, 381, 988 A.2d 1075, 1079, 1087 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 majority opinion, after setting forth the facts of the case, was almost entirely devoted to the issue of whether the requested records, <em>without any redactions, </em>were \u201cpersonnel records\u201d of individuals and thus exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i) of the Public Information Act. The intermediate appellate court held, for several reasons, that the unredacted records were not exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i). <em>See State Police v. NAACP, supra, </em>190 Md.App. at 367-378, 988 A.2d at 1079-1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The NAACP had argued before the Court of Special Appeals that the issue in the case was whether the <em>redacted </em>records should be disclosed because the NAACP was not seeking unredacted records and was agreeable to the redaction. The NAACP pointed out that \u00a7 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii) provides that a \u201ccustodian who denies the application shall: * * * (iii) permit inspection of any part of the record that is subject to inspection and is reasonably severable.\u201d In rejecting this argument, the Court of Special Appeals referred to the matter of redaction as a \u201csuggestion\u201d by the NAACP, and said that the State Police did not accept the \u201csuggestion.\u201d <em>State Police v. NAACP, supra, </em>190 Md.App. at 380, 988 A.2d at 1087. Alternatively, the Court of Special Appeals held that, \u201cif the records were in fact \u2018personnel reeord[s] of an individual,\u2019 they would not be transformed into another category of records by simply redacting names from them.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">In support of its holding that the investigatory files at issue do not constitute \u201cpersonnel recordfs] of an individual\u201d under \u00a7 10-616(i), the Court of Special Appeals reasoned that the requested files \u201cdo not involve private matters concerning ... the trooper\u2019s private life,\u201d but, \u201c[ijnstead, such complaints involve events occurring while the trooper is on duty and engaged in public service.\u201d (190 Md.App. at 368, 988 A.2d at 1080). The Court of Special Appeals continued <em>(ibid.):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">\u201c[T]he files at issue concern public actions by agents of the State concerning affairs of government, which are exactly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the types of material the Act was designed to allow the public to see. <em>A.S. Abell, supra, </em>297 Md. at 32 [464 A.2d 1068].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The Court of Special Appeals also emphasized that the \u201ccommon sense meaning of the term \u2018personnel record[s] of an individual\u2019 would not include investigative files of a police department concerning racial profiling.\u201d 190 Md.App. at 372, 988 A.2d at 1082-1083.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In addition, the Court of Special Appeals took the position that the requested records were actually \u201crecords of investigations conducted by a ... police department\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f)(i) of the Public Information Act, and, as such, the State Police could have denied inspection of the records on that ground.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals pointed out that the State Police could not in the present judicial action rely on \u00a7 10-618(f) because, in denying the NAACP\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>request, the State Police did not rely on \u00a7 10-618(f) but relied exclusively on \u00a7 10-616(i). The Court of Special Appeals, however, did rely on \u00a7 10-618(f) in holding that the requested records were not \u201cpersonnel record[s] of an individual\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i) of the Public Information Act. The appellate court expressed the view that records cannot be covered by both \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f) and \u00a7 10-616(i). At one point, the Court of Special Appeals stated (190 Md.App. at 374-375, 988 A.2d at 1084):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">\u201cThe records at issue clearly do not <em>directly </em>pertain to discipline \u2018of an existing or former employee\u2019 but even if they did, to be exempt, the MSP [State Police] would have to show that the investigative records exception was inapplicable. <em>See </em>section 10-618(a) and (f).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">At another place in its majority opinion, the Court of Special Appeals stated (190 Md.App. at 370, 988 A.2d at 1081):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0g\">\u201cBecause the records the NAACP seeks in this case fit precisely within the class of records governed by section 10-618(0, we see no reason why its provision should not control, rather than section 10 \u2014 616(i) of the Act, upon which the MSP relies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The Court of Special Appeals also discussed two opinions by this Court dealing with the \u201cpersonnel record\u201d exemption in \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i), namely <em>Kirwan v. The Diamondback, </em>352 Md. 74, 721 A.2d 196 (1998), and <em>Governor v. Washington Post, </em>360 Md. 520, 546-548, 759 A.2d 249, 263 (2000). The appellate court concluded that the State Police records sought by the NAACP do not constitute \u201cpersonnel record[s] of an individual\u201d under the principles set forth in the <em>Kirwan </em>and <em>Washington Post </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The State Police filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, contending that the requested investigative records were \u201cpersonnel records\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i) of the Maryland Public Information Act and that the Circuit Court erred by ordering the disclosure of the redacted records. The NAACP did not file a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari. This Court granted the certiorari petition, <em>Mary</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>land State Police v. NAACP, </em>415 Md. 38, 997 A.2d 789 (2010), and we shall affirm the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judgment, although on different grounds than those relied upon by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In numerous cases, this Court has reiterated that \u201cthe provisions of the Public Information Act reflect the legislative intent that citizens of the State of Maryland be accorded wide-ranging access to public information concerning the operation of their government.\u201d <em>Kirwan v. The Diamondback, supra, </em>352 Md. at 81, 721 A.2d at 199 (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also, e.g., Montgomery County v. Shropshire, </em>420 Md. 362, 375, 23 A.3d 205, 213 (2011); <em>Ireland v. Shearin, </em>417 Md. 401, 408, 10 A.3d 754, 758 (2010); <em>University System v.

Abell Publishing Co. v. Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 32, 464 A.2d 1068, 1071 (1983). We have also held that, \u201c \u2018in order to effectuate the Public Information Act\u2019s broad remedial purpose,\u2019 \u201d the Act \u201c \u2018must be liberally construed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kirwan, supra, </em>352 Md. at 81, 721 A.2d at 199, <em>quoting A.S.

Furthermore, the defendant-custodian \u201chas the burden of sustaining a decision to deny inspection of a public record.\u201d \u00a7 10-623(b)(2)(i) of the Act. The Public Information Act\u2019s strong preference for public access to government documents must be considered whenever a court is applying the particular provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Turning to the case at bar, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judgment, although we disagree with some of the intermediate appellate court\u2019s reasoning. Moreover, we perceive the issues somewhat differently than did the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">As previously mentioned, one of the reasons given by the Court of Special Appeals for holding that the requested records were not personnel records within the meaning of \u00a7 10-616(i) was that they were records of investigations within the meaning of \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f). The Court of Special Appeals seemed to be of the view that particular records could not be exempt under both sections and that, if the records fell within \u00a7 10-618(1% they could not be exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10-616\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">In <em>Attorney General v. Gallagher, supra, </em>359 Md. at 348-351, 753 A.2d at 1040-1041, the Court of Special Appeals had expressed a similar view concerning the relationship among the Public Information Act\u2019s exemptions from disclosure. This Court in <em>Gallagher, </em>however, flatly rejected the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 position. In setting out the arguments and the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding, the <em>Gallagher </em>opinion stated (359 Md. at 347-348, 753 A.2d at 1040):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>\u201cThe petitioner argued, and the Circuit Court held, that several documents were exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10-615, as \u2018privileged.\u2019 They included documents embodying \u2018attorney mental impressions\u2019 or attorney \u201cwork product.\u2019 According to the respondent\u2019s argument and the holding of the Court of Special Appeals, privileged documents, including attorney work product, contained within an investigatory file, would have to be disclosed to a person in interest if none of the seven exemptions under \u00a7 10-618(f)(2) were applicable. The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding would allow litigants to have access to records in an investigatory file which disclose the \u2018mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArQ\">We responded in <em>Gallagher </em>as follows (359 Md. at 348, 753 A.2d at 1040):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">\u201c[I]f this Court were to adopt the intermediate appellate court\u2019s holding in this case, \u00a7 10-618(0(2) would also override the exemptions for \u2018confidential, commercial information\u2019 (\u00a7 10 \u2014 617(d)(2)), \u2018confidential financial information\u2019 (\u00a7 10 \u2014 617(d)(3)), \u2018information about the finances of an individual\u2019 (\u00a7 10-617(0), and \u2018interagency or intra-agency letter[s] or memorand[a] that would not be available by law to a private party in litigation with the unit\u2019 (\u00a7 10 \u2014 618(b)). Nothing in the language or history of the Public Information Act supports the view that, when records are contained within an investigatory file, \u00a7 10-618(0(2) displaces all other exemptions in the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">This Court in <em>Gallagher </em>concluded by reiterating its \u201cholding that \u00a7 10-618(0 does not overrule other exemptions under the Act\u201d and that, \u201cif any exemption under \u00a7\u00a7 10-615, 10-616, or 10-617 is applicable to a particular record, then it must be withheld\u201d (359 Md. at 354-355, 753 A.2d at 1043-1044). <em>See Montgomery County v. Shropshire, supra, </em>420 Md. at 381-382, 23 A.3d at 216-217 (Records of a police department internal affairs investigation into certain conduct of two officers were requested under the Public Information Act, and this Court held that the records were exempt from disclosure as personnel records pursuant to \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i). The Court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>Shropshire </em>distinguished the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion in the case now before us). <em>See also State Police v. NAACP, supra, </em>190 Md.App. at 390, 988 A.2d at 1093 (Judge Kehoe, in a concurring opinion joined by Judge Zarnoch, and relying on <em>Gallagher, </em>disagreed with the majority opinion in the present case).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Consequently, the fact that the requested records in this case might have been covered by \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f) would not preclude their status as personnel records covered by \u00a7 10-616(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">As earlier pointed out, the majority opinion of the Court of Special Appeals in this case rejected the NAACP\u2019s argument that the case concerned redacted records and rejected the NAACP\u2019s reliance upon \u00a7 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii) of the Act. The intermediate appellate court stated that the State Police \u201cdid not accept the NAACP\u2019s suggestion that the records be redacted,\u201d <em>State Police v. NAACP, supra, </em>190 Md.App. at 380, 988 A.2d at 1087. The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 majority opinion treated the principal issue in the case to be whether the <em>unredacted </em>records were exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10-616(i), and the majority concluded that such records were not exempt from disclosure. <em>But cf. State Police v. NAACP, supra, </em>190 Md.App. at 390-393, 988 A.2d at 1093-1094 (Kehoe, J., joined by Zarnoch, J., taking the position that the unredacted records were exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i), but that the redacted records should be disclosed).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Redaction of the records was <em>not </em>simply a \u201csuggestion\u201d by the NAACP. Instead, the requirement that the records be redacted was the principal part of the Circuit Court\u2019s order from which the present appeals were taken, and which was affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals. In fact, most of the Circuit Court\u2019s four-page order dealt with redaction and the procedures for redacting the records. The court\u2019s order determined that the requested records</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANe\">\u201cconstitute personnel records under the MPIA, however, the Court finds that they may be disclosed provided that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>names and any identification number of individual Maryland State Police (\u2018MSP\u2019) troopers and the names and identifying information of any complainants are redacted from such records. Accordingly, pursuant to the MPIA, Defendant shall provide Plaintiff with such records, redacting the names and any identification numbers of individual Maryland State Police (\u2018MSP\u2019) troopers and the names and any identifying information of any complainants. The process for providing Plaintiff with these redacted records is set forth in paragraphs 2-6 below.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The Circuit Court\u2019s appealable interlocutory order, which is the order affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals, was an order enjoining the parties to redact the requested records and turn over the redacted records to the NAACP. While the Circuit Court\u2019s order contained a few words saying that the records \u201cconstitute personnel records,\u201d there was no injunction or other court action with regard to unredacted records. Because no appealable Circuit Court order concerns the disclosure of unredacted records, that issue was not before the Court of Special Appeals and is not before this Court. Consequently, we have no occasion to express any opinion in this case as to whether the unredacted records would be exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10-616(i) of the Public Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The State Police\u2019s argument in this Court, for the most part, is that the <em>unredacted </em>records are exempt from disclosure. Nevertheless, the State Police briefly argue that the redacted records are also exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10-616(i). The State Police contend that \u201c[tjhere is no provision for redaction or partial disclosure to be found in either \u00a7 10-616 as a whole or specifically within \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i).\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s opening brief at 48). According to the State Police, \u201c[t]he plain, unambiguous prohibition in \u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i) cannot be overcome or evaded by invoking other sections of the [Act], including the provisions of \u00a7 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii).\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s reply brief at 20). The Court of Special Appeals, after stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>that redaction was only a \u201csuggestion\u201d by the NAACP, alternatively stated that, \u201cif the records were in fact \u2018personnel record[s] of an individual,\u2019 they would not be transformed into another category of records by simply redacting names from them.\u201d <em>State Police v. NAACP, supra, </em>190 Md.App. at 380, 988 A.2d at 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The above-summarized arguments are not persuasive. After the names of State Police troopers, the names of complainants, and all identifying information are redacted, the records clearly do not fall within the statutory language of \u201crecord[s] of an individual.\u201d (\u00a7 10 \u2014 616(i)). There would be no \u201cindividual\u201d identified in the redacted records.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Moreover, \u00a7 10-616(a)(i) of the Public Information Act provides as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">\u201c(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Unless otherwise provided by law, a custodian shall deny inspection of a public record, as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">(i) <em>Personnel records. </em>\u2014 (1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a custodian shall deny inspection of a personnel record of an individual, including an application, performance rating, or scholastic achievement information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAC7\">Section 10-614(b)(3)(iii) of the Act is a statutory provision \u201cotherwise provided by law.\u201d It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">\u201c(3) A custodian who denies the application shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">(iii) permit inspection of any part of the record that is subject to inspection and is reasonably severable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">The plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 10-616(a) and 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii) authorizes redactions so that the applicant can receive portions of an exempt record which are severable and the receipt of which does not violate the substance of the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">If a record falling within one of the Act\u2019s exemptions is redacted in accordance with \u00a7 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii) and, if it is still exempt as argued by the State Police and held by the Court of Special Appeals, no effect whatsoever would be given to \u00a7 10-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>614(b)(3)(iii). The State Police\u2019s and the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 position would largely render \u00a7 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii) nugatory. Nevertheless, \u201cit is a settled principle of statutory ... construction that a provision should not be construed so as to render it nugatory,\u201d <em>Bienkowski v. Brooks, </em>386 Md. 516, 548, 873 A.2d 1122, 1141 (2005). <em>See Fisher v. Eastern Correctional, </em>425 Md. 699, 709-710, 43 A.3d 338, 342-343 (2012); <em>Stachowski v.

Dackman, </em>413 Md. 132, 148, 991 A.2d 1216, 1225 (2010). Furthermore, as shown by this Court\u2019s opinions, \u00a7 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii) is not nugatory. <em>See Governor v. Washington Post, supra, </em>360 Md. at 542-550, 759 A.2d at 261-266 (This Court directed that there should be redactions in various public records sought by the applicant); <em>Cranford v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>300 Md. at 774, 780-781, 481 A.2d at 228-229, 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The Circuit Court was fully warranted in ordering redactions in the requested State Police records, and, for this reason, the Circuit Court\u2019s order should be upheld.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. PETITIONER TO PAY COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-7\">. The NAACP had filed several complaints against the State Police for racial profiling during traffic stops. In a case giving rise to the present controversy, the State Police entered into a consent agreement with the NAACP, which was incorporated in an order of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The consent order obligated the State Police to provide the NAACP with quarterly reports containing detailed information on the number, nature, location and disposition of complaints alleging racial profiling. Some of the documents requested by the NAACP in the present case were at issue in that federal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">On October 15, 2008, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland issued a ruling clarifying that, under the 2003 consent order, the State Police were required to provide the NAACP with redacted copies of racial profiling complaints made. The State Police complied with that order. In the case before this Court, the NAACP has not argued that the federal district court order gave the NAACP the right to inspect the records at issue in this case, namely, the investigative files related to those complaints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-9\">. The Opinion and Order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County noted that the NAACP originally requested twelve categories of records. The State Police complied with the request as to seven of those categories, but denied the request as to five. Before the Circuit Court, the NAACP continued to contest the State Police\u2019s denial of three of the categories. Only one category of requests was at issue when the case reached this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\">. The next to last paragraph of the Circuit Court\u2019s order provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">\"The Court reserves ruling on Plaintiff's remaining claims for relief, including but not limited to Plaintiff's claim that the fees charged by Defendant for gathering and reproducing the records responsive to Plaintiff\u2019s MPIA [Maryland Public Information Act] Request should be waived, and Plaintiff's claim that the fees charged by Defendant are in excess of what the MPIA permits. After receiving notice from the parties that the redacted records have been produced to Plaintiff, the Court shall schedule a prompt hearing, including if necessary an evidentiary hearing, to resolve such claims.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqW\">As to the appealability of the Circuit Court's interlocutory order, <em>see State Prosecutor v.
