Petitioner argues that requiring him to register as a sex offender: (1) violates Petitioner\u2019s right to be free from <em>ex post facto </em>laws pursuant to both the federal Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and to be free from <em>ex post facto </em>restrictions pursuant to the Maryland Declaration of Rights; (2) violates Petitioner\u2019s due process rights pursuant to both the federal Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights; and (3) violates the plea agreement entered into when he pled guilty to the underlying crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">During the 1983-84 school year, at the time of Petitioner\u2019s commission of the sex offense mentioned herein, the Maryland sex offender registration statute did not exist. The General Assembly enacted the sex offender registration statute in 1995. As a result of amendments to that statute in 2009 and 2010, Petitioner is now required to register as a sex offender. We shall hold that requiring Petitioner to register as a result of the 2009 and 2010 amendments violates the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws contained in Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Pursuant to our determination that Petitioner may not be compelled to register, his name and likeness shall be removed from the Maryland Sex Offender Registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">On June 19, 2006, John Doe<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) pled guilty to, and was convicted of, a single count of child sexual abuse under Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1984 Cum.Supp.), Article 27 \u00a7 35A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 35A(a)(4)(i) prohibited \u201cany act that involves sexual molestation or exploitation of a child by a parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Petitioner\u2019s conviction was based on his inappropriate contact with a thirteen-year-old student during the 1983-84 school year when Petitioner was a junior high school teacher. At the time of the incident, allegations concerning Petitioner\u2019s misconduct were reported to school officials, the school officials conducted an investigation, and Petitioner resigned from his teaching position at the school. No charges, however, were brought at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Approximately 20 years after the incident, in 2005, a former student contacted law enforcement and reported the sexual abuse that occurred during the 1983-84 school year. According to the State, in 2005, Petitioner was charged with various sex related offenses involving children.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">On June 19, 2006, Petitioner and the State presented a plea agreement to the trial judge, which the judge accepted as binding. The agreement called for Petitioner to plead guilty to one count of child sexual abuse, a crime that carried a maximum sentence of fifteen years incarceration. In exchange for the guilty plea, the agreement (1) provided for a pre-sentence investigation; (2) allowed Petitioner to remain on bond until the sentencing date; (3) established a five-year cap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>on the actual term of incarceration the trial court could impose, allowing Petitioner to argue for a reduced sentence; and (4) provided that the State would not pursue the other outstanding charges or any subsequent related uncharged crimes. The agreement did not, however, address registration as a sex offender. After accepting the binding plea agreement, the trial judge entered a conviction and ordered a presentence investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Petitioner\u2019s sentencing hearing was held on September 6, 2006. Before imposing sentence, the trial judge explained to Petitioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">1 am impressed with the life that you have lived since being relieved of your responsibilities as a teacher.... I\u2019m also impressed by some of the difficulties that you\u2019ve experienced in your life and the responsibility that you showed to your family and the responsibility that you\u2019ve shown to others [ever] since that time. So the [court] is certainly taking into consideration all of the things that you have done of a positive nature since the time of this incident back in the 1980s. And what has been also said is true that rehabilitation is one of the factors that the [trial court] must look at, <em>and you appear to have rehabilitated yourself significantly since the time of this incident.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">(Emphasis added). The trial judge then stated, however, that \u201cthere are other things the [trial court] must consider, such as, the nature of the crime.\u201d The trial judge noted that \u201c[c]hild abuse is a very serious and heinous crime\u201d and that the victim was a \u201cchild\u201d and a \u201cstudent.\u201d The trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">Retribution is also a valid factor, punishment for punishment\u2019s sake, as well as general deterrence, that is to prevent and deter others from committing acts such as this. Once again, these are just as valid as rehabilitation, specific deterrence, that is, to prevent [Petitioner] from committing an act such as this again, <em>which I don\u2019t think will occur.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-F\">(Emphasis added). The trial judge imposed a sentence of ten years incarceration, with all but four and one half years suspended, and three years supervised probation upon release from incarceration. As one of the conditions of Petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>probation, he was ordered to \u201cregister as a child sex offender.\u201d Additionally, the trial judge ordered Petitioner to pay court costs and a fine of $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Approximately one month later, Petitioner filed a Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence challenging the $500 fine and the requirement that he register as a child sex offender. Petitioner argued that the trial court \u201clacked authority to require [Petitioner] to register as a child sex offender.\u201d Petitioner noted that the Maryland sex offender registration statute that was in effect at that time applied retroactively to a child sex offender who committed his or her offense on or before October 1, 1995, <em>if </em>the offender was \u201cunder the custody or supervision of the supervising authority on October 1, 2001.\u201d Petitioner contended that he could not be required to register because \u201c[t]here was no registry at the time of the instant offense and the law, as written, [did] not apply retroactively to [Petitioner]\u201d because he \u201cwas indisputably not under the custody or supervision of the supervising authority on October 1, 2001 as that term is defined in the statute.\u201d Additionally, Petitioner asserted that the fine was \u201cnot a permitted penalty under [the law he was convicted for violating].\u201d On November 1, 2006, the Circuit Court agreed with Petitioner and issued an order striking the fine and the requirement that Petitioner register as a child sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In December 2008, Petitioner was released early from prison. In 2009, the Maryland General Assembly passed a new law, effective October 1, 2009, changing the sex offender registration requirements. <em>See </em>C.P. \u00a7 11-701 <em>et seq. </em>(2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2009 Cum.Supp.); 2009 Md. Laws, Chap. 541. The new sex offender registration statute retroactively required a child sex offender who committed a sex offense prior to October 1, 1995, but was convicted on or after October 1, 1995, and had not previously been required to register under Maryland law, to now register as a child sex offender. C.P. \u00a7 11\u2014702.1(c)(ii) (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2009 Cum.Supp.). Petitioner testified that on October 1, 2009, Petitioner\u2019s probation officer directed Petitioner, under threat of \u201carrest[ ] and incarceration],\u201d to register as a child sex offender. Petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>maintains that he did not agree with the requirement, but registered, against the advice of counsel, as a child sex offender in early October 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">In 2010, the Maryland General Assembly again amended the sex offender registration statute re-categorizing Petitioner, based upon his prior conviction, as a Tier III sex offender. C.P. \u00a7\u00a7 11-701(q)(1)(ii), 11-704(a)(3) (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2010 Cum.Supp.); 2010 Md. Laws, Chaps. 174 and 175. As a result of the 2010 amendment, generally, sex offenders are designated by tiers. <em>See </em>C.P. \u00a7 11-701(l) (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2012 Cum.Supp.). Tier III is the most severe designation requiring lifetime registration, as opposed to Tier II offenders who register for 25 years or Tier I offenders who register for 15 years. <em>See </em>C.P. \u00a7 11-707(a)(4) (2001, 2008 RepL.Vol., 2012 Cum.Supp.). Additionally, Tier III offenders must re-register every three months, while Tier I and Tier II offenders are required to reregister every 6 months. C.P. \u00a7 11-707(a) (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2012 Cum.Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In October 2009, in a separate civil proceeding, Petitioner filed in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County a Complaint for a Declaratory Judgment seeking a declaration that he not be required to register as a sex offender under the Maryland sex offender registration statute, and that he be removed from the Maryland Sex Offender Registry. Petitioner\u2019s Complaint advanced three arguments, including that to require him to register, when he was not informed of that requirement when he pled guilty, would improperly render his guilty plea involuntary. None of the arguments advanced in the Complaint, however, explicitly addressed the constitutionality of the registration requirement. After the State\u2019s successful \u201cMotion for Transfer of Action,\u201d the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Washington County, the county where Petitioner committed his crime, pled guilty, and was sentenced. During the Circuit Court proceedings, the parties addressed the issues presented in Petitioner\u2019s Complaint. In addition, counsel for the State<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> argued to the court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>requiring Petitioner to register did not violate the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. At the end of the hearing, the trial judge denied Petitioner\u2019s request for declaratory relief and ordered that Petitioner \u201cshall not be removed from the sex offender registry.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Petitioner noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In Petitioner\u2019s appeal, he once again contended that requiring him to register as a sex offender violated the terms of the plea agreement. In addition, Petitioner explicitly advanced challenges to the application of the statute on <em>ex post facto, </em>bill of attainder, equal protection, and due process grounds. The State argued that Petitioner failed to raise the four constitutional arguments in his Complaint and, hence, the arguments were not preserved for appeal. The intermediate appellate court determined that the due process and <em>ex post facto </em>arguments were properly raised in the trial court and, therefore, addressed them. The Court of Special Appeals, however, determined that the equal protection and bill of attainder arguments were not properly raised in the trial court and, accordingly, did not consider those issues. In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court rejected all of Petitioner\u2019s arguments and affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment requiring Petitioner to remain on the Maryland Sex Offender Registry. We issued a writ of <em>certiorari </em>in the present case, 425 Md. 227, 40 A.3d 39 (2012), to consider the following three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">1. Given the highly punitive and restrictive nature of Maryland\u2019s newly enacted sex offender registration laws, does their retroactive application violate the federal constitutional ban on <em>ex post facto </em>laws and <em>both </em>clauses of Article 17 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>the Maryland Declaration of Rights prohibiting <em>ex post fado </em>laws and <em>ex post fado </em>restrictions?<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\">2. Do Maryland\u2019s sex offender registration laws violate Mr. Doe\u2019s federal and state constitutional rights to due process?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">3. Given that the plea agreement entered into by Mr. Doe did not, and indeed could not have, contemplated registering as a sex offender, is he entitled to specific performance of the plea agreement?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">As a preliminary matter, we shall address both parties\u2019 contentions that this Court should not consider certain arguments. First, the State asserts in its brief to this Court that Petitioner did not raise the <em>ex post fado </em>issue in his Complaint, and therefore, this Court, on review of the case, should not consider the issue. We reject this argument. Maryland Rule 8-131 (a) provides that \u201c[o]rdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been <em>raised in or decided </em>by the trial court....\u201d Md. Rule 8-131 (a) (emphasis added). As noted recently in <em>Duckett v. Riley, </em>428 Md. 471, 476, 52 A.3d 84, 87 (2012) (quotation omitted), \u201cto ascertain the meaning of a ... rule of procedure we first look to the normal, plain meaning of the language.\u201d The use of the word \u201cor\u201d indicates that an issue must be raised in or decided by the trial court, but it is not necessary for both to occur to preserve the issue for appellate review. The <em>ex post fado </em>issue was raised in the trial court and addressed by both the State and the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>judge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The issue was then raised in the Court of Special Appeals. Accordingly, the <em>ex post facto </em>issue is plainly preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Second, Petitioner includes in his Reply Brief to this Court a Motion to Strike the State\u2019s argument that federal law precludes \u201cMaryland courts from granting [Petitioner] the relief he seeks.... \u201d The State contends, in its brief to this Court, that the federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, SORNA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16901 <em>et. seq., </em>imposes upon Petitioner an \u201cindependent obligation to register as a Tier III sex offender.\u201d The State therefore, asserts that this Court cannot grant Petitioner the relief he seeks, \u201can order exempting [Petitioner] from an obligation to register as a Tier III sex offender.\u201d Petitioner specifically notes in his brief to this Court that he is challenging his registration requirements imposed by Maryland law, not federal law. Thus, the question of whether Petitioner is required to comply with federal law and what is required of Petitioner to comply is not before this Court. As Petitioner\u2019s federal obligations are not before us, we need not, and do not, address the issue of whether they require him to independently register.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Moreover, Petitioner seeks ultimately a declaration exempting him from the obligation to register under the Maryland sex offender registration statute. We have held that a declar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>atory judgment is appropriate when there is an actual controversy between the parties and the declaratory judgment will terminate the conflict. <em>See Green v. Nassif, </em>426 Md. 258, 292-93, 44 A.3d 321, 341-42 (2012); <em>Ocean Petroleum, Co. v. Yanek, </em>416 Md. 74, 81-82, 5 A.3d 683, 687-88 (2010); Md.Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-409 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. In the present case, Petitioner is currently registered as a sex offender and is threatened with criminal prosecution, should he fail to comply with the law, under a Maryland statute that he claims is unconstitutional as applied to him. <em>See Grimm v. County Comm\u2019rs of Washington County, </em>252 Md. 626, 632-33, 250 A.2d 866, 869 (1969) (citations omitted). In light of this actual controversy between the parties, a determination of whether the statute is unconstitutional as applied to Petitioner, and whether he should be removed from the Sex Offender Registry, will resolve the conflict. Therefore, pursuant to Maryland law, entry of a declaratory judgment would be proper and to do so would not require this Court to construe federal law with respect to SORNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">I. The Sex Offender Registration Statute in Maryland</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In order to address the <em>ex post facto </em>issue, it is necessary to provide some relevant history of sex offender registration in Maryland. In 1995, the Maryland General Assembly first enacted the Maryland sex offender registration statute. <em>State v. Duran, </em>407 Md. 532, 546-47 n. 7, 967 A.2d 184, 192 n. 7 (2009) (quotation omitted); 1995 Md. Laws, Chap. 142. As enacted, the statute applied prospectively to sex offenders who committed their crimes after the statute went into effect on October 1, 1995. <em>See </em>1995 Md. Laws, Chapter 142, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">In 2001, the sex offender registration statute was amended and was applied retrospectively to different groups of sex offenders,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> including \u201ca child sex offender who committed [his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>or her] sexual offense on or before October 1, 1995\u201d if that offender was \u201cunder the custody or supervision of the supervising authority on October 1, 2001.\u201d C.P. \u00a7 11-702.1 (2001); 2001 Md. Laws, Chap. 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">In 2009, the retroactive application of the statute was once again amended and registration was required of a child sex offender who committed his or her crime before October 1, 1995 but was convicted on or after October 1, 1995, irrespective of when the offender was incarcerated or under supervision. <em>See </em>C.P. \u00a7 11-702.1 (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2009 Cum. Supp.); 2009 Md. Laws, Chap. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">In 2010, the sex offender registration statute was amended again, and among other things, the amendment addressed the retroactive application of the statute. <em>See </em>C.P. \u00a7 11-702.1 (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2010 Cum.Supp.); 2010 Md. Laws, Chaps. 174 and 175. The 2010 amendment required retroactive registration of all persons who were already required to register on September 30, 2010, the day before the amendment went into effect. <em>See </em>C.P. \u00a7 11-702.1(a)(2) (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2010 Cum.Supp.). This language had the consequence of incorporating the retroactive application of the statute as amended in 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Petitioner committed the underlying child sex offense during the 1983-84 school year, long before 1995. He was not under custody or supervision of the State until after he was charged with the relevant offense in 2005. Therefore, Petitioner is required to register as a sex offender pursuant to the 2009 and 2010 amendments\u2019 retroactive application of the sex offender registration statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>II. Constitutional Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Petitioner argues that \u201c[g]iven their highly punitive and restrictive nature, retroactive application of Maryland\u2019s sex offender registration laws violates the federal constitutional ban on <em>ex post facto </em>laws[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] and both clauses of Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights prohibiting <em>ex post facto </em>laws and <em>ex post facto </em>restrictions.\u201d In response, the State contends that \u201c[t]he Court of Special Appeals correctly concluded that the Maryland [sex offender registration statute] does not violate either the federal or State ... prohibitions on ex post facto laws.\u201d We conclude, however, that requiring Petitioner to register as a sex offender violates Article 17\u2019s prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws; thus, we need not, and do not, address whether requiring Petitioner to register violates the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws under Article 1 of the federal Constitution.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Furthermore, in determining that the retroactive application of the statute violates Article 17, we need not, and do not, address whether requiring Petitioner to register affects his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>constitutional due process rights. We further offer no opinion on whether registration is a valid form of punishment under the Maryland Constitution or whether the other constitutional rights of registrants are affected by having to register as a sex offender under the Maryland sex offender registration statute. <em>See Smith v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. 84, 114, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 1158-59, 155 L.Ed.2d 164, 190-91 (2003) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (concluding that the retroactive application of the Alaska sex offender registration statute violates the prohibition on <em>ex post facto </em>laws but does not give rise to a right to additional procedural safeguards under the Due Process Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">A. We examine Petitioner\u2019s contention pursuant to Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides: That retrospective Laws, punishing acts committed before the existence of such Laws, and by them only declared criminal, are oppressive, unjust and incompatible with liberty; wherefore, no <em>ex post facto </em>Law ought to be made; nor any retrospective oath or restriction be imposed, or required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Md. Decl. of Rts., Art. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">In the past, we have read the protection against <em>ex post facto </em>laws in Article 17 of the Declaration of Rights <em>in pari materia </em>with, or as generally having the same meaning as the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause in Article 1 of the federal Constitution. <em>See Dep\u2019t of Public Safety and Corr. Serv. v. Demby, </em>390 Md. 580, 608, 890 A.2d 310, 327 (2006) (citations omitted); <em>Khalifa v. State, </em>382 Md. 400, 425, 855 A.2d 1175, 1189 (2004) (citations omitted); <em>Evans v. State, </em>382 Md. 248, 280 n. 13, 855 A.2d 291, 310 n. 13 (2004) (citations omitted). We have indicated, however, that this Court will not always limit the protection provided by Article 17 to that which is provided by the federal Constitution. In <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Kim, </em>376 Md. 276, 289-90, 829 A.2d 611, 618-19 (2003), we explained that when determining if the retroactive application of a statute \u201ccontravene[s] some Constitutional right or prohibition,\u201d including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>\u201cviolating] the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws,\u201d we must consider <em>both </em>the federal and state protections because the standards may be different. Petitioner urges this Court to \u201cjoin the growing number of states relying on their own constitutions to find [the retroactive application of sex offender registration] violative of <em>ex post facto </em>prohibitions.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Throughout our case law, we have recognized that, in many contexts, the protections provided by the Maryland Declaration of Rights are broader than the protections provided by the parallel federal provision. As we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">Many provisions of the Maryland Constitution ... do have counterparts in the United States Constitution. We have often commented that such state constitutional provisions are <em>in pan materia </em>with their federal counterparts or are the equivalent of federal constitutional provisions or <em>generally </em>should be interpreted in the same manner as federal provisions. Nevertheless, we have also emphasized that, simply because a Maryland constitutional provision is <em>in pan materia </em>with a federal one or has a federal counterpart, does <em>not </em>mean that the provision will <em>always </em>be interpreted or applied in the same manner as its federal counterpart.

As noted above, Petitioner committed his sex offense during the 1983-84 school year. The Maryland sex offender registration statute did not go into effect until over a decade later in 1995. As a result of the 2009 and 2010 amendments to the statute, the registration requirements were applied retroactively to Petitioner. He could not have had fair warning that he would be required to register. In fact, during the 2010 trial court proceedings in the present case, the trial judge, who also presided over Petitioner\u2019s original sentencing four years earlier, stated \u201cno one could have anticipated, I certainly didn\u2019t in 2006, that in 2009, the law would change to require someone to register if an offense had occurred during the time period that it did occur in this particular case.\u201d If in 2006, \u201cno one could have anticipated\u201d that Petitioner would be required to register, he could hardly have had fair warning of the requirement two decades earlier.

We first stated that both the federal and Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>land <em>ex post facto </em>prohibitions relate to \u201ccriminal or penal laws <em>or the consequences of an </em>offense.\u201d 310 Md. at 223, 528 A.2d at 907 (emphasis added). After noting that limitation, we concluded that the change in the law violated both prohibitions against <em>ex post facto </em>laws, by adopting the standard the United States Supreme Court applied when analyzing a federal <em>ex post facto </em>allegation in <em>Kring, </em>107 U.S. at 235, 2 S.Ct. at 455, 27 L.Ed. at 511, namely that the prohibition \u201cextends broadly to any law passed after the commission of an offense which ... in relation to that offense, <em>or its consequences, </em>alters the situation of a party to his disadvantage[.]\u201d 310 Md. at 224, 528 A.2d at 908 (emphasis in original) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">In <em>Anderson, </em>we found further support for the \u201cdisadvantage\u201d standard in four other United States Supreme Court cases: <em>Miller v.

After <em>Collins, </em>the focus of the <em>ex post facto </em>inquiry is not on whether a legislative change produces some ambiguous sort of \u201cdisadvantage,\u201d ... but on whether any such change alters the definition of criminal conduct or increases the penalty by which a crime is punishable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMvF\"><em>California Dep\u2019t of Corr. v.

In <em>Collins </em>and <em>Morales, </em>the Supreme Court abandoned the standard that the protection against <em>ex post facto </em>laws extends to laws, retroactively applied, that act to the disadvantage of the offender.

Because the Supreme Court concluded that the Alaskan legislature intended the statute to be \u201ccivil,\u201d the Court next examined whether there was \u201cthe clearest proof\u2019 that the Alaskan sex offender registration statute was \u201cso punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [Alaska\u2019s] intention to deem it civil.\u201d 538 U.S. at 92, 123 S.Ct. at 1147, 155 L.Ed.2d at 176 (quotations omitted).

But for the fact that Petitioner committed a child sex crime and was subsequently convicted for that offense, he would not be labeled a Tier III sex offender and he would not be required to register. <em>See </em>C.P. \u00a7\u00a7 11\u2014701(q)(1)(ii); 11-704(a)(3) (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2012 Cum.Supp.). Thus, imposing registration alters the consequences for a prior crime and implicates the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition. <em>See Anderson, </em>310 Md. at 224, 230, 528 A.2d at 908, 911 (citations omitted) (noting that commitment to a state mental institution \u201cis a direct consequence of adjudications at [Mr. Anderson\u2019s] criminal trial that he was guilty of committing a crime but insane at the time of the crime[,]\u201d and concluding that \u201c[considering the nature of ... confinement [in the mental hospital] under Maryland law, <em>and particularly the fact that it represents the disposition portion of an adverse judgment in a criminal case ... we believe that the confinement does implicate the ex post facto prohibition.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In <em>Anderson, </em>we noted that \u201cnot every law passed after the commission of an offense, which changes the consequences of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>that offense, is barred by the ex post facto prohibition.\u201d 310 Md. at 226, 528 A.2d at 909 (citation omitted). As the disadvantage standard has been applied in our cases, Article 17 prohibits the retroactive application of laws that have the effect on an offender that is the equivalent of imposing a new criminal sanction or punishment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In both <em>Gluckstern </em>and <em>Demby, </em>we concluded that the retroactive applications of changes in the law that likely had the practical effect of keeping persons incarcerated or confined by the State for a longer period of time violated the prohibitions against <em>ex post facto laws. See Demby, </em>390 Md. at 614-15, 616-18, 890 A.2d at 330-31, 331-33; <em>Gluckstern, </em>319 Md. at 644, 669, 574 A.2d at 902-03, 915. In the present case, the application of the sex offender registration statute to Petitioner in 2009 is the equivalent of imposing a new criminal sanction for Petitioner\u2019s prior commission of a sex crime in the 1980s. Thus, the retroactive application of the sex offender registration statute to Petitioner violates Article 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">First, requiring Petitioner to register has essentially the same effect on his life as placing him on probation. It is well-settled in this State that probation is a form of a criminal sanction. <em>See Corbin v. State, </em>428 Md. 488, 502, 52 A.3d 946, 954 (2012) (quoting <em>United States v. Knights, </em>534 U.S. 112, 119, 122 S.Ct. 587, 591, 151 L.Ed.2d 497, 505 (2001)) (\u201cProbation, like incarceration, is a form of criminal sanction imposed by a court upon an offender after verdict, finding, or plea of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>guilty.\u201d). Because the sex offender registration statute has a highly similar effect on Petitioner\u2019s life as being on probation, applying the statute to Petitioner effectively imposes on him an additional criminal sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Petitioner testified that under threat of \u201carrest[ ] and incarceration]\u201d he was required to register in 2009. <em>See </em>C.P. \u00a7 11-704 (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2009 Cum.Supp.); C.P. \u00a7 11-721 (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.). Petitioner currently must report in person to law enforcement every three months, give notice to law enforcement of his address and any changes of address, and notify law enforcement before being away from his home for more than seven days. <em>See </em>C.P. \u00a7\u00a7 11-705; 11-706, 11-707 (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2012 Cum.Supp.). Furthermore, he must disclose to the State a significant amount of information, some of which is highly personal, including: his employment address; information about his conviction; his social security number; his email address and computer log-in names; information about vehicles he often uses, including those not owned by him; his finger prints and palm prints; all \u201cidentifying factors, including a physical description,\u201d and an updated digital image of himself. <em>See </em>C.P. \u00a7\u00a7 11-706, 11-707 (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2012 Cum.Supp.). Additionally, other than to vote, Petitioner is prohibited from entering onto real property that is used as a school or a family child care center licensed under Title 5, Subtitle 5 of the Family Law Article, without first obtaining permission. C.P. \u00a7 11-722 (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2012 Cum.Supp.). If Petitioner fails to comply with these requirements, he faces terms of imprisonment, depending on the violation, of up to three or five years. <em>See </em>C.P. \u00a7\u00a7 11-721, 11-722(d) (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2012 Cum.Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">These restrictions and obligations have the same practical effect as placing Petitioner on probation or parole.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See Doe </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>v. State, </em>189 P.3d 999, 1012 (Alaska 2008); <em>Wallace, </em>905 N.E.2d at 380-81. As a result of Petitioner\u2019s conviction; he was required to register with the State, and he must now regularly report in person to the State and abide by conditions established by the State or he faces re-incarceration. This is the same circumstance a person faces when on probation or parole; as the result of a criminal conviction, he or she must report to the State and must abide by conditions and restrictions not imposed upon the ordinary citizen, or face incarceration. <em>See Bryant v. Social Services, </em>387 Md. 30, 37, 874 A.2d 457, 46] (2005) (noting that as a condition of probation the petitioner was required to report to his probation officer); <em>Patuxent v.

Pursuant to the current Maryland sex offender registration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>statute, however, Petitioner must register for life. <em>See </em>C.P. \u00a7 11-707(a)(4) (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2012 Cum.Supp.). There is no evidence in the record that Petitioner has been convicted of any crimes since 1984. When the State imposed registration upon him in 2009, however, it had an effect that was the equivalent of placing Petitioner on probation for life as a result of his sex offense. Thus, although the statute may be labeled \u201ccivil\u201d or \u201cregulatory,\u201d it effectively imposes upon Petitioner an additional criminal sanction for a crime committed in the 1980s.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Moreover, the dissemination of Petitioner\u2019s information pursuant to the sex offender registration statute, is tantamount to the historical punishment of shaming. When the Alaska and Indiana Supreme Courts concluded that the retroactive application of their respective sex offender registration statutes violated their state constitutions\u2019 prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws, the two courts both determined that public dissemination of information about registrants \u201cat least resembles the punishment of shaming[.]\u201d <em>See Doe, </em>189 P.3d at 1012 (footnotes omitted); <em>Wallace, </em>905 N.E.2d at 380 (citations and quotations omitted). We conclude that the Maryland sex offender registration statute\u2019s dissemination provisions have the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In <em>Young v. State, </em>370 Md. 686, 806 A.2d 233 (2002), we examined an earlier version of the Maryland sex offender registration statute in the context of due process rights.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Notwithstanding our conclusion in <em>Young </em>that the sex offender registration statute, as a whole, was not so punitive in effect to exceed its nonpunitive purpose, the majority, in that case, conceded that the dissemination of a registrant\u2019s information, including some private information, imposes \u201caffirmative disabilities\u201d on registrants because the dissemination has the effect of \u201clabelling a registrant] as a sexual offender within the community [which] can be highly stigmatizing and can carry the potential for social ostracism.\u201d 370 Md. at 713, 806 A.2d at 249. The majority further expressed concerns in <em>Young </em>that \u201cthe newly initiated Internet notification [that was beginning to be used in Maryland would] threaten!] widespread disclosure of highly personal data and may implicate social ostracism, loss of employment opportunities, and possibly verbal and physical harassment.\u201d 370 Md. at 718 n. 13, 806 A.2d at 252 n. 13. Examining the sex offender registration statute now and in the context of the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition, we conclude, as the Court in <em>Young </em>predicted, that the dissemination of information about registrants imposes many negative consequences. The result is that the dissemination of information about registrants, like Petitioner, is the equivalent of shaming them, and is, therefore, punitive for <em>ex post facto </em>purposes.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Justice Ginsburg noted in her dissent in <em>Smith, </em>the \u201cpublic notification [requirement], which permits placement of the registrant\u2019s face on a webpage under the label \u2018Registered Sex Offender,\u2019 calls to mind shaming punishments once used to mark an offender as someone to be shunned.\u201d 538 U.S. at 116, 123 S.Ct. at 1159, 155 L.Ed.2d at 191-92 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (citations omitted). On the Maryland Sex Offender Registry Website, a color picture of a registrant is included on the Registry and appears when the icon over the registrant\u2019s home is selected on the searchable map. <em>See </em>Md.

In one of the affidavits attached to Amicus\u2019s brief, the affiant attests that he has had significant problems finding housing after his lease was terminated early and the property management company indicated that \u201cbeing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>a registered sex offender was a \u2018non-curable violation of the lease agreement])]\u2019 \u201d In one of our past cases, as a result of registration, one registrant was evicted from his home and rendered homeless because of the notice published to the community. <em>See Twine v. State, </em>395 Md. 539, 544-45, 910 A.2d 1132, 1135 (2006). While concluding that the dissemination of information pursuant to the Alaskan sex offender registration statute, in <em>Smith, </em>was not akin to shaming, the United States Supreme Court stated that one of the hallmarks of shaming was that it often included the expulsion of the offender from the community. 538 U.S. at 98, 123 S.Ct. at 1150, 155 L.Ed.2d at 180 (citations omitted). For those registrants removed from their rental homes or rendered homeless by the dissemination of information, the effect, in our view, is quite similar to expulsion from the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Additionally, other harms caused by dissemination render its effects tantamount to the traditional punishment of shaming. A study by the United States Department of Justice indicated that 77% of registrants in another state surveyed reported \u201cthreats/harassment[.]\u201d Richard G. Zevitz &amp; Mary Ann Farkas, United States Department of Justice, National Institute of Justice, <em>Sex Offender Community Notification,: Assessing the Impact in Wisconsin, </em>at 10 (Dec.2000), <em>available at </em>https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffilesl/nij/179992.pdf. And, the affidavit provided by the Executive Director of Families Advocating Intelligent Registries, a non-profit Maryland organization, indicates that the Director has received reports of children of registrants being bullied because of their parent\u2019s status on the Registry. Another affiant stated that through her job and membership in family support groups, she is \u201caware ... that even those employers that do hire felons often have a policy that automatically excludes persons on the sex offender registry in order to avoid publication of the employer\u2019s name/address on the registry and the accompanying negative publicity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Finally, when analyzing whether the retroactive application of its own sex offender registration statute violated the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition in the Alaskan Constitution, the Alaska Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>preme Court noted that there have been \u201cpublished reports that offenders are sometimes subjected to protests and group actions designed to force them out of their jobs and homes,\u201d such that \u201cthe practical effect of such unrestricted dissemination could make it impossible for the offender to find housing or employment,\u201d and in other states \u201cthere have been reports of incidents of suicide by and vigilantism against offenders on state registries.\u201d <em>Doe v. State, </em>189 P.3d at 1010-11 (footnotes and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">In the present case, the statute places a registrant\u2019s information, including his or her address, on the Internet for anyone with Internet access to see, and allows members of the public, who live in the county where a registrant will five, work, or attend school, by request, to receive email notifications of the registrant\u2019s release from incarceration and \u201cthe registration information of the [registrant].\u201d <em>See </em>C.P. \u00a7 11-717 (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2012 Cum.Supp.). Examining dissemination in the context of whether it violates the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws, we, therefore, conclude that the dissemination provisions of the Maryland sex offender registration statute have an effect upon Petitioner that is tantamount to shaming.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">When Petitioner committed his sex crime during the 1983-84 school year he did not face registration under the statute as a consequence for his crime. Registration was imposed, over twenty years later in 2009, under the sex offender registration statute as a direct consequence of Petitioner\u2019s commission and conviction for his sex crime. The application of the statute has essentially the same effect upon Petitioner\u2019s life as placing him on probation and imposing the punishment of shaming for life, and is, thus, tantamount to imposing an additional sanction for Petitioner\u2019s crime. Therefore, we conclude that the imposition of the registration requirement upon Petitioner, as the result of amendments passed 25 years after Petitioner\u2019s crime, to a statute passed over a decade after Petitioner\u2019s commission of a crime is in violation of the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition contained in Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

Consistent with our prior analysis of the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition, we conclude that requiring Petitioner to register violates the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws under Article 17. Therefore, we need not, and do not, reach the question whether the language contained in Article 17, \"nor any retrospective oath or restriction be imposed, or required!,]\u201d would give rise to a separate ground for finding the application of the sex offender registration statute unconstitutional under Article 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b576-6\">.

Mr. Nathan addressed the potential <em>ex post facto </em>issue arguing that in <em>Young v.

The United States Supreme Court decided <em>Smith v. Doe, supra, </em>in 2003. In 2004, we decided <em>State v. Raines, </em>383 Md. 1, 857 A.2d 19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>(2004). The dissenting opinion states that in <em>State v.

To be clear, however, the initial opinion in <em>Raines, </em>following the standard set forth in <em>Smith, </em>is an opinion of only two judges of this Court. There were also two concurring opinions in <em>Raines, </em>however, those judges concurred only in the judgment and did not concur in the initial opinion. Moreover, when two members of this Court followed the <em>Smith </em>standard in <em>Raines, </em>they addressed the Article 17 protection together with the federal <em>ex post facto </em>protection. 383 Md. at 26, 857 A.2d at 34. In the present case, we address Article 17\u2019s prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws independently of the federal prohibition. In doing so, we note that we have never abandoned the analysis applied in <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Gluckstem, </em>that Article 17's prohibition \u201cextends broadly to any law passed after the commission of an offense which ... in relation to that offense, <em>or its consequences, </em>alters the situation of a party to his [or her] disadvantage^]\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>310 Md. at 224, 528 A.2d at 908 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b590-6\">. Applying this Court's long-standing approach rather than following the United States Supreme Court\u2019s approach to the federal Constitution\u2019s prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws, recognizes that Article 17, previously codified as Article 15, is an independent protection provided by the Maryland Constitution; an independent provision for over 230 years. <em>See </em>Dan Friedman, <em>The History, Development, and Interpretation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, </em>71 Temp. L.Rev. 637, 656 (1998) (noting that the protection against <em>ex post facto </em>laws has been in the Maryland Declaration of Rights since 1776); 1 Bernard Schwartz, <em>the Bill of Rights: A Documentary History, </em>at 281 (N.Y.1971) (same). To ensure the independent protection intended by Article 17, we elect not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>to follow the United States Supreme Court or narrow the scope of the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b593-5\">. This standard is very similar to the standard traditionally used by the Supreme Court, that \u201c[e]very law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed\u201d violates the federal prohibition on <em>ex post facto </em>laws. <em>Calder, </em>3 Dall. at 390, 1 L.Ed. at 650 (emphasis omitted). Under the Supreme Court\u2019s approach in <em>Smith, </em>however, when determining if the application of a law inflicts a greater punishment, the fact that \u201cin its necessary operation, the regulatory scheme [imposed by the sex offender statute]: has been regarded in our history and traditions as a punishment[,]\u201d 538 U.S. at 97, 123 S.Ct. at 1149, 155 L.Ed.2d at 180, is only one factor in the seven-factor <em>Mendoza </em>test. Under Article 17, if the application of a law has an effect that is tantamount to imposing an additional criminal sanction, its retroactive application violates Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b594-6\">. As we noted in <em>Patuxent v. Hancock, </em>329 Md. 556, 620 A.2d 917 (1993), while probation is ordered by a judge before incarceration begins, and parole is granted while a party is incarcerated, both have the same consequence, that a criminal offender is allowed to spend a portion of his or her sentence released in the community if he or she adheres to prescribed conditions. 329 Md. at 574, 620 A.2d at 926 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>(citations omitted). As noted above, sex offender registration, which requires Petitioner to follow prescribed conditions or face incarceration, is similar to both probation and parole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b596-6\">. The State\u2019s argument that we should conclude that the sex offender registration statute is a civil law and thus its retroactive application does not offend the prohibitions against <em>ex post facto </em>laws relies on our decision in <em>Young v. State, </em>370 Md. 686, 806 A.2d 233 (2002), that Maryland's sex offender registration statute did \"not constitute punishment in the constitutional sense, as defined by the United States Supreme Court....\u201d 370 Md. at 690, 806 A.2d at 235. In that case, however, we addressed whether the statute violated the petitioner's due process rights \"in light of [the United States Supreme Court case] <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).\u201d 370 Md. at 690, 806 A.2d at 235. Because in the present case we address the Petitioner's assertion in light of Maryland\u2019s prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws provided by Article 17, our decision in <em>Young, </em>and its conclusion that the statute was not a \"punishment ... as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>defined by the United States Supreme Court,\u201d is not directly applicable to the present case where we examine the law through a different lens.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b597-5\">. The State relies on the <em>Smith </em>Court\u2019s conclusion that disabilities faced by registrants as a result of the public dissemination of their information is actually a result of publically available conviction records, not the dissemination of registrants\u2019 information. <em>See Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 98-99, 123 S.Ct. at 1150, 155 L.Ed.2d at 181. We disagree. First, there is a significant difference between the information that is available to someone who is specifically searching for information about a particular person and a list of all registrants available to any person with access to the Internet. <em>See Doe v. State, </em>189 P.3d 999, 1011 (Alaska 2008). The increased accessibility of information about an offender to the public is the intended effect of creating a publically disseminated registry. <em>See Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 99, 123 S.Ct. at 1150, 155 L.Ed.2d at 181 (noting that \u2018'[widespread public access [to information about offenders] is necessary for the efficacy of the [sex offender registration] scheme\u201d). Furthermore, while many of the disabilities, such as being denied a home or a job based on a background check, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>as likely to result from the registrant\u2019s publically available conviction, some of the disabilities, such as registrants and their families being subject to protests and harassment, have been shown to result from sex offender registration and dissemination. <em>See Doe v. Pataki, </em>120 F.3d 1263, 1279 (2d Cir.1997) (noting that the parties in that case stipulated to \"numerous instances in which sex offenders have suffered harm in the aftermath of notification \u2014 ranging from public shunning, picketing, press vigils, ostracism, loss of employment, and eviction, to threats of violence, physical attacks, and arson.\u201d); Richard Klein, <em>An Analysis of Thirty-Five Years of Rape Reform: A Frustrating Search For Fundamental Fairness, </em>41 Akron L.Rev. 981, 1039 (2008) (\"The community notification and public dissemination provisions, which publicize where an offender lives and information about his crime, have led to widespread labeling, ostracizing, and attacks on the ex-offender.\u201d); Wayne A.

I would not do so. The reasoning of the Plurality opinion is faulty and, therefore, so is its conclusion. To my mind, a correct reading of Article 17 and the most relevant cases leads to the conclusion that Doe is not entitled to the relief he seeks on the constitutional arguments he makes.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Since 2009, several amendments to the Maryland Sex Offender Registration Act have been adopted, including, but not limited to: (1) adding juvenile sex offenders to the list of those who must register; (2) requiring registration statements to include a list of aliases, electronic email addresses, computer screen names, or any name by which the registrant had been legally known; (8) requiring tier III offenders (such as Doe) to register in person every three months for life; (4) requiring that registrants provide three days notice after changing addresses; (5) ordering registrants to notify law enforcement, prior to the relocation, when the registrant obtains a temporary residence or changes the location where the registrant resides or \u201chabitually lives\u201d for more than 5 days; (6) requir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>ing homeless registrants to register in person with the local law enforcement in each county where the registrant habitually lives; (7) publicize registration information on the Internet; and (8) granting the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services and law enforcement the discretion to provide notice of a registration statement or a registrant\u2019s change of address to whomever they deem necessary so as to protect the public from the registrant. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2008 Repl.Vol., 2010 Supp.), Crim. Proc. Art., \u00a7\u00a7 11-701, 11-705, 11-706, 11-717, 11-718.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><em>Smith v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. 84, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed.2d 164 (2003), and <em>Young v. State, </em>370 Md. 686, 806 A.2d 233 (2002), are the two leading cases addressing <em>ex post facto </em>challenges to sex offender registration statutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both cases employ the \u201cintent-effects\u201d test to determine whether a statute violates <em>ex post facto </em>clauses: first, the court must consider the legislative intent of the statute; second, even if the statute\u2019s stated purpose is non-punitive, the court must assess whether its effect overrides the legislative purpose to render the statute punitive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Smith, </em>538 US. at 92, 123 S.Ct. at 1146-47, 155 L.Ed.2d at 176 (2003). To assess the effects of a statute, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>court must consider several factors, derived from <em>Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 83 S.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d'644 (1963).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Smith </em>and <em>Young </em>held that the statutes at issue were intended as civil remedies because the primary government interest was to protect the public from sex offenders. <em>Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 93-94, 123 S.Ct. at 1147, 155 L.Ed.2d at 177; <em>Young, </em>370 Md. at 712, 806 A.2d 233, 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Although the Maryland registration statute does not state expressly its legislative purpose, the Court of Appeals found in <em>Young </em>that the statute\u2019s overall design and plain language indicate that it was intended as a \u201cregulatory requirement\u201d aimed to protect the public rather than to punish or stigmatize offenders. <em>Young, </em>370 Md. at 712, 806 A.2d at 248. This was true, the Court noted, even if the 2002 statute was codified (as is the current registration statute) in the Maryland Criminal Procedure Article, or even if registration is triggered by a criminal conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 712, 714, 806 A.2d at 248-49. The Supreme Court in <em>Smith </em>also came to the same conclusion, even if Alaska \u2014 similar to Maryland \u2014 required that defendants be notified about the statute\u2019s requirements. <em>Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 95-96, 123 S.Ct. at 1148-49, 155 L.Ed.2d at 178-79; <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 4-242 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Nevertheless, significant revisions to the Maryland registration statute have occurred since the <em>Young </em>court reviewed the statute in 2002. The Supreme Court in <em>Smith </em>and the Court of Appeals in <em>Young </em>concluded that registration statutes traditionally have \u201cnot been regarded as punishment,\u201d 370 Md. at 714, 806 A.2d at 250, particularly if the State does not make \u201cthe publicity and the resulting stigma an integral part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>objective of the regulatory scheme\u201d but rather to protect the public. <em>Smith, </em>588 U.S. at 98-99, 128 S.Ct. at 1150, 155 L.Ed.2d at 180-81. Disseminating registrants\u2019 basic registry information, without further government involvement, is a reasonable civil deterrent remedy. <em>Young, </em>370 Md. at 714-15, 806 A.2d at 250; <em>see also Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 102-103, 123 S.Ct. at 1152, 155 L.Ed.2d at 183. Yet, the Supreme Court noted that if a state provides the public \u201cwith means to shame the offender by, say, posting comments underneath his record\u201d on the registry web site, dissemination of registry information may resemble the public shaming punishments of the colonial period. <em>Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 99, 123 S.Ct. at 1150-51, 155 L.Ed.2d at 181. Currently, the Maryland registry web site allows any person to post comments, that are available for the public to view, below a registrant\u2019s profile.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">A second factor to consider is whether the registration statute imposes impermissibly an affirmative disability or restraint on registrants. A registration statute involves an affirmative disability or restraint when either result would occur, apart from consequences common to registering as a sex offender, such as inability to find work or housing due to employers\u2019 or landlords\u2019 routine background and criminal checks, or seeking permission before changing jobs or residences. <em>Id. </em>at 100, 123 S.Ct. at 1151, 155 L.Ed.2d at 181-82. In-person registration requirements, however, may involve punitive restraints. <em>Id. </em>Currently, Maryland\u2019s registration statute, as noted above, requires in-person registration for tier III offenders, such as Doe, every three months for life. <em>See </em>Md.Code, Crim. Proc. Art., \u00a7 11-707(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The <em>Young </em>court recognized that, although basic registrant-identifying information was \u201cnot unreasonably burdensome,\u201d the community notification provisions of the statute imposed \u201chighly stigmatizing\u201d labels. 370 Md. at 713, 806 A.2d at 249. These labels carried \u201cthe potential for social ostracism\u201d because the statute allowed for dissemination of non-public and sensitive information about registrants, such as treatment received for personality disorder or a mental abnormality. <em>Id. </em>This risk is present potentially with Maryland\u2019s statute, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>requires registrants to inform the State on every change of location, including any place in which a registrant \u201chabitually lives\u201d or stays for more than five days, and also allows the Department or law enforcement to share the information with anyone when it is necessary to do so to protect the public. <em>See </em>Md.Code, Crim. Proc. Art. \u00a7\u00a7 11-705(i), 11-718(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Furthermore, both <em>Smith </em>and <em>Young </em>relied on the state legislatures\u2019 conclusions that sex offenders pose a substantial risk of recidivism. <em>See Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 102, 123 S.Ct. at 1152, 155 L.Ed.2d at 183; <em>Young, </em>370 Md. at 715, 806 A.2d at 250. A state can use reasonable means to legislate with regard to convicted sex offenders as a class; thus, requiring an \u201cindividual determination of their dangerousness\u201d does not convert the statute into a punishment under the <em>ex post facto </em>clause. <em>Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 103-04, 123 S.Ct. at 1153, 155 L.Ed.2d at 183-84. As long as a registration statute is tailored narrowly to prevent repetition of sex offenses and requires only qualifying sex offenders to register, as the Court found \u00a7 792 did in <em>Young, </em>it is not excessive in its deterrent purpose. <em>See Young, </em>370 Md. at 715, 806 A.2d at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">New research since 2002, however, presents a different policy perspective to <em>Young\u2019s </em>holding. Applying such a broad-reaching statute like Maryland\u2019s to any qualifying sex offender without particularized determinations of recidivism may undermine the law\u2019s intent to prevent the repetition of sex offenses Indeed, recent research reports that broad-reaching sex offender registration and notification laws do not reduce recidivism by sex offenders. See, e.g., Catherine L. Carpenter, <em>Legislative Epidemics: A Cautionary Tale of Criminal Laws that Have Swept the Country, </em>58 Buff. L.Rev. 1, 58-59 (2010) (noting that, \u201c[djespite the persistent statements that expansive sex offender registration laws are essential tools to protect the community,\u201d the efficacy of such laws is in doubt); <em>see also </em>Human Rights Watch, <em>No Easy Answers: Sex Offender Laws in the U.S. </em>21-33 (Sept.2007). Several states have used such findings to hold that their sex offender registration statutes constitute retroactive punishment in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>of state or federal prohibitions of <em>ex post facto </em>laws, primarily based on the lack of any determination of future dangerousness before or after an offender is required to register. <em>See, e.g., State v. Williams, </em>129 Ohio St.Sd 344, 952 N.E.2d 1108, 1113 (2011); <em>State v. Letalien, </em>985 A.2d 4 (Me.2009); <em>Wallace v. State, </em>905 N.E.2d 371 (Ind.2009); <em>Commonwealth v. Baker, </em>295 S.W.3d 437 (Ky.2009); <em>Doe v. State, </em>189 P.3d 999, 1019 (Alaska 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The Court in <em>Young </em>noted that the consequences of the 2002 Maryland registration statute\u2019s widespread community notification \u2014 namely, stigmatization, social ostracism, loss of employment, and harassment \u2014 implicate liberty and privacy interests inherent to due process. 370 Md. at 713, 806 A.2d at 249. To raise a successful due process challenge involving damage to reputation, the \u201cstigma-plus test\u201d requires that, in addition to harming the plaintiffs reputation, the state\u2019s conduct must have harmed the plaintiff in an additional way. <em>Doe v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs., </em>185 Md.App. 625, 644, 971 A.2d 975, 986 (2009). The \u201cplus\u201d factor is met either by a violation of a \u201cfundamental right\u201d guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution or \u201cthe denial of a state-created property or liberty interest such that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause is violated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 639, 643-44, 971 A.2d at 983-84, 986-87 (quoting <em>Cooper v. Dupnik, </em>924 F.2d 1520, 1532 n. 22 (9th Cir.1989)). Conversely, procedural due process guarantees an opportunity for a hearing to establish a material fact when a claimant has suffered a deprivation of life, liberty, or property. <em>Conn. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. 1, 4, 123 S.Ct. 1160, 1162-63, 155 L.Ed.2d 98, 102 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Doe contends that the statutory requirements harmed his reputation and his \u201cfundamental\u201d rights to property, privacy, and employment, and that he has a procedural due process right to an individualized determination of his imputed dangerousness. A correct interpretation of relevant precedent, however, does not support Doe\u2019s arguments. As to Doe\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>substantive due process claim,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> while there is no fundamental right to employment, the Court of Special Appeals has held that the Maryland internet database sex offender registry does not violate the right to privacy because a registrant\u2019s photograph and criminal record are \u201c \u2018already fully available to the public and [are] not constitutionally protected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe, </em>185 Md.App. at 645-47, 971 A.2d at 987-88 (citing <em>Russell v. Gregoire, </em>124 F.3d 1079, 1093-94 (9th Cir.1997)). Moreover, apart from his own testimony, Doe presented no evidence in the Circuit Court or in his brief to support his claims that he has been unable to find sustainable work or that he is suffering financially.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Second, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Connecticut Department of Public Safety v. Doe </em>forecloses Doe\u2019s argument that he is entitled to a hearing before being required to register. In <em>Connecticut Department, </em>the Court held that procedural due process did not entitle a sex offender to a hearing to determine dangerousness before being required to register because the offender\u2019s present dangerousness was irrelevant to the statute\u2019s registration requirement. 538 U.S. at 4, 123 S.Ct. at 1162-63, 155 L.Ed.2d at 102. The Court relied on the finding that conviction of a qualifying offense is the sole factor in determining whether an individual must register as a sex offender \u2014 individual dangerousness is irrelevant. <em>See id. </em>at 5, 123 S.Ct. at 1163, 155 L.Ed.2d at 103-04. The Court of Special Appeals agreed with the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in addressing the same issue under Maryland\u2019s sex offender registration statute in <em>Doe v. Department of Public Safety &amp; Correctional Services, </em>185 Md.App. at 634-36, 971 A.2d at 980-82. Even if Doe was deprived of a protected interest, he does not have a due process right to a hearing because individual dangerousness is irrelevant to the registration requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>All is not lost, however. I am persuaded by Doe\u2019s argument that, on this record, he is entitled to specific performance of the plea agreement in this case. Doe and the State contend that the plea agreement\u2019s silence as to sex offender registration supports their arguments. Determining the meaning of a sentencing term in a plea agreement requires strict adherence to the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the plea agreement as established in the Maryland Rule 4-243 plea proceeding and to \u201cdue process concerns for fairness and adequacy of procedural safeguards.\u201d <em>Cuffley v. State, </em>416 Md. 568, 580-581, 7 A.3d 557, 563-65 (2010) (quoting <em>Solorzano, </em>397 Md. 661, 668, 919 A.2d 652, 656 (2007)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Extrinsic evidence is irrelevant to identify the agreement\u2019s terms; rather, the terms are limited to what a reasonable lay person in the defendant\u2019s position would have understood to be the terms of the plea agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 582-83, 7 A.3d at 563-65. Any ambiguities in the record concerning the agreement\u2019s terms are resolved in the defendant\u2019s favor. <em>Id. </em>at 583, 7 A.3d at 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">In the present case, the Maryland Rule 4-243 hearing record from 2006 does not indicate that sex offender registration was a term of Doe\u2019s plea agreement. The plea agreement was limited to a five-year term, and it was only at the sentencing hearing that the judge ordered Doe to register as a sex offender. Assuming that a registration term would be included in an agreement at Doe\u2019s 2006 plea hearing, a reasonable person in Doe\u2019s position likely would understand that registering as a sex offender was not a part of the agreement. <em>See id. </em>at 581-83, 7 A.3d at 564-66. The prosecutor\u2019s testimony at the hearing in 2010 on the present declaratory judgment relief, as to what she and Doe\u2019s attorneys discussed before the plea hearing, is irrelevant. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Furthermore, the policy arguments of good faith and efficiency of plea negotiations support using the <em>Cuffley </em>approach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>in this case. One primary concern to the majority in <em>Cuffley </em>was the potential risk that defendants would not understand the nature of the agreement before pleading guilty. 416 Md. at 583, 7 A.3d at 566. This risk may be present when plea terms to which a defendant agreed change retrospectively. Second, permitting retrospective application of the Maryland Act may discourage defendants to plead guilty, since defendants must have some reasonable assurance that the benefit promised in their plea agreements will not be withdrawn in the future, as the Amicus Brief argues here. This is significant in the state criminal justice system, where ninety-four percent of state convictions result from guilty pleas. <em>See Missouri v. Frye, </em>-U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 1399, 1407, 182 L.Ed.2d 379, 389 (2012); <em>see also State v. Brockman, </em>277 Md. 687, 693, 357 A.2d 376, 380-81 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, remand to that court with directions to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Washington County and direct the Circuit Court to enter a declaratory judgment consistent with the views expressed here, including any further proceedings required to enforce specifically Doe\u2019s plea agreement, which does not include him having to register as a sex offender as the result of the crime he committed in 1984.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-5\">. In <em>Smith, </em>the Supreme Court considered the Alaska sex offender registration statute, which: (1) required registration with state or local law enforcement authorities; (2) publicized registration and non-confidential information on the Internet; and (3) applied retroactively to offenders who had been convicted before the law's enactment <em>Smith, </em>538 U.S. 84, 90-91, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 1145-46, 155 L.Ed.2d 164, 174-76 (2003). In <em>Young, </em>the Court of Appeals considered whether the 2002 sex offender registration statute, then codified as Maryland Code Article 27, \u00a7 792 (now \u00a7 11-701 of the Criminal Procedure Article) was an additional penalty that required a jury trial to prove the actual conditions precedent to registration. <em>Young v.

In his dissent, Justice Stevens advocated a different analytical approach to an <em>ex post facto </em>challenge: looking at the Act\u2019s application and effect, he distinguished other cases in which the <em>ex post facto </em>challenge was rejected on the ground that, unlike other cases, \"a criminal conviction under these [analogous] statutes provides both a <em>sufficient </em>and a <em>necessary </em>condition for the sanction.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 112, 123 S.Ct. at 1157-5, 155 L.Ed.2d at 189 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b603-6\">. The relevant factors include, but the analysis is not limited to: (1) whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint; (2) whether it has been regarded historically as punishment; (3) whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment: retribution and deterrence; (4) whether the behavior to which it applies is a crime already; (5) whether the law has a scienter requirement; (6) whether it lacks an alternative purpose to which it may be connected rationally; and (7) if such an alternative does exist, whether the statute appears excessive in relation to the alternative. <em>Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. at 168-69, 83 S.Ct. at 567-68, 9 L.Ed.2d at 660-62.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b607-5\">.

Rather, the cumulative effect of 2009 and 2010 amendments of the State\u2019s sex offender registration law took that law across the line from civil regulation to an element of the punishment of offenders. <em>See generally </em>Catherine L. Carpenter &amp; Amy E.

J. Leg is. 369, 386-400 (2009). It was certainly within the General Assembly\u2019s purview to make the registration law more onerous for offenders. In my view, however, in light of both Article 17 of the Declaration of Rights and Article I, \u00a7 10 of the federal Constitution, like other new laws affecting punishment for offenses, those amendments may not be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Judge ADKINS joins in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-9\">. This Court has repeatedly stated that Article 17 has \"the same meaning\u201d as the parallel federal constitutional provision, <em>E.g., DPSCS v, Demby, </em>390 Md. 580, 609, 890 A.2d 310 (2006). The plurality opinion suggests that the Supreme Court deviated from the common understanding of the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws in 1990 when it decided <em>Collins v.

However, this Court has relied on <em>Collins </em>on several occasions when analyzing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>whether application of a particular State law violated that prohibition. <em>E.g., Booth v.

For reasons I shall explain, I do not believe Petitioner is entitled to the relief he seeks under the federal'and state law grounds he asserts. I agree with Judge McDonald that the Plurality\u2019s interpretation of Maryland\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition is unsupported by the language or history of Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Nor, for that matter, do I see a principled reason to depart in this case from the approach this Court has consistently taken in reading Article 17 <em>in pari materia </em>with the federal <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. Unlike Judge McDonald, I agree with Judge Harrell that the 2009 and 2010 amendments to Maryland\u2019s sex offender registration law survive under federal <em>ex post Jacto </em>law and, because I read the <em>ex post facto </em>clause of Article 17 <em>in pari materia </em>with the federal <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause, the 2009 and 2010 amendments to the law do not violate Article 17. I write separately, though, to explain how I arrive at that result. I also agree with Judge Harrell that Maryland\u2019s current sex offender registration law does not offend due process. Finally, I disagree with Judge Harrell\u2019s application of <em>Cuffley v. State, </em>416 Md. 568, 7 A.3d 557 (2010), to this case and his ultimate conclusion that, because Petitioner\u2019s plea agreement was silent as to sex offender registration, he cannot be compelled to comply with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">This Court has traditionally construed Article 17 <em>in pari materia, </em>with the federal <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause and has declared repeatedly that the two clauses have the same meaning. <em>See, e.g., Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Public Safety and Corr. Servs. v. Demby, </em>390 Md. 580, 608, 890 A.2d 310 (2006) (\u201cWe have held that the <em>ex post fa,do </em>clause in the Maryland Declaration of Rights has the same meaning as the federal clause.\u201d); <em>State v.

State, </em>382 Md. 248, 280 n. 13, 855 A.2d 291 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>(2004) (same); <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 136, 647 A.2d 106 (1994) (same); <em>Anderson v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>310 Md. 217, 223, 528 A.2d 904 (1987) (stating that the Maryland <em>ex post facto </em>clause \u201chas been viewed as having the same meaning as the federal prohibition\u201d). I would not depart from our well-established practice of examining the Maryland and federal <em>ex post facto </em>prohibitions under the same rubric, using federal jurisprudence as persuasive authority. <em>See, e.g., Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 736, 415 A.2d 830 (1980) (\u201cArticle 17 ... parallels the federal clause and the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the federal <em>ex post facto </em>clause is persuasive authority.\u201d (citations omitted)). As we have done previously, we should look to the principles set forth in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>cases for guidance in determining whether the sex offender registration provisions of current Maryland law violate the federal <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition and, thereby, also Article 17. Faithful application of those principles leads me to conclude that the General Assembly did not enact an <em>ex post facto </em>law by making retrospective the current sex offender registration scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of the federal Constitution, in relevant part, forbids \u201c[ejvery law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed.\u201d <em>Stogner v. California, </em>539 U.S. 607, 612, 123 S.Ct. 2446, 156 L.Ed.2d 544 (2003) (quoting <em>Calder v. Bull, </em>3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 390, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798)); <em>see Evans, </em>382 Md. at 281, 855 A.2d 291 (quoting same); <em>see also Collins v.

It is well-settled that the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition applies not to civil regulatory regimes but to criminal laws or laws that are punitive in intent or effects. <em>See Kansas v. Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 369-70, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997) (holding that a state\u2019s civil commitment statute was nonpunitive and not a criminal proceeding, \u201cthus remov[ing] an essential prerequisite for ... <em>ex post facto </em>claims\u201d). Contrary to the Plurality\u2019s view, it simply is not enough, for <em>ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number><em>post facto </em>purposes, that retroactive application of the 2009 and 2010 amendments to Maryland\u2019s sex offender registration law \u201calters the situation of a party to his disadvantage.\u201d <em>See Doe v. Dep\u2019t of Public Safety and Corr. Servs., </em>430 Md. 535, 559-60, 62 A.3d 123, 137-38 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">The test the Plurality puts forward for detecting an <em>ex post facto </em>law is drawn largely from <em>Anderson v. Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. See Doe, </em>430 Md. at 553-54, 62 A.3d at 133-34; <em>see also id. </em>at 556, 62 A.3d at 135 (describing the test as follows: \u201c[t]wo critical elements must be present for a criminal or penal law to be <em>ex post facto: </em>it must be retrospective ... and it must <em>disadvantage </em>the offender affected by it.\u201d (citations omitted)). There are two problems, as I see it, with employing in the present case the test used in <em>Anderson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The <em>Anderson </em>Court, relying on <em>Kring v. Missouri, </em>107 U.S. 221, 2 S.Ct. 443, 27 L.Ed. 506 (1883), and its progeny, concluded that \u201ca law passed after the commission of a criminal act, affecting substantial rights, and changing the consequences of having committed the criminal act in a way that is disadvantageous to the defendant, falls within the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>310 Md. at 227, 528 A.2d 904. The Supreme Court, however, no longer embraces <em>Kring\u2019s </em>expansive view of what is prohibited by the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. In <em>Collins v. Youngblood, </em>the Court expressly overruled <em>Kring, </em>particularly the conclusion in that case that the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause reaches \u201cany change which \u2018alters the situation of a party to his disadvantage.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 497 U.S. at 50, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>110 S.Ct. 2715; <em>see also Booth v. State, </em>327 Md. 142, 171, 608 A.2d 162 (1992) (noting that <em>Collins </em>overruled Kring). Rather, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that the scope of the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause is limited to the types of legislative acts set forth by Justice Chase in <em>Calder v. Bull. Collins, </em>497 U.S. at 49-50, 110 S.Ct. 2715; <em>see also Stogner, </em>539 U.S. at 611-12, 123 S.Ct. 2446 (recognizing that <em>Calder v. Bull </em>provides \u201can authoritative account of the scope of the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause\u201d). Those categories are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\">1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was <em>innocent </em>when done, criminal; and punishes such action.2d. Every law that <em>aggravates </em>a <em>crime, </em>or makes it <em>greater </em>than it was, when committed.3d. Every law that <em>changes the punishment, </em>and inflicts a <em>greater punishment, </em>than the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the <em>legal </em>rules of <em>evidence, </em>and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, <em>in order to convict the offender.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-5\"><em>Calder, </em>3 U.S. at 390. <em>Anderson, </em>to the extent it relies on a now-discredited analysis and language that the Supreme Court abandoned two decades ago in <em>Collins, </em>should not guide the disposition of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Neither am I persuaded, as the Plurality is, that the post-<em>Collins </em>cases of this Court demonstrate a lineage of <em>ex post facto </em>decisions that demands our adherence in the present case to the <em>Kring/Anderson </em>test, under principles of <em>stare decisis. </em>In not one of the <em>post-Collins </em>cases cited in the Plurality opinion did this Court declare that the <em>ex post facto </em>caselaw in Maryland no longer takes into account, much less applies, the federal <em>ex post facto </em>analysis. Indeed, the Maryland <em>ex post facto </em>cases relied upon by the <em>Plurality </em>\u2014 Demby, <em>Khalifa, Frost, Gluckstem, </em>and <em>Anderson </em>\u2014 invoke in one way or another the notion that Article 17 and the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of the federal Constitution have essentially the same meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>I also dispute, for an entirely separate reason, the Plurality\u2019s reliance on the <em>Anderson </em>test, which asks whether a retrospective \u201ccriminal or penal law\u201d operates to \u201cdisadvantage\u201d the offender. <em>See Doe, </em>430 Md. at 556-59, 62 A.3d at 135-37. The present case requires us to examine for a possible <em>ex post facto </em>problem what on its face is a civil, regulatory regime. Unlike the case at bar, the laws at issue in the <em>post-Collins </em>cases relied upon by the Plurality unquestionably come within \u201c[t]he ambit of punishment, for <em>ex post facto </em>purposes,\u201d <em>see Demby, </em>390 Md. at 610, 890 A.2d 310, as each one of those laws affected directly the length of an individual\u2019s sentence for a crime. <em>See id. </em>at 614-15, 890 A.2d 310 (COMAR amendments that terminated eligibility of certain inmates to earn special project diminution credits for double-celling); <em>Khalifa,, </em>382 Md. at 420 &amp; n. 6, 855 A.2d 1175 (statutory amendments that increased the maximum sentence for abducting a child to a place outside the United States); <em>Frost, </em>336 Md. at 137, 647 A.2d 106 (statutory amendments which entitled the Parole Commissioner to rescind all diminution credits at a revocation hearing). <em>See also Booth, </em>327 Md. at 168-69, 608 A.2d 162 (statutory amendment that removed intoxication from the list of mitigating circumstances for the crime of first degree murder); <em>Gluckstern v. Sutton, </em>319 Md. 634, 669, 574 A.2d 898 (1990) (statutory amendments that, when combined, made parole more difficult to obtain for Sutton). The Plurality opinion fails to demonstrate that the changes to Maryland\u2019s sex offender registration scheme are a \u201ccriminal or penal law,\u201d which remains a threshold element of the test upon which the Plurality relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">This Court\u2019s analysis should focus on whether the law at issue affects not mere \u201cconsequences\u201d but rather the \u201cdefinition of crimes, defenses, or punishments,\u201d as that is the true concern of the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition. <em>Collins, </em>497 U.S. at 51, 110 S.Ct. 2715. In other words, \u201cLajfter <em>Collins, </em>the focus of the <em>ex post facto </em>inquiry is not on whether a legislative change produces some ambiguous sort of \u2018disadvantage,\u2019 ... but on whether any such change alters the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>criminal conduct or increases the penalty by which a crime is punishable.\u201d <em>Morales, </em>514 U.S. at 506-07 n. 3, 115 S.Ct. 1597.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><em>Smith v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. 84, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed.2d 164 (2003), provides the proper test for ascertaining whether a facially civil regulatory scheme is, in effect, criminal in the sense that it imposes \u201cpunishment,\u201d as that term is understood in <em>ex post facto </em>analysis. That case, which involved an <em>ex post facto </em>challenge to Alaska\u2019s Sex Offender Registration Act, also referred to as Alaska\u2019s \u201cMegan\u2019s Law,\u201d lays out a two-part inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">We must \u201cascertain whether the legislature meant the statute to establish \u2018civil\u2019 proceedings.\u201d <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 361 (117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501] (1997). If the intention of the legislature was to impose punishment, that ends the inquiry. If, however, the intention was to enact a regulatory scheme that is civil and nonpunitive, we must further examine whether the statutory scheme is \u201c \u2018so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the State\u2019s] intention\u2019 to deem it \u2018civil.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>United States v.

Under that test, the current sex offender registration and notification regime survives the challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">The first, \u201cintent\u201d prong of the <em>Smith v. Doe </em>test requires the courts to inquire \u201cwhether the legislature, in establishing the penalizing mechanism, indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (quoting <em>Hudson v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 93, 99, 118 S.Ct. 488, 139 L.Ed.2d 450 (1997)). This is a matter of statutory construction, involving consideration of \u201cthe statute\u2019s text and its structure to determine the legislative objective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, 123 S.Ct. 1140. It is also relevant that, \u201cwhere a legislative restriction \u2018is an incident of the State\u2019s power to protect the health and safety of its citizens,\u2019 it will be considered \u2018as evidencing an intent to exercise that regulatory power, and not a purpose to add to the punishment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93-94, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (quoting <em>Flemming v. Nestor, </em>363 U.S. 603, 616, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960)). Therefore, \u201ceven if the objective of [the law at issue] is consistent with the purposes of the [respective state\u2019s] criminal justice system, the State\u2019s pursuit of it in a regulatory scheme does not make the objective punitive.\u201d Id. at 94, 123 S.Ct. 1140. In other words, \u201c[t]he location and labels of a statutory provision do not by themselves transform a civil remedy into a criminal one.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>For example, in <em>Smith v. Doe, </em>the Supreme Court explained that the Alaska legislature\u2019s placement of the sex offender registration provisions in that state\u2019s Code of Criminal Procedure, where other nonpunitive provisions also were placed, \u201cis not sufficient to support a conclusion that the legislative intent was punitive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95, 123 S.Ct. 1140. The Court therefore held that Alaska\u2019s sex offender registration and notification law did not violate the federal <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause because the primary purpose of the statute was not to impose punishment but rather to enact a civil regulatory scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 105-06, 123 S.Ct. 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">If a reviewing court concludes that the legislative intent in enacting the scheme is nonpunitive, then the second, \u201ceffects\u201d part of the <em>Smith v. Doe </em>test requires the court to determine whether, notwithstanding that the legislation is intended to be civil, its effects are so punitive that they negate its civil purpose. The Supreme Court identified a number of \u201cguideposts\u201d to assist in answering that question with respect to a sex offender registration law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">The factors most relevant to our analysis are whether, in its necessary operation, the regulatory scheme: has been regarded in our history and traditions as a punishment; imposes an affirmative disability or restraint; promotes the traditional aims of punishment; has a rational connection to a nonpunitive purpose; or is excessive with respect to this purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 97, 123 S.Ct. 1140. Yet, \u201c[b]eeause we ordinarily defer to the legislature\u2019s stated intent, <em>only the clearest proof </em>will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (emphasis added) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). For that reason, this second, \u201ceffects\u201d step in the analysis is a \u201csteep one for those challenging a statute on <em>[ex post facto </em>] grounds.\u201d <em>United States v. W.B.H., </em>664 F.3d 848, 853-54 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 524, 184 L.Ed.2d 339 (2012). Reasoned application of this two-part, intent-effects test yields for me the conclusion that retroactive application of the 2009 and 2010 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>amendments to Maryland\u2019s sex offender registration scheme does not render it an <em>ex post facto </em>law.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">With regard to the first, \u201cintent\u201d part of the test, I am convinced that the General Assembly did not intend the 2009 and 2010 amendments to be punitive, but rather intended the amendments to accomplish two public-safety, regulatory ends. The General Assembly obviously intended to incorporate the provisions of the federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16901 <em>et seq., </em>enacted in 2006.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The legislature also intended to further the objectives of the then-extant civil regulatory scheme this Court previously held to be nonpunitive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Young, </em>370 Md. at 712, 806 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>283 (\u201c[T]he plain language and overall design of [the statute] clearly indicate that it was not intended as punishment, but rather was intended as a regulatory requirement aimed at protection of the public.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The 2009 and 2010 amendments to the Maryland sex offender registration law in large measure respond directly to SORNA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Dep\u2019t of Leg. Servs., Fiscal and Policy Notes Revised, S.B. 854 and H.B. 936 at 1 (Md. General Assembly, 2010 Reg. Sess.) (\u201cThis Administration bill makes changes to notification and registration provisions of Maryland\u2019s sexual offender laws to conform to the federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA)....\u201d); Fiscal and Policy Note Revised, S.B. 425 at 2-3 (Md. General Assembly, 2009 Reg. Sess.) (noting that SORNA \u201crequires conformity by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>states with various aspects of sex offender registration provisions\u201d of SORNA and describing the potential consequences of failing to comply with SORNA).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Notably, every federal court of appeal that, to date, has been asked to examine the question has rejected an <em>ex post facto </em>challenge to SORNA. <em>See United States v. Felts, </em>674 F.3d 599, 606 (6th Cir.2012) (pointing out the \u201cunanimous consensus among the circuits that SORNA does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause\u201d). In so holding, many courts have noted the civil or remedial intent of that statute. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Elkins, </em>683 F.3d 1039, 1044-45 (9th Cir.2012) (\u201cElkins does not question that Congress, in enacting SORNA, intended to create a regulatory scheme, and we recognize that SORNA was created for the purpose of establishing a national system for the registration of sex offenders.\u201d); <em>W.B.H., </em>664 F.3d at 854-55, 860 (stating that Congress\u2019s intent in enacting SORNA was \u201cnot to punish former sex offenders for their past crimes but to promote public safety by providing citizens with information about the whereabouts of sex offenders and assisting law enforcement in locating them\u201d); <em>United States v. Leach, </em>639 F.3d 769, 773 (7th Cir.2011) (observing that SORNA \u201cis, in fact, regulatory\u201d); <em>United States v. Young, </em>585 F.3d 199, 204-06 (5th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (\u201cCongress sought to create a civil remedy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The features of Maryland\u2019s current registration law, although not identical to SORNA, are in material respect sufficiently like the federal act and reflect the General Assembly\u2019s civil regulatory intent in enacting the 2009 and 2010 amendments. Like SORNA, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 16915, 16916, Maryland requires Tier III offenders, such as Petitioner, to register in person every three months for life, Md.Code (2001, 2008 RepL.Vol., 2012 Supp.) \u00a7 11-707(a)(2), (4) of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d). SORNA allows officials to take a current photo of the registrant during each in-person verification, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16916; the Maryland law requires an updated photograph of all registrants to be taken every 6 months, CP \u00a7 11-707(a). SORNA requires registrants to notify at least one jurisdiction in which they are registered in person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>within three days of any change to the registrant\u2019s name, residence, employment, or student status. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913(c). Maryland similarly requires a registrant to notify local law enforcement in person within three days of any commencement or termination of enrollment or employment in an institution of higher education, CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 705(f); to provide written notice of a legal change of name, CP \u00a7 ll-705(g); and to notify local law enforcement within three days of changes in \u201c(1) residence; (2) the county in which the registrant habitually lives; (3) vehicle or license plate information; (4) electronic mail or Internet identifiers; (5) home or cell phone numbers; or (6) employment,\u201d CP \u00a7 ll-705(e). <em>See also </em>CP \u00a7 11 \u2014 705(j) (requiring written notice to State registry within three days of establishment of new \u201celectronic mail address, computer log-in or screen name or identity, instant-message identity, or electronic chat room identity\u201d). Maryland provides for online dissemination of certain registration information, not excluding the registrant\u2019s photograph, CP \u00a7 11-717, as does SORNA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16918. SORNA requires that states provide a criminal penalty for a registrant\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913(e), and the Maryland scheme creates such a penalty, <em>see </em>CP \u00a7 11-721.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">That the current Maryland sex offender registration law imposes upon registrants certain additional requirements<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> not found in SORNA does not dictate, for me, a different conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>sion with respect to the General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting the law. To my mind, none of these features of the Maryland scheme focus directly on deterrence and retribution, two of the traditional aims of criminal punishment, and none turns on a finding of <em>scienter, </em>which is a hallmark of many criminal laws. Neither, for that matter, does the fact that there is a criminal punishment for failing to register make the registration regime punitive. <em>See Smith v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. at 95-96, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (noting that civil regimes may impose criminal penalties for violating the regime\u2019s regulatory requirements). Finally, the requirements of prior notification to law enforcement of even a temporary change of residence and of seeking permission before entering a school, though onerous, likewise do not undermine the otherwise clear legislative purpose of protection of the public. In short, as I see it, the Maryland sex offender registration law is not punitive under the first, \u201cintent\u201d step of the <em>Smith v. Doe </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The Maryland sex offender registration law, in my view, also passes constitutional muster under the second, \u201ceffects\u201d step of <em>Smith v. Doe. </em>Put simply, Petitioner has not met his burden to establish by the \u201cclearest proof\u2019 that the Maryland law transforms what is obviously a civil remedy into a criminal penalty. To be sure, Maryland\u2019s current sex offender registration law includes requirements that were not provided by either Alaska\u2019s Megan\u2019s Law reviewed by the Supreme Court in <em>Smith v. Doe </em>or the earlier version of the Maryland sex offender law this Court reviewed in <em>Young. See supra </em>note 3. That the requirements imposed under the current civil registration <em>regime </em>are more burdensome than at the time of the registrant\u2019s conviction and the dissemination provisions work to the \u201cdisadvantage\u201d of the registrant, as the Plurality asserts, does not mean that retrospective application of those requirements renders the Maryland scheme an <em>ex post facto </em>law. As I have noted, the \u201cdisadvantage\u201d language that once played a key role in the <em>ex post facto </em>analysis no longer does so; instead it is the intent-effects test of <em>Smith v. Doe </em>that pertains.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>The factors most relevant to this part of the analysis are drawn from among the seven <em>Mendoza-Martinez </em>factors, <em>see supra </em>note 6, and are \u201cwhether, in its necessary operation, the regulatory scheme: has been regarded in our history and traditions as a punishment; imposes an affirmative disability or restraint; promotes the traditional aims of punishment; has a rational connection to a nonpunitive purpose; or is excessive with respect to this purpose.\u201d <em>Smith v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. at 97, 123 S.Ct. 1140. Applying those factors to the current Maryland sex offender registration scheme produces, for me, the following conclusions. First, although the Plurality is deeply troubled by the use of the Internet to maintain the publicly-accessible registry, <em>see Doe, </em>430 Md. at 564-68, 62 A.3d at 140-43, I see no merit in the contention that the online posting of information concerning the registrant\u2019s conviction, his photograph, residence, etc., amounts to public humiliation and shaming, a traditional characteristic of punishment. Indeed, any such argument fails in light of what this Court and the Supreme Court have had to say on the subject. We observed in <em>Young </em>that, although public dissemination of one\u2019s criminal history certainly has some negative consequences, \u201cdissemination of such information in itself has not historically been regarded as punishment when done in furtherance of a legitimate government interest.\u201d 370 Md. at 714, 806 A.2d 233. <em>See also Smith v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. at 98, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (\u201c[T]he stigma of Alaska\u2019s Megan\u2019s Law results not from public display for ridicule and shaming but from the dissemination of accurate information about a criminal record, most of which is already public.\u201d). That the means chosen by Congress <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the General Assembly to disseminate this information now involves making the registry available online for public access does not render the dissemination punitive in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>effect or akin to public shaming. <em>See id. </em>at 99, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (noting that, although \u201cthe geographic reach of the Internet is greater than anything which could have been designed in colonial times,\u201d \u201c[widespread public access is necessary for the efficacy of the scheme, and the attendant humiliation is but a collateral consequence of a valid regulation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The same rationale holds for the provision of the current Maryland law permitting community members to request email notification when an offender is released from incarceration in his or her county. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 11-717(d); <em>Smith v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. at 105, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (noting that the online registry at issue was passive; information available on the Internet must be sought out by one who desires access to it). It is simply a fact of present-day society that the Internet is one of the most efficient and effective ways to disseminate information; as such, the use of the Internet in this way further supports the conclusion that \u201c[t]he purpose and the principal effect of notification are to inform the public for its own safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99, 123 S.Ct. 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Neither, to my mind, does the current Maryland law necessarily constitute an \u201caffirmative disability or restraint,\u201d as that term is understood in <em>ex post facto </em>law. First, the Maryland law \u201cimposes no physical restraint, and so does not resemble the punishment of imprisonment, which is the paradigmatic affirmative disability or restraint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (citing <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 104, 118 S.Ct. 488). Furthermore, the obligations of the Maryland scheme are \u201cless harsh than the sanctions of occupational debarment, which [the Supreme Court has] held to be nonpunitive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, 123 S.Ct. 1140. Reporting in person at designated intervals certainly can prove inconvenient, even burdensome; it does not follow, though, that requiring this of the registrant is punitive. <em>See ACLU v. Masto, </em>670 F.3d 1046, 1056 (9th Cir.2012) (holding that a Nevada law implementing SORNA was not punitive under the <em>Smith v. Doe </em>test).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Likewise nonpunitive in their effects are the requirements of providing advance notice of travel and temporary change of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>residence, and the restrictions on knowingly entering school property and day care facilities. But even if I were to grant that these requirements constitute affirmative disabilities or restraints because they adversely affect a registrant\u2019s ability to travel or attend his or her child\u2019s school activities, that conclusion alone would not render the current registration scheme, taken as a whole, punitive in effect. <em>See Young, </em>370 Md. at 713, 806 A.2d 233 (observing that the \u201caffirmative disability or restraint\u201d factor weighed in the petitioner\u2019s favor, but ultimately concluding that the statute was not punitive).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Furthermore, the registration and notification features of the current scheme have a rational connection to the regulatory purpose of the legislative scheme. That there exists evidence of a strong connection between the features of a regulatory scheme and the obvious, nonpunitive legislative purpose behind that law is a \u201c[m]ost significant\u201d factor in the analysis. <em>Smith v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. at 102, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Ursery, </em>518 U.S. 267, 290, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 135 L.Ed.2d 549 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The duration of the registration and notification requirements and the nature of what information must be reported are rationally connected to the public safety purpose of the Maryland law; so too is the feature of the law that classifies offenders in tiers based on the nature of the underlying conviction, rather than an individualized assessment. As was true of Alaska\u2019s Megan\u2019s Law, considered in <em>Smith v. Doe, </em>the \u201cbroad categories,\u201d the \u201ccorresponding length of the reporting requirement,\u201d and the notification features of the Maryland law are \u201creasonably related to the danger of recidivism, and this is consistent with the regulatory objective.\u201d 538 U.S. at 102, 123 S.Ct. 1140; <em>see id. </em>at 104, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (\u201cThe State\u2019s determination to legislate with respect to convicted sex offenders as a class, rather than require individual determination of their dangerousness, does not make the statute a punishment under the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">As for the last factor of the \u201ceffects\u201d part of the analysis, I conclude that the features of Maryland\u2019s current sex offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>registration scheme are not excessive when considered in light of the law\u2019s public safety purpose. In considering this factor, I have borne in mind the Supreme Court\u2019s caution in <em>Smith v. Doe </em>that a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the General Assembly. The Court explained in this regard: \u201cThe excessiveness inquiry of our <em>ex post facto </em>jurisprudence is not an exercise in determining whether the legislature has made the best choice possible to address the problem it seeks to remedy. The question is whether the regulatory means chosen are reasonable in light of the non-punitive objective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105, 123 S.Ct. 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Finally, even if I were to consider it a \u201cclose call\u201d as to whether the current Maryland scheme were punitive in its effects, I would be bound in that instance to defer to the General Assembly. In <em>Smith v. Doe, </em>Justice Souter disagreed with the Court that the \u201ccivil indications\u201d of the Alaska legislature\u2019s intent in enacting that state\u2019s Megan\u2019s Law outweigh the indications of that law\u2019s \u201cpunitive character,\u201d but he ultimately concurred in the judgment upholding the constitutionality of the law. <em>Id. </em>at 110, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (Souter, J., concurring in the judgment). He observed that \u201cthe substantial evidence does not affirmatively show with any clarity that the Act is valid,\u201d yet he concluded that \u201c[w]hat tips the scale for me is the presumption of constitutionality normally accorded a State\u2019s law,\u201d which \u201cgives the State the benefit of the doubt in close cases like this one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That same rationale applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">For all these reasons, the 2009 and 2010 amendments to the Maryland scheme do not in their effects constitute punishment. It follows, then, that retroactive application of those requirements does not constitute an <em>increase </em>in punishment, which, of course, is the essence of an <em>ex post facto </em>law. In coming to the contrary conclusion, the Plurality mistakenly relies upon a now-discredited test to analyze the constitutionality of the current sex offender registration provisions. Furthermore, in the end, the result reached by the Majority of the Court intrudes upon the prerogative of the General Assembly to make a law that does not violate either the Constitution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>the United States or the Constitution of Maryland and the Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">In my assessment, proper application of the test for <em>ex post facto </em>espoused by the Supreme Court in <em>Smith v. Doe </em>and in recent Maryland cases leads to but one conclusion. I would hold that, because the statute is nonpunitive in either intent or effects, its retroactive application to Petitioner and others similarly situated does not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of the United States Constitution or the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition of Article 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Petitioner separately argues that the Maryland sex offender registration scheme violates his right to due process. I agree with Judge Harrell that this contention has no merit. Indeed, it seems to me that <em>Connecticut Dep\u2019t of Public Safety v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. 1, 123 S.Ct. 1160, 155 L.Ed.2d 98 (2003), decided the same day as <em>Smith v. Doe, </em>controls and completely disposes of Petitioner\u2019s contention. In that case, a convicted sex offender argued that, by being required to register as a sex offender under Connecticut\u2019s Megan\u2019s Law, he was being deprived of a liberty interest \u2014 his reputation and status in the community\u2014 without being afforded a hearing on his individual level of dangerousness, as he claimed is required by the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 6, 123 S.Ct. 1160. In rejecting that claim, the Supreme Court observed that \u201cmere injury to reputation,\u201d which is the type of injury Petitioner claims here, \u201cdoes not constitute the deprivation of a liberty interest\u201d that is subject to due process protections. <em>Id. </em>at 6-7, 123 S.Ct. 1160; <em>see Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 711-12, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976) (an interest in reputation is \u201cquite different from the \u2018liberty\u2019 or \u2018property\u2019 \u201d interests recognized in Supreme Court decisions and \u201cis neither \u2018liberty\u2019 nor \u2018property\u2019 guaranteed against state deprivation without due process of law.\u201d). The Court decided that, even if a liberty interest were implicated, the statute mandates that all sex offenders register by virtue of their convictions alone, regardless of individual dangerousness, and \u201cdue process does not entitle [a person] to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>hearing to establish a fact that is not material under the [state] statute.\u201d <em>Connecticut Dep\u2019t of Public Safety v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. at 7, 123 S.Ct. 1160. As with the law at issue in <em>Connecticut Dep\u2019t of Public Safety v. Doe, </em>Maryland\u2019s registration requirement for a child sexual offender is triggered by \u201cconviction alone,\u201d rather than a determination of dangerousness. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 11-704(a). The requirement applies to all persons convicted of specified sexual offenses and does not purport to make any distinction among registrants based on who might or might not be a continuing threat to public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">A number of courts around the country have followed <em>Connecticut Dep\u2019t of Public Safety v. Doe </em>to hold that their respective sex offender registration laws, similar to Maryland\u2019s, do not offend due process. <em>See Doe v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>490 F.3d 491, 498 (6th Cir.2007); <em>Doe v. Moore, </em>410 F.3d 1337, 1342, 1345-46 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Doe v.

I would hold likewise that Maryland\u2019s sex offender registration law does not violate Petitioner\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Petitioner argues that, by application of Maryland Rule 4-243 and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cuffley v. State, </em>416 Md. 568, 7 A.3d 557 (2010), he is entitled not to have to abide by the requirements of the current sex offender registration law because compliance with those unforeseen requirements was not included as a term of the plea. Judge Harrell agrees with Petitioner; I do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Maryland Rule 4-243(c) requires that the prosecutor and defense attorney \u201cadvise the judge of the terms of the agreement.\u201d The judge may then accept or reject the plea but, if the agreement is approved, \u201cthe judge shall embody in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>judgment the agreed sentence, disposition, or other judicial action encompassed in the agreement or, with the consent of the parties, a disposition more favorable to the defendant than that provided for in the agreement.\u201d Md. Rule 4\u2014243(c)(1), (3). \u201cRule 4-243 requires strict compliance with its provisions.\u201d <em>Cuffley, </em>416 Md. at 582, 7 A.3d 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">In <em>Cuffley, </em>we considered whether a judge violated the terms of a plea agreement by imposing a sentence above the guidelines range, and suspending all but part of it, when the plea agreement called for a sentence \u201cwithin the guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573, 7 A.3d 557. In reviewing the plea agreement, we noted that \u201cthe meaning of the <em>sentencing term </em>of a binding plea agreement must be resolved by resort <em>solely </em>to the record established at the Rule 4-243 plea proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, 7 A.3d 557 (first emphasis added). The goal is \u201cto determine what the defendant reasonably understood to be the sentence the parties negotiated and the court agreed to impose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The standard is an objective one, grounded in \u201cwhat a reasonable lay person in the defendant\u2019s position and unaware of the niceties of sentencing law would have understood the agreement to mean, based on the record developed at the plea proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen a defendant\u2019s guilty plea rests in part on a promise concerning disposition, and the State or the court violates that promise, \u2018the accused may obtain redress by electing either to have his guilty plea vacated or to leave it standing and have the agreement enforced at resentencing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580-81, 7 A.3d 557 (quoting <em>State v. Brockman, </em>277 Md. 687, 694, 357 A.2d 376 (1976)). We held in <em>Cuffley </em>that the court breached the plea agreement by imposing a sentence outside the agreed-upon guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 586, 7 A.3d 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Judge Harrell stretches the rule of <em>Cuffley </em>to reason that, because sex offender registration was <em>not </em>a term of Petitioner\u2019s plea agreement, he should not be required to comply with current sex offender registration requirements. <em>Cuffley </em>plainly does not apply to the case before us. <em>Cuffley </em>and the rule emanating from it focus on \u201cthe meaning of the <em>sentencing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>term,\u201d </em>and \u201cwhat the defendant reasonably understood to be the <em>sentence.\u201d Id. </em>at 582, 7 A.3d 557 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">A sentencing court does not impose sex offender registration as part of the sentence. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-243(e)(3) (directing that \u201cthe judge shall embody in the judgment the agreed sentence, disposition, or other judicial action\u201d). Because the Supreme Court in <em>Smith v. Doe </em>and this Court in <em>Young </em>have held that sex offender registration is not punishment, it follows that imposing it on a defendant does not make the registration requirement a part of the sentence. On this point Judge Harrell surely must agree, given his reasons for why, in his view, Maryland\u2019s current sex offender registration scheme is neither an <em>ex post facto </em>law nor in violation of Petitioner\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The requirements of the registration regime generally are triggered automatically by operation of law, once the defendant is convicted of a qualifying crime.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Petitioner was convicted of child sexual abuse, a crime that now requires automatic registration. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7\u00a7 11-701(q) (defining Tier III offenders), 11-702.1 (retroactivity provision), 11-704 (requiring registration of specified offenders) and \u00a7 3-602 of the Criminal Law Article. The requirements have full force and effect without their being imposed as part of the sentence for the underlying crime. And the sentencing court does not possess the authority to declare that a convicted sex offender, other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>wise obligated to comply with the requirements of Maryland\u2019s registration regime, need not comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">It follows that, if registration is not punishment and is imposed mandatorily by operation of law, then it is a collateral consequence of a plea agreement. The conclusion that sex offender registration is a collateral consequence is one that other courts have reached, as well. For instance, the Supreme Court of Idaho has held that the failure of the trial court to advise a defendant of sex offender registration requirements did not render his plea invalid. <em>Ray v. State, </em>133 Idaho 96, 982 P.2d 931, 934 (1999). The <em>Ray </em>Court concluded that \u201csex offender registration is not a direct consequence of a guilty plea,\u201d in part because (as in Maryland) registration is a \u201cconsequence of conviction over which the district judge has no direct control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 935-36. The Supreme Court of Nevada confronted the same issue in <em>Nollette v. State, </em>118 Nev. 341, 46 P.3d 87 (2002). The Nevada Court held that sex offender registration \u201cis a collateral consequence of a guilty plea because it is not sufficiently punitive to have an immediate and direct effect on the defendant\u2019s range of punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The requirement that Petitioner register as a sex offender likewise had no effect on the ultimate range of punishment he faced upon conviction. Because sex offender registration is not punishment, but a collateral consequence of a conviction, it was not required to be included as part of Petitioner\u2019s plea agreement.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Judge Harrell not only misapprehends <em>Cuffley </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>as dictating a contrary result, but he also states incorrectly the relief available to Petitioner in such a situation. Judge Harrell concludes that the absence of the sex offender registration requirement entitles Petitioner to \u201cspecific performance of the plea agreement in this case.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>430 Md. at 576, 62 A.3d at 147 (Harrell, J., concurring). Judge Harrell concludes that specific performance in Petitioner\u2019s case dictates that, for Petitioner (and presumably other similarly situated persons), the registration requirement simply does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Specific enforcement of the plea agreement, i.e., \u201cthe benefit of the bargain,\u201d is one of two options available to a defendant when \u201cthe record of the plea proceeding clearly discloses what the defendant reasonably understood to be the terms of the agreement.\u201d <em>Cuffley, </em>416 Md. at 583, 7 A.3d 557. The other option is for the defendant to withdraw his plea. Unlike in <em>Cuffley, </em>however, this is not a situation where a defendant bargained for a particular sentence \u2014 and had that plea agreement accepted by the court \u2014 only to receive a different sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The State and the Court made no promises in the plea agreement or during the plea hearing that Petitioner would not have to register as a sex offender. Indeed, the plea agreement is silent on the matter, which was acceptable under the law, given the collateral nature of the registration requirement. Because there was no agreement with Petitioner that he would not be subject to the collateral consequence of registration as a sex offender, either at the time of the plea or at some future time, it follows that there was no \u201cbreach\u201d of the agreement entitling him to the relief he now seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-6\">. Following <em>Collins v. Youngblood, </em>the Supreme Court made clear that the progeny of <em>Kring, </em>also relied upon in our <em>Anderson </em>decision, are \"inconsistent with the framework developed in <em>Collins.\u201d California Dep\u2019t of Corr. v.

State, </em>370 Md. 686, 806 A.2d 233 (2002), analyzed the 2002 version of Maryland\u2019s sex offender registration statute, which was codified at Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.) Article 27, \u00a7 792, but has since been amended and is now located at Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2012 Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 11-701 through 11-727 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d). <em>See Doe, </em>430 Md. at 570 n. 1, 62 A.3d at 144 n. 1 (Harrell, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b616-8\">. We pointed out in <em>Young </em>that, although the intent-effects test was gleaned from <em>United States v.

I see no reason why the converse should not be true in Maryland, i.e., that the test we used in the due process context to determine whether a law is punishment applies equally in the <em>ex post facto </em>context. Indeed, it makes no sense <em>not </em>to apply the same test in both situations, as the Supreme Court did in <em>Smith v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. 84, 97, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed.2d 164 (2003). <em>See also infra </em>note 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b619-5\">.

Another instance of discretion occurs when a person has been convicted of kidnapping and the victim is an adult. In that instance, the person is only classified as a Tier III sex offender and required to register if ordered to do so by the court. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7\u00a7 11-701(q)(1)(iv), 11-704(a) and \u00a7 3-502 of the Criminal Law Article.
