His contract was assigned to GMAC. Scott subsequently defaulted on the loan, and GMAC repossessed the vehicle on February 22, 2009. On March 17, 2009, GMAC sent a notice to Scott, informing him that the Galant would be sold at a \u201cpublic sale\u201d conducted by Manheim of Baltimore-Washington (\u201cManheim\u201d)[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] on Tuesday, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>March 31, 2009. GMAC then sent Scott a notice on a form indicating that his car had been sold at that auction, and explaining that an approximate balance of $16,541 remained. <em>See Scott, </em>789 F.Supp.2d at 638-39; Scott Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 15-18, 26.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">In July 2006, Gardner likewise purchased a Chevrolet Impala under a retail installment sales contract governed by the provisions of the CLEC. Gardner failed to make scheduled payments on the vehicle, and GMAC, who was assigned the contract and a security interest in the vehicle, repossessed it. On December 8, 2009, GMAC sent a notice to Gardner, notifying her that the Impala would be sold at a public sale on Tuesday, January 5, 2010, as part of another Manheim auction. The notice stated, \u201c[Y]ou may attend the sale and bring bidders if you want.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>789 F.Supp.2d at 639; Gardner Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 15-17.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">Neither Scott\u2019s nor Gardner\u2019s notices mentioned that members of the public needed to provide a refundable $1,000 cash deposit in order to <em>attend </em>the auction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Scott Am.

She stated, \u201cSince I did not find out about the $1,000 entrance fee until I arrived at the auction, I did not even have time to try to get the $1,000 entrance fee to attend the auction.\u201d Gardner Aff. \u00b6 5 (J.A. 413). After her vehicle was sold at the auction, GMAC informed her of the sale and also that she had a deficiency balance of approximately $12,196. <em>Scott, </em>789 F.Supp.2d at 639; Gardner Compl. \u00b6 28.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">The Manheim \u201cTuesday Sales,\u201d including the ones in which Gardner\u2019s and Scott\u2019s vehicles were sold, were adver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>tised every Sunday in the <em>Baltimore Sun\u2019s </em>classified \u201cauction\u201d section. The ads, printed in a similar font as other ads in that section, provided the time and location of the sale, a contact phone number, and the terms and conditions of the sale, including the requirement of a refundable $1,000 cash deposit to attend. <em>See Scott, </em>789 F.Supp.2d at 643. The ads did not, however, mention the makes or model years of the cars to be sold, nor did they include a specific description of the condition of the cars. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Ms. Gardner and Mr. Scott filed separate complaints against GMAC in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, in which they alleged, in part, that GMAC violated CLEC because the sales of their cars were in reality \u201cprivate sales,\u201d which required GMAC to provide a detailed post-sale disclosure to the debtors under CLEC, Section 12-1021(j)(2) of the Commercial Law Article, which GMAC had not done:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1j\">Scott and Gardner filed suit against GMAC, and they both alleged the same five counts: (1) violation of the CLEC; (2) breach of contract; (3) declaratory and injunctive relief; (4) restitution and unjust enrichment; and (5) violation of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, Md. Code Ann., Com. Law \u00a7\u00a7 13-101 <em>et seq. </em>Their suits were combined, as they were \u201cnearly identical in all material respects.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>789 F.Supp.2d at 639. Notably, \u201cboth suits are [ ] predicated on the factual premise that the Tuesday [Sales] were private sales subject to more stringent notice and accounting requirements.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The District Court combined the two cases because they shared the same issue: whether the sale of the debtor\u2019s car was a \u201cpublic auction\u201d or a \u201cprivate sale\u201d under CLEC. GMAC filed a motion for summary judgment, which the Court granted, concluding that the sales were \u201cpublic auctions\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>because they \u201cwere both widely advertised and open to the public for competitive bidding.\u201d <em>Scott v. Nuvell Financial Services LLC, </em>789 F.Supp.2d 637, 644 (D.Md.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Ms. Gardner and Mr. Scott appealed. Before the Fourth Circuit, they filed a motion to certify questions of law to this Court, as to whether the sales of their cars were \u201cprivate sales\u201d because of the $1,000 admission fee required to attend and observe. The Fourth Circuit initially denied the motion, but thereafter, <em>sua sponte, </em>certified the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">After discovery had begun, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>raised the question of whether the Tuesday Sales were actually \u201cpublic sales\u201d under Maryland law, and invited the parties to move for judgment on the pleadings on this issue. Thereafter, the Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment, which the court granted as to all five counts. <em>See Scott, </em>789 F.Supp.2d at 645. The court also rejected a request by Scott and Gardner to pursue further discovery on the issue before ruling. <em>See id. </em>at 640-42.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">Upon appeal to this court, the Appellants filed a Motion to Certify Questions of Law to the Court of Appeals of Maryland on October 6, 2011. This court denied the motion on November 14, 2011. Here, however, we address the certification motion <em>sua sponte.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The issue before us is limited to the $1,000 admission fee and its impact on the characterization of sales of repossessed cars as \u201cpublic\u201d versus \u201cprivate.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The admission fee in issue must be differentiated from other financial mechanisms employed by auctioneers that are not addressed herein, such as a bidder\u2019s fee, which is a deposit charged to an auction attendee who intends to bid and is later refunded to an unsuccessful bidder, <em>Pyles v. Goller, </em>109 Md.App. 71, 76, 674 A.2d 35, 37-38 (1996) (involving a $5,000 deposit in order to bid during a public sale); an entry cost, which is \u201ca nonrefundable fee required from bidders,\u201d Ronald N.

Roberson, </em>420 Md. 649, 656, 25 A.3d 110, 114 (2011). Should the debtor default on the loan, the security interest enables the creditor to repossess and retain the car for full satisfaction of the debt or to sell it at a \u201cpublic auction\u201d or \u201cprivate sale\u201d and use the sale\u2019s proceeds to decrease the loan obligation of the debtor. Section 12-1021(a), (j)(1), (l)(4)(i). The sale, whether a \u201cpublic auction\u201d or a \u201cprivate sale,\u201d \u201cmust be accomplished in a commercially reasonable manner.\u201d Section 12\u20141021 (j)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">If the sale is a \u201cpublic auction,\u201d and the loan secured was more than $2,000, the debtor, after the sale, must receive a written statement detailing how the proceeds were allocated among the costs of the auction, costs of storing the collateral, and reducing the debt obligation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">(k) <em>Same </em>\u2014 Disposition <em>of certain proceeds. </em>\u2014 (1) The provisions of this subsection apply to a public sale of property which secured a loan in excess of $ 2,000 at the time the loan was made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">(2) The proceeds of a sale to which this subsection applies shall be applied, in the following order, to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">(i) The actual and reasonable cost of the sale;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">(ii) The actual and reasonable cost of retaking and storing the property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">(iii) The unpaid balance owing under the agreement at the time the property was repossessed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>(3) The credit grantor shall furnish to the consumer borrower a written statement which shows the distribution of the proceeds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Section 12-1021(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">If the sale is a \u201cprivate sale,\u201d by contrast, the debtor must receive more detailed information, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the form of a post-sale disclosure. This post-sale disclosure includes, in addition to a description of the distribution of the proceeds, information about the purchaser, the number of bids received, and, if there is an impact on its value, the condition of the collateral at the time it was repossessed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">(2) In all cases of a private sale of repossessed goods under this section, a full accounting shall be made to the borrower in writing and the seller shall retain a copy of this accounting for at least 24 months. This accounting shall contain the following information:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">(i) The unpaid balance at the time the goods were repossessed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">(ii) The refund credit of unearned finance charges and insurance premiums, if any;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">(iii) The remaining net balance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-10\">(iv) The proceeds of the sale of the goods;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-11\">(v) The remaining deficiency balance, if any, or the amount due the buyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-12\">(vi) All expenses incurred as a result of the sale;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-13\">(vii) The purchaser\u2019s name, address, and business address;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-14\">(viii) The number of bids sought and received; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-15\">(ix) Any statement as to the condition of the goods at the time of repossession which would cause their value to be increased or decreased above or below the market value for goods of like kind and quality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-16\">Section 12 \u2014 1021(j)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-17\">After the sale, the creditor may pursue a deficiency judgment against the debtor for the remaining balance of the loan. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The debtor, obviously, only can challenge a creditor\u2019s sale as violative of CLEC after it is completed, typically in defense of a deficiency proceeding. If the debtor can show that the creditor failed to abide by the requirements of CLEC in selling the collateral, the creditor may be barred from a deficiency judgment and limited to the proceeds of the sale as satisfaction of the debt. Section 12\u20141021(j)(3), (k)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The debtors in this case contend that the sales of their cars were private, because the $1,000 admission fee restricted access to the sales, and therefore GMAC should have furnished to them the post-sale disclosures required for \u201cprivate sales.\u201d They construe the different post-sale disclosure requirements, which compel the production of more information to the debtor if the sale is a \u201cprivate sale,\u201d as evidence that the distinction between the two types of sales is the debtor\u2019s ability to attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">GMAC counters that it was not required to provide detailed post-sale disclosures to the debtors because the sales were \u201cpublic auctions.\u201d It argues that a \u201cprivate sale\u201d is one that expressly excludes \u201cclasses of individuals\u201d and defines a \u201cpublic auction\u201d as \u201ca method of selling [property] in a public forum through open and competitive bidding,\u201d quoting <em>Pyles, </em>109 Md.App. at 75 n. 2, 674 A.2d at 37 n. 2. It argues that a \u201cpublic auction\u201d does not mandate the attendance of the debtor, but, instead, the distinction between sales in a public or private context is the presence of competitive bidding. The admission fee, GMAC further maintains, improved competitive bidding because the fee ensured that potential bidders would be able to pay at least $1,000 toward the price of the cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">CLEC does not define \u201cpublic auction\u201d or \u201cprivate sale,\u201d nor does the Uniform Commercial Code<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or other provisions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>which the terms are used.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Legislative history, then, becomes important: CLEC was enacted in 1984 as part of a body of legislation \u201cto entice creditors to do business in the State.... \u201d <em>Roberson, </em>420 Md. 649, 662, 25 A.3d 110, 118 (2011). CLEC was designed, in part, to counter \u201cmore favorable\u201d regulations in Delaware that had attracted lenders to that state away from Maryland, causing significant job loss in the Baltimore area. <em>Biggus v. Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>328 Md. 188, 197, 613 A.2d 986, 991 (1992). This 1983 Act, however, enabled a creditor only to sell repossessed goods at a \u201cpublic auction.\u201d 1983 Maryland Laws, Chapter 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In 1987, Chapter 765 of the Laws of Maryland, which originated as Senate Bill 839, amended CLEC, to add \u201cprivate sale\u201d as an alternative to a \u201cpublic auction.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Senate Bill 839, sponsored by Senator George Della, added the opportunity for a creditor to sell collateral by \u201cprivate sale,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in addition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u201cpublic auction,\u201d and further provided that \u201cany sale of repossessed property must be accomplished in a commercially reasonable manner.\u201d Although the bill failed to identify what a \u201ccommercially reasonable manner\u201d would constitute, the bill file does contain a letter from Attorney General J. Joseph Curran, Jr. to Governor William D. Schaefer regarding the constitutionality and legal sufficiency of the bill, in which the Attorney General opined that the concept of commercial reasonableness manifested itself in the common law, citing our decision in <em>Obrecht v. Crawford, </em>175 Md. 385, 2 A.2d 1 (1938), which involved a seller\u2019s resale of flour following the buyer\u2019s breach of contract. There, we explained, and the Attorney General quoted in his letter, \u201cwhere [the seller] elects to resell, he must do [so] within a reasonable time and in such a manner as to secure the best obtainable price and he is bound to exercise reasonable care and diligence to that end.\u201d <em>Obrecht, </em>175 Md. at 397-98, 2 A.2d at 8 (citation omitted). Beyond referencing this duty of reasonable care, the legislative history regarding commercial reasonableness is wanting.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The bill file additionally contains a memorandum addressed to the House Economic Matters Committee Counsel from Delegate Dana Dembrow, expressing concern that a \u201cprivate sale\u201d could enable the creditor to engage in a sale of the debtor\u2019s property, collusive in nature, which would result in a rock-bottom resale price and a deficiency against the debtor for the entire loan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Because there is no <em>notice </em>provision and no <em>right of public participation </em>in this bill which specifically permits private sales of repossessed property, a dealer who repossesses could sell to itself any vehicle for the sum of $1.00 and then proceed against the purchaser for the entire deficiency of the loan (less ($1.00)[)]. The only possible protection is found in notification of such a sale to the borrower and to the Commissioner of Consumer Credit, but the disclosed activity would be perfectly legal and the deficiency judgement enforceable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Memorandum from Delegate Dana Dembrow to the House Economic Matters Committee Counsel, Lars Kristiansen (April 9, 1987) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Senate Bill 839 was amended in committee to add the post-sale disclosure requirements for \u201cprivate sales\u201d as part of \u201cconsumer protection measures\u201d to \u201cprevent private sales that are made to the detriment of the defaulting buyer/borrower\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANf\">The intent is to provide a lender the freedom to seek the best resale price on the repossessed goods, an option that could be of benefit to the defaulting buyer/borrower. Currently, many public sales (auctions) cannot be attended by private buyers due to limitations on how the purchase price must be paid, eligibility to bid and other restructive [sic] factors. Under certain circumstances, such sales do not generate the best possible price as the successful bidder is usually purchasing the goods at wholesale for later retail resale. Certain private purchasers may be interested in buying the goods for their own use and not concerned with the profit motive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">These facts are recognized under the Retail Installment Sales Act (CLA Title 12 subtitle 6); however, to prevent favored buyer private sales that are not \u201cbona fide\u201d (commercially reasonable), the Commissioner of Consumer Credit has a regulation that allows a full review of all private sale transactions under the subtitle. These amendments, if accepted, will codify the pertinent consumer protection measures of that regulation and prevent private sales that are made to the detriment of the defaulting buyer/borrower.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Explanation of Amendments, SB 839 (Senator Della) (1987). The 1987 amendments to CLEC, thus, were intended to balance giving the creditor the benefit of the \u201cfreedom to seek the best resale price on the repossessed goods,\u201d with protecting the debtor against collusive and detrimental \u201cfavored buyer private sales that are not ... commercially reasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The requirements of commercial reasonableness of all sales and post-sale disclosure for a \u201cprivate sale\u201d have not been materially changed <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> since 1987 nor defined. Nevertheless, we can glean what the concept of \u201ccommercial reasonableness\u201d represents by explaining its meaning in the context of Maryland Uniform Commercial Code, pursuant to which the approach is a multi-factor analysis. The outcome of this multifactor analysis does not necessarily depend solely on a low sales price, as \u201c[t]he fact that a greater amount could have been obtained by a ... disposition ... at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the secured party is not of itself sufficient to preclude the secured party from establishing that the ... disposition ... was made in a commercially reasonable manner.\u201d Section 9-627(a) of the Commercial Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Rather, \u201c \u2018the primary focus of commercial reasonableness is not the <em>proceeds </em>received from the sale but rather the <em>procedures </em>employed for the sale.\u2019 \u201d <em>National Housing Partnership v. Municipal Capital Appreciation Partners </em>I, <em>L.P., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>935 A.2d 300, 315 (D.C.2007), quoting <em>In re Zsa Zsa, Ltd., </em>352 F.Supp. 665, 671 (S.D.N.Y.1972), <em>aff'd without opinion, </em>475 F.2d 1393 (2d Cir.1973) (emphasis in original).

Bower, </em>266 Md. 579, 590-91, 295 A.2d 870, 875-76 (1972), for example, in which we determined that the creditor\u2019s sale of a repossessed boat was not commercially reasonable under the Uniform Commercial Code, because the creditor not only failed to advertise the sale in \u201ccustomary yachting publications,\u201d but also the three bids he received had a \u201ccuriously improbable air\u201d about them, and the value of the boat depreciated because the creditor failed to maintain its condition during the two-year delay between the repossession and resale of the boat. Notably, our conclusion was buttressed by the dubious nature of the few prospective offers and the devalued condition of the boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Commentators have opined that other procedural aspects that could influence a finding of commercial unreasonableness of a sale are that the sale occurred \u201ctoo quickly\u201d; that there was inadequate advertising; that it was held in an improper location; that prospective bidders did not have the opportunity to inspect the property before the sale; that the creditor did not perform minor maintenance to the collateral that might increase the selling price; or that the sale did not occur as advertised. James J. White &amp; Robert S. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code 906-08 (5th ed.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The multi-factor analysis used to define commercial reasonableness in the UCC can be applied to CLEC, as we have heretofore noted in <em>Kline v. Central Motors Dodge, Inc., </em>328 Md. 448, 614 A.2d 1313 (1992), in which we addressed whether the Retail Installment Sales Act (\u201cRISA\u201d), Sections 12-601 to 12-636 of the Commercial Law Article, Maryland Code (1975, 2005 Repl.Vol.), another credit-extension statute, required a \u201cbona fide public or private sale,\u201d Section 12-626(e)(1)(ii), to be conducted in a commercially reasonable manner. In concluding that it did, we agreed with the debtors\u2019 argument that the phrase \u201cbona fide,\u201d in RISA\u2019s requirement that a \u201cprivate sale\u201d must be \u201cbona fide\u201d in accordance with Section 12-626(e)(1)(ii), had \u201csubstantially the same meaning as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>words, \u2018commercially reasonable,\u2019 \u201d under what is now Section 9-610(b) of Maryland Uniform Commercial Code. <em>Kline, </em>328 Md. at 451, 459, 614 A.2d at 1314, 1318. We held that \u201cthe bona fide sale required by RISA \u00a7 12-626 is the same as the commercially reasonable sale required by\u201d CLEC. <em>Id. </em>at 459, 614 A.2d at 1318. The phrase \u201ccommercially reasonable manner,\u201d under CLEC, then, relates to evaluating the procedures utilized to sell collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">The post-sale disclosure requirements, similarly, were intended to address the potential for collusion to the detriment of the buyer during a \u201cprivate sale\u201d and requires greater qualitative and quantitative information be disclosed to the debtor, including: \u201cThe purchaser\u2019s name, address and business address;\u201d \u201cThe number of bids sought and received;\u201d and \u201cAny statement as to the condition of the goods at the time of repossession which would cause their value to be increased or decreased above or below the market value for goods of like kind and quality.\u201d Section 12 \u2014 1021 (j)(2)(vii, viii, ix).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Although we have not had occasion to define \u201cpublic auction,\u201d our brethren on the Court of Special Appeals have in <em>Pyles v. Goller, </em>109 Md.App. 71, 75 n. 2, 674 A.2d 35, 37 n. 2 (1996), and <em>Express Auction Services, Inc. v. Conley, </em>127 Md.App. 447, 453, 732 A.2d 1012, 1015 (1999), to be \u201ca method of selling [property] in a public forum through open and competitive bidding,\u201d quoting the National Auctioneers Association\u2019s <em>Glossary of Real Estate Auction Terms. </em>Although both of these cases involved the sale of real estate and neither addressed the issue of whether the sale in question in those cases were \u201cpublic auctions,\u201d it is the definition embraced by GMAC. \u201cOpen\u201d and \u201ccompetitive bidding\u201d are, thus, the gravamen of a \u201cpublic auction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">To be open, as a deterrent from collusion and abuse, is to be transparent, as we acknowledged most recently in <em>WSG Holdings, LLC v. Bowie, </em>429 Md. 598, 57 A.3d 463 (2012), in which we considered the open meeting provisions of the Charles County Code and the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Appeals for Charles County. In that case, the Board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Appeals refused to allow all but one member of the public and his counsel to observe an in-person inspection of a subject property in a zoning exception application proceeding. In concluding that this visit was a meeting that was not open, in violation of the Charles County Code and the Board\u2019s own Rules of Procedure, we acknowledged that the purpose of openness is to be transparent, to allow the public to observe the Board of Appeals\u2019 evidence-gathering and decision-making process, so to prevent corruption, deceit, and \u201cthe crystallization of secret decisions to a point just short of ceremonial acceptance.\u201d 429 Md. at 619, 57 A.3d at 476, quoting <em>Town of Palm Beach v. Gradison, </em>296 So.2d 473, 477 (Fla.1974). Openness and transparency, then, are dependent on the ability to observe the proceeding to ensure opportunity to observe that rules are being followed and those in control are not engaging in collusive or unfair practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">In auctions, openness, defined as \u201cfull transparency,\u201d allows \u201c[bidders and other interested parties [to] verify that the rules are followed.\u201d Peter Cramton <em>&amp; </em>Jesse A. Schwartz, \u201cCollusive Bidding: Lessons from the FCC Spectrum Auctions,\u201d 17 Journal of Regulatory Economics 229, 230 (2000). Transparency further assures the integrity of the auction process, as all are involved in observing that the rules of the auction are followed and thereby trust that the sellers are abiding by the rules, as opposed to favoring one bidder.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Aleksandar Pekec &amp; Michael H. Rothkopf, \u201cCombinatorial Auction Design,\u201d 49 Management Science 1485, 1489 (2003) <em>(\u201cTransparency </em>is important in auctions for two reasons: (1) it simplifies bidders\u2019 understanding of the situation, thus easing their decision making, and (2) it increases their trust in the auction process by improving their ability to verify that the auction rules have, in fact, been followed.\u201d (emphasis in original)). Openness or transparency in a \u201cpublic auction,\u201d thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>elucidates the integrity, or lack thereof, of the procedures employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">The \u201cpublic auction\u201d concept, as well as CLEC\u2019s language, purpose, and design, thus, define the answer to the Certified Question. A \u201cpublic auction\u201d requires transparency in the process for its own integrity. The post-sale disclosure requirements for a \u201cprivate sale\u201d are implicated when openness and transparency are not present, to enable a debtor to challenge the procedures used to sell a vehicle that affect the amount of a deficiency judgment assessed against the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In the present case, the admission fee obscured transparency because bidders and interested parties would have had to accumulate and part with money, at least temporarily, in order to merely observe the auction. The admission fee shielded the process used to sell Ms. Gardner\u2019s and Mr. Scott\u2019s cars from observation and, thus, could not constitute a \u201cpublic auction\u201d under CLEC. Rather, the sales were, in actuality, \u201cprivate sales\u201d subject to the post-sale disclosure requirements of Section 12-1021(j)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">CERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED AS SET FORTH ABOVE.

The following provisions of the Maryland Uniform Commercial Code involving a \u201cpublic sale\u201d and a \u201cprivate sale,\u201d for example, do not define the public-private distinction: Section 2-706 of the Commercial Law Article (regarding the seller\u2019s resale of goods as a remedy to the buyer\u2019s breach); Section 7-206 of the Commercial Law Article (providing that a warehouse may sell goods \u201cat public or private sale,\u201d if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>goods are a hazard to other property, facilities, or other persons); Section 7-210 of the Commercial Law Article (providing for the enforcement of a warehouse lien by public or private sale); Section 7-308 of the Commercial Law Article (providing for the enforcement of a carrier\u2019s lien on goods by public or private sale); Section 9-614 of the Commercial Law Article (providing Safe-Harbor forms of pre-sale notification of public and private sales).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b558-7\">.
