That on the 26th day of March, 1868, a person representing himself to be P. Donovan presented to the defendants a check for $2,100, payable to P. Donovafi or order, on the Bowery National Bank, purporting to be drawn by one John Sniffen, who was then a depositor with said bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-12\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That the defendants, upon presentation of the check to them, certified said check to be good, as alleged in the complaint, in the usual way of such certifications by the paying teller stamping the same upon its face, and writing his name thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-13\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>3. That shortly after said certification, the defendants learned from John Sniffen, the depositor, by whom said check purported to be drawn, that said check was never drawn by him, and the defendants thereupon inserted in four daily morning newspapers, which were issued on the morning of the next day, March 27th, 1868, a notice cautioning the public from negotiating said check.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-14\">\u201c 4. That on the said 26th day of March a person representing himself to be P. Donovan presented said check to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>paying teller of the Sixth National Bank and asked the said bank to pay the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-4\">\u201c 5. That previous to this day, the person so presenting said check had been introduced by a customer of the bank to said Sixth National Bank as P. Donovan, and in that name had opened an account in said Sixth National Bank, and in that name had deposited money and drawn checks upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-5\"><em>\u201c </em>6. That the paying teller of said Sixth National Bank, upon the presentation of said check so certified, refused to pay the same; but upon the same being indorsed by the person presenting the same with the name of P. Donovan, the payee therein named, the paying teller certified the indorsement to be correct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-6\">\u201c 7. That said person thereupon left the bank, and on the 26th day of March, 1868, took said check to the plaintiff, who was a dealer in gold and silver coin and bullion, doing business at No. 1 Wall street, in the city of New York, and offered to purchase gold coin with said check.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-7\">\u201c 8. That this person being a stranger to the plaintiff, and it then being after bank hours, the plaintiff sent said check to a bank near his office to ascertain if the certification upon its face of the Bowery National Bank was genuine, and also the certificate of the Sixth National Bank to its indorsement. That the paying teller of the bank had left for the day, and the plaintiff was unable to and did not learn concerning the genuineness of said certifications. That thereupon the plaintiff refused to deliver the gold and take the check until he could verify these certifications, and requested the holder of the check to call the next day during banking hours.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-8\"><em>\u201c </em>9. That the said person called the next morning, the 27th of March, 1868, and again presented said check. That thereupon the plaintiff sent said check to a bank in the neighborhood, and learned that the certifications thereon were genuine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-9\">1110. That thereupon the plaintiff took the check and delivered to the person presenting it its full equivalent in gold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-10\">\u201c 11. That shortly afterward (this being on the 27tli of March, 1868) the plaintiff sent said checks to the banking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>house of the defendants at the corner of Canal street and the Bowery, and demanded payment, and was then for the first 'time informed- that said check was a forgery, and payment of said check was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-4\">\u201c 12. That the name of John Sniffen, as signed to the said check was in fact a forgery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-5\">\u201c 13. That the plaintiff took said check without notice of the forgery of 'the drawer\u2019s name, and gave value for the same in good faith, and in the course of his business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-6\">\u201c 14. That the plaintiff has never been paid by said defendants the amount of 'said check.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-7\">\u201c 15. That the interest thereon from- the date of the presentation thereof to the date of this report is $470.33.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-8\">\u201c And I report as a conclusion of law, that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment against the defendants for $2,570.33- and the costs- of this action.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-9\"><em>James JR.

The plaintiff took the check in the ordinary course of business for value and in good faith. There is nothing shown to impeach his title. The check turned out to be a forgery. It cannot be questioned that the bank is liable to make good its certificate by paying the check. <em>(Farmers' and Merchants' Bank </em>v. <em>Butchers' and\u2019 Drovers' Bank, </em>25 id., 146; <em>Price </em>v. <em>Neul, </em>3 Burr., 1354; <em>Commercial, &amp;c., Bank </em>v. <em>First National Bank, </em>30 Md., 11.) The principle on which the liability rests is stated by Holt, Ch.. J., in <em>Hern </em>v. <em>Nichols </em>(1 Salk., 298), namely, that \u201c seeing somebody must be a loser by this deceit, it is more reason he that confides in the deceiver should be a loser than a stranger,\u201d and has become an established rule of law in cases identical with this.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Whether the indorsement purporting to be that of the payee named in the check was genuine or not, or whether the person so named was a fictitious person, imperfectly appears. But it is immaterial whether it was one or the other. There can be no real payee of a forged instrument. As between the plaintiff and the bank the liability of the latter attached upon the check being certified, and as it is impossible to make title to money payable upon a forged check through an indorsement thereof, proof of the genuineness of the indorsement is unnecessary for that purpose. The evidence shows that the person from whom the plaintiff received the check went by the name indorsed thereon, and that the indorsement was made by him. This is quite sufficient to protect the plaintiff against any imputation of negligence or bad faith in taking the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The advertisement of the forgery not having been brought home to the plaintiff, corr have no effect whatever upon his right to recover. <em>(Raphael </em>v. <em>Bank of </em>England, 17 C. B., 161.) For the reasons stated, we are of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
