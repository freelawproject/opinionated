The referee found, as a fact, that the judgment had been paid, satisfied and canceled of record; that payments had been made by Lawrence on account of the judgments for principal and interest, and that he should have in his hands some $3,000, or the value thereof, beyond the payments. The referee found that the plaintiff was entitled to one-half of that sum, with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-11\">It was claimed by the defendant, before the referee, that the evidence established the fact that the satisfaction piece of one of the judgments, in respect to which the security had been given upon appeal, was given by mistake, under a supposition that the judgment had been fully paid, whereas the costs alone had been paid, and the defendant requested a finding as to the amount actually paid upon such judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>and as to whether there was mistake in <em>giving </em>the satisfaction piece. He also requested findings of law upon the question of payment of the judgments, and as to whether the defendant Lawrence, knowing of the mistake, was released from the liability of surety.

The receipt of September 15th, 1863, contains the contract. By the terms of that, the defendant Lawrence agreed to hold the bonds as security for liabilities of his co-sureties and himself on undertakings given on behalf of Ward <em>&amp; </em>Gove, upon appeals by them to the Court of Appeals, in certain actions between them and Charles Kelsey. It appears that Kelsey prevailed in these appeals, and that the judgments recovered were duly satisfied by him. The satisfaction of these judgments discharged the defendant and his co-sureties on the undertaking, and entitled Ward &amp; Gove to a return of the bonds. It may be that, if any fraud or mistake occurred in procuring the satisfaction of the judgments, and Lawrence was privy to it, he would be permitted to avail himself of the facts, as giving him the right to retain the securities. But there is no proof of such mistake or fraud, nor has Kelsey asserted the existence of either of those facts, or sought in any way to invalidate the satisfaction pieces of the judgments. We are of opinion that the evidence on this subject constitutes no defence to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">2d. The only other defence is, that Ward agreed that Lawrence might apply the securities in payment of a debt due Mm by Ward individually. There being no evidence of the assent of the plaintiff to this agreement, or of any act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of ratification on his part, this agreement was not binding upon him, and the finding of the referee upon the facts, as applied to this case, was correct. An agreement by one member of a copartnership with a trustee of the firm, to divert securities belonging to the firm, in the hands of the latter, to the individual use of the former, is not valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
