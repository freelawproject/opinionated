They also contested the alleged value.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">The defendants attempted to prove several remote and indirect facts and circumstances, from which it was sought to be inferred that the loss occurred from leakage in some manner, which the court excluded, and defendants excepted. A stevedore was asked as to his experience of the effect of heavy weather on fluids in casks during a sea voyage; and also as to the condition of the other casks containing fluids, that came out of the vessel at the same time as this. It was not offered to be shown that casks, perfectly sound at the termination\u2019of the voyage, ever lost the fluids which had been put into them, in consequence of severe or heavy weather during the voyage. Any experience short of this would fall far short of justifying a legal conclusion that this 'wine was lost from a sound cask by stress of weather. The evidence was wholly immaterial and properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">A motion was made to dismiss the complaint at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, for the reason that he had not proven that the government duties had been paid on \u2022 the wine, and a custom-house permit obtained to land it.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">This omission in no manner excused the want of wine in the cask. It was nonsense to require the plaintiff to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>duty, or produce a permit to land a cask of wine, when the wine was gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The importer of the cask of wine, after learning that the defendants had suffered a loss of the wine, assigned his claim against the defendants to the plaintiff, who brought the action. The assignor was asked, on cross-examination, what he sold it for to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">It was insisted that it would tend to show bias and interest in the witness; the price for which the claim sold was immaterial, and might tend to prejudice the mind of the jury. The assignor had no legal claim against his assignee in respect to the price. Interest or bias do not disqualify a witness. It may be taken into consideration in weighing the value of evidence, but there would be no legitimate inference as to interest or bias against the witness on account of the price.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Another witness was asked if this wine did not often deteriorate in coming to this country. \u2018An exception was taken to its exclusion. The wine not having been delivered, it was purely conjectural whether it would have deteriorated. It was not claimed that such wine always deteriorated. The inquiry could prove nothing certain or material as to the wine .in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">A custom-house officer, who kept an entry of an application for a permit to land this cask of wine, was asked what he found on his memorandum as to the valuation of this cask. It was excluded by the judge, unless evidence should be given to connect the importer with the memorandum. This rule was correct. It was worse than hearsay, unless the memorandum was brought to the knowledge of the importer at the time it was made or while he remained the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">A witness, acquainted with custom-house business and regulations, was asked to state under what circumstances, and on what valuations, free permits are given at the custom department. The question was excluded, and an exception taken. The inquiry tended to prove nothing material. It was not shown that the importer had applied for a free permit. It was not claimed that there was any statute about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>permits. It was of no consequence what were the rules or regulations of the custom-house. It does not follow that those rules are always observed.- I believe it is not unusual for the officials to disregard them wholly.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The cask having been received in good order, the defendants were bound to prove that the loss occurred within some clause of the bill of lading exempting them from liability; .proving that the ship had, a tempestuous voyage, that the cargo was well stowed, and that the hatches were properly secured, &amp;c., did not tend to shift the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The cask was in good order on arrival, showing that the \u25a0severe weather had not injured it, and, consequently, that the loss of the wine did not happen from that cause; at least, that question could not be taken from the jury, as requested at the close of the evidence. There could be no conclusive 'presumption, in this case, that the wine was lost by stress of weather or peril of the seas.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The matters embraced in the third and fifth requests of defendants\u2019 counsel to the court, in relation to the charge, are mere questions of fact, .and were fully covered by the charge as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
