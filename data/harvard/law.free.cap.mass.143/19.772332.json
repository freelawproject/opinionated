Sts. <em>c. </em>175, to recover possession of a certain tenement in Taunton. Writ dated July 6, 1885, and, as shown by the officer\u2019s return, served on that day. Trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before Hammond, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-8\">It appeared that the defendant leased the tenement by an oral agreement from Ann C. Howard, and had occupied said premises for some time previously to July 1, 1885; that on July 3, 1885, Howard let said tenement to the plaintiff, by a duly executed written lease, for the term of one year; that the plaintiff thereupon caused to be served upon the defendant the following notice, dated July 3, 1885: \u201c Please take notice that I have this day leased the tenement 28 White Street in said Taunton, the same being the upper tenepient or the tenement now occupied by you at said 28 White Street, as the tenant of my lessor, Mrs. A. C. Howard, and I further give you notice to quit, vacate, and deliver up to me the said tenement by Monday, 6th day of July current, by twelve o\u2019clock noon, or I will take due course of law to eject you from the same; \u201d and that the notice was served between six and seven o\u2019clock in the evening of July 3, 1885.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-9\">The plaintiff called as a witness one Cobb, a deputy sheriff, and asked him the following question: \u201c Do you remember what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>time of day you served that writ?\u201d To this, against the defendant\u2019s objection, he made the following answer: \u201c I can\u2019t tell you exactly. I got home after sunset, or about sunset, and my folks told me you had been down to see me; I drove immediately to your office, and took the papers, and made out my copies, and went up to Etter\u2019s house, and rapped at the door, but I didn\u2019t seem to find him at home, and finally I left it, and I should think it was late in the evening; my impression would be it was not a great way from nine o\u2019clock.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-4\">It further appeared that the defendant occupied the second story of said tenement, and was a married man.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\">The defendant asked the judge to rule, as matter of law, that the notice, upon the above evidence, was insufficient in point of time. The judge refused so to rule; found, as a fact, that the notice was sufficient in point of time, and that the writ was made after six o\u2019clock in the evening of July 6; and found for the plaintiff. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-6\"><em>F. V. Fuller, </em>for the defendant, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUx\">1. That the testimony of the officer was inadmissible to explain or qualify his return, and therefore that the action was prematurely brought. 2. That the notice did not afford the tenant a reasonable time in which to remove, as it embraced a public holiday and Sunday.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-7\"><em>W. W. Robinson, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A_m\">was not called upon.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b36-8\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AA\">After the lease was made to the plaintiff, the defendant became a tenant at sufferance. .There is nothing in the bill of exceptions to show that the finding of the Superior Court, that the notice was sufficient, was erroneous as matter of law. <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>126 Mass. 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">As the notice fixed \u201c Monday, 6th day of July current, by twelve o\u2019clock noon,\u201d as the time when the tenant was required to vacate the premises, it was important for the plaintiff to show that his writ was not sued out and served before that time. The writ is dated July 6, 1885, and the officer returned that he served it on July 6, 1885. For the purpose of showing that it was issued and served after noon of that day, it was competent for the officer to testify that he served it in the evening. This testimony did not contradict or vary his return, but was consistent with it.</p>\n<p id=\"A9A\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
