The defendant's death was suggested on March 20, 1885. An order summoning in the executors of his will issued on June 4, 1885, returnable in July, 1885.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag2d\">The Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>99, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, in giving an action of tort to a common informer to recover of the owner of a place in which property is lost by gaming treble the value thereof, provide for the recovery of a penalty; and the action does not survive against the representatives of the defendant, either at common law or by the Pub. Sts. <em>e. </em>165, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The assumption on which the argument for the plaintiff is founded, that, prior to the General Statutes, the action to recover a like penalty survived because the form of the action was debt, is unwarranted. The earlier statutes, passed when debt was the common action for penalties, (St. 1793, <em>c. </em>43, \u00a7 4; Rev. Sts. <em>e. </em>118, \u00a7 42,) gave a <em>qui tarn </em>action of debt to recover a penalty, one half of which was for the use of the Commonwealth. The General Statutes, passed after the Practice Act (St. 1852, <em>c. </em>312, \u00a7 2) had provided that tort should include all actions for penalties, prescribed the action of tort, and gave the whole penalty to the informer. St. 1785, <em>a. </em>58. Rev. Sts. <em>e. </em>50, \u00a7 12. St. 1837, <em>o, </em>179. Gen. Sts. c. 85, \u00a7 1. Plainly neither action can survive against a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"AMeh\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
