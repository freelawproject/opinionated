Allen, being then and there a passenger of said corporation, as aforesaid, and not being in its employment, was lost in the manner and form aforesaid: whereby said Brockton Street Railway Company has become liable to a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars nor less than five hundred dollars, to be recovered by indictment, and to be paid to the executor or administrator of the said Edward B. Allen, for the use of the widow and children of the said Edward B. Allen, and that Carrie I Allen, of Springfield, in the county of Hampden, has been duly appointed and now is administratrix of the'estate of the said Edward B. Allen; that said Edward B. Allen died as aforesaid, leaving a widow, to wit, the said Carrie I. Allen, but leaving no children. Against the peace of the Commonwealth and contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-4\">Before the jury were empanelled, the defendant filed the following motion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-5\">\u201c And said defendant moves that the second count in said indictment be quashed, for the reason that the same is insufficient in form, and does not set forth any offence with precision, accuracy, and certainty, for the following reasons : First. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>is no averment that the life of said Allen was lost by reason of the unfitness and gross negligence or carelessness of any servant or agent of said corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-4\">\u201c And said defendant moves that the third count in said indictment be quashed, for the reason that the same is insufficient in form, and does not set forth any offence with precision, accuracy, and certainty, for the following reasons: First. There is no averment that said Edward B. Allen was a passenger on said car. Second. There is no averment that the life of said Allen was lost by reason of the unfitness and gross negligence or carelessness of any servant or agent of said corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-5\">\u201c And now comes the defendant and moves that each count in said indictment be quashed, for the reason that each count is vague and uncertain, and too general in its allegations, in that neither count does with sufficient certainty and accuracy set out and aver how or in what manner or in what respect or particular said servants or agents of said company were unfit or grossly negligent or careless.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-6\">Barker, J., overruled the motion; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-7\">The evidence for the government tended to show that, in the morning of March 10, 1885, Edward B. Allen was a passenger on a car of the defendant corporation, and was standing on one of the steps of the front platform; that one Fenner was driving the car; that one Ashley got on to the car to relieve Fenner, to enable him to get his breakfast; that Ashley took the reins, and Fenner immediately got off, as if in a hurry, on the side where Allen was, while the car was in rapid motion, and Allen was pushed or struck against by Fenner, and fell to the ground, and was run over by the car; and died two days afterwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-8\">The defendant\u2019s evidence tended to show that Fenner remained on the car some time after giving the reins to Ashley, and did not get off until after Allen had fallen to the ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-9\">The defendant requested the judge to instruct the jury as follows: \u201c If the jury find that, at the time Fenner was attempting to get off the car, he was not engaged in the business of the street railway company, they must, under this indictment, return a verdict of not guilty, even though they should find that the other driver was guilty of gross negligence and carelessness, and unfit for his duty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The judge refused to instruct the jury as requested; and instructed them as follows : \u201cIf the jury find the cause of Allen\u2019s fall was that he was pushed of struck against by Fenner, as Fenner was in the act of leaving the car, and that Fenner's act at the time, and in the way in which you shall find that it was performed, was a grossly negligent and careless act, then it would be sufficient to fix the liability of the defendant, upon this indictment, if at the time Fenner was engaged in the business of the company, and this is a question of fact. If a driver, after relinquishing his charge and control of the horses, the reins, and appliances to his successor, immediately starts to leave the car in pursuance of a common intention between him and the driver to whom he relinquished the same, in order that the latter should then and there assume his turn at the driving, rather than at any other time and place, to enable the first driver then and there to leave his work and the car, the act of the first driver in so leaving the car may be found to be an act performed when he was in the business of the company. But if there was no present intention on the part of Fenner to leave the car immediately upon relinquishing the driving, and he remained upon the car to be carried on to his place of destination, his act in leaving the car subsequently, when that place of destination was reached, would not be an act done while engaged in the business of the company.\u201d The judge also gave other instructions appropriate- to the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-3\">The jury, returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-4\"><em>K. </em>Kingman, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-5\"><em>B. W. Karris B. 0. </em>Karris, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b523-6\">Gardner, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoL\">The second and third counts of the indictment are sufficient. The only specific objection made at the argument, that there is no averment that the life of Allen was lost by reason of the unfitness, gross negligence, and carelessness of any servant or agent of the corporation, is not sustained. Each count alleges that by reason of the unfitness, gross negligence, and carelessness of one Fenner, who is alleged to be the servant of the defendant corporation, and engaged in its business, the life of Allen was lost. The motion to quash was rightly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>The facts show that the driver Fenner was relieved by one Ashley, to enable Fenner to go to his breakfast. Fenner was in the employ of the defendant corporation, as a driver of one of its horse cars. To perform this duty it was necessary for him to go upon the car, and it was also necessary that he should leave the car when he went to his meals, and when his service was completed for the day. We do not think that he was exclusively within the scope of his' employment when he was handling the reins and driving the horses. When going upon the car for that purpose, and when leaving it after he had stopped driving, he was within the scope of his employment. His employment was continuous, and his service began when he stepped upon the car for the purpose of driving the horses, and continued until he left the car, at least if he left immediately after giving the reins and horses in charge of another driver. If in going upon the car to act as driver, or in leaving the car at once after'ceasing to be driver, he negligently and carelessly came in contact with a passenger, by reason of which the passenger suffered injury, we think that the driver in so doing was a servant of the corporation, was acting within the scope of his employment, and that the corporation is responsible to the passenger injured for the negligent acts of its driver. The company is liable for whatever injury occurs to a \u2019passenger through the negligence and carelessness of its servant in doing what is necessarily incident to his employment. If it should be held otherwise, passengers upon horse cars might be subject to the brutality of one in the service of the corporation, whom the corporation placed upon its cars, and yet for whose acts while upon the car the corporation would not be liable unless he held the reins in his hands and was actually driving the horses at the time of his careless and negligent act.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The instructions prayed for were properly refused, and those given were sufficiently favorable to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
