Because it does not appear from any venire served for drawing and summoning jurors, that either or any of the persons above named were drawn by a selectman of the town in which he resides, in accordance with the provisions of the statute. 2. Because no indorsement or return is made upon any venire by any person having authority under the statute to make such indorsement or return, that either of said persons named was legally drawn to serve as traverse juror in this case, or at this sitting of the court. 3. Because the statute requires that jurors shall be selected by drawing ballots from the jury box; that this drawing of ballots shall be done openly in the presence of the selectmen by one of their number; that the names of the persons borne on the ballots so drawn should be indorsed on the venire under which the drawing takes place; that there is no return, indorsement, or certificate made by any person authorized thereto, or other competent evidence upon any venire returned, of the fact that the name of either of said persons above named was selected or drawn in the manner or by the person authorized by statute to make such selection or drawing.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-8\">The defendant, before either of said persons named was sworn, presented to the court the venire upon which each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>said persons was summoned to attend court, as evidence of tlie causes of challenge alleged.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ate\">The argument for the prisoner rests chiefly on the ground that the Pub. Sts. <em>o. </em>170, \u00a7 22, prescribing the manner of summoning a juror, \u201c by reading to him the venire with the indorsement thereon of his having been drawn, or by leaving at his place of abode a written notification of his having been drawn,\u201d &amp;c., contemplate an indorsement by the town clerk or selectmen of the fact that certain persons have been duly drawn, and that, without such indorsement, the constable has no proper means of knowing the fact, since the law does not require his presence at the drawing.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">This particular alternative method of making service was first enacted in the St. of 1784, <em>e. </em>7, \u00a7 5. An examination of the statutes upon the subject from 1692 to the present time shows that there has never been any express requirement that the town clerk or selectmen should certify in writing who were chosen as jurors by the freeholders, as was the custom before 1736, or drawn from the jury box by themselves, as has been the law since that date, or even that the constable should be present when jurors were so chosen or drawn; there has never been any express provision showing how the constable should ascertain what persons were chosen or drawn as jurors; but the constable has always been required, in general terms, to summon the persons chosen or drawn as jurors, and to make return of the venire. See Prov. Sts. 1692-3 (4 W. &amp; M.) <em>c. </em>33, \u00a7 11; 1 Prov. Laws (State ed.) 74; 1694-5 (7 W. &amp; M.) <em>e. </em>24, \u00a7 1; 1 Prov. Laws (State ed.) 193; 1697 (9 W. III.) <em>e. </em>9, \u00a7 10; 1 Prov. Laws (State ed.) 286; 1699-1700, (11 W. III.) c. 1, \u00a7 4; <em>e. </em>2, \u00a7 3; <em>c. </em>3, \u00a7 5; 1 Prov. Laws (State ed) 368, 369, 371; 1736-7 (11 Geo. II.) <em>e. </em>10, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; 2 Prov. Laws (State ed.) 828, 829; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>1741-2 (15 Geo. II.) <em>c. </em>18, \u00a7\u00a7 2-5; 2 Prov. Laws (State ed.) 1090, 1091; 1749-50 (23 Geo. II.) e. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 2-5; 3 Prov. Laws (State ed.) 474, 475; 1756-7 (30 Geo. II.) <em>c. </em>13, \u00a7\u00a7 2-5; 3 Prov. Laws (State ed.) 995; 1759-60 (33 Geo. II.) e. 29, \u00a7\u00a7 2-5; 4 Prov. Laws (State ed.) 318, 319; Sts. 1784, <em>c. </em>7, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5 ; 1807, e. 140; Rev. Sts. c. 95, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 17; Gen. Sts. e. 132, \u00a7 20; Pub. Sts. c. 170, \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">We have also looked at a number of original venires in different years, both before and after 1784, in two different counties, and upon the venires so examined the constables usually made a direct return that certain persons named were drawn as jurors; though in some instances an indorsement of the drawing was made upon the venire by the town clerk. As early as 1804, and perhaps earlier, there was a printed form of return upon venires in Suffolk county, in which the constable stated who were drawn. Such also is the form of return given in Goodwin\u2019s Town Officer, (ed. of 1829,) 331, 332, and in the New England Sheriff, (2d ed., 1855,) 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In the present case, the return was in this respect in the usual form, and it was not disputed that the jurors in fact were properly drawn; and the objection rests solely on the ground 'that the drawing was not certified upon the venire by the town clerk or selectmen. This was not necessary. If the jurors were to be summoned by reading to them the venires with the indorsement thereon of their having been drawn, such indorsement might be made by the constable.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The result is that the exceptions are overruled. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Moran, 130 Mass. 281, 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
