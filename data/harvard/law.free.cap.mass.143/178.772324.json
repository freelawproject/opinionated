The defendant, admitting that he kept the beer for sale, introduced evidence tending to show that the beer did not contain more than three per cent of alcohol; and that he sold several barrels a week, believing it to contain less than three per cent of alcohol. The government was then allowed to show, against the defendant\u2019s objection, that, on two days named, one seventeen days and the other two days before the day named in the complaint, a man was seen to go into the defendant\u2019s shop sober, and to come out intoxicated. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant had no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-11\">- Complaint,, under the P\u00fab.

Trial in the Superior Court, before Hammond, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-4\">The government introduced evidence tending to show that, on September 8, 1886, officers duly seized upon the defendant\u2019s premises, under a search-warrant, certain beer, being a sample from -a barrel on draught; that said beer contained more than three per cent of alcohol; and that the defendant kept and exposed the same for sale, as alleged in the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-5\">The defendant, admitting that he kept the beer for sale, introduced evidence tending to show that the beer did not contain more than three per cent of alcohol; and that he sold from four to five barrels a week, believing it to contain less than three per cent of alcohol.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-6\">During the trial, the government asked one of its witnesses the following question: \u201c What, if anything, have you seen shortly before the date of this complaint in reference to the conduct of the premises by the defendant ? \u201d To which the witness answered as follows: \u201c August 21st, I saw a man go in there sober and come out intoxicated; and I saw the same September 5th.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-7\">It appeared that the defendant had been in possession of the premises ever since August 1,1886.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-8\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions to the admission of said question and answer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b195-9\"><em>JE.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-cT\">So far as we can see, from the brief bill of exceptions, the defence was, not that the defendant was licensed, but that he kept for sale only a certain kind of beer, containing less than three per cent of alcohol. Admitting that he kept for sale the beer which was seized, the defendant, to support his defence, introduced evidence tending to show that he sold from four to five barrels of beer a week, believing it to contain less than three per cent. To meet this defence, the evidence which was objected to was competent. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Pease, 110 Mass. 412. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodman, </em>97 Mass. 117. Though not conclusive in its nature, and open to possible explanation on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>other grounds, it had some tendency to show that the beer usually sold by the defendant was stronger than the law allows to be sold by unlicensed persons. The evidence was made relevant by the course of the trial. The time apparently was not more remote than that covered by the evidence introduced by the defendant himself. At any rate, the defendant does not show by his bill of exceptions that he has suffered any injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
