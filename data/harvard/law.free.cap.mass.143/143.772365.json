The defendant contended that, under the pleadings and upon the evidence, the action could not be maintained. The judge found for the plaintiff for the amount so paid; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-11\">D. <em>B.

This was done, and the money was received and applied to the payment of the defendant\u2019s debt. In borrowing the money, in giving the note, and in paying the debt, the wife was the defendant\u2019s duly authorized agent. Through his agent, the defendant requested the plaintiff to assume a legal obligation. When one pays money under a legal obligation, assumed by him at the request of another and for his benefit, the law implies a promise to repay on the part of the person at whose request and for whose benefit the obligation is assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">When the plaintiff paid the note which he had signed, and which, at the defendant\u2019s request, had been used by him to obtain, money with which to pay his debt, it was in effect the payment of money by the plaintiff at the defendant\u2019s request. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Green, </em>3 Met. 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The plaintiff had no cause of action against the defendant until he had paid the note, which he was legally bound to pay. The statute of limitations did not begin to run until the plaintiff had been compelled to make such payment. <em>Thayer </em>v. Daniels, 110 Mass. 345.</p>\n<p id=\"Am1x\">\n<em>^Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
