The clear meaning of the allegation is, that the defendant kept the nuisance on the first day of August, and on divers other days and times between said day and the third day of September, including said third day of September. The complaint charges but one offence committed during a single period of time, and is not bad for duplicity.</p>\n<p id=\"AEa\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
