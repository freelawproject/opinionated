The respondent objected to the certificate, on the ground that the justice administering the oath was at that time the attorney of the party in relation to the cause involved in said oath; but the judge overruled the objection, and admitted the certificate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-8\">The respondent also requested the judge' to instruct the jury, \u201c that, the oath to the certificate having been administered by. the attorney of the party in relation to a cause for which he was employed as such attorney, the same was void and of no effect.\u201d But the judge refused so to instruct the jury, and on this point gave no instruction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-9\">The jury found for the petitioner; and the respondent alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-10\"><em>L.

But it has always been the uniform usage for attorneys for either party to administer oaths, as justices of the peace, to their clients or others, when the necessity for voluntary affidavits arises in a case; and there is no sound objection to this where the oaths are voluntary, and the act of the justice is substantially ministerial, and not judicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">In the case before us, the act of the attorney of the petitioner, in administering to him the oath to his certificate, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>substantially ministerial, and did not involve or require any hearing, decision, or adjudication. The act of the attorney was no more judicial than the taking an acknowledgment to a deed; and the Superior Court rightly held that the oath was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
