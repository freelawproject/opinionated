One of said five children, named John, was born on December 19, 1857, after the death of the testator.

Nowell, born on October 31, 1867, who is now living. The husband of said Hannah is dead. Georgiana married Henry E.

Foster, 7 Met. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>297. <em>Hatfield </em>v. <em>Sohier, </em>114 Mass. 48. <em>Gibbens </em>v. <em>Gibbens, </em>140 Mass. 102. The inartificial use of the word \u201c revert \u201d no more obscures the plain meaning that the children are to take as purchasers, than \u201c descend to his legal heirs \u201d in <em>White </em>v. <em>Woodberry, </em>9 Pick. 136,138, or \u201c inherit \u201d in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>16 Gray, 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">The question whether the remainder is to be taken <em>per capita </em>or <em>per stirpes </em>is more difficult. The English rule is, that, when property is given to A. and B. as tenants in common, and, at their decease, to their children, the latter take <em>per stirpes, </em>the testator\u2019s intent that the share of each tenant in common shall continue separate and go to his children being inferred from the fact that it will go over immediately upon his decease. <em>Pery </em>v. <em>White, </em>Cowp. 777, 781. <em>Flinn </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>1 Coll. 365. <em>Arrow </em>v. <em>Mellish, </em>1 DeG. &amp; S. 355. <em>Willes </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>10 Beav. 47. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Whittaker, </em>23 Beav. 196. <em>Wills </em>v. <em>Wills, </em>L. R. 20 Eq. 342. <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>7 Allen, 72, 77. Perhaps this court has gone further than the English courts would, in reading \u201c at their decease \u201d as meaning \u201c when all the life tenants shall have died,\u201d rather than \u201c as they respectively die,\u201d <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Coolidge, </em>99 Mass. 191, 192, although in that case the limitation over was not to children of the life tenants. But, when this interpretation is adopted, the reason for the English rule ceases, because the whole fund goes over together, instead of in separate shares at different times.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">We are of opinion that the testator\u2019s grandchildren take <em>per capita, </em>not only on the ground that the whole fund goes over together, but also because this remainder is evidently given in the same proportions as the remainder after the wife\u2019s death, which is limited by the same clause, and, as the remaindermen\u2019s parents take no interest in the latter, there can be no doubt that, if it stood alone, it would go <em>per capita. Weston </em>v. <em>Foster, ubi supra. </em>The presence of the latter limitation, and the slightly illiterate character of the will, make it more likely that the words \u201c at their decease \u201d were used in a popular rather than in a strictly logical sense, and thus enable us to apply the authority of <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Coolidge </em>with more confidence. And, conversely, the construction which we give to the words \u201c at their decease \u201d makes it more probable that the intention to be gathered from the limitation of the remainder after the wife\u2019s death is the true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>purport of the whole clause, rather than that for which there is some color in other portions of 'the clause taken by themselves. See further <em>Ballard </em>v. Ballard, 18 Pick. 41, 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">In <em>Merriam </em>v. Simonds, 121 Mass. 198, 208, there was an indication that the remainder was modelled on what the remaindermen would have taken in a representative capacity if the gift to the first takers had been absolute, for the remainder was to \u201c their children or their legal representatives,\u201d and the decision went on the ground that legal representatives were mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"ALF\">Decree\u201e <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
