The judge declined so to rule, and instructed the jury that they must he satisfied that the defendant made the assault with the intent charged in the indictment, and although the offence of carnally knowing and abusing may not have been committed, because of a change of intent after the assault was made, yet if the assault was made with the intent charged, they would be warranted in returning a verdict of guilty. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant had no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b48-10\">At the trial of an indictment, under the Pub.

Is the \u2022 offence laid in the indictments of an assault with intent to carnally know and abuse known to the laws of the Commonwealth ? The Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>202, \u00a7 28, provide for an assault upon a female with intent to commit a rape. Are the terms to carnally know and abuse synonymous with the term to rape? Are the two offences technically the same, differing only in mode of proof ? The offence of carnal knowledge and abuse imports that the victim was under ten years of age, and was a consenting party. The offence of rape implies that the acts done were done without the consent and against the will, imports the use of force and violence, and may be committed upon any female irrespective of age, that is to say, if the crime in every other respect is complete. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Fogerty, 8 Gray, 489. The offences are technically different, the one, rape, being a common law offence, the other, carnal abuse, a statutory one. <em>State </em>v. Worden, 46 Conn. 349, 363. The offence should have been laid as an attempt to commit the crime of carnally knowing and abusing, under the Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>210, \u00a7 8. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickett, </em>11 Nev. 255. Or as a misdemeanor at common law. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>9 Car. <em>&amp; </em>P. 213. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Ryland, </em>11 Cox C. C. 101.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-5\">The evidence in the case at bar shows affirmatively the entire absence of intent on the part of the defendant to carnally know and abuse the children, or either of them, and is not to be distinguished from <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Nichol, </em>Rus. &amp; Ry. 130, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Merrill, 14 Gray, 415. The jury should have been instructed that there was no sufficient proof to maintain the charge against the defendant of an intent to carnally know and abuse. ' \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-6\">2. Had the offence been laid in the indictment as the technical one of an assault with intent to commit rape, the second request for instructions should have been granted. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merrill, ubi supra. Rex </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>7 Car. &amp; P. 318. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>4 F. &amp; F. 967. <em>Shannon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Penn. St. 226.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-7\">Less favorable instructions should not have been given in the lesser crime of an assault with intent to carnally know and abuse. To say that there can be an assault without the use of force or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>violence, and with the consent of the person alleged to have been assaulted to acts done, is a contradiction in language. The consent of a child under ten years is no defence to the substantive crime, because the statute expressly so provides ; but is a defence to the assault with intent, because the terms of the statute do not extend to the assault, and because an assault consented to is no assault. <em>Smith </em>v. State, 12 Ohio St. 466. <em>State </em>v. Pickett, <em>ubi supra. Stephens </em>v. State, 34 Alb. L. J. 228. <em>Regina </em>v. Connolly, 26 U. C. (Q. B.) 317. <em>Cliver </em>v.

The instructions as given were in no sense equivalent, tended to mislead the jury in determining upon whom the burden rested, and upon this point must have left them in doubt.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-6\"><em>E. J. </em>Sherman, Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b52-7\">C. Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFP\">The chief argument for the defendant is, that an indictment for an assault upon a female child under the age of ten years, with intent to unlawfully and carnally know and abuse her, cannot be maintained without proof that the acts were done without her consent; that the carnal knowledge and abuse of a child is a special statutory offence, distinct from the crime of rape; and that the consent of the child is no defence to the substantive crime, because the statute expressly so provides or implies, but is a defence to the assault with intent, because the terms of the statute do not extend to the assault, and because an assault consented to is no assault in law. And there are many decisions, both English and American, some of which are cited, which sustain this defence. But it is not a valid defence in this Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">The statutes upon which the case depends are as follows: Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>202, \u00a7 27. \u201c Whoever ravishes and carnally knows a female of the age of ten years or more by force and against her will, \u00f3r \u00fanlawfully and carnally knows and abuses a female <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>child under the age of ten years, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life, or for any term of years.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Section 28. \u201c Whoever assaults a female with intent to commit a rape shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life, or for any term of years, or by fine,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">There is, indeed, another statute, Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>210, \u00a7 8, which provides that \u201c Whoever attempts to commit an offence pi'ohibited by law, and in such attempt does any act towards the commission of such offence, but fails in the perpetration,\u201d shall be punished. But the indictments in these cases are not brought under this statute. Indictments for attempts, whether brought under particular statutes, or under the common law, should set forth in direct terms that the defendant attempted to commit the crime. And so are the precedents. Train &amp; Heard's Prec. 50-53. 2 Wharton\u2019s Prec. (4th ed.) 1046-1052. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Dennis, 105 Mass. 162. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Sherman, 105 Mass. 169. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. McLaughlin, 105 Mass. 460. <em>Christian </em>v. Commonwealth, 23 Grat. 954. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomp</em>son, 116 Mass. 346, 349. This statute, therefore, being disregarded, it is to be considered if these indictments can rest upon the Pub. Sts. <em>e. </em>202, \u00a7 28, punishing an assault with intent to commit a rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In England, the definitions of rape have sometimes included the statutory offence of carnal knowledge of a young child. Thus, \u201c Rape is felony by the common law, declared by Parliament for the unlawful and carnal knowledge and abuse of any woman above the age of ten years against her will, or of a woman child under the age of ten years with her will, or against her will.\u201d 3 Inst. 60. \u201c Rape is the carnal knowledge of any woman above the age of ten years against her will, and of a woman-child under the age of ten years with or against her will.\u201d 1 Hale P. C. 628; see also p. 631. In 1 East P. C. 436, it is said, \u201cThis last-mentioned offence [viz. unlawful abuse of a child] is not properly speaking a rape, which implies a carnal knowledge against the will of the party; but a felony created by this statute [18 Eliz. <em>c. </em>7, \u00a7 4], under which the consent or non-consent of the child, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>under the age of ten years, is immaterial.\u201d Other writers have sometimes, directly or by implication, included the statutory of-fence within the term rape. See 4 Bl. Com. 212; 1 Gabb. Crim. Law, 832; Roscoe Crim. Ev. (7th Am. ed.) 875.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">But, however it may have been elsewhere, in Massachusetts the offence of unlawfully and carnally knowing and abusing a female child under the age of ten years is, and for more than two hundred years has been, known and designated as rape. In October, 1669, the ordinary form of rape being already punishable by existing laws, the following statute was passed : \u201c Forasmuch as carnal copulation with a'woman childe, under the age of ten years, is a more hainous sin than with one of more years, as being more inhumane and unnatural in itself, and more perrilous to the life and well-being of the childe: it is therefore ordered by this Court, and the authority thereof, that whosoever he be shall, commit or have carnal copulation with any such childe under ten years old, and be legally convicted thereof, he shall be put to death.\u201d This was printed in the edition of 1672 of the Colony Laws, p. 15, with the marginal note, \u201c Rape of a child.\u201d See also Anc. Chart. 60, with the same marginal note. These statutes for the ordinary form of rape, and for the abuse of a child, were in substance reenacted in separate and successive sections in 1692; 1 Prov. Laws (State ed.) 56 ; but by the Prov. St. of 1697 (10 Will. III.) <em>c. </em>18, 1 Prov. Laws (State ed.) 296, entitled, \u201cAn act against ravishment or rape,\u201d both were put into one section, and so they have ever since remained. The next statute appears to be that of 1784, <em>c. </em>68, entitled, \u201cAn act for the punishment of rape,\u201d both offences being included in the same section; the marginal note in the edition of 1823 being, \u201cRape punished with death.\u201d This was followed by the St. of 1805, <em>c. </em>97, entitled, \u201c An act providing for the punishment of the crime of rape, and for the prevention thereof,\u201d in which, by express reference, the offence of carnally knowing and abusing a woman child under the age of ten years is classified as rape. The later statutes are the St. of 1815, <em>c. </em>86; the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>125, \u00a7 18, where the marginal note is, \u201c Rape, or abuse of female child; \u201d the Gen. Sts. <em>e. </em>160, \u00a7 26, and the Pub. Sts. <em>o. </em>202, \u00a7 27, in each of which the marginal note mentions only \u201c rape.\u201d In Davis\u2019s Crim. Just. (ed. 1824), a work long used and relied on in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>State, the carnal knowledge of young female children is called rape. \u201c A rape upon children under the age of ten years, whether with or without their consent, was made a capital offence as early as the reign of Queen Elizabeth.\u201d p. 590. See also Davis\u2019s Crim. Just. (Heard\u2019s ed.) 673, 668; Bouvier\u2019s Law Diet., Rape (eds. of 1852 and 1883) ; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Sugland, 4 Gray, 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Where a rape upon a female child under the age of ten years is charged, by carnally knowing and abusing her, it is not necessary to aver or prove that the acts were done against her will, or without her consent. The reason is, that, from her tender years, she is held in law to be incapable of giving a valid consent to such acts, and the law conclusively presumes that she did not consent. 3 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 211. \u25a0 The rule has always been so from the earliest times, though the reason has not always been stated in this form.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In this Commonwealth, the statute punishing an assault with intent to commit a rape also includes both phases of the crime of rape; the carnal knowledge and abuse of a young female child, as well as a rape committed upon a grown woman by actual force and violence, and against her will. This is apparent from an examination of the first statute upon the subject. St. 1805, <em>o. </em>97, \u00a7 3. Section 1 provides the same punishment for any man who shall ravish and carnally know any woman by force and against her will, or shall unlawfully and carnally know and abuse any female child under the age of ten years; and for any person present, aiding and consenting in such rape, &amp;c. Here \u201c rape \u201d obviously includes both offences previously described. Section 2 provides for the punishment of accessories \u201cafter any rape committed as aforesaid.\u201d Section 3 provides for the punishment of any man who, \u201c with intent to commit a rape as aforesaid, shall make an assault upon a woman, or female child.\u201d This is perfectly explicit; as is also the St. of 1815, <em>e. </em>86, which increases the punishment for an assault on a female child under the age of ten years, with an intent to commit a rape. The Rev. Sts. <em>e. </em>125, \u00a7 18, provided for the punishment of any person who should ravish and carnally know any female of the age of ten years or more, by force and against her will, or should unlawfully and carnally know and abuse any female child under the age of ten years; and, in \u00a7 19, provided for the punishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>of any person who should \u201c assault any female with intent to commit the crime of rape.\u201d No other provision was made for assault upon a child with intent to carnally know and abuse her, and no mention was made by the commissioners of any intention to change the law, by omitting altogether all provision for this offence. It is apparent that \u00a7 19 was intended to be as comprehensive as the Sts. of 1805, <em>c. </em>97, \u00a7 8, and 1815, <em>c. </em>86, both of which are referred to in the margin; and that the offence of assaulting a young female child with intent unlawfully and carnally to know and abuse her was included under the description of assaulting \u201c any female with intent to commit the crime of rape.\u201d The language of the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>160, \u00a7 27, and of the Pub. Sts. <em>e. </em>202, \u00a7 28, is in substance the same, and bears the same construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">It thus appears that the Legislature intended, by the Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>202, \u00a7 28, to punish, as a criminal offence, an assault upon a female child under the age of ten years, with intent carnally to know and abus\u00e9 her. But it is contended, and there are many decisions elsewhere to support this ground of defence, that the assault is the gravamen of this offence, and that an assault must of necessity be against her will. This argument, however, involves a confusion in the use of the terms \u201c against her will.\u201d Every x\u2019ape involves an assault; and a rape, as well as an assault, must be against the will of the victim. But it has already beexx clearly established ixx this Commonwealth, that \u201cagainst her will\u201d means the same thing as \u201cwithout her consent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Burke, 105 Mass. 376. And accordingly it has beeix held that, if a man has carnal ixxtercourse, using so much force as is necessary, with a woman who is incapable of consenting, by reasoxx of sleep, drunkexxness, stupefaction, unconsciousness, idiocy, helplessness, and sometimes even where the consent of one capable of consexxting is procured by fraud, he may be convicted of rape. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Burke, <em>ubi supra ; Commonwealth </em>v. McDonald, 110 Mass. 405; <em>Regina </em>v. Mayers, 12 Cos C. C. 311; <em>The Queen </em>v. Dee, 14 L. R. Ir. 468. In the last case, which was decided in 1884, it was determined in Ireland, on great consideration, that the consent of a married womaxx, if fraudulently obtained by personation of her husband, is no defence to an iixdictment for rape. There is a full discussion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>by counsel and by the court, of the previous English decisions upon the subject; and the determination is in accordance with the later intimations of English judges. See <em>The Queen </em>v. Flattery, 2 Q. B. D. 410; <em>Regina </em>v. Young, 14 Cox C. C. 114. In cases of assault upon young girls with intent, the English courts, though making a distinction between consent and submission, and holding that mere submission would not amount to a defence, \u2014see <em>The Queen </em>v. <em>Lock, </em>L. R. 2 C. C. 10, and cases there cited, \u2014 did not entirely break away from the earlier decisions, which held that the consent of a young girl would defeat an indictment for such an assault; and at last it was enacted in 1880, by Parliament, in the St. of 43 <em>&amp; </em>44 Yict. <em>e. </em>45, \u00a7 2, that \u201c it shall be no defence to a charge or indictment for an indecent assault on a young person under the age of thirteen to prove that he or she consented to the act of indecency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The difficulty in England appears to have arisen from the phraseology of the early statutes, punishing carnal knowledge and abuse of a young girl, whether by her own consent or without her consent, apparently implying that she might consent thereto. See <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>10 Cox C. C. 114. But there has been no such language in any of the Massachusetts statutes ; and even if there had been, it is more in accordance with the spirit of the law simply to hold a girl under the age of ten years incapable of giving a valid consent, so that the question whether she did or did not give a formal or apparent consent becomes immaterial. If, as all agree, it is immaterial upon a charge of committing the completed act, which includes an assault, no reason but an extremely technical one can be urged why it should not be so upon a charge of assault with intent to commit the completed act. Indeed, to speak of an assault upon her without her consent, with intent to carnally know and abuse her with her consent, seems to involve a contradiction in terms. But when it is once considered that the intention of the law is to declare that a young girl shall be deemed incapable of consenting to such an act to her injury, and that evidence of any consent by her shall be incompetent in defence to an indictment therefor, and that, although she gives a formal and apparent consent, yet in law, as in reality, she gives none, because she does not and cannot take in the meaning of what is done, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>legal difficulty disappears, and the conclusion may properly be reached that the assault is without her consent, and against her will. This principle has been clearly maintained, with reference to kidnapping children, and removing young slaves from the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Nickerson, 5 Allen, 518. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Taylor, 3 Met. 72, 73. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aves, </em>18 Pick. 193,225. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>8 N. H. 550. <em>State </em>v. <em>Farrar, </em>41 N. H. 53.
