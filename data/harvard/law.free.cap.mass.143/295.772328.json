It does not even allege that the -representations are false or malicious. If he has any remedy, which we do not mean to intimate, it is by an action at law. The bill does not state a c\u00e1se within the equity jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
