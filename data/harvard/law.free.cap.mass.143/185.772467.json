Sts. <em>c. </em>151, \u00a7 5. In the Superior Court the case was referred to a master, who found the following facts :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-8\">In October, 1878, the defendant, who was the owner of the whaling barque Clarice of Edgartown, sold to the plaintiff six sixty-fourths of the vessel, and made a contract with him by which the plaintiff was to go, as master of the vessel, on a whaling voyage of forty-two months, for a certain lay. The plaintiff broke his contract by leaving the vessel at St. Helena in March, 1881, and the damage to the defendant in consequence thereof was $800.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-9\">The defendant also sought to recoup the damages sustained by him by reason of the discharge by the master of the first mate, who left the vessel at the same time as the plaintiff. The first mate shipped at Edgartown for the voyage, and signed shipping articles for the same. He had no right, by the terms of his contract, to be discharged at St. Helena, or at any other place, before the termination of the voyage, except by mutual consent; but he was discharged at his own request, at the time when the plaintiff left the barque. He made this request, and obtained his discharge, because the plaintiff left the barque, and for no other reason. The expense to the defendant on account of said discharge was the three months\u2019 extra wages paid the mate on his discharge, amounting to $45, and the bonus and increase of wages paid to the man who was shipped in the mate\u2019s place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>The master ruled, as matter of law, that this was not a damage for which the defendant would be entitled to recoup against the plaintiff\u2019s claim on account of the plaintiff\u2019s breach of said contract; but if, on the foregoing facts, the defendant was entitled to recoup the same, then that his damage therefor was $250.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-4\">The master further found that the wages of the plaintiff as master had been paid ; and that there was due the plaintiff the sum of $848, less the $300 above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-5\">The defendant filed an exception to the report of the master on account of the disallowance of the sum of $250 in recoupment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-6\">At the hearing, before <em>Staples, </em>J., judgment was entered in accordance with the report of the master; and the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-7\"><em>JF.

The defendant contends that the amount of damages sustained by him in consequence of the discharge of the mate of the vessel should, on account of the plaintiff\u2019s breach of his contract, be allowed the defendant, in recoupment against the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">The master\u2019s contract with the owners was distinct and separate from that of the mate\u2019s with the owners. They were not connected, nor were they dependent upon each other. The master could have thrown up his contract, and it would have had no effect upon the mate\u2019s contract. The fact of the master\u2019s leaving the vessel may have remotely contributed to the mate\u2019s leaving. But this is not sufficient. \u201cIn general, the parties are deemed to have contemplated only the damages and interest which the creditor might suffer from the non-performance of the obligation, in respect to the particular thing which is the object of it, a.nd not such as may have been incidentally occasioned thereby.\u201d Pothier on Obligations, (3d Am. ed.) Pt. 1, c. 2, art. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>The discharge of the mate at St. Helena was not caused by the master\u2019s leaving the barque, in any such sense as to render the master liable therefor. The damages to the defendant were not consequent upon the master\u2019s leaving, and were too remote to be allowed in recoupment. The master\u2019s breach of his contract was not the proximate cause of the mate\u2019s breaking his contract, or of his obtaining his discharge. <em>Tutein </em>v.
