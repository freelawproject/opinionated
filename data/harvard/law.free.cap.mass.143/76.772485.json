Slater Manufacturing Company, summoned as trustee of the principal defendant, answered that, at the time of the service of the writ upon it, it had not in its hands or possession any goods, chattels, or moneys of the defendant; and also answered certain interrogatories filed by the plaintiff. The record of the district court in which the action was tried stated that the trustee was charged, and'appealed from that judgment to the Superior Court, and \u201cfiled a bond not approved by said court, with sufficient sureties,\u201d to prosecute the appeal, and pay all such costs as might arise after the appeal within thirty days after judgment. In the Superior Court, the plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, because the \u201c trustee did not file a- bond, with sufficient sureties approved either by the court or plaintiff, according to statute in such cases made and provided.\u201d The justice of said district court thereupon asked leave to amend his record in the \u25a0 case, so that, in place of the words \u201cfiled a bond not approved by said court,\u201d .it should read, \u201c filed a bond not approved or disapproved by said court, as no motion was made by either party requesting approval or disapproval; \u201d and this amendment was allowed. The trustee filed, in the Superior Court, an answer similar to that first filed; and also answered further interrogatories. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-7\">The Superior Court ordered judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant, and discharged the trustee; and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-8\"><em>O.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV1\">The true construction of the record, as amended, of the district court is, that the sureties were sufficient, but that the bond was not approved or disapproved by-said court, as no motion was made by. either party requesting approval or disapproval. This must mean that there was no formal action by the judge, but that the sureties were deemed by him to be sufficient. Construed thus, there was a sufficient compliance with the requirements of the statutes to give jurisdiction to the Superior .Court. Pub.
