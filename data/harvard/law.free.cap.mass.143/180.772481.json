On cross-examination, she was asked if she had not lived in the house of a person named; and she said that she had. The defendant then asked her if said house was not a house of ill-fame; to which she replied, that she did not see what that had to do with the case. The defendant asked for a direct answer to the question. The government objected; and the judge declined to compel the witness to answer the question, stating that she was not bound to criminate herself. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant had <em>no </em>ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b196-9\">At the trial of an indictment against a man and a woman for adultery, S., the husband of the female defendant, who was a witness for the government, testified, on cross-examination, that he had employed .persons to watch his wife. The defendant called as a witness one W., who testified that she had lived in the family of S. for about one year, and had left his employ. The defendants asked her if she had not, during the time she was in the employ of S., been offered money by him if she would watch his wife and tell him what she knew about his wife\u2019s actions. This question was excluded. The defendants also offered to show by this witness, that, on other occasions than that of the alleged offence, S. had accused his wife of similar acts of which she was not guilty. The judge excluded this evidence also. <em>Held, </em>that the defendants had no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-10\">Indictment, against Charles A.

The defendants\u2019 counsel then asked her if said house was not a house of ill-fame; to which she replied, that she did not see what that had to do with the case. The defendants\u2019 counsel asked for a direct answer to the question. The government objected; and the judge declined to compel the witness to answer the question, stating that she was not bound to criminate herself.

Smith had not, during the time she lived in his family, accused his wife of being locked up in a bedroom with the defendant Trider, when such was not the ease. The government objected, and the judge excluded the question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-8\">The defendants offered to show by this witness, that Asahel A. Smith had habitually accused his wife of receiving strange, men in her bedroom during the time the witness Williams lived in his family, when, in fact, such was not the case; but the judge ruled that the evidence was not admissible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-9\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty against both defendants; and they alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-10\"><em>W.

She was excused from answering solely for the reason that she objected to answer a question the answer to which might tend to criminate her. It sufficiently appeared that she declined to answer for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The evidence of the witness Williams had no tendency to contradict the witness Smith, who testified that he had employed persons to watch his wife; and evidence that, on other occasions than that of the alleged offence, he had accused his wife of similar acts of which she was not guilty, was clearly irrelevant, and involved immaterial issues.</p>\n<p id=\"AJlA\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
