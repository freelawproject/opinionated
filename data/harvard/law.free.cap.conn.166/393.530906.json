From the judgment rendered February 11,1971, the defendant appealed to this court. On November 19, 1972, while the present appeal was pending and while he was being transported to the New Haven correctional center, the defendant escaped from the custody of the Connecticut department of corrections and since that date has not been heard from or seen by authorities in this jurisdiction or by counsel representing him on this appeal. In the belief that the fugitive defendant should not be deprived of the availability of counsel while his appeal was still pending before this court, we denied his counsel\u2019s application for permission to withdraw their appearance for him on this pending appeal despite their .representation that they were unable to discuss the appeal with the \u201cabsent appellant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Leslie, </em>165 Conn. 792, 305 A.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">The appeal having been perfected and reached for hearing and it appearing on oral argument that the defendant is still a fugitive whose whereabouts are unknown, we decline to adjudicate his case and direct that the appeal be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>As the United States Supreme Court said in a similar ease, citing <em>Smith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>94 U.S. 97, 24 L. Ed. 32, and <em>Bonahan </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>125 U.S. 692, 8 S. Ct. 1390, 31 L. Ed. 854: \u201cNo persuasive reason exists why this Court should proceed to adjudicate the merits of a criminal case after the convicted defendant who has sought review escapes from the restraints placed upon him pursuant to the conviction. While such an escape does not strip the case of its character as an adjudieable case or controversy, we believe it disentitles the defendant to call upon the resources of the Court for determination of his claims.\u201d <em>Molinaro </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>396 U.S. 365, 366, 90 S.
