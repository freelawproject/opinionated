The plaintiff alleged negligence on the part of the defendant and the defendant pleaded contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant and the plaintiff appealed, claiming error on the part of the court in refusing to set aside the verdict and in the charge as delivered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">We have tested the court\u2019s ruling on the motion to set aside the verdict by an examination of the evidence as printed in the appendices to the briefs. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 718, 721; <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Shiels, Inc., </em>166 Conn. 3, 19, 347 A.2d 102; <em>Moriarty </em>v. <em>Lippe, </em>162 Conn. 371, 374, 294 A.2d 326. We find no error in the court\u2019s ruling. There was evidence from which the jury could reasonably and logically conclude that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">We have tested the assignments of error addressed to the charge to the jury and conclude that, considered as a whole, it fairly presented the case to the jury so that no injustice resulted. <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>166 Conn. 418, 427, 352 A.2d 773; <em>Gosselin </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>166 Conn. 152, 165, 348 A.2d 623; <em>Enlund </em>v. <em>Buske, </em>160 Conn. 327, 331, 278 A.2d 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
