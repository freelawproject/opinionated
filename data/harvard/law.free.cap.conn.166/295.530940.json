After a trial to a jury a verdict was rendered in his favor against only the defendant Perzanowski (hereafter the defendant), who has taken this appeal from the judgment rendered thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">Although the defendant has filed six assignments of error, we find his attacks on the finding, which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>subject to correction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Ms challenge to the court\u2019s charge on the issue of \u201ccontrol\u201d of the driveway to be dispositive of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The finding, as corrected, discloses that substantial and conflicting evidence was introduced by all of the parties to this action relating to the issue of who had \u201ccontrol\u201d of the driveway where the injury was sustained. Such \u201ccontrol\u201d was, of course, a vital issue in the trial of this ease, since liability can be predicated upon negligence in the control and possession of premises, as opposed to mere ownersMp thereof. See <em>Panaroni </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>158 Conn. 92, 97-100, 256 A.2d 246; <em>Ziulkowski </em>v. <em>Kolodziej, </em>119 Conn. 230, 232, 175 A. 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The defendant introduced evidence relating to Ms claim of lack of control and specifically requested a charge on that issue, alerting the court to its presence in the case, but the court denied the request. Subsequent to the court\u2019s charge, the jury requested a clarification of the word \u201ccontrol\u201d and the court, quoting <em>Panaroni </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 98, responded with only the following definition: \u201cThe word \u2018control\u2019 has no legal or techmeal meaMng distinct from that given in its popular acceptation, and refers to the power or authority to manage, superintend, direct or oversee and maintain.\u201d The defendant claims that tMs response was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Although the defendant took no exception to the charge, his written request to charge on the issue of control nevertheless affords a ground of appeal. Practice Book \u00a7 249; <em>Degnan </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>136 Conn. 171, 172, 69 A.2d 642. Nor are we limited to the specific question of whether the defendant\u2019s request to charge should have been granted. Having been informed of a material and important issue by the request, it was the duty of the court to charge correctly on that subject. <em>Mei </em>v. <em>Alterman Transport Lines, Inc., </em>159 Conn. 307, 311, 268 A.2d 639; <em>Seeley </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>49 Conn. 134, 138; see <em>Stavola </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>136 Conn. 670, 682, 73 A.2d 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The test of a charge is whether it is correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury. <em>Amato </em>v. <em>Sawicki, </em>159 Conn. 490, 494, 271 A.2d 80; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a776. \u201cThe primary purpose of the charge is to assist the jury in applying the law correctly to the facts which they might find to be established.\u201d <em>Vita </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>158 Conn. 75, 77, 255 A.2d 848. A charge should be more than a mere statement of legal principles; it should indicate to the jury the application of the law to the facts claimed to have been proved. <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Hartford-Connecticut Trust Co., </em>111 Conn. 313, 315, 149 A. 782; <em>Schiesel </em>v. <em>Poli Realty Co., </em>108 Conn. 115, 124, 142 A. 812. While \u201c[t]he degree to which reference to the evidence may be called for lies largely in the discretion of the court\u201d; <em>Gorham </em>v. <em>Farmington Motor Inn, Inc., </em>159 Conn. 576, 583, 271 A.2d 94; reference to the evidence is required sufficient to guide the jury in their application of the stated law to the evidence before them. <em>Vita </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>supra. These principles apply with particular force to situations such as that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>presented here, where the jury, by its request for clarification, had indicated a degree of confusion concerning the issue of control. See <em>Silvester </em>v. <em>Kerelejza, </em>158 Conn. 433, 436-38, 262 A.2d 157; <em>Bottaro </em>v. <em>Schoenborn, </em>157 Conn. 194, 197, 251 A.2d 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The trial court, in merely quoting a brief portion of the <em>Panaroni </em>definition, failed to relate the definition of control to the claims of the parties, making its definitional response insufficient to guide the jury. In the very case quoted from in the trial court\u2019s response, this court applied the quoted definition to the claimed facts for several pages. See <em>Panaroni </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>158 Conn. 92, 98-100, 256 A.2d 246. Reading the definition, without any such discussion of the factual claims involved, failed sufficiently to instruct the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The defendant assigned error in the court\u2019s refusal to include in the finding sixteen paragraphs of his draft finding, which he claimed to be admitted or undisputed. We find it necessary to add only those paragraphs setting forth the court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s request for a clarification of the word \u201ccontrol\u201d as used by the court in its charge, paragraphs which are clearly not in dispute and are material to the issues involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
