The case was referred to <em>Hon. John B. Thim, </em>state referee, who, exercising the powers of the Superior Court, rendered judgment for the plaintiff. The defendants have appealed from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The defendants have assigned error in the referee\u2019s finding of facts without evidence; in his rulings on evidence; in his overruling of their claims of law; and in his conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The finding<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> discloses the following pertinent facts: The plaintiff was engaged in the deep-well dewatering business and, in conjunction therewith, sold and rented pumps and associated equipment. In the summer of 1966, the defendant Gary began to prepare its bids to obtain contracts for the installation of sanitary sewers in the town of North Haven. Initially the town of North Haven had divided the sewer project into two segments and contractors were invited to bid on either or both, designated as contracts 100-8 and 100-9. The proposed project called for the sewer pipe to be laid in dry trenches, requiring dewatering of the area. Following discussions with Gary, the plaintiff pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>pared a proposal for the predewatering of the project area, the cost of which was to be incorporated by Gary in its bids. Upon the acceptance of the plaintiff\u2019s proposal by Gary, the parties entered into a subcontract agreement dated April 18, 1967, with an addendum dated May 3, 1967.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter Gary submitted its bids for proposed contracts 100-8 and 100-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The town of North Haven did not accept any of the submitted bids. Instead it modified the sewer project by redesignating some of the streets on which sewers were to be installed, combined the previously proposed contracts into a single contract, labeled it 100-9 and invited bids. Gary\u2019s bid on the new contract 100-9 was accepted by the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Gary did not enter into a new subcontract with the plaintiff;. Both parties understood that their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>rights and obligations were governed by the terms of the subcontract of April 18, 1967, and the addendum. From June 6, 1967, to November 7, 1967, the plaintiff performed well-drilling operations and rented pumps and equipment to Gary pursuant to the terms of the subcontract and addendum. The plaintiff rendered monthly bills in accordance with the charges fixed in the subcontract for wells drilled and equipment rented. Gary never disputed the accuracy or reasonableness of those bills, and made three partial payments thereon. When G-ary failed to make further payments, the plaintiff terminated its operations and removed its equipment from the sewer project site.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>After the plaintiff commenced this action, the defendants filed two affirmative defenses and a counterclaim, which, among other things, alleged that the plaintiff failed to perform according to the terms of the subcontract agreement and therefore breached its agreement with Gary. The counterclaim specifically alleged the existence of the subcontract agreement of April 18, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The referee reached the following conclusions: (1) the plaintiff brought the proper cause of action in seeking recovery on the subcontract; (2) the plaintiff fully performed its contractual obligations; (3) the plaintiff was justified in terminating its subcontract with Gary; and (4) the defendants failed to establish the allegations of their special defenses and counterclaim. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff in the amount of $60,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Gary\u2019s principal claim is that the referee erred in concluding that the plaintiff had brought the proper cause of action. Gary argues that the subcontract of April 18, 1967, relates by its terms to contract proposals 100-8 and 100-9 only, and that when those contracts were not subsequently awarded to Gary, the subcontract became unenforceable and void. Although Gary concedes that the plaintiff performed work on the sewer project, it maintains that the work was not done under contracts 100-8 and 100-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">\u201cThe intention of the parties manifested by their words and acts is essential to determine whether a contract was entered into and what its terms were. <em>Nutmeg State </em>Machine[ry] <em>Corporation </em>v. <em>Shuford, </em>129 Conn. 659, 661, 30 A.2d 911. This determination requires a finding of mutuality of obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>tion.\u201d <em>Hess </em>v. <em>Dumouchel Paper Co., </em>154 Conn. 343, 347, 225 A.2d 797. Intention is an inference of fact, and the conclusion is not reviewable unless it was one which the trier could not reasonably make. <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>157 Conn. 548, 557, 254 A.2d 898; <em>Grote </em>v. <em>A. C. Hine Co., </em>148 Conn. 283, 286-87, 170 A.2d 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The inclusion of .a reference to contracts 100-8 and 100-9 in the subcontract did not automatically cause its termination when the contract subsequently awarded Gary was labeled 100-9. The subcontract required the plaintiff to drill wells and rent equipment when and where Gary directed. The parties agreed to a specific price per vertical foot drilled and to a specific schedule of rental rates for equipment leased. There was no need to consult contracts 100-8 and 100-9 for detailed plans and specifications since the mutual obligations of the parties were contained within the four corners of the subcontract and its addendum. The written words of the parties did not manifest any intent to abandon their subcontract merely because the sewer project was modified and combined under the single label 100-9. This is not a case, as claimed by Gary, in which \u201csubstantial changes\u201d were subsequently made to incomplete documents incorporated into the contract by reference, as in <em>Randolph Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Kings East Corporation, </em>165 Conn. 269, 275, 334 A.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The subsequent acts of the parties are also evidence of their intent. When the plaintiff began work on the sewer project, it did so under the direction of Gary. The plaintiff performed according to the terms of the subcontract and rendered monthly bills thereunder. Gary accepted those bills without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>objection and made partial payments. Moreover, the defendants\u2019 pleadings alleged the existence of the subcontract agreement of April 18, 1967. Those pleadings are inconsistent with their present claim and could properly be considered by the trier on the question of intent. See <em>Haaser </em>v. <em>A. C. Lehmann Co., </em>130 Conn. 219, 222, 33 A.2d 135. Gary\u2019s treasurer, Vincent Giordano, summed it up when he was asked on direct examination, \u201cDid you draw a new contract with Hydro-Hercules?\u201d He answered, \u201cI don\u2019t believe we did. I think we just went along on that one [the subcontract of April 18].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The conclusions reached by the trial court are tested by the finding and must stand unless they are legally or logically inconsistent with the facts found or unless they involve the application of some erroneous rule of law material to the case. <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Chatfield, </em>166 Conn. 76, 80, 347 A.2d 58. The referee\u2019s finding that \u201cthe parties understood that the relationship between them was governed by plaintiff\u2019s Exhibits G and H [Subcontract of April 18, 1967, and addendum of May 3, 1967]\u201d is amply supported by the subordinate facts, and is more than sufficient to support the conclusion that the parties entered into a valid and enforceable subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The referee correctly rejected Gary\u2019s contention that recovery could be had only on an implied contract or in quantum meruit. Since Gary contracted for performance at an agreed unit price and at an agreed rental for equipment leased, the plaintiff was not required to prove the reasonable value of its services. Where the plaintiff performs according to the contract, he is entitled to recover the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>unpaid contract price. <em>Strimiska </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>158 Conn. 179, 187, 257 A.2d 814; 11 Williston, Contracts (3d Rev. Ed.) \u00a7 1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The defendants have assigned error in the finding by the referee that \u201c[t]he total fair and reasonable charges for repairs to leased equipment because of negligence was $2,983.64.\u201d The defendants claim that \u201cthere was a total absence of any evidence to justify a finding that the alleged repairs resulted from negligence.\u201d This assignment of error has merit. We find no evidence in the appendix to the plaintiff\u2019s brief which would support a finding that the alleged repairs were necessitated by Uary\u2019s negligence. Moreover, there is no claim in the complaint for the cost of repairs to leased equipment damaged by negligence. The referee erred in making this finding and award.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The final assignment of error relating to rulings on evidence has been considered and found to lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">There is error only in the amount of damages; the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment as on file except as modified in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-7\">A finding of material fact may be attacked as not supported by the evidence. The validity of such a claim is tested by the evidence printed in the appendices to the brief. Practice Book \u00a7 718; <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Chatfield, </em>166 Conn. 76, 77 n.1, 347 A.2d 58. An examination of the plaintiff\u2019s printed appendix discloses that fifteen of the sixteen challenged findings are reasonably supported by the evidence. The remaining challenged finding relates to the issue of damages and is considered in the body of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\"> \u201cGARY EXCAVATING, INC.
