The court found the issues for the defendants, and from a judgment rendered thereon the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">The following facts are not in dispute: The plaintiff, the James J. F. Loughlin Agency, Inc., for more than fifteen years has conducted an insurance business on the second floor of the premises at 842 Farmington Avenue, West Hartford. These premises are located in an area designated as a central business dictrict by \u00a7 17.2.11 (b) of the West Hart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>ford zoning ordinance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The West Hartford zoning regulations were enacted under authority granted by a special act of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In 1958, the plaintiff erected and placed an illuminated sign on the outside of the office building which it occupied. The sign is six feet long and three feet high, projects from the face of the building and is held in place by a system of brackets or struts. The sign does not conform to the requirement of \u00a7 17.3.42 (a) of the zoning ordinance that \u201c[n]o sign shall project more than 18 inches from the face of a structure.\u201d In all other respects, however, the sign conforms as a permitted structure or use in a central business district. Section 17.3.90 of the ordinance concerns nonconforming uses and structures and \u00a7 17.3.91 provides for the continuance of nonconforming uses and structures existing at the enactment of the zoning regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In 1965, the town of West Hartford enacted comprehensive sign regulations, designated as \u00a7\u00a7 17.3.40\u201417.3.49 of its zoning ordinance. The portion of \u00a7 17.3.45 that may apply to the present ease provided that signs existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance, or any amendment thereto, which did not conform to the requirement of subsection 17.3.42 (a) would be allowed to continue as a nonconforming use, but should be made to conform within five years from October 10, 1965. On October 28, 1969, the last sentence of \u00a7 17.3.45 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>amended to read: \u201cA sign constituting a nonconforming use shall not be subject to the provisions of \u00a7 17.3.90 of this Zoning Ordinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">In February of 1971, the plaintiff was notified by the building inspector, acting as the zoning enforcement officer, that its sign was in violation of \u00a7 17.3.42 (a) in that it projected more than \u201c18 inches\u201d from the face of the structure. The plaintiff requested a variance of the ordinance, which the zoning board of appeals denied in April, 1971. An appeal was taken to the Court of Common Pleas and, following a judgment dismissing the appeal, the plaintiff sought certification by petition to this court. The petition was denied on July 12, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The plaintiff, on July 21, 1972, instituted the present action in the Court of Common Pleas against the town and its zoning enforcement officer, seeking .an injunction restraining the defendants from interfering with or removing the sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Based on these facts, the court reached the following conclusions: The regulation or prohibition of the use of signs is within the reasonable exercise of the police power of the town\u2019s legislative body under its charter provisions. Section 17.3.45 of the zoning ordinance is legal and constitutionally valid. That section, requiring a nonconforming use to conform or be terminated within a specified period of five years, is not in violation of the due process clause and equal protection provisions of the United States and Connecticut constitutions. The section does not violate the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 8-2<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and its provisions are within the authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>granted the defendant town under the enabling act granting it zoning authority. And, finally, the section is not confiscatory, but is a legitimate exercise of legislative power to eliminate nonconforming uses and secure the public safety and general welfare of the community as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The plaintiff: assigns error in the conclusions reached by the court and in the court\u2019s overruling of its claims of law. The main thrust of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, which is dispositive of this controversy, lies in its claim that General Statutes \u00a7 8-2, as amended in 1959, providing for the continuance of nonconforming uses and structures, includes the right to maintain the challenged sign as presently displayed. Neither party contends that there is a conflict between General Statutes \u00a7 8-2, as amended in 1959, and \u00a7 17.3.91 of the zoning ordinance. Both of these enactments clearly permit the continuance of a nonconforming use or structure existing at the time of the adoption of the zoning ordinance. Similarly, it is admitted that the plaintiff\u2019s sign is a nonconforming use or structure. The contention centers on the effect of \u00a7 17.3.45 of the zoning ordinance, adopted October 28, 1969, wherein signs not conforming with the requirements of subsection 17.3.42 (a) were required to conform within five years from October 10, 1965.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>The defendants contend that the power to enact \u00a7 17.3.45 flows from police power conferred upon the town of West Hartford to legislate \u201cfor the welfare, public health .and safety of its inhabitants as a whole.\u201d In 1954, a special act of the legislature, entitled \u201cAn act concerning a revised charter for the town of West Hartford,\u201d conferred power to regulate through zoning. 28 Spec. Acts 759, No. 562, c. 12, \u00a7 3. That act provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cthe [town] council, as zoning authority, may regulate . . . the height, size and location of advertising signs . . . within the limits of the town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">As the plaintiff points out, however, \u00a7 8-2 of the General Statutes authorizes the zoning commission of each city, town or borough \u201cto regulate, within the limits of such municipality . . . the height, size and location of advertising signs and billboards.\u201d The plaintiff stresses the fact that in 1959 this statute was .amended by Public Act No. 661 to state that \u201c[s]uch regulations shall not prohibit the continuance of any nonconforming use, building or structure existing ,at the time of the adoption of such regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We must thus decide whether General Statutes \u00a7 8-2, as amended in 1959 by a public act, prevails over \u00a7 17.3.45, enacted pursuant to a special act of 1954. The trial court concluded that the provisions under \u00a7 17.3.45 do not violate the provisions of \u00a7 8-2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>of the General Statutes as amended and are within the authority granted the defendant town under the enabling act granting it zoning authority. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">A town, acting by its town council, can exercise only the powers which are expressly granted to it by statute or such as are necessary to enable it to discharge the duties and carry out the objects and purposes of its creation. <em>Aunt Hack Ridge Estates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>160 Conn. 109, 115, 273 A.2d 880; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>152 Conn. 312, 314, 206 A.2d 428. Being a creature of the state, the defendant town has no inherent power to modify a legislative act. <em>Lacava </em>v. <em>Carfi, </em>140 Conn. 517, 520, 101 A.2d 795; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>111 Conn. 667, 673, 151 A. 268; <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>104 Conn. 238, 252, 132 A. 690. \u201cWhere an earlier statute is special, only in the sense that it applies to a single case of which there may be many in the state, and the later one is general in its operation and applies to all such cases, then the earlier one is repealed by the later.\u201d <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Hartford Theological Seminary, </em>66 Conn. 475, 485, 34 A. 483. \u201cWhen provisions of the general statutes (1941) cover the same field as those of special law (1925) the former prevail. <em>Hutchison </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>129 Conn. 329, 332, 27 A.2d 803.\u201d <em>Willard </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>135 Conn. 303, 306, 63 A.2d 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">We must therefore conclude that the 1959 amendment to \u00a7 8-2 regarding nonconforming uses prevails over \u00a7 17.3.45 of the town zoning ordinance adopted pursuant to 28 Special Acts 759, No. 562, e. 12, \u00a7 3. Accordingly, the plaintiff; is not bound by the restriction which the defendant town seeks to impose upon the use of its sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The other .assignments of error warrant no discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the plaintiff with such injunctive relief as will restrain the defendants from enforcing against the plaintiff \u00a7 17.3.45 of the West Hartford zoning ordinance, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\"> The purpose of the central business district as stated, in part, in \u00a7 17.2.11 (b), \u201cis to encourage the concentration of a wide variety of stores, services and activities serving the entire Town as major shopping and community centers. . . . The Central Business Districts are those which comprise the older business districts, characterized by small and diverse property ownership.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b328-9\"> Section 8-2 of the General Statutes permits the zoning commission of each city, town or borough to \u201cregulate the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration or use of buildings or structures and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>use of land.\u201d In 1959, under Public Act No. 661, this statute was amended, in part, to include the following language: \u201cSuch regulations shall not prohibit the continuance of any nonconforming use, building or structure existing at the time of the adoption of such regulations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\"> In its use of this five-year limitation regarding nonconformity of signs, the West Hartford ordinance under attack embodies what has come to be known as the amortization method. Such a method requires nonconforming uses to be terminated at the expiration of a specified length of time. See, for example, Katarincic, \u201cElimination of Non-Conforming Uses, Buildings, and Structures by Amortization-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Concept versus Law,\u201d 2 Duquesne L.

App. 2d 442, 455, 274 P.2d 34; Dennis et al., \u201cThe Connecticut Law of Zoning,\u201d (Part B), 41 Conn. B.J. 453, 520-27. It has been recommended that Connecticut enact a statutory provision enabling municipalities to amortize nonconforming uses.
