Johnson, as an \u201camended writ, summons and complaint duly and timely served on or before January 22, 1969.\u201d Both defendants filed pleas in abatement alleging that the purported amendment constituted an appeal taken later than fifteen days after the action of the zoning board of appeals in violation of \u00a7 8-8 of the General Statutes. Prom a judgment sustaining the pleas in abatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>of both defendants, the plaintiff has appealed to this eonrt. He assigns error to the determination of the court <em>(DeVita, </em>J.) that the papers actually served on January 20, 1969, constituted an appeal taken after the fifteen-day appeal period, and not an amendment. In view of the disposition of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, we find it unnecessary to discuss the issues raised by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
