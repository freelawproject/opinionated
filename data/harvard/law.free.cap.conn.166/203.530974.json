The state has filed with this court a motion to strike improper matter from that draft finding and moved for an order directing the defendant to file a substituted draft finding prepared in compliance with the rules of practice in this court.

In the event that present court-appointed counsel for the defendant is unable or unwilling to comply with that directive, then the trial court is directed to revoke his appointment and appoint in Ms stead a public defender who can and will do so.
