At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion, the plaintiff, in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 380 of the Practice Book, submitted a financial affidavit which purported to set forth his assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The affidavit contained false information. It indicated that the plaintiff\u2019s annual income was approximately $13,000. In subsequent deposition proceedings, it was determined that in fact his income for the period reported was, in fact, in excess of $24,000, and that he had not disclosed as an asset a $5000 interest in a limited partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">What a husband can afford to pay for support and alimony pendente lite is a material considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>tion in the court\u2019s determination as to what is a proper order. <em>England </em>v. England, 138 Conn. 410, 415, 85 A.2d 483. A court is entitled to rely upon the truth and accuracy of sworn statements required by \u00a7 380 of the Practice Book, and a misrepresentation of assets and income is a serious and intolerable dereliction on the part of the affiant which goes to the very heart of the judicial proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">While the present appeal arises from a ruling on a motion to modify the original order which was predicated upon the false information contained in the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, justice to the defendant requires that she have a new and full hearing on her original motion for alimony and support, untainted by the plaintiff\u2019s misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">There is error, the ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion to modify the order of temporary alimony and support is set aside, and the case is remanded for a new and full hearing on the merits of the motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
