J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB\">The plaintiffs have appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court dismissing their appeal from a finding and final order of the defendant insurance commissioner<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the state of Connecticut approving an application by the defendant International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, hereinafter referred to as ITT, to make an exchange offer for the stock of the defendant Hartford Fire Insurance Company, hereinafter referred to as Hartford Fire, pursuant to the then recently enacted provisions of Public Act No. 444 of the 1969 session, now codified as \u00a7\u00a7 38-39a through 38-39\u00dc of the General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">The court made a limited finding confined to the issue of aggrievement. From this the following facts appear: The plaintiff Ralph Nader is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>author, lecturer and advocate of consumer interests, who resides in the District of Columbia, although he is a member of the bar and a domiciliary of Connecticut. The plaintiff Reuben Robertson who is an attorney and associate of the plaintiff Ralph Nader and who likewise resides in the District of Columbia, has been, since prior to December 22, 1969 (the exchange offer application date), the holder of a basic homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued by the defendant Hartford Fire in the amount of $35,000, for which the premium is approximately $200 per three-year term. The plaintiff Peter Cooper is a resident of Connecticut and has been a shareholder of ITT since prior to December 22, 1969. The plaintiff Margaret Curtin is a resident of Connecticut who, from prior to December 22, 1969, had been a shareholder of the defendant Hartford Fire. On October 11, 1973, the defendant ITT, a Delaware corporation with its principal headquarters in New York .and qualified to do business in Connecticut, and the defendant Hartford Fire, a Connecticut corporation specially chartered to engage in the business of insurance, moved to dismiss the appeal of the plaintiff Margaret Curtin, averring that her justiciable interest in the litigation terminated on April 23, 1973, when she exchanged all her shares of Hartford Fire for ITT stock, pursuant to the exchange offer which is the subject matter of this dispute. This court denied that motion without prejudice to argument at the time of the appeal of the issue raised by the motion. <em>Nader </em>v. Altermatt, 165 Conn. 818, 310 A.2d 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">On July 23, 1969, the defendants ITT and Hartford Fire sought the approval of the insurance commissioner for a proposed plan and agreement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>merger. After a public hearing, however, approval of the plan was denied by the commissioner\u2019s finding and order dated December 13, 1969, wherein the commissioner expressed dissatisfaction with various aspects of the proposal and stated that the proper method for effectuating an affiliation between the companies was by exchange offer pursuant to Public Act No. 444, which had become law upon its passage on June 11, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">On December 22, 1969, ITT submitted an application for a proposed tender offer whereby shares of ITT series N convertible preferred stock would be offered on a stated exchange ratio for common stock of Hartford Fire. Although the financial terms of the plan of the merger and exchange offer were substantially the same, the exchange offer proposal gave each Hartford Fire shareholder the unrestricted option to accept or reject the ITT stock, whereas, under the earlier proposed plan of merger, dissenting shareholders would have been left to their statutory rights of appraisal. Furthermore, certain executive stock options, which the commissioner had previously found objectionable, had been voluntarily relinquished by the corporate officers involved. Approximately 99 percent of the common stock of Hartford Fire was tendered to ITT under this exchange offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">ITT\u2019s application for the acquisition of a domestic insurance company was the first to be filed under the new law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which required an information state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>ment to be filed with the commissioner, sent to the target insurance company and disseminated by the insurance company to its stockholders within thirty days of its receipt by the target company and upon approval by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The commissioner authorized the dissemination of the tender offer statement, which included ten categories of information. The statement and a notice of public hearing were mailed on January 18, 1970, to each Hartford Fire shareholder of record as of December 31, 1969. Notices of the public hearing were published with the requisite frequency in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Hartford Courant and the Hartford Times.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">At the public hearings held by the commissioner between March 10 .and March 12, 1970, ITT pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>sented twenty-six exhibits and the testimony of fifteen witnesses including executives of ITT and Hartford Fire, executives of ITT subsidiaries and independent financial and insurance analysts. Although interested persons and members of the public were afforded the opportunity to make statements, to present evidence including testimony, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses, none of the plaintiffs appeared or otherwise participated in the public hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 brief discloses that after the conclusion of the public hearings, Nader met privately with the insurance commissioner and subsequently submitted statements, information and papers in the nature of a brief in opposition to the ITT application.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The commissioner issued a finding and final order on May 23, 1970, which found that ITT\u2019s application satisfied each of the five substantive criteria required under the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nader and Robertson filed a petition for a rehearing which was denied by the commissioner on May 28,1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>The plaintiffs sought a review de novo in the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 38-39k of the General Statutes,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which permits an appeal and judicial review to \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by any regulation, order or other action of the commissioner\u201d and further provides: \u201cThe court shall conduct its review without a jury and by trial de novo, except if all parties so stipulate, the review shall be confined to the record.\u201d The parties refused to stipulate and the court proceeded with a hearing at the conclusion of which it rendered judgment dismissing the appeal. On the appeal to this court from that judgment, the trial court filed a limited finding confined to the issue of aggrievement.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The decisive issue for our consideration on this appeal is whether the trial court was in error in concluding that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that they were aggrieved persons within the intendment of the provisions of \u00a7 38-39k (a) of the General Statutes and, accordingly, lacked standing to appeal from the May 23, 1970, finding and final order of the insurance commissioner. We conclude that the court was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The fundamental test by which the status of aggrievement for purposes of qualifying to take an appeal from an administrative order or regulation is determined encompasses a well-settled twofold determination. First, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific, personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been/specially and injuriously affected by the decision. <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>165 Conn. 687, 700, 345 A.2d 563; <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Planning Board, </em>159 Conn. 1, 13, 266 A.2d 396; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, 156 </em>Conn. 622, 623, 238 A.2d 413; <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Town Planning &amp; Zoning Commision, </em>156 Conn. 505, 507-508, 242 A.2d 705; <em>Gregorio </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 422, 425-26, 232 A.2d 330; <em>I.

The United States Supreme Court recently stated that while an organization interested in the problem of environmental or consumer protection may represent its members who are injured by federal administrative action, \u201ca mere \u2018interest in a problem,\u2019 no matter how long standing the interest and no matter how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>qualified the organization is in evaluating the problem, is not sufficient by itself to render the organization \u2018adversely affected\u2019 or \u2018aggrieved\u2019 within the meaning of the APA.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>supra, 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Appeals to the courts from decisions of administrative officers exist only under statutory authority. <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Planning Board, </em>supra; <em>Bardes </em>v. <em>Zoning Board, </em>141 Conn. 317, 318, 106 A.2d 160; <em>Long </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>133 Conn. 248, 252, 50 A.2d 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">As we recently stated in <em>Hartford Kosher Caterers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gazda, </em>165 Conn. 478, 484, 338 A.2d 497, \u201c[t]he concept of standing as presented here by the question of aggrievement is a practical and functional one designed to assure that only those with a genuine and legitimate issue can appeal an order.\u201d The determination of aggrievement is a question of fact for the trial court, and the plaintiff has the burden of proving that fact. <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>supra; <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>158 Conn. 497, 503, 264 A.2d 566; <em>Foran </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>158 Conn. 331, 340, 260 A.2d 609; <em>Hulbert </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>158 Conn. 187, 195, 257 A.2d 810; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>156 Conn. 622, 624, 238 A.2d 413; <em>I.

It was the function of the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>to determine as to each plaintiff, first, whether the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations if they should be proved would constitute aggrievement as a matter of law, and, second, if as a matter of law they would constitute aggrievement, then whether each plaintiff proved the truth of his allegations. The conclusions reached by the trial court cannot be disturbed on appeal unless the subordinate facts do not support them. <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra; <em>Hickey </em>v. <em>New London, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">As to the plaintiff Nader, the court found: (1) \u201cNo evidence was presented that Ralph Nader has any \u2018special interest\u2019 in these proceedings.\u201d (2) \u201cNo evidence was presented on behalf of the plaintiff Ralph Nader that he had suffered or might subsequently suffer any loss or injury as the result of the Commissioner\u2019s approval of the exchange offer.\u201d (3) \u201cNo evidence was presented that Ralph Nader had any special knowledge of, or responsibility for, the insurance industry.\u201d (4) \u201cRalph Nader professed concern for obedience to law and the just disposition of every judicial or administrative proceeding.\u201d Although the plaintiffs attacked the first and third of these findings as to the lack of evidence, they printed no evidence in the appendix to their brief to indicate that the court was in error in finding a complete lack of evidence. They did attack the court\u2019s second specific finding that Nader presented no evidence that he had suffered or might subsequently suffer any loss or injury as a result of the commissioner\u2019s decision but only on the ground that that finding was \u201cin language of doubtful meaning so that its real significance may not appear.\u201d We find no merit to this contention and no error in the court\u2019s conclusion that Nader failed to prove aggrievement.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The appeal of the plaintiff Cnrtin requires hut brief comment. Not only does it appear that the court correctly concluded that she had failed to prove aggrievement but it further appears that subsequent to the judgment of the trial court and during the pendency of this appeal she tendered her shares of Hartford Fire for ITT series N stock pursuant to the exchange offer approved by the commissioner. The appeal is moot as to her. <em>Southbury </em>v. <em>American Builders, Inc., </em>162 Conn. 633, 634, 295 A.2d 566; 4 Am. Jur. 2d, Appeal and Error, \u00a7 179; see <em>Braasch </em>v. <em>Mandel, </em>40 Del. Ch. 12, 172 A.2d 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Cooper\u2019s sole alleged bases were (1) a claim that the commissioner failed adequately to protect the public interest \u201cby preventing the takeover of a domestic insurance company by outside financial interests which cannot be expected to maintain the same or as high a level of civic concern and support\u201d; and (2) a claim that as a shareholder of ITT he is aggrieved by the alleged failure of the commissioner to protect his \u201cinterests by enforcement and application of the procedural and substantive provisions of Public Act No. 444.\u201d As to Cooper\u2019s allegations of aggrievement, the court made findings, which have not been attacked by the plaintiffs, that (1) Cooper did not participate in the proceedings before the insurance commissioner; (2) Cooper, although a party plaintiff, did not even appear or testify at the trial of this action from which he has appealed; and (3) he signed a proxy form which authorized the voting of his ITT shares in favor of the earlier plan of merger, the terms of which were substantially identical to the second plan which was approved by the commissioner. The court concluded that \u201c[t]he plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Peter B. Cooper, does not have any \u2018special interest\u2019 in these proceedings, is not aggrieved within the meaning of Gen. Stat. \u00a7 38-39k (a), and is without standing to maintain this appeal.\u201d We find no error in these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">We note in passing that before the trial of this case ITT and Hartford Fire jointly filed a demurrer and a motion to erase the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, claiming that the plaintiffs had \u201cfailed to allege sufficient facts to show that they are aggrieved parties within the meaning of \u00a7 11 of Public Act No. 444.\u201d In its memorandum of decision denying the motion to erase, the court <em>(Rubinow, </em>J.) found that as to Cooper the complaint was sufficiently broad to encompass a possible claim and proof at trial that Cooper\u2019s equity as a shareholder of ITT \u201cmay be \u2018diluted\u2019 \u201d by virtue of the share for share exchange of ITT series N convertible preferred stock for Hartford Fire stock, citing <em>Allegheny Corporation </em>v. <em>Breswick &amp; Co., </em>353 U.S. 151, 77 S. Ct. 763, 1 L. Ed. 2d 726. As we have noted, Cooper neither testified nor even appeared at the trial of this appeal and despite the suggestion in the court\u2019s preliminary ruling on the motion to erase that Cooper might at the trial be able to prove aggrievement on the basis of a claim that his stockholder\u2019s equity might be diluted, it nowhere appears that Cooper in fact ever made such a claim, much less that he introduced any evidence to prove it. The record contains no suggestion that such a claim was ever advanced by him. There is no reference to such a claim on his behalf in the draft finding, the finding, or the assignments of error. There is not a scintilla of evidence of such a claim in the appendix to the plaintiffs\u2019 brief, nor is any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>claim mentioned in the plaintiffs\u2019 brief itself, nor was it advanced in argument.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">We have already noted Robertson\u2019s general allegations of aggrievement including his status as a policyholder of Hartford Fire. The trial court\u2019s findings as to what evidence Robertson produced to prove his allegations are contained in three paragraphs of the court\u2019s finding: (1) \u201cNo evidence was presented that Reuben Robertson has any \u2018special interest\u2019 in these proceedings.\u201d (2) \u201cThe only evidence offered of Reuben Robertson\u2019s alleged aggrievement is his own speculation that, as a result of the exchange offer, Hartford Fire might in the future cease to offer for sale homeowners insurance similar to that now held by him.\u201d (3) \u201cRobertson also speculated, as a basis for his claim of aggrievement, that Hartford Fire might cease to offer homeowner\u2019s insurance for sale on other than a group, or \u2018mass merchandising,\u2019 basis.\u201d Significantly, the plaintiffs did not attack the latter two findings of the court and although they did attack the first finding they printed no evidence in the appendix to their brief which would disclose that the court\u2019s finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>as to the lack of evidence was erroneous. Nor did the plaintiffs assign error to the court\u2019s final finding as to Robertson: \u201cThere is no evidence in the record that indicates a reasonable probability, or even possibility, that Hartford Fire will in the foreseeable future eliminate or reduce the amounts of homeowner\u2019s or other personal lines of insurance made available for purchase by individuals unaffiliated with any program of mass merchandising.\u201d On the basis of these findings the trial court concluded: \u201cThe plaintiff, Reuben Robertson, does</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">not have any \u2018special interest\u2019 in these proceedings, is not aggrieved within the meaning of Gfen. Stat. \u00a7 38-39k (a), and is without status to maintain this appeal\u201d and \u201c[n]o credible evidence was presented to support any claim that the conditions included in paragraph 2 of the Commissioner\u2019s Finding and Final Order adversely affected in any way the interests of the policyholders or shareholders of Hartford Fire.\u201d We find no error in these conclusions of the court. Mere generalizations and fears are not sufficient to establish aggrievement. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>156 Conn. 505, 508, 242 A.2d 705; <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>150 Conn. 696, 698, 187 A.2d 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">As we have previously stated in this opinion, it is well-settled law that the question of aggrievement is a jurisdictional one and claims of aggrievement present an issue of fact for the determination of the trial court with the burden of proving aggrievement resting upon the plaintiffs who have alleged it. Neither the size of the corporations involved nor the publicity attendant on the decision of the insurance commissioner nor the prominence of the named plaintiff justifies a departure from established legal principles or a disregard of settled requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>as to burden of proof, submission of evidence, and the preservation of claimed errors by assignment supported by appropriate briefing, with such supplemental appendices as the case requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We find no error in the conclusion of the trial court that the plaintiffs failed to prove the aggrievement which the legislature by the provisions of \u00a7 38-39k (a) of the General Statutes has expressly prescribed as a condition precedent to the prosecution of their appeal. In view of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to discuss the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In this opinion Shapiro, Loiselle and MacDonald, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-10\">At the commencement of this appeal, the then insurance commissioner, William E. Cotter, was named as a party defendant in his oficial capacity. He resigned as commissioner on September 18, 1970, and his successor, Eobert F. ClafEey, was substituted as a party defendant. When Paul B. Altermatt succeeded ClafEey as insurance commissioner he, in turn, on April 2, 1971, was substituted as a party defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 38-39b. acquisition of control of DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANIES LIMITED.

From all that appears, it may well be that Cooper\u2019s ITT shares were in fact voted in favor of the issuance of the series N shares. In any event, if his rights as a stockholder in ITT were in any way illegally prejudiced by the issuance of the series N shares, his proper remedy was by a shareholders\u2019 action against ITT, a Delaware corporation, not by an appeal to the insurance commissioner of Connecticut, who had no jurisdiction to approve or disapprove the issuance of stock by a Delaware corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b80-8\">Bogdanski, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB8\">(dissenting). I respectfully dissent. I agree that the plaintiff Ralph Nader failed to show personal aggrievement and that the plaintiff Margaret Curtin\u2019s appeal became moot when she exchanged her Hartford Fire stock for ITT stock pursuant to the exchange offer approved by the insurance commissioner. But I believe that the plaintiffs Peter Cooper and Reuben Robertson are \u201caggrieved\u201d by the order of the insurance commissioner as that term has traditionally been construed by this court. The plaintiff Cooper, as a common stockholder of ITT, claims to be aggrieved by the commissioner\u2019s order because the convertibility of the preferred stock which ITT exchanged for Hartford Fire stock threatened the \u201cdilution\u201d of his common stock equity. The plaintiff Robertson claims to be aggrieved because the insurance commissioner approved the exchange offer without protecting his interests as a Hartford Fire policy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>holder as required by the statute governing acquisitions of domestic insurance companies. He asserts that ITT failed to comply with self-disclosure requirements, and that conditions imposed by the commissioner for the benefit of Hartford Fire policyholders on the use of Hartford Fire funds were inappropriate and unenforceable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">In 1969, the G eneral Assembly enacted Public Act No. 444 (General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38-39a through <em>38-39V) </em>in response to the threat of a take-over of the domestic insurance industry by out-of-state conglomerates. The legislature feared that foreign corporations would \u201craid\u201d the attractive cash reserves of acquired domestic insurance companies, weaken their stability and even remove them from the state, to the detriment of policyholders, securityholders, and the general public. See Finding and Final Order Entered by the Insurance Commssioner, May 23, 1970; Hearings before Joint Standing Committee on Insurance, 1969 Sess., Pt. 1, pp. 17-22; 13 S. Proc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>1969 Sess., Pt. 4, pp. 1975-76; 13 H.R. Proe., 1969 Sess., Pt. 8, pp. 3847-49. Representative Genovesi, for example, referred to a recent take-over in which. \u201c[m]illions of dollars of policyholders\u2019 surplus was raided hy the conglomerate.\u201d 13 H.R. Proe., 1969 Sess., Pt. 8, p. 3849. Accordingly, the legislature enacted a statute requiring prior approval hy the insurance commissioner of any insurance company acquisitions. Public Act 1969, No. 444 directs him to approve an acquisition only upon a finding that the acquisition would not prevent the insurance company from continuing to write the lines of insurance for which it was licensed, that the interests of policyholders and securityholders of the insurance company would be protected, and that the acquisition would serve the public interest. General Statutes \u00a7 38-39d (b). \u201cAny person aggrieved\u201d by the commissioner\u2019s approval of an acquisition may appeal to the Superior Court in Hartford County. \u00a7 38-39k (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u201cAggrievement\u201d is the standard jurisdictional prerequisite to an appeal from any administrative agency decision. The requirement simply means that the decision must have an actual adverse effect on a legitimate personal interest of the appellant. See, in addition to the cases cited in the majority opinion, <em>Sea Beach Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>164 Conn. 90, 93-94, 318 A.2d 115; 3 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 22.18; 2 Cooper, State Administrative Law, pp. 535-41. Although unsupported \u201cgeneralizations and fears are not enough\u201d to demonstrate aggrievement; <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>150 Conn. 696, 698, 187 A.2d 239; aggrievement is established if \u201cthere is a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that some legally protected interest . . . has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>been adversely affected.\u201d <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>McGuinness, </em>140 Conn. 80, 83, 98 A.2d 660; see also <em>Hartford Kosher Caterers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gazda, </em>165 Conn. 478, 485-86, 338 A.2d 497, and cases cited. Moreover, aggrievement does not depend on the magnitude of the injury threatened. A taxpayer, for example, has standing to challenge municipal action which \u201cwould . . . result, directly or indirectly, in an increase in his taxes or would, in some other fashion, cause him irreparable injury.\u201d <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Desmond, </em>140 Conn. 426, 430, 101 A.2d 294; <em>Zuckerman </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>144 Conn. 160, 163-64, 128 A.2d 325; see also Davis, Administrative Law Treatise (1970 Sup.) \u00a7\u00a7 20.09-5, 22.09-6, 22.21.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Cooper bases his aggrievement on the threatened dilution of his common stock equity. This court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>never before had occasion to decide whether such a threatened injury suffices for aggrievement, but that question has been answered affirmatively by the United States Supreme Court. In <em>Allegheny Corporation </em>v. <em>Breswich &amp; Co., </em>353 U.S. 151, 77 S. Ct. 763, 1 L. Ed. 2d 726, minority common stockholders of Allegheny appealed from an Interstate Commerce Commission decision approving Allegheny\u2019s issuance of convertible preferred stock. Mr. Justice Frankfurter said (p. 160) that \u201cunder relevant notions of standing, the <em>threatened </em>[emphasis added] \u2018dilution\u2019 of the equity of the common stockholders provided sufficient financial interest to give them standing.\u201d Cooper\u2019s grievance is certainly palpable enough to satisfy the legal requirements of aggrievement in Connecticut. <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Desmond, </em>supra; <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>McGuinness, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">My colleagues say that Cooper has not shown aggrievement because he did not present evidence of aggrievement to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But he was not required to do so. When a person is aggrieved as a matter of law, he need not prove aggrievement in fact. <em>Weigel </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>160 Conn. 239, 247-49, 278 A.2d 766. Similarly, since the necessary facts to show Cooper\u2019s aggrievement\u2014his shareholder status and the terms of the exchange offer\u2014were admitted and undisputed, no more evidence of aggrievement was needed. Indeed, since the threat of dilution is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>a logical consequence of the admitted and undisputed facts, it is difficult to see what additional evidence Cooper would have offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The majority opinion also suggests that if Cooper\u2019s rights as an ITT shareholder were illegally prejudiced by the issuance of the series N shares, his proper course of action would have been to bring a shareholders\u2019 action against ITT. That argument simply misconstrues the nature of Cooper\u2019s claim. He claims that the insurance commissioner, not ITT, acted illegally in approving the exchange of stock, and that he is aggrieved by that exchange. Cooper does not claim that the issuance of the series N shares was illegal. Hence, his proper remedy is to appeal the insurance commissioner\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Robertson bases his claim of aggrievement on Public Act No. 444. That statute entitles him, as a policyholder of Hartford Fire, to protection from the abuses which the General Assembly feared might result from conglomerate take-overs of domestic insurance companies. He alleges that the commissioner failed in specific respects to provide the protection mandated by Public Act No. 444 when he approved ITT\u2019s exchange offer. He claims, for example, that the conditions imposed by the insurance commissioner to protect Hartford Fire policyholders from a raid on the treasury, set out in footnote 1, are legally and practically incapable of enforcement. If Robertson\u2019s allegations are true, he is clearly aggrieved by the commissioner\u2019s order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But Robertson was not required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>to prove his allegations in the preliminary hearing as to aggrievement, nor did the court permit him to do so. When the G-eneral Assembly limited appeals to persons aggrieved, \u201cit could not have been the legislative intent to require the court to determine the merits of the controversy as a preliminary matter, before even entertaining the appeal.\u201d <em>Waterbury Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>130 Conn. 494, 499, 35 A.2d 837. Since Robertson is aggrieved if his allegations are true, his appeal should not have been dismissed without a hearing on the merits. See <em>Waterbury Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In this case the majority departs from traditional principles of standing and thereby prevents judicial scrutiny of a far-reaching administrative action which is of great public concern. The present case involves the largest and most important insurance acquisition ever made, and probably the largest single corporate acquisition in financial history. The commissioner\u2019s approval is the first ever obtained under Public Act No. 444, a statute enacted to ensure protection of the public interest. In the past, when questions of public importance have been presented, this court has not allowed unrealistic rules of standing to bar judicial review. In <em>Ducharme </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>161 Conn. 135, 137-39, 285 A.2d 318, for instance, this court held that despite precedent to the contrary, outmoded concepts of standing would not bar a municipality from challenging the constitutionality of a state statute. The requirement of aggrievement should not be erected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>into a barrier to judicial review. As Chief Justice Vanderbilt of the New Jersey Supreme Court said in a case holding that competitors of a savings and loan association were aggrieved by the banking commissioner\u2019s approval of a branch office of the association, \u201cin cases involving substantial public interest, the courts have held that \u2018but slight private interest, added to and harmonizing with the public interest\u2019 is sufficient to give standing .... Competing banking institutions may be the only persons with sufficient private interest in harmony with the public concern for the safety of savings and bank deposits to bring the attention of the courts to errors of law in an administrative action granting a license to establish a branch contrary to the standards set by the statute delegating authority to so act. If such banking institutions do not have the necessary standing, who then is there who can or will challenge an administrative decision favorable to the applicant? Without standing in the appellants to invoke the power of judicial review, the Commissioner\u2019s action favorable to [the defendant] Colonial, right or wrong, proper or arbitrary, takes on a conclusive character to the posssible great detriment of the people as a whole.\u201d <em>Elizabeth Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>24 N.J. 488, 499, 501-502, 132 A.2d 779.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The courts of this state are in the business of hearing and deciding cases on their merits. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>requirements of standing must not be applied so as to become an obstacle to judicial review of administrative decisions affecting the people of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">I would find error in part and order a hearing on the merits of the claims of the plaintiffs Cooper and Robertson.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-6\"> In his finding and final order of May 23, 1970, the insurance commissioner imposed ten conditions on the exchange offer, including the following: \u201c(d). Subject to the provision of subparagraph (e), for ten years Hartford shall not in any year transmit funds to ITT in excess of earnings of Hartford for that year as reported on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles. The companies will be free to return to ITT any capital that ITT shall have supplied to Hartford so long as Hartford\u2019s surplus is not thereby reduced below that necessary for underwriting purposes, (e). Hartford shall not make any investments within the ITT system without the prior consent of the Connecticut Insurance Department, (f). For at least five years, Hartford shall not reduce its underwritings in any line of insurance substantially below the average of its underwritings in that line during the period 1964-1969. . . . (h). That, in the event the proposed exchange offer is consummated, ITT shall bind itself to fulfill the aforesaid conditions, (a) through (g). (i). That, in the event that the proposed exchange offer is consummated, ITT shall exercise its powers as a stockholder to cause the Hartford to amend its charter so as to make the aforesaid conditions binding on the Hartford and its shareholders.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Professor Davis\u2019s Administrative Law Treatise (1970 Sup.) $ 22.09-5, p. 748, states: \u201cCommon law that has endured for centuries is based on the human nature that impels assertion of principle when only a trifle is immediately involved. If A steps on B\u2019s land, touches B\u2019s person, or points a gun at B, in each instance causing damage or injury so trifling that it is not discernible, B nevertheless has a cause of action for trespass, for battery, or for assault. The common law in each instance allows the plaintiff:, on the basis of the trifle, to assert principle. Just as the trifle may be the basis for fighting out principle in the common law, the trifle may be the basis for standing to assert principio against the public officer or the government.\u201d Professor Davis concludes that for standing, \u201c[a] small injury should suffice. A choice has to be made as to how much adverse effect should be enough for standing. The requirement could be a large injury, a middle-sized one, or a small one. Much complexity as well as many unsatisfactory results would grow out of requiring an injury to equal litigation expenses or to equal such a jurisdictional minimum as $10,000 for the Supreme Court has properly treated as sufficient a fraction of a vote, a $1.50 poll tax, and a fine of five dollars and costs. . . . Therefore, the choice the federal courts have generally made, that an identifiable injury to an interest of the plaintiff will suffice even if the interest or the injury is a tiny one, should be firmly adopted and clarified.\u201d Davis, op. cit. \u00a7 22.21, pp. 785-86.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b84-6\"> That Cooper did not participate in the proceedings before the insurance commissioner does not deprive him of standing to appeal as an aggrieved person. <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>146 Conn. 665, 666, 154 A.2d 520. Nor is his injury nonexistent because he chose to ignore it when the first merger plan was presented to ITT stockholders.
