J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqE\">Defendant Ronald Mott appeals from a judgment entered after a jury found him guilty of failing to file and/or provide , a disclosure statement in connection with a seller assisted marketing plan (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1812.217; 1812.203/1812.205; counts I-III) and attempted grand theft (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664/487, subd. 1; counts IV and V).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">In December 1979, Donald Anderson called defendant in response to an advertisement in the business section of a local newspaper which read: \u201cExciting New Sports League. Now looking for managing partner to run the [San Fernando] Valley team. Join the big time sports world in unique amateur sports league. Only work 6 mo. a year, like the pros! Xlnt profit potential from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>player tuition fees. Only cash requirement is $4,000 for partnership contribution + $6000 for working capital. For interview call The National Sports League. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">When defendant and Anderson met to discuss the advertised business opportunity, defendant described the National Sports League (hereinafter the League) as a national league for children between ages 11-15. Defendant was the commissioner of the League and its sole owner. The western division was to consist of six \u201cindividually owned\u201d teams in various cities which were to compete against each other in various sports.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Defendant offered to sell the Los Angeles team to Anderson for $10,000. Of this amount, $4,000 was to be paid directly to the League, with the remainder to be placed in a team security deposit account.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Defendant gave Anderson a document entitled \u201cTeam Partnership Agreement.\u201d The agreement established the buyer and the League as partners in the operation of the team and provided for the division of team profits and ownership. The buyer would have a 67 percent ownership interest in his team and the League would have a 33 percent ownership interest. While the authority to run the team was vested in the \u201cowner,\u201d he was not made a partner in the League and had no authority in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Under the arrangement, the League would dictate operating policies and procedures for each League team and provide a variety of league services, including the arrangement of conference league play, team transportation and lodging. The League was also to provide the owner with an extensive training program, assistance in recruiting of team members and staff and \u201cextensive national advertising.\u201d The League was to obtain sports equipment at a discount and establish a comprehensive insurance plan. The League also agreed to incorporate.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">In addition to the $4,000 \u201cpartnership contribution,\u201d which was to be paid directly to the League, each team owner was to forward $265 from each player\u2019s enrollment fee for the operation of the League and provision of League services.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">At this initial meeting, defendant told Anderson that the entire league would soon be operational as one team had already been sold. Defendant falsely represented that he had already made arrangements to obtain sporting equipment, transportation and lodging for League team members at a reduced rate and that Anderson would have to \u201cmove fast\u201d in order to purchase the Los Angeles team. He claimed that Anderson would make more than a $17,000 profit on his initial investment in a year\u2019s time.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Defendant showed Anderson a document entitled \u201cIncome and Expense Projection,\u201d but no disclosure statement was given to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">After the meeting, Anderson became suspicious and contacted the police. Police Officers Larralde and Daniels, posing as prospective team purchasers, accompanied Anderson to a second meeting where defendant essentially repeated his earlier description of the operations of the League. Although defendant provided an operating manual and contract, the officers were not given a disclosure statement. At a third meeting, scheduled shortly thereafter, defendant was arrested pursuant to a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Prior to trial, defendant informed the court that he wished to dismiss his appointed public defender and represent himself at trial. The court granted his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Defendant represented himself throughout the jury trial without benefit of advisory counsel. He testified extensively on his own behalf urging, inter alia, that the League offered the sale of team partnership interests and was not a seller assisted marketing plan. The League was never incorporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Defendant was convicted of one count of violation of Civil Code section 1812.217 for placing an advertisement and making a representation to a purchaser about a seller assisted marketing plan without having first filed a disclosure statement with the Secretary of State, as required by Civil Code section 1812.203; two counts of failing to provide potential purchasers of the seller assisted marketing plan with such disclosure statement; and two counts of attempted grand theft. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\n<em>Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Defendant contends that: (1) the record does not support a finding that he voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to counsel; (2) the League offered the sale of team partnership interests and was not a seller assisted marketing plan under Civil Code section 1812.201; (3) the failure to file a disclosure statement (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1812.203) is necessarily included in the offense of failure to provide a disclosure statement to a potential purchaser (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1812.205, 1812.206); (4) the evidence did not establish that he \u201cwilfully\u201d violated Civil Code section 1812.217, and (5) his conviction and sentencing constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Respondent controverts all of defendant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\n<em>Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">In an unpublished portion of this opinion, we have determined that since the record does not establish that defendant was aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, we cannot find that defendant made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed. For purposes of retrial, however, we determine that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support a finding that defendant\u2019s proposed business operation was a \u201cseller assisted marketing plan\u201d within the meaning of Civil Code section 1812.201 and that he wilfully violated the provisions of sections 1812.203 and 1812.205, which are made punishable by section 1812.217. In view of the required reversal, defendant\u2019s other contention does not require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\n<em>The Business Operation of the League Constituted a Seller Assisted Marketing Plan Within the Meaning of Civil Code Section 1812.201</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Defendant contends that his marketing plan only involved offers to enter into team partnerships and therefore did not constitute a seller assisted marketing plan within the meaning of Civil Code section 1812.201.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>We disagree. The evidence establishes that the business operation of the League precisely fits the statutory definition of a seller assisted marketing plan and is not specifically listed as an exception thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The advertised plan called for the sale by the League of interests in individual team partnerships in which the League was to be a minority partner. The purchasers were partners in the individual teams but did not become partners in the League. The League was to provide various services<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to assist the purchaser in the operation of the team but not as its contribution to the team partnerships which were obliged to pay therefor. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1812.201, subd. (a).) The initial payment of $4,000 to the League exceeded the $500 minimum required by the statute. The evidence further established that the defendant told potential purchasers that there was a market for the NSL and that they could earn \u201can amount in excess of the initial payment made.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1812.201, subds. (a)(1) and (2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Where, as here, the business operation meets the definition of a seller assisted marketing plan, the question of whether the arrangement also involved sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>partnership interests is simply irrelevant. Sales of partnerships interests are not specifically listed as an exception to the disclosure requirement of the statute. Unlike the sale of partnership interests, each of the exceptions to the statute involves a business operation which is either subject to close state regulation compliance with which is a condition of the exemption (e.g., securities or franchises) or is inherently less subject to abuse (e.g., sale of ongoing business).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\n<em>Failure to File a Disclosure Statement Is Not Necessarily Included in the Offense of Failure to Provide a Disclosure Statement to a Potential Purchaser</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Defendant urges that since the disclosure statement required to be provided to a prospective purchaser by Civil Code section 1812.205<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is identical to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the statement required to be filed with the Secretary of State under Civil Code section 1812.203,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the latter offense is necessarily included in the former offense. This contention is without merit. \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018The test in this state of a necessarily included offense is simply where an offense cannot be committed without necessarily committing another offense, the latter is a necessarily included offense.\u2019\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pendleton </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 371, 382 [158 Cal.Rptr. 343, 599 P.2d 649].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lohbauer </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 364, 369 [173 Cal.Rptr. 453, 627 P.2d 183].)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Obviously, one can fail to provide a disclosure statement to a potential purchaser without failing to provide such a statement to the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Similarly, violation of Civil Code sections 1812.203 and 1812.205 are not necessarily included in the grand theft charges. Defendant did not necessarily commit grand theft by failing to file and/or provide a disclosure statement. (Cf., <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonda </em>(1983) 138 Cal.App.3d 774, 778 [188 Cal.Rptr. 295].)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\n<em>The Evidence Was Sufficient to Support a Finding that Defendant \u201cWilfully\u201d Violated Civil Code Section 1812.217</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Defendant contends that he lacked the \u201cwilfullness\u201d necessary to establish a violation of Civil Code section 1812.217,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as he had no knowledge of the registration and disclosure requirements of Civil Code sections 1812.203/1812.205. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Penal Code section 7 provides that the word \u201cwilfully,\u201d \u201cwhen applied to the intent with which an act is done or omitted, applies simply a purpose or willingness to commit the act, or make the omission referred to. It does not require any intent to violate law, or to injure another, or to acquire any advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>The principle that knowledge of the unlawfulness of an act or omission is not required was recently reiterated by our Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Snyder </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 590, 592-593 [186 Cal.Rptr. 485, 652 P.2d 42]: \u201c \u2018It is an emphatic postulate of both civil and penal law that ignorance of a law is no excuse for a violation thereof. Of course it is based on a fiction, because no man can know all the law, but it is a maxim which the law itself does not permit any one to gainsay .... The rule rests on public necessity; the welfare of society and the safety of the state depend upon its enforcement. If a person accused of a crime could shield himself behind the defense that he was ignorant of the law which he violated, immunity from punishment would in most cases result.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>(1892) 96 Cal. 171, 176 [31 P. 45]; see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State Department of Health </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 548, 554-555 [150 Cal.Rptr. 344], and cases cited.) . . . [T]he crucial question is whether the defendant was aware that he was engaging in the conduct proscribed by that section. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Norton </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d Supp. 14, 21 [146 Cal.Rptr. 343];
