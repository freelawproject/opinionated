Justice Dyer</author>\n<p id=\"AXV\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">This is an appeal by Robert Rivera, now confined in the Tennessee State Penitentiary at Nashville, from the denial of a habeas corpus petition heard in the Circuit Court of Stewart County.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">On 12 July 1957 Rivera, along with co-defendants was convicted of two counts of armed, robbery receiving a sentence of fifteen years under each count with said sentences to run consecutively. These two cases are docket numbers 143 and 144. On 30 January 1958 Rivera, along with co-defendants, was convicted of armed robbery, receiving a sentence of ten years. This last case is docket number 146 and it runs consecutively to the sentences in 143 and 144 mailing a total time of forty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">' There is filed in the record a letter from C. Murray Henderson, Warden of the Tennessee State Penitentiary at Nashville. Under this letter it is apparent Rivera has served the ten year sentence imposed under docket number 146. This leaves at issue only the sentences imposed under docket numbers 143 and 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Upon arrest Rivera, along with co-defendants, was given a preliminary hearing before W. H. Keel, a Justice of the Peace in Stewart County. Upon indictment to these charges. defendant, along with co-defendants, went to trial on a plea of not guilty. The State called W. H. Keel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>as a .witness who upon direct examination testified as follows</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5q\">Q. Now, Squire Keel, before the jury retired, you had testified, and I believe for it to b\u00bf certain, this may be a little repetition. I would like for you, sir, now so that there can\u2019t be any misunderstandings and quibblings about the matter, just state to the Court and jury what did happen after the trial was called? Just go in it fully about all of the occurrences, what occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHT\">A. I asked the defendants if they had counsel or somebody to represent them, and they said they didn\u2019t have. I asked them if they wanted one, and I told them that :they were entitled to counsel and would give them a chance to get them a lawyer if they wanted one. If they wanted one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4Z\">And so I later tried to appoint a lawyer for them. Tried to get them a lawyer.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A17\">And had Bill Lewis, called Bill Lewis in. He didn\u2019t accept it. That is, he said he couldn\u2019t accept it on\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">THE COUBT (interposing) You need not say why he didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t accept?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">THE WITNESS: He didn\u2019t accept. I tried to get hold of Ira Atkins and couldn\u2019t locate him. Anyway\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">BY MB. W. D. HOWELL:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3G\">Q. (continuing) That is the legislature in session at that time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANBk\">A. At that time I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-12\">Q. Was Mr. Atkins a member of the legislature?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-13\">A. I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Q. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATsq\">A. So at that time, Moore asked if he conld represent, conld act as representative for all of them, or counsel for all of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\">And so I asked them if that was satisfactory and they said yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">And so he went ahead and acted as a spokesman for all of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">Q. Jnst there, did each one of them give his assent to Mr. Moore acting for them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">Q. Now, of course, you were asked about Mr. Atkins being a member of the legislature, it hadn\u2019t convened at that time, but was he away? Was he away at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">A. I understood that he was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">Q. Not available to say the least of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-11\">A. That is right, not available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGY\">Q. I believe you have stated that each one agreed or assented that Mr. Moore speak for them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-13\">A. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-14\">EXAMINATION BY THE COUBT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmS\">Q. Just one question. Before you go, I want to ask him one question if I may. Before they spoke, Squire Keel, .did you advise them that what they said, that they didn\u2019t have to make a statement and that what they said would be held against them? Did you advise them of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>A. After I read the charge to them, I asked each one of them if they had any statement to make, and told them that they didn\u2019t have to make a statement unless they wanted to and it would be held against them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">THE COURT: All right, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">BY MR. W. D. HOWELL:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">Q. (continuing) Now, under those circumstances, I am not asking you what they did, but under those circumstances did each one of them make a statement to you about their innocence or guilt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">A. They did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">Q. As they were called up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">A. Yes, they pleaded guilty to the charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-11\">MR. J. ALFRED SMITH: If Your Honor please, we object to that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-12\">THE COURT: I am going to overrule your objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-13\">MR. J. ALFRED SMITH: Note an exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">We are faced with the question of whether, is it error requiring reversal, where the State is allowed to prove in the trial under an indictment or presentment on plea of not guilty, that defendant did in fact plead guilty to these charges at the preliminary hearing. This same issue, though under different circumstances, arose in <em>Brooks v. State, </em>187 Tenn. 67, 213 S.W.2d 7 (1948) where it was held to be error for the State to ask the defendant on cross examination \u201cif he did not plead guilty to the charge.\u201d This question had reference to a plea of guilty on arraignment which was later changed to not guilty. In the <em>Brooks </em>case Mr. Justice Burnett (now Chief Justice) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>in giving the logic and reason for so holding quoted from <em>Kercheval v. United States, </em>274 U.S. 220, 47 S.Ct. 582, 71 L.Ed. 1009 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">A plea of gnilty differs in purpose and effect from a mere admission or an extra-judicial confession; it is itself a conviction. Like a verdict of a jury it is conclusive. More is not required; the court has nothing to do hut give judgment and sentence. Out of just consideration for persons accused of crime, courts are careful that a plea of guilty shall not he accepted unless made voluntarily after proper advice and with full understanding of the consequences. When one so pleads he may he held bound. (Citing authority.) But, on timely application, the court will vacate a plea of guilty shown to have been unfairly obtained or given through ignorance, fear or inadvertence. Such an application does not involve any question of guilty or innocence. (Citing authority.) The court in exercise of its discretion will permit one accused to substitute a plea of not guilty and have a trial if for any reason the granting of the privilege seems fair and just. (Citing authority.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">The effect of the court\u2019s order permitting the withdrawal was to adjudge that the plea of guilty be held for naught. Its subsequent use as evidence against petitioner was in direct conflict with that determination. When the plea was annulled it ceased to be evidence. By permitting it to be given weight the court reinstated it pro tanto. (Citing authority.) The conflict was not avoided by the court\u2019s charge. Giving to the withdrawn plea any weight is in principle quite as inconsistent with the prior order as it would be to hold the plea con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>elusive. Under the charge, if the plea was found not improperly obtained, the jury was required to give it weight unless petitioner was shown to be innocent. And, if admissible at all, such plea inevitably must be so considered. As a practical matter, it could not be received as evidence without putting petitioner in a dilemma utterly inconsistent with the determination of the court awarding him a trial. Its introduction may have turned the scale against him. \u2018The withdrawal of a plea of guilty is a poor privilege, if, notwithstanding its withdrawal, it may be used in evidence under the plea of not guility.\u2019 \u201d 187 Tenn. 72, 213 S.W.2d 9</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-3\">We agree and so hold to allow the State to prove Rivera, on trial before a jury on a plea of not guilty, had in fact plead guilty to the charges at the preliminary hearing was error requiring a reversal of the judgments against him; and whether Rivera, at the preliminary hearing, waived counsel or if he had counsel would not affect this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The judgments against Robert Rivera, under docket numbers 144 and 145 of the Circuit Court of Stewart County, are reversed and set aside. The petition for writ of habeas corpus is granted. Robert Rivera is remanded to the custody of the Sheriff of Stewart County where he may be retried on these charges.</p>\n<judges id=\"b476-5\">Burnett, Chief Justice, Chattin and Creson, Justices, and Harbison, Special Justice, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
