P. Dozier and wife, Ethel A. Dozier, as the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">In the view which this Court takes, the pertinent facts of this case are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">(1) The complainant, between June 21, 1963, and December 19,1963, furnished certain materials and labor used in the construction of a bathroom addition to the defendants \u2019 house.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">(2) Said materials and labor were furnished by the complainant at the specific requests of Mrs. Mary Best, the defendants\u2019 daughter, and Ronald Cheney, son of Mary Best, and credit was extended to these persons. Both Mary Best and Ronald Cheney were then, and still are, residing with the defendants in the latter\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>(3) The complainant has attempted to collect the debt from Mary Best but his efforts have been of no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">(4) Subsequently, Mary Best was adjudicated a bankrupt on a petition filed by her in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee on October 12, 1964. Said petition listed the account of the complainant as one of the petitioner\u2019s debts. Whether or not she has been granted a discharge is unknown to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The complainant commenced this suit in the Chancery Court of Williamson County, Tennessee, to secure a mechanic\u2019s lien on the defendants\u2019 property and to recover a personal judgment against the defendant for the value of the labor and materials furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The defendant interposed a demurrer on the grounds that the complaint on its face showed that there was no special contract with the defendants and that the complainant had lost its right to a mechanic\u2019s lien by failure to comply with the requisites set forth in T.C.A. sec. 64-1101 et seq. The demurrer was ultimately sustained and the complainant\u2019s bill was dismissed. The correctness of that ruling is the question now under consideration by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The complainant concedes his loss of the right to a mechanic\u2019s lien and does not assail the sustainment of those grounds of the demurrer relevant to the lien. However, the complainant asserts that, notwithstanding the loss of the right to a mechanic\u2019s lien, the original bill, as amended, continues to state a good cause of action on the theory of unjust enrichment, upon which it is entitled to a hearing on the merits. Antithetically, the defendants contend that the right to a mechanic\u2019s lien is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the sole and exclusive remedy against the defendants, and that having lost the same, complainant is not entitled to a personal judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The only question confronting this Court is whether or not the complainant\u2019s amended bill states a good cause of action upon which it is entitled to a hearing on the merits, notwithstanding the loss of the right to a mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">In ascertaining the merit of the complainant\u2019s contention we must examine closely the following significant excerpt from the complainant\u2019s bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">\u201cSaid materials and labor were furnished and performed by B. H. Paschall, Jr., d/b/a Paschall\u2019s Shopping Center, and by Complainant at the specific requests of Mrs. Mary Best, a daughter of Defendants, and Bonald Cheney, a son of Mrs. Mary Best and the duly authorized agent of the said Mrs. Mary Best at all times complained of herein, both of whom were then, and still are, residing with Defendants in the dwelling house heretofore mentioned. Said materials and services were furnished and performed in the construction of the addition heretofore mentioned with the <em>full knowledge and consent </em>of Defendants. The construction of said addition has <em>enhanced the value </em>of the property heretofore described, and Defendants have been <em>unjustly enriched </em>by the construction of same, without their giving remuneration therefor.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">It is a well established rule that demurrers are not favored at law and will be overruled if, by a fair and reasonable intendment, the pleading states, however in-artificially, a good cause of action. See <em>Holland Bros. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>Electric Co. v. M. W. Kellogg Co., </em>205 Tenn. 352, 326, S.W.2d 649; <em>Jones v. Allied Am. Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>38 Tenn.App. 362, 274, S.W.2d 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Applying this test of liberal construction, we agree with the complainant that the amended bill states a good cause of action against the defendants on the theory of unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">A perusal of the record indicates that the trial court\u2019s sustainment of the defendant\u2019s demurrer was primarily based on the cases of <em>Jordan v. Deitz, </em>201 Tenn. 77, 83, 296 S.W.2d 866, and <em>Taylor v. Tennessee Lumber Co., </em>107 Tenn. 41, 63 S.W. 1130, both of which we take this opportunity to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">In <em>Jordan v. Deits, </em>supra, among other things, this Court decided that in a suit by a subcontractor against a landowner, with whom there is no privity of contract, the principal contractor is a necessary and indispensable party to the suit. However, that rule was merely our exegesis of T.C.A. sec. 64-1126, as unamended, which concerns methods of enforcing mechanic\u2019s liens. Subsequent to that decision, the statute was amended to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">\u201c(2) Where there is no such contract, by attachment in court of law or equity * * * the writ of attachment to be accompanied by a warrant for the sum claimed, to be served upon the owner and <em>may within the discretion of the plaintiff </em>or complainant be served upon the contractor, or subcontractor in any degree, with whom the complainant is in contractual relation, but the owner shall have the right to make said contractor or subcontractor a defendant by cross-action or cross-bill as is otherwise provided by law.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>In our opinion, this amendment is a clear manifestation of the Legislature\u2019s intent to change the result of the <em>Jordan </em>case, so that in a suit to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien by one who is not in privity of contract with the landowner, the contractor is no longer a necessary and indispensable party to the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Both the <em>Jordan </em>and <em>Taylor </em>cases are relied on as standing for the proposition that a materialman, who is without privity of contract with the landowner, is not entitled to a personal judgment against the owner. That the trial court grounded its dismissal of the complainant\u2019s bill on this proposition is clearly evinced by the following statement from the Chancellor\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">\u201cHere the complainant does not allege that he had a contractual relationship with the owner through an agent or otherwise, so it is not entitled to a personal judgment against the owners, defendants. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">We are convinced that the trial court was clearly in error in arriving at this conclusion. Nothing which we said in the <em>Jordan </em>or <em>Taylor </em>cases was intended to preclude the possibility of a suit on quantum meruit which is indeed an action in personam. Those cases involved no question of unjust enrichment, and consequently, this Court gave no consideration to the propriety of such a remedy. To hold that, in absence of a mechanic\u2019s lien, privity of contract is a prerequisite in all actions to recover the value of labor and material furnished, would not only open the door to fraud, but would completely abrogate the common law remedy of quantum meruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The rule we announced in the <em>Jordan </em>and <em>Taylor </em>cases was perhaps stated more unequivocally in <em>Lundstrom Const. Co. v. Dygert, </em>254 Minn. 224, 94 N.W.2d 527, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>where J. Matson, speaking on behalf of the Minnesota Supreme Court, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ\"><em>\u201cAside from unjust enrichment, </em>which is an element not involved here, it is generally recognized that, other than the statutory right to a mechanic\u2019s lien or other special statutory remedies, subcontractors and ma-terialmen have no right to a personal judgment against the owner where there is no contractual relation between them.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">The law recognizes two distinct types of implied contracts; namely, contracts implied in fact and contracts implied in law, commonly referred to as quasi contracts. The distinction between the two has been explicitly stated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Weatherly v. American Agr. Chemical Co., </em>16 Tenn.App. 613, 65 S.W.2d 592:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">\u201cContracts implied in fact arise under circumstances which, according to the ordinary course of dealing and common understanding of men, show a mutual intention to contract. Such an agreement may result as a legal inference from the facts and circumstances of the case. * * * \u2018Contracts implied in law, or more appropriately, quasi or construction contracts, are a class of obligations which are imposed or created by law without the assent of the party bound, on the ground that they are dictated by reason and justice * * &gt; J 5</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Actions brought upon theories of unjust enrichment, quasi contract, contracts implied in law, and quantum meruit are essentially the same. Courts frequently employ the various terminology interchangeably to describe that class of implied obligations where, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>basis of justice and equity, the law will impose a contractual relationship between parties, regardless of their assent thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">It is well established that want of privity between parties is no obstacle to recovery under quasi contract. 17 C.J.S. Contracts sec. 6, p. 572; <em>Mill and Logging Supply Co. v. West Tenino Lumber Co., </em>44 Wash.2d 102, 265 P.2d 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\"> The apparent reason is that such contracts are not based upon the intention of the parties but are obligations created by law. They are founded on the principle that a party receiving a benefit desired by him, under circumstances rendering it inequitable to retain it without making compensation, must do so. See <em>Naone v. Fisher </em>(D.C.Tenn.), 45 F.Supp. 653, 655; 35A Words and Phrases, Quasi Contract, p. 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">That our decision in the <em>Taylor </em>case was not intended to preclude a materialman from recovering a personal judgment on equitable grounds, where there is no privity of contract, is evinced by at least two subsequent decisions by the Court of Appeals, with whom we agreed by denying certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">In <em>Ford v. Whittle Trunk and Bag Co., </em>12 Tenn.App. 486, the complainant had furnished labor and materials to the defendant corporation without the authority, but with the consent, of the general manager. The Court concluded that there was no special contract between the parties and that recovery was not secured by a mechanic\u2019s lien. Nevertheless, the materialman was allowed to recover on the \u201cequities of estoppel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">Again in <em>Province v. Mitchell, </em>44 Tenn. App. 115, 312 S.W.2d 861, absence of privity was no bar to a personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>judgment on behalf of a materialman who had furnished materials in the improvement of the defendant\u2019s property, but who failed to establish a special contract with the defendant. In granting recovery to the materialman, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">\u201cIf then, as we hold, there was no express contract * * * the only obligation which Mrs. Mitchell was under was that <em>imposed by law, which was to pay on a quantum meruit basis </em>or as the result of an implied contract to pay the reasonable value of the material and labor furnished by complainants.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The defendants assert that an implied undertaking cannot arise against one benefited by the work performed, where the work is done under a special contract with another. While this may be the general rule, we do not think that it is applicable in every case. Indisputably, where one is afforded recovery from the person with whom he has a contract, he cannot also recover from third persons incidentally benefited by his performance. In such a case it could hardly be said that the retention of the benefit by the third party is unjust as to the furnisher. However, the situation is dissimilar where a person furnishes materials and labor under a contract for the benefit of a third party, and that contract becomes unenforceable or invalid. In that situation there is certainly no reason to preclude the furnisher or subcontractor from seeking recovery against the third person on the theory of quantum meruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Our perusal of cases in other jurisdictions has revealed several decisions which, we believe, lend support to our reasoning in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>In <em>DeGasperi v. Valicenti, </em>198 Pa.Super. 455, 181 A.2d 862, the complainant sought to recover for construction work done on the defendant\u2019s land under a contract with the defendant\u2019s husband. Although there was no privity between the complainant and the defendant landowner, the court allowed recovery against the latter on the theory of quasi contract. The court reasoned that since the defendant wife owned the land, she had been unjustly enriched at the complainant\u2019s expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In <em>Karon v. Kellogg, </em>195 Minn. 134, 261 N.W. 861, the plaintiff sought a mechanic\u2019s lien and a personal judgment against a landowner for materials and labor furnished in the improvement of the latter\u2019s land. The services were performed at the specific requests of the defendant\u2019s brother, who was occupying the land. As in the present case, the plaintiff was disallowed the lien because of failure to properly perfect the same. Nevertheless, recovery was permitted on the theory of unjust enrichment. Arriving at its conclusion the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">\u201cHaving been so benefited, defendant is liable, quasi ex contractu, <em>independently of contract </em>or agency.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Matter of <em>Estate of Phillips. </em>10 Misc.2d714, 173 N.Y.S.2d 632, held that a claim for certain materials and labor on the decedent\u2019s property was a debt of the decedent\u2019s estate on the basis of unjust enrichment, notwithstanding the fact that the decedent did not order the work, but that it was done at the request of the decedent\u2019s daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">In the very recent case of <em>Beacon Homes, Inc. v. Holt, </em>266 N.C. 467, 146 S.E.2d 434, the complainant, at the request of the defendant\u2019s mother, erected a house on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>land owned by the defendant. The complainant\u2019s performance was executed under misconception that the mother owned the land in question. In a suit brought against the defendant landowner, it was held that the complainant\u2019s bill stated a good cause of action in unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Based upon the foregoing authorities, we hold that where a materialman or subcontractor furnishes labor or materials which benefit the property of a person with whom there is no privity of contract, an action on quantum meruit may lie against the landowner to recover the reasonable value of said labor and materials so furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">We wish to make it clear that recovery on such an action may not be had in every instance where a subcontractor or materialman has furnished materials or labor which benefit a third person. Our decision in this case is limited to affirming the propriety of quasi contract as a remedy in such factual situation. Each case must be decided according to the essential elements of quasi contract, to-wit: A benefit conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff, appreciation by the defendant of such benefit, and acceptance of such benefit under such circumstances that it would be inequitable for him to retain the benefit without payment of the value thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The most significant requirement for a recovery on quasi contract is that the enrichment to the defendant be unjust. Consequently, if the landowner has given any consideration to any person for the improvements, it would not be unjust for him to retain the benefit without paying the furnisher. Also, we think that before recovery can be had against the landowner on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>an unjust enrichment theory, the furnisher of the materials and labor must have exhausted his remedies against the person with whom he had contracted, and still has not received the reasonable value of his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\">We are not incognizant of some decisions in other jurisdictions which have denied the subcontractor or materialman relief in similar fact situations. However, the great majority of those cases are distinguishable from the present case in that they concerned questions involving the merits of the cases. As heretofore stated, in the case at bar we are concerned solely with the propriety of unjust enrichment as a remedy where there is no privity of contract. Many of those cases denying the subcontractor or materialman recovery proceeded on agency theories with absolutely no allegations of unjust enrichment. See e.g. <em>Porter v. Marotta, </em>Tex.Civ.App., 267 S.W.2d 222. Others have based their decision on an estoppel by the subcontractor because of his failure to give the landowner timely notice of the principal contractor\u2019s default. See e.g. <em>Goldberg v. Barta, </em>(D.C.Mun.App.) 109 A.2d 779. By far the most frequent ground employed to preclude relief on quasi contract has been a finding that the enrichment is not unjust. See e.g. <em>Cohen v. Delmar Drive-In Theatre, </em>7 Terry (Del.) 427, 84 A.2d 597; <em>Chatfield v. Fish, </em>126 Conn. 712, 10 A.2d 754. The point to be made is that none of these cases have gone so far as to deny the availability of quasi contract as a remedy to a materialman. Consequently, we do not think these decisions are inconsonant with our opinion in this case</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">We believe that equity and good conscience, as well as the authorities cited, support our decision in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>and that the complainant should he given a hearing on the merits of his allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Consequently, we remand this case to the trier of facts to determine whether or not the defendant has been so nnjnstly enriched at the detriment of the complainant so as to require him to make compensation therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The decree dismissing the bill of the complainant is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
