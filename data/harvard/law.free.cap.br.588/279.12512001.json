Hoffman, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The debtor's motion to hold the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health &amp; Human Services (\"EOHHS\") in contempt and for sanctions for violating the automatic stay imposed as a result of the filing of this bankruptcy case on January 11, 2018, came on for hearing before me on August 21, 2018. At the hearing, the parties agreed, and the docket in the Probate Court proceeding (Docket No. BR114P0127EA) confirms, that all proceedings in the Probate Court occurring after January 11, 2018, were initiated by the Probate Court. All proceedings involved the Probate Court's efforts to enforce its orders entered against the debtor in the nature of sanctions imposed upon the debtor for his repeated contempt of court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A court's imposition and enforcement of a monetary sanction for contemptuous conduct is an exercise of its police power and is excluded from the automatic stay by Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 362(b)(4).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dignley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277901,12272974\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/1143/\">\n    852 F.3d 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2017) ;\n   <em>\n    Alpern v.

Applicable First Circuit authority does not dictate a contrary conclusion. Mr. Baker's hearing argument that First Circuit precedent establishes that the police power exception to the automatic stay does not apply to \"pecuniary matters\" or \"pecuniary actions\" is a misstatement. The cases relied upon by Mr. Baker, including\n   <em>\n    In re Spooky World\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9083347,9090717\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/346/1/\">\n    346 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 2003) ;\n   <em>\n    In re McMullen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9156330,9152395\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/386/320/\">\n    386 F.3d 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir.2004) ; and\n   <em>\n    In re Soares\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6479448,7643945\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/969/\">\n    107 F.3d 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 1997) establish that the police power exemption from the automatic stay is inapplicable when the police power is exercised to further the governmental unit's \"pecuniary interest\" or for a \"pecuniary purpose.\" This is a much narrower standard than the exercise of police power in connection with a pecuniary matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Any activity involving money is a pecuniary matter but not every activity involving money is an attempt to enforce a pecuniary interest. A court's imposition of a monetary sanction to punish misconduct and its subsequent efforts to enforce that sanction are not for a pecuniary purpose even though they involve the payment of money.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alpern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318952,6533194\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/11/689/\">\n    11 F.3d at 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The fact that the sanction is entirely pecuniary does not take it out of section 362(b)(4).\").
