Hanan, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In Celtic lore, a selkie was a seal who could take human form on land, and become a seal again upon returning to the sea. Unfortunately for the debtor's argument, statutory liens do not have that same transformative quality and do not become avoidable judicial liens when the creditor returns with a money judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The debtor, David Doss, filed this adversary proceeding against Norhardt Crossing Condominium Association Inc., which has a statutory lien against the debtor's condominium unit, by virtue of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20703.165\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 703.165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3). The debtor asserts that Norhardt's lien is wholly unsecured, and therefore can be avoided under 11 U.S.C. sections 506(a) and 506(d). Norhardt responded to the complaint with a motion to dismiss, which the Court converted to a motion for summary judgment. For the reasons explained below, the Court will grant Norhardt's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The debtor filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on February 27, 2017, and converted the case to a Chapter 7 in October 2017. Because he failed to file a certificate showing that he had completed a course in personal financial management, see \u00a7 727(a)(11), the debtor's case was closed without a discharge on March 7, 2018. The debtor subsequently moved to reopen his case to file the certificate and obtain his discharge. Shortly before the Court granted his motion, on April 4, the debtor's counsel filed correspondence asking that the case be reopened, but not be closed immediately after discharge, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   I will be filing a Motion to Impose the Automatic Stay and Avoid a Lien against one of the creditors, Norhardt Crossing Condo Association with the court within 24 hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   When the Court issued notice of the closing of the case without discharge on March 9, 2018, creditor Norhardt Crossing Condo Association immediately filed Notice for a Sheriff sale on the debtor's home. The notice of sheriff sale is set for April 25, 2018 and debtor needs to protect his home from this creditor as their lien is totally unsecured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Case No. 17-21492-beh, CM-ECF, Doc. No. 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court reopened the case on April 5, and later that same day the debtor filed a motion to reimpose the stay, citing as authority 11 U.S.C. section 362(c)(3)(B). The Court summarily denied the motion, noting that the cited section of the Code did not apply, and that the only way to \"reimpose\" the stay once it has lapsed as a matter of law is to seek injunctive relief, which requires an adversary proceeding. The Court's order also pointed out that the debtor appeared intent on initiating a proceeding to avoid Norhardt's lien based solely on its purportedly unsecured status, and that Supreme Court precedent precludes a Chapter 7 debtor from avoiding or \"stripping off\" a valueless lien.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dewsnup v. Timm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227736\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/410/#p417\">\n    502 U.S. 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 417,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6507836\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/112/773/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227736\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/410/#p417\">\n    116 L.Ed.2d 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) ;\n   <em>\n    Bank of America v.

The Court therefore ordered the debtor to show cause why his case should remain open once his discharge issues, requiring him to \"demonstrate that the relief he appears to be seeking-the avoidance of a lien on his residence based on its purportedly unsecured status-is not prohibited as a matter of law, in light of the Supreme Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Caulkett\n   </em>\n   , or otherwise.\" Case No. 17-21492-beh, CM-ECF, Doc. No. 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The debtor responded by initiating this adversary proceeding. His complaint seeks injunctive relief, as well as the avoidance of Norhardt's lien under 11 U.S.C. sections 506(a) and 506(d). It also asserts that Norhardt's claim/lien is dischargeable under section 523(a)(16). The debtor did not move for a preliminary injunction, but instead filed a \"Notice of Request for Injunctive Relief,\" purporting to set a 10-day response deadline to the complaint. The Court issued a summons on April 16 and set a 30-day response deadline (May 16), as prescribed by Bankruptcy Rule 7012(a). On May 8, before the time to respond to the complaint had passed, the debtor filed a proposed order granting his requested injunctive relief \"to prevent the confirmation\n   of the sheriff sale now pending in Waukesha County Court.\" Norhardt objected to the proposed order, arguing that the debtor could not unilaterally shorten the time to respond to the complaint. The Court took no action on the proposed order, indicating that it would address Norhardt's objection at the previously-scheduled pretrial conference on May 31, 2018. On May 16, Norhardt moved to dismiss the complaint and for sanctions under Bankruptcy Rule 9011. The Court considered both of these motions at the May 31 pretrial conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the start of the pretrial conference, the debtor's counsel informed the Court of recent developments in Norhardt's state court foreclosure proceeding: on May 24, the parties appeared at a hearing on Norhardt's request for confirmation of the sheriff's sale of the debtor's condominium unit, as well as the debtor's request for a satisfaction of a judgment lien; the state court judge deferred ruling on the requests, explaining that whether Norhardt's lien was \"discharged\" was a question for the bankruptcy court to decide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Also at the May 31 pretrial conference, counsel for the debtor conceded that injunctive relief was no longer necessary, and the Court sustained Norhardt's objection to the debtor's May 8 proposed order. Turning to the lien-avoidance request, the debtor's counsel attempted to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Dewsnup\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Caulkett\n   </em>\n   by arguing that Norhardt's lien was a judicial lien, and not a mortgage. Counsel's argument on this point was not entirely cohesive: she later conceded that Norhardt had a statutory lien, but that the lien was dischargeable under section 523(a)(16); then asserted that the lien was judicial, and appeared to use the two terms interchangeably.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Because Norhardt's motion to dismiss attached and relied on exhibits not included in the complaint-a statement of condominium lien and a copy of its recorded lien on the debtor's unit-the Court converted the motion to one for summary judgment and allowed the parties to brief the issues and supplement the record with additional evidence relevant to the motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Levenstein v. Salafsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381282\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/345/#p347\">\n    164 F.3d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 347 (7th Cir. 1998) (\"The court must either convert\n   the 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 and proceed in accordance with the latter rule, or exclude the documents attached to the motion to dismiss and continue under Rule 12.\"). The Court then took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and this is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(K).

First, did Norhardt's foreclosure of its statutory lien change the nature of the lien to a judicial lien? Second, whatever the nature of the lien, can the debtor avoid it?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The foreclosure of Norhardt's statutory lien did not change the nature of the lien to a judicial lien.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In Wisconsin, condominiums are governed by the Condominium Ownership Act, Chapter 703 of the\n   Wisconsin Statutes. Section 703.165(3) provides for the creation of a lien on a condominium unit for unpaid assessments:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   All assessments, until paid, together with interest on them and actual costs of collection, constitute a lien on the units on which they are assessed, if a statement of lien is filed within 2 years after the date the assessment becomes due. The lien is effective against a unit at the time the assessment became due regardless of when within the 2-year period it is filed. A statement of condominium lien is filed in the land records of the clerk of circuit court of the county where the unit is located, stating the description of the unit, the name of the record owner, the amount due and the period for which the assessment was due. The clerk of circuit court shall index the statement of condominium lien under the name of the record owner in the judgment and lien docket. The statement of condominium lien shall be signed and verified by an officer or agent of the association as specified in the bylaws and then may be filed. On full payment of the assessment for which the lien is claimed, the unit owner shall be entitled to a satisfaction of the lien that may be filed with the clerk of circuit court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20703.165\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 703.165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3). Additionally, section 703.165(7) allows for the foreclosure of such a lien in the same manner as the foreclosure of a mortgage on real property:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A lien may be enforced and foreclosed by an association or any other person specified in the bylaws, in the same manner, and subject to the same requirements, as a foreclosure of mortgages on real property in this state. An association may recover costs and actual attorney fees. An association may, unless prohibited by the declaration, bid on the unit at foreclosure sale and acquire, hold, lease, mortgage and convey the unit.\n   <em>\n    Suit to recover a money judgment for unpaid common expenses shall be maintainable without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing the same.\n   </em>\n   Suit for any deficiency following foreclosure may be maintained in the same proceeding. No action may be brought to foreclose the lien unless brought within 3 years following the recording of the statement of condominium lien. No action may be brought to foreclose the lien except after 10 days' prior written notice to the unit owner given by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the address of the unit owner shown on the books of the association.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20703.165\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 703.165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7) (italics added). The italicized portion of this provision indicates that a condominium association has at least two remedies to recover delinquent assessments from a unit owner: a suit to recover a money judgment (an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   action), and a foreclosure suit (an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   action). Notably, obtaining a money judgment does not result in a waiver of the lien securing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Consistent with the above provisions, in September 2015 Norhardt filed a statement of lien with the Waukesha County Clerk of Courts, giving rise to a statutory lien under Wis. Stat 703.165(3). Norhardt then took action to enforce its lien through foreclosure proceedings, under Wis. Stat 703.165(7). In doing so, Norhardt exercised both of its available remedies: it foreclosed its lien to obtain a foreclosure judgment, and it also obtained a money judgment against the debtor personally for the delinquent balance. The debtor asserts, without any supporting authority, that Norhardt's \"condo lien filed in September 2015 [\n   <em>\n    would be\n   </em>\n   ] a statutory lien that cannot be avoided in bankruptcy ... if [Norhardt] had not pursued legal action to foreclose on the lien and obtained a money judgment, creating\n   a judicial lien.\" CM-ECF, Doc. No. 15, at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   There are several fundamental flaws with the debtor's lien transformation argument. First, the debtor appears to conflate Norhardt's money judgment with its foreclosure judgment. The money judgment Norhardt obtained against the debtor is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the result of the enforcement/foreclosure of Norhardt's statutory lien-it is the result of the enforcement of the debtor's personal obligations under his contractual agreement with the association. To highlight the distinction, the money judgment is the result of Norhardt's\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   action (and would have allowed, for example, the garnishment of the debtor's wages),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   while the foreclosure judgment is the result of its\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   action (and provided for the sale of specific real estate securing a pre-existing statutory lien). Any argument that the separate money judgment is an extension or reincarnation of Norhardt's statutory lien confuses the condominium association's rights against the debtor personally with its rights against his property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Assuming, however, that the debtor means to argue that the foreclosure judgment-and not the corresponding money judgment-replaced or nullified Norhardt's statutory lien, that contention also must fail. Despite exhaustive efforts, the Court has been unable to find a single case or statute that would sustain this argument. Instead, every authority the Court has located holds to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Cunningham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151682\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/478/346/#p361\">\n    478 B.R. 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 361 (Bankr.

An individual lienholder is not able to recover simply by possessing the lien. Rather, the lienholder must go to court and obtain a judgment against the debtor in order to be able to execute on the lien.

The debtor cited to these provisions of the Code despite the Court's warning in its order to show cause that the Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Dewsnup\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Caulkett\n   </em>\n   appear to foreclose the use of that Code section to avoid \"unsecured\" liens in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The debtor attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Dewsnup\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Caulkett\n   </em>\n   by arguing-again without any supporting legal authority-that those cases do not apply because Norhardt has a judicial lien rather than a mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Setting aside that Norhardt has a valid\n   <em>\n    statutory\n   </em>\n   lien, the debtor's argument still fails. Nothing in the language of\n   <em>\n    Dewsnup\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Caulkett\n   </em>\n   suggests that the reading of section 506(d), and the meaning of an \"allowed secured claim,\" should be different when a lien is nonconsensual. Numerous courts have reached that same conclusion, holding that\n   <em>\n    Dewsnup\n   </em>\n   applies to both consensual and non-consensual liens, including judicial liens.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Swiatek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11628266\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/231/26/#p29\">\n    231 B.R. 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 29 (Bankr.

If this is, in fact, the debtor's argument, it is wrong. Section 523(a)(16) was codified\n   <em>\n    in response to\n   </em>\n   cases like the Seventh Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Rosteck\n   </em>\n   decision, and the 2005 amendment to section 523(a)(16) limited the validity of\n   <em>\n    Stone.\n   </em>\n   In other words, if\n   <em>\n    Rosteck\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   had been decided under the current version of section 523(a)(16), the results in those cases would have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   More fundamentally, section 523(a)(16) governs the discharge of personal liability, not liens. There is no question that the debtor's discharge here included his\n   <em>\n    personal\n   </em>\n   liability for any pre-petition fees and assessments owed to Norhardt. But his discharge had no effect on the validity of Norhardt's statutory condominium lien, or Norhardt's ability to enforce the foreclosure judgment it obtained by foreclosing the lien against the debtor's condominium unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As a final point, the debtor adds an argument about Wisconsin Statute \u00a7 806.19(4). This state statute concerns the satisfaction of judgment liens after a bankruptcy discharge. Like\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f), this statutory provision was not referenced in the debtor's complaint (and could not have been, because at the time he filed it, the debtor had not received his discharge). Whether the debtor is entitled to a satisfaction of a judgment under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20806.19\">\n    Wis.
