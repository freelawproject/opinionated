On April 20, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment, along with a statement of undisputed facts, supporting affidavits, and a memorandum. Dkt. No. 7. Defendant, appearing pro se, filed a response to Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and a response to Plaintiffs' statement of undisputed facts. Dkt. Nos. 9, 12. He also filed supporting affidavits and exhibits. Dkt. Nos. 10, 11, 13. Thereafter, Plaintiffs replied to Defendant's response and filed a motion to strike, affidavits, a request for judicial notice, and a motion to seal. Dkt. Nos. 14, 15, 16, 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Undisputed Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Beginning in 2013, Plaintiffs and Defendant lived in the Colony Subdivision in Eagle, Idaho as neighbors. Herrera Aff., Dkt. No. 7-3 at \u00b6 2. In Spring 2016, the relationship between the parties started to deteriorate due to an ongoing conflict over Plaintiffs' adherence to Colony Subdivision's Covenants, Codes, and Restrictions (CC &amp; Rs). Dkt. No. 15, Ex. A. This conflict intensified throughout 2016, leading Defendant to file a complaint against Bryan Herrera in Ada County District Court on December 22, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Manweiler Aff., Dkt. No. 7-2 at \u00b6 2.

Defendant amended his complaint a second time on June 7, 2017 seeking damages for declaration violations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. On that same day, Plaintiffs filed a counterclaim that included causes of action for breach of quiet enjoyment, injunctive relief, intrusion on privacy, and abuse of process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5, Ex. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant's causes of action for injunctive relief and defamation per se were dismissed through summary judgment on August 1, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. After a court trial on September 22, 2017, Defendant's remaining claims were dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. After a trial held in the District Court on September 18-20, 2017, the jury was given the following instructions with respect to Plaintiffs' abuse of process claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Instruction No. 11: On Counterclaim 4 for abuse of process, the Herreras have the burden of proof on each of the following propositions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1.

That the Herreras were damaged and the amount of damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   If you find from your consideration of all the evidence that each of these propositions has been proved, then your verdict should be for the Herreras; but if you find from your consideration of all the evidence that any of these propositions has not been proved, then your verdict should be for Jim Scott.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Instruction No. 12: The ulterior motive or purpose generally required in an abuse of process action may take the form of coercion to obtain a collateral advantage not properly involved in the proceeding itself, such as the surrender of property or the payment of money, by\n   use of the process as a threat or club.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, Ex. B.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the conclusion of trial, the jury returned a verdict awarding Plaintiffs $150,000 in general damages for the abuse of process claim and $50,000 in general damages for the breach of quiet enjoyment claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11, Ex.

On October 31, 2017, District Court Judge Norton denied both of these motions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16, Ex. D. On that same day, the court entered judgment in the amount of $200,000 on behalf of Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17, Ex. E. On January 26, 2018, an amended judgment of $228,691.89 was entered for Plaintiffs that included attorney fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18, Ex. F. Plaintiffs have not collected any of the judgment amount from Defendant. Herrera Aff., Dkt. No 7-2. On February 14, 2018, Defendant petitioned this Court for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, listing Plaintiffs as creditors.\n   <em>\n    In re Scott,\n   </em>\n   Case No. 18-06007-JMM, Dkt. No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 1, 2018, Plaintiffs commenced this adversary proceeding against Defendant seeking a determination of nondischargeability of the $150,000 abuse of process judgment under \u00a7 523(a)(6).

Motion to Strike\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Before the Court can consider the Motion for Summary Judgment, it must first resolve Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike. Plaintiff moved to strike paragraphs 4-7 of Pamela Scott's affidavit, Dkt No. 11, and\n   paragraphs 5, 9, 10, and 12 of Defendant's affidavit, Dkt. No. 10, because, Plaintiffs argue, they contain statements for which the affiants lack personal knowledge, are inadmissible hearsay, or are legal conclusions. Dkt. No. 14 at 2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Civil Rule 56(c)(4), made applicable by Rule 7056, provides: \"An affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a [summary judgment] motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.\" Hearsay is generally inadmissible as evidence. Fed. R. Evid. 802. Federal Rule of Evidence 801(c) explains that hearsay is a statement that \"(1) the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing; and (2) a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.\" Statements of opposing parties offered in their individual capacities are not hearsay. Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(a). When referring to documents, litigants must supply \"an original writing to prove its content unless [the Federal Rules of Evidence] or a federal statute provides otherwise.\" Fed. R. Evid. 1002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In their motion, Plaintiffs moved to strike paragraph 4 of Pamela Scott's affidavit and paragraph 5 of Defendant's affidavit because they included inadmissible hearsay statements. Dkt. No. 14 at 2-4. Each of these paragraphs recall the same statement allegedly made by the Plaintiff at a homeowners' association meeting that took place in Winter 2016/2017. Dkt. No. 14 at 2-4. The statements in these paragraphs are not hearsay because they were made by a Plaintiff, Bryan Herrera, who is an opposing party in this proceeding. The statements are not hearsay and are admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs move to strike paragraphs 5-7 of Pamela Scott's affidavit because Ms. Scott lacked the personal knowledge necessary to make the statements in those paragraphs. Dkt. No. 14 at 2-4. In paragraphs 5-7, Ms. Scott offers statements \"on information and belief\" about the square footage of the Herrera's old and new homes, but does not provide any evidence to support her assertions, nor does she explain how she obtained this information or why she is qualified to testify to these facts. Dkt. No. 11. Since Ms. Scott's statements in paragraphs 5-7 are not based on personal knowledge, they are properly stricken and the Court will not consider them in resolving the motion for summary judgment before it.\n   <em>\n    Idaho Conservation League v. Atlanta Gold Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3778859\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/844/1116/#p1124\">\n    844 F.Supp.2d 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1124 (D. Idaho 2012) (\"When a motion to strike challenges the admissibility of an affidavit or declaration, the Court must disregard only those portions of the submission which are inadequate pursuant to the rules.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs also moved to strike paragraphs 9 and 12 of Defendant's affidavit on the grounds that those paragraphs included inadmissible hearsay. Dkt. No. 14 at 2-4. These paragraphs refer to separate statements made by Plaintiffs' attorney and a witness in previous court proceedings. Dkt. No. 10. Each of these statements were made outside of the current judicial proceeding, are offered as proof of the matters asserted therein, and do not meet any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. Therefore, the Defendant's statements in paragraphs 9 and 12 are inadmissible hearsay, must be stricken, and the Court will not consider them in resolving this motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Idaho Conservation League\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3778859\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/844/1116/#p1124\">\n    844 F.Supp.2d at 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiffs moved to strike paragraph 10 of the Defendant's affidavit\n   because it contained ultimate legal conclusions. Dkt. No. 14 at 2-4. While paragraph 10 does not include ultimate legal conclusions, it does refer to the contents of a written order of another court. Dkt. No. 10. The Defendant must provide the original writing in order to prove its contents. However, here, the Defendant separately provided a copy of the district court judge's\n   <em>\n    Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration and Granting in Part Attorney Fees\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 13, which is the best evidence of the statements in paragraph 10 of Mr. Scott's affidavit. As such, the admissibility of paragraph 10 is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs' motion to strike is granted as to paragraphs 5-7 of Ms. Scott's affidavit and paragraphs 9 and 12 of Defendant's affidavit; denied as to paragraph 4 of Ms. Scott's affidavit and paragraph 5 of Defendant's affidavit; and moot as to paragraph 10 of Defendant's affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    B.

Plaintiffs argue their debt meets the requirements of \u00a7 523(a)(6) because it is a judgment that was awarded to them after a jury found Defendant injured them by committing the intentional tort of abuse of process. Plaintiffs' Mem. at 3, Dkt. No. 7-4. To Plaintiffs, the issues of willfulness and maliciousness have already been adjudicated in the state court abuse of process action, and further litigation of these issues should be precluded in this dischargeability action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The creditor carries the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a debt should be excepted from discharge pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Molina v.

The Court concludes that he did. In\n   <em>\n    Bach v. Bagley\n   </em>\n   , the Idaho Supreme Court held that a \"party [has] had a full and fair opportunity to litigate where an argument\n   could have been made in a prior proceeding.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073526\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/148/784/\">\n    148 Idaho 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073526\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/148/784/\">\n    229 P.3d 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1157 (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Here, Defendant's opportunity to litigate his case far exceeds this minimal standard. Defendant appeared in the state court action, was represented by counsel, and contested Plaintiffs' counterclaim in an answer. Defendant litigated the issue of abuse of process claim during summary judgment proceedings that included reply briefs and oral arguments. Defendant's counsel tried the issue of abuse of process to a jury during a three-day trial held in September 2017. At the conclusion of trial, Defendant filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a motion for a new trial on the issue of abuse of process, both of which were denied. Based on Idaho precedent, the Court concludes that Defendant had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue of abuse of process in state court. Accordingly, this factor has been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    b.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Identity of Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Since federal bankruptcy law defines what \"willful and malicious injury\" means under \u00a7 523(a)(6), the Court must determine if the issues litigated in state court are identical to those presented in this adversary proceeding. To do so, the Court must consider whether the elements of the cause of action of abuse of process relied upon by the state court as the basis for its judgment are the same as those this Court must apply in this discharge litigation. To prevail on this element, Plaintiffs must show that the substantive elements of the state court abuse of process judgment are sufficient to establish that Defendant inflicted a \"willful and malicious injury\" for the purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    i.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Willfulness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First, the Court must examine whether the state court judgment for abuse of process establishes that Defendant's conduct was \"willful\" under \u00a7 523(a)(6). Pursuant to Jury Instruction No. 11, the state court jury found that the Defendant \"committed a willful act in the use of legal process not proper in the regular course of the proceedings.\" Manweiler Aff, Dkt, No. 7-2 at \u00b6 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The United States Bankruptcy Appellate Panel of the Ninth Circuit, in\n   <em>\n    In re Black\n   </em>\n   , previously determined that \"willfulness\" for the purposes of an abuse of process claim can be consistent with \"willfulness\" under \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   , the evidentiary record showed that the debtors intended to abuse process to accomplish their ulterior purpose of attempting to negotiate a lower purchase price in a real estate transaction.\n   <em>\n    Black v. Bonnie Springs Family Ltd. P'ship (In re Black)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5900756\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/487/202/#p212\">\n    487 B.R. 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 212 (9th Cir. BAP 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Here, the record fails to show that Defendant subjectively intended to cause injury to Plaintiffs in his abuse of process. However, for the purposes of establishing willfulness, Defendant is also charged with what he must have known when taking the injury-producing action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Even though the record does not show that Defendant's subjective intent was to cause injury to Plaintiffs, Defendant must have known that his abuse of process would do so. The evidence shows that the jury awarded Plaintiffs $150,000 in general damages for abuse of process to reimburse\n   them for renovation costs incurred before they later sold their home. The record suggests that Defendant's motive was, in part, to vigorously enforce the CC &amp; R's in the Colony Subdivision where both parties lived. However, the state court jury found that Defendant's abuse of process was \"willful\" and that the Defendant used process \"as a threat or club.\" Based on these findings, this Court may infer that Defendant must have known his overzealous efforts at the enforcement of the CC &amp; R's would cause injury to Plaintiffs. The state jury findings related to Defendant's abuse of process are sufficient to establish that Defendant's conduct was willful under \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    ii.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maliciousness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Next, the Court must consider whether the state court judgment for abuse of process also establishes that Defendant's conduct was \"malicious\" under \u00a7 523(a)(6). The Ninth Circuit defines a \"malicious\" act as one that is (1) wrongful, (2) done intentionally, (3) necessarily causing injury, (4) without just cause or excuse.\n   <em>\n    Ormsby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3508541,4139366\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/1199/\">\n    591 F.3d at 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An act necessarily causes injury in this context if it is \"targeted at the creditor, at least in the sense that the conduct is certain or almost certain to cause financial harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Transamerica Commercial Fin. Corp. v. Littleton (In re Littleton)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523213,12257758\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/942/551/\">\n    942 F.2d 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 555 (1991).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Here, the state court jury found that the Defendant had \"an ulterior, improper purpose\" in his use of legal process that was \"not proper in the regular course of the proceeding.\" Manweiler Aff, Dkt, No.7-2 at \u00b6 9-10. The jury's finding of an improper purpose in the abuse of process claim is sufficient to demonstrate that Defendant committed a wrongful act, satisfying the first element of the malice standard in \u00a7 523(a)(6) cases. The jury also found that Defendant's act was done \"willfully,\" which establishes that Defendant's wrongful acts were done intentionally, satisfying the second element. Further, the jury's finding that Defendant acted with an improper purpose establishes that he acted without just cause or excuse, satisfying the fourth element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   However, Plaintiffs' claim fails on the third element because the record fails to show that Defendant's actions necessarily caused injury. While it is true that the state court found that Defendant's actions did in fact cause injury, resulting in $150,000 in general damages, the record does not conclusively establish whether Defendant's abuse of process must have necessarily caused injury to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Within the Ninth Circuit, parties have prevailed on the element of malice in dischargeability actions where they have pointed to specific facts in the record that show a plaintiff was necessarily injured by a debtor's conduct because the likelihood of financial harm was \"certain or almost certain.\"\n   <em>\n    Transamerica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523213,12257758\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/942/551/\">\n    942 F.2d at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In holding that the \"malicious\" prong was met, the\n   <em>\n    Ormsby\n   </em>\n   court also pointed to the fact that the grant of attorney fees in the case was based on a prerequisite finding that the misappropriation of the title plants was \"willful and malicious.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3508541,4139366\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/1199/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In another Ninth Circuit case, the court found that the debtor's conduct necessarily caused a financial injury where the debtor chose to wrongfully withhold wages due an\n   employee.\n   <em>\n    Jercich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11129506,11147796\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/1202/\">\n    238 F.3d at 1209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The bankruptcy court's finding of malice was further buttressed by state court findings of \"substantial oppression\" resulting from \"despicable conduct\" that subjected the plaintiff to \"cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person's rights.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11129506,11147796\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/1202/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In a third case, the Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel found that the misappropriation of trade secrets necessarily caused financial injury to the victim of the misappropriation.\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.

The jury awarded $150,000, presumably to compensate Plaintiffs for renovations made to their home prior to its sale. The record does not show what their injury necessarily would have been if they had not renovated their home. There is no doubt that the state court found that Plaintiffs were in fact injured by Defendant's wrongful acts, but the record does not show that Plaintiffs necessarily had to have been injured by Defendant's abuse of process. Since it is unclear whether Defendant's abuse of process necessarily caused injury to Plaintiffs, malice is not established and Plaintiffs are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As discussed above, the party asserting issue preclusion bears the burden of proving its applicability under state law. Here, the Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the state court's findings in the abuse of process action are sufficiently identical to the findings necessary to establish \"maliciousness\" for the purposes of a \u00a7 523(a)(6) nondischargeability action. This Court must resolve any reasonable doubts as to what was decided by a prior judgment against a finding of issue preclusion. The record before the Court at summary judgment does not definitively show sufficient identity of legal issues between the state court case and this adversary proceeding, and this element of issue preclusion is not met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    c.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Issue was Actually Decided\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   This element of issue preclusion is met.

However, the substance of those allegations is best characterized as a residual dispute over the facts of the state court case rather than a meritorious allegation of fraud or deceit related to the current action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiffs' right to seek an order of nondischargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(6) outweighs the significance of the alleged transgressions by Plaintiffs in this adversary proceeding. The defense of unclean hands does not preclude Plaintiffs from seeking relief in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Section 523(a)(6) excepts from discharge debts that arise from \"willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity....\" Based on the evidence of record, Plaintiffs were unable to establish that Defendant's conduct was malicious. Since Plaintiffs were unable to carry their burden by showing that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is denied. A separate order will be entered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Unless otherwise indicated, all chapter and section references are to the Bankruptcy Code,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -1532, all rule references are to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, Rules 1001 -9037, and all \"Civil Rule\" references are to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rules 1 -86.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <em>\n     Jim Scott v.
