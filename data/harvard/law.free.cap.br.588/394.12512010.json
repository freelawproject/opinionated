There are no mortgage liens on the Property, although Debtors have unsecured debt. It cannot be reasonably argued that a Chapter 7 trustee would not be able to secure a higher price for the Property than the amount of the Arianna lien. Liquidation in this case would pay the Arianna lien in full and produce significant assets for distribution to creditors. It cannot be reasonably argued that Arianna, in receiving a $335,000 property, has not received more than the approximately $45,000 it would have received in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    In re Hackler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269372\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/571/662/#p663\">\n    571 B.R. at 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, Judge Gravelle concluded that \"Arianna's arguments regarding federalism are overstated when applied to a \u00a7 547 preferential transfer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269372\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/571/662/#p663\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269372\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/571/662/#p663\">\n    at 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Bankruptcy Court noted that although New Jersey law exempts tax foreclosures from reach of its fraudulent conveyance statute, N.J.S.A. \u00a7 54:5-87, it is silent on the effect of preferential transfers set forth in the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269372\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/571/662/#p663\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   More significantly, the Bankruptcy Court concluded that \"[a]llowing avoidance of a transfer of property made pursuant to the entry of judgment on a tax sale foreclosure is ...

Therefore, after determining that the avoidance of the transfer of property comports with New Jersey law, the Bankruptcy Court held that Plaintiff satisfied all the necessary elements under Section 547 and, therefore, declared void the October 2016 Property Transfer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269372\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/571/662/#p663\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On appeal, Arianna presents the following arguments: (1) the Bankruptcy Court's decision runs afoul of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    BFP v.

App. Div. 2004) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the sake of completion, it is worth also briefly noting that the Court is satisfied that the Bankruptcy Court properly determined that Debtors met all five factors under Section 547. Here, it is undisputed that: (1) Debtor's property was transferred to Arianna; (2) the transfer was for delinquent municipal tax sale certificate liens owed by the Debtors before the transfer was made; (3) Debtors were insolvent at the time; (4) the transfer was made within 90 days of the Debtors' bankruptcy filing; and (5) the creditor received substantially more proceeds ($330,000) than it would have received under Chapter 7 ($45,000 plus interest). \" Section 547(b)(5)'s requirement that the creditor\n   not receive more by a prepetition transfer than it would under chapter 7 'simply carries out the common sense notion that a creditor need not return a sum received from the debtor prior to bankruptcy if the creditor is no better off vis-a-vis the other creditors of the bankruptcy estate than he or she would have been had the creditor waited for liquidation and distribution of the assets of the estate.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re GGI Props., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/#p254\">\n    568 B.R. at 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Collier on Bankruptcy, \u00b6 547.03 (Matthew Bender 2017) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Rocco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=255%20Fed.%20Appx.%20638\">\n    255 Fed.Appx. 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 642 (3d Cir. 2007). The Court also sees no prejudice to Arianna, since it nevertheless remains entitled to the initial lien (including 18% interest) it secured against Debtors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Andrews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11094952\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/262/299/#p306\">\n    262 B.R. 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 306 (Bankr. M.D. Pa. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, the Court is unpersuaded by Arianna's argument that the bankruptcy court's decision is incongruent with New Jersey law. As the Bankruptcy Court noted, New Jersey has a similar statute, under N.J.S.A. \u00a7 54:5-87, which provides limited grounds for debtors to contest the validity of a final judgment, within ninety days. Arianna's reliance on case-law that refused to set aside tax foreclosures based on equitable principles or N.J. Ct. R. 4:50-1 is unavailing. None of the matters relied by Arianna were based on Section 547(b), nor do they identify any conflict between the Bankruptcy Code and New Jersey law. In short, having reviewed the record, the federalism issues of\n   <em>\n    BPF\n   </em>\n   are not present in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    II. Section 547(b) Does Not Violate the Tax Injunction Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Arianna argues, alternatively, that the Bankruptcy Court erred in failing to determine that Section 547(b) violates the Tax Injunction Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to Arianna, the Tax Injunction Act completely barred the Bankruptcy Court from hearing Debtor's cause of action. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Tax Injunction Act states, \"[t]he district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, because a tax sale certificate does not interfere with a state's ability to collect taxes, the Tax Injunction Act is inapplicable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simon v. Cebrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"572938\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/53/17/\">\n    53 F.3d 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 1995). In\n   <em>\n    Simon\n   </em>\n   , the tax lienholder brought a foreclosure action against the debtors in state court; in challenging removal to federal court she contended\n   that the FDIC's invocation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201825\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)\"restrained the collection of taxes and thus implicated the jurisdictional bar of the [Tax Injunction Act].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201825\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201825\">\n    at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In rejecting this argument, the Third Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Withholding consent to foreclose from a private citizen does not implicate the assessment, levy, or collection of any tax. The statute is intended to prevent interference with taxation by governmental entities; however, upon the sale of the tax certificate, the tax obligation is satisfied. The holder's inability to foreclose does not affect the governmental entity's ability to assess, levy, or collect any tax, and thus, the [Tax Injunction Act] is not applicable\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201825\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Simon\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that the Tax Injunction Act is not implicated here. It is undisputed that Arianna's predecessor purchased the tax certificate from the Township of North Brunswick; thereby satisfying the tax obligation. The fact that the Bankruptcy Court has avoided the transfer of title to Arianna does not affect the Township of North Brunswick's ability to still collect taxes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201527\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/497/188/#p199\">\n    497 B.R. 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 199 (Bankr.

Therefore, the Court is satisfied that the Tax Injunction Act does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, Arianna's argument that Section 505 of the Bankruptcy Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20505\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , bars the Bankruptcy Court from reviewing a final judgment is without merit. Section 505 concerns the determination of tax liability, which is not at issue. Since Section 505 has no applicability in the present matter, the Court sees no error in the Bankruptcy Court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Having carefully reviewed and taken into consideration the submissions of the parties, as well as the arguments and exhibits therein presented, and for good cause shown, and for all of the foregoing reasons,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Bankruptcy Court's decision is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    At oral argument, Arianna presented a newly minted argument that was not raised in its brief or before the Bankruptcy Court. Counsel averred, without any legal support, that because Debtors' initial June 2016 Chapter 13 filing was dismissed for failing to attend a Section 341(a) meeting, that this somehow precludes Debtors from now availing themselves of relief under Section 547(b). While the Court notes that Debtors failed to attend its Section 341(a) meeting, which resulted in a dismissal of the petition; the Bankruptcy Court allowed Plaintiffs to refile their bankruptcy petition six months later. However, given the general rule that bankruptcy courts construe the record in the debtors' favor; the Court does not see this argument as a reason for remand. In addition, \"when a party fails to raise an issue in the bankruptcy court, the issue is waived and may not be considered by the district court on appeal.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Kaiser Group Int'l Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1546950,9180679\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/399/558/\">\n     399 F.3d 558\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 565 (3d Cir. 2005) ;\n    <em>\n     In re Ginther Trusts\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11129396,11143335\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/686/\">\n     238 F.3d 686\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 689 (5th Cir. 2001).
