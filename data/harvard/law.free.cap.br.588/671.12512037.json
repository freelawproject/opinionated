After Mr. Gunsalus was laid off in 2014, the Gunsaluses failed to pay the real estate taxes on their home, totaling $1,236.52. ECF No. 8 at 16. On November 10, 2014, Ontario County began to enforce a lien for the unpaid taxes. ECF No. 1-2 at 4.

Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Ontario County argues that its tax lien bars Appellants from claiming a\n   federal homestead exemption,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which consequently deprives the Hamptons of standing to bring an avoidance proceeding under Sections 522(h) and 548 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Appellants claimed the federal homestead exemption under Section 522(d)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. ECF No. 11 at 31. Under the plain language of Section 522(h), debtors who can exempt property have standing to bring avoidance actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deel Rent-A-Car, Inc., v. Levine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1908849,6128098\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/721/750/\">\n    721 F.2d 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 754 (11th Cir. 1983). Nothing suggests that Appellants are precluded from claiming the federal homestead exemption, and the caselaw that the County uses in its argument to the contrary concerns the New York State homestead exemption, which, unlike the federal homestead exemption, does not protect debtors whose taxes are unpaid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Cty. of Chautauqua\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049650\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/449/7/#p12\">\n    449 B.R. 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12 (Bankr. W.D.N.Y. 2011). Furthermore, the County interprets Section 522(c)(2)(B) as barring the Appellants from claiming the federal homestead exemption, when it merely provides that exempt property remains liable for a tax lien.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(B). Appellants are not attempting to avoid paying the tax liens on their respective properties; they are attempting to avoid a transfer of the property. Accordingly, because Appellants \"do not seek to avoid the tax lien under section 545,\" but are instead challenging \"the tax sale as constructively fraudulent under section 548, section 522(c)(2)(B) does not negate their potential standing under section 522(h).\"\n   <em>\n    Hollar v.

The Supreme Court did not elaborate on these precise considerations, which has led to disagreement about whether or not the\n   <em>\n    BFP\n   </em>\n   presumption applies to tax lien foreclosure.

The value the\n   debtor in\n   <em>\n    BFP\n   </em>\n   received was necessarily less than the fair market value of its property because the mortgage foreclosure \"completely redefin[ed] the market in which the property [was] offered for sale; normal free-market rules of exchange [were] replaced by the far more restrictive rules governing forced sales.\"\n   <em>\n    Wentworth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1299731\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/221/316/#p320\">\n    221 B.R. at 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

This Court therefore declines to extend\n   <em>\n    BFP\n   </em>\n   's holding to a materially different case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This holding comports with the Second Circuit's rationale expressed in\n   <em>\n    In re Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3730059,630679\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/263/\">\n    464 F.3d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 273 (2d Cir. 2006). Although the Circuit did not directly reach the merits, it expressed concern in a situation where, as in this case, the RPTL allowed a New York county to receive a \"windfall\" at the expense of other creditors and cautioned the lower court \"that there is a strong presumption of not allowing a secured creditor to take more than its interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3730059,630679\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/263/\">\n    464 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   273 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Chase\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8935704\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/328/675/#p681\">\n    328 B.R. at 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"There is nothing in [Vermont's strict foreclosure law] to prevent a foreclosing mortgagee with a debt of $2,000 from foreclosing on property worth $100,000 and retaining the property, notwithstanding the colossal surplus value of the property.

If this Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's decision, Ontario County would receive surpluses of nearly $22,000 in one instance and more than $20,000 in another. The Appellants, on the other hand, assert that they would be homeless and unable to repay their other creditors through Chapter 13 bankruptcy. The Second Circuit expressly warned against this result in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , and its reasoning disfavors extending\n   <em>\n    BFP\n   </em>\n   's presumption to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This Court also disagrees with the County's argument that allowing the Appellants to avoid their foreclosures would frustrate the County's interest in timely collecting property taxes and ensuring clear title to real estate.

Ultimately, state interests must be balanced against \"the Bankruptcy Code's strong policy favoring equal treatment\n   of creditors.\"\n   <em>\n    In re McMahon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11893120\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/129/93/#p97\">\n    129 F.3d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97 (2d Cir. 1997). Moreover, the County's interests in collecting taxes and avoiding \"clouds on title\" would not be upset by fraudulent conveyance avoidance. The Appellants have made all ongoing tax payments that have come due since the deadline to redeem their home passed, and their Chapter 13 plans provide for payment of all their owed real estate taxes. There is also no question of title to the Appellants' homes, as adversary proceedings were filed before the auction and bidders were notified of the litigation before bidding. The Court is unwilling to subordinate the Appellants' and their other creditors' interests to the County's speculative, unfounded fears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Reasonable minds may differ over the applicability of\n   <em>\n    BFP\n   </em>\n   to the RPTL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Marie T.
