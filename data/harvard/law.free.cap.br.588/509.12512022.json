The 7th Circuit revisited the first\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   prong in\n   <em>\n    O'Hearn,\n   </em>\n   where it set aside an undue hardship discharge of student loans for a debtor with no dependents and an annual salary of $43,000.00 because it found that the bankruptcy court's decision was not grounded on factual inferences supported by the record.\n   <em>\n    In re O'Hearn,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9103036\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/339/559/#p565\">\n    339 F.3d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 565 (7th Cir. 2003).

The court based this justification on two assumptions: that Mr. O'Hearn would have to live alone if he rented an apartment; and that by living alone many of his expenses, no longer shared, would likely double.

Neither party produced evidence comparing Ms. Hopson's expenses vis-a-vis National and Local Standards provided by the IRS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20707\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) (Generally, deductions allowed for debtors subject to the means test, in part, consists of the applicable monthly expense amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards issued by the Internal Revenue Service).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Moreover, Ms. Hopson's responses to interrogatories show her having a monthly net income of $2439.83 and monthly expenses of $2480.26, which would make her short each month by $40.43. That conclusion, however, differs from Ms. Hopson's credible testimony that she has a couple of hundred dollars left over at the end of each month, before taking into account any of the potential cost savings she could make.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Debtor directs this court's attention to the\n   <em>\n    Durrani\n   </em>\n   case, where the court ruled that a Chapter 13 Debtor's student loan debts were dischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8). Assuming Ms. Hopson's testimony about the couple of hundred dollars left over after each month is true, her situation is similar to the debtor in\n   <em>\n    Durrani\n   </em>\n   who had a surplus of $166.00 after all of her necessary expenses were covered.\n   <em>\n    Durrani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9195818\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/311/496/#p501\">\n    311 B.R. at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Durrani\n   </em>\n   is instructive because \"the question framed by\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   in this first prong is whether Durrani can maintain a minimal standard of living if she is required\n   <em>\n    to repay this loan\n   </em>\n   , not whether she has any surplus in her budget available for a monthly payment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9195818\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/311/496/#p501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9195818\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/311/496/#p501\">\n    at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). However, Ms. Hopson's case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Durrani.\n   </em>\n   None of the student loans in\n   <em>\n    Durrani\n   </em>\n   were enrolled in\n   Income Contingent Repayment Plan (\"ICRP\") plans.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9195818\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/311/496/#p501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court noted \"even if Durrani could afford the [$331] ICRP payment-which the court has not found she can do-enrolling in the ICRP would result in negative amortization and the amount of this loan would continue to grow throughout the 25 year repayment term.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9195818\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/311/496/#p501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Debtor's situation is different. The\n   <em>\n    Durrani\n   </em>\n   debtor had significant health limitations that made it unlikely that her income would increase. Ms. Hopson has no such limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Debtor asserts that if she were forced to repay her student loans over a ten-year period, she would have to pay $1,111 per month. The court disagrees. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Durrani\n   </em>\n   , Ms. Hopson's student loans are currently enrolled in IBR plans-her monthly payments are zero. The Debtor is correct that courts are obligated to consider not just a snapshot of a debtor's current situation but her likely future income based upon her education and employment.\n   <em>\n    In re Wallace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924849\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/557/129/#p139\">\n    557 B.R. 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 139 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 2016). Even if Ms. Hopson's sole income was Social Security now or in 2020, the drop in income would very likely keep her IBR payments at zero dollars per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Another factor considered by courts in evaluating the totality of the circumstances is the availability and the pursuit of an ICRP. Courts have rejected a \"per se\" rule requiring enrollment in an income driven repayment plan to establish a debtor's good faith effort to repay his or her student loans. The Sixth Circuit explained that had Congress intended participation in those programs to repeal discharge under Section 523(a)(8) it could have said so.\n   <em>\n    In re Barrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5417589,6045782\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/353/\">\n    487 F.3d 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 364 (6th Cir. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Kreiger v.
