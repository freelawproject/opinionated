The cases were jointly administered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Prior to the Petition Date, Debtors were wireless telecommunications companies. Collectively, Debtors acted as an intermediary between domestic wireless carriers and various foreign wireless handset manufacturers. PCD was a leading distributor of wireless communication devices and accessories. Each wireless device sold by PCD was accompanied by a comprehensive warranty that required PCD to provide certain repair services. Additionally, PCD repaired and refurbished devices that were returned outside of their warranty period. More than 97% of PCD's warranty repair services were performed by certain third-party repair service vendors (\"Repair Services Vendors\"). [\n   <em>\n    Declaration of Raymond F.

(\"Shine\"), performed almost all of the warranty repair services and the out-of-warranty repairs for PCD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the 90-day period prior to the Petition Date, from May 21, 2013 through August 19, 2013 (the \"Preference Period\"), Debtors made transfers to KMT in an amount not less than $3,824,194.36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Almost immediately after filing bankruptcy, on August 20, 2013, Debtors filed a motion seeking to sell substantially all of their assets to Quality One Wireless, LLC (\"Quality One\") pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (\"APA\"). That same day, Debtors filed a Customer Programs Motion\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"CPM\"), seeking to maintain PCD's business until its sale to Quality One could be consummated. [main case dkt item 8; adv. dkt item 32-6] In the CPM, PCD stated that the Repair Service Vendors were critical to PCD's ongoing operations and, specifically, critical to PCD's ability to honor warranty claims and to refurbish phones returned out of warranty. PCD alleged that the loss of any one Repair Service Vendor would cause severe disruption to PCD's business and its proposed sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The CPM does not identify who the Repair Service Vendors are, nor state how much each such vendor was owed as of the Petition Date; however, the parties agree that KMT would have fallen within the definition of a Repair Service Vendor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As\n   of the Petition Date, PCD owed the Repair Service Vendors approximately $975,000.

[main case dkt item 101; adv. dkt item 32-8] In addition, while the Interim Order provided for a $1 million payment cap to Repair Service Vendors, the Final Order did not include a payment cap. However, the CPM did not request that Debtors waive any chapter 5 causes of action, including preference claims, against any Repair Service Vendors, nor did the Interim Order or Final Order grant such a release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 17, 2013, the Court entered an order approving the sale of substantially all of Debtors' assets to Quality One.

If such determination would be too speculative, then the critical vendor defense will fail, at least on a dispositive motion. However, if the record shows that the preference payments would have been approved had they been included in the critical vendor motion, then the critical vendor defense should preclude any preference claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Motion, pp. 4-5 [adv. dkt item 31] Notably, at no point does KMT allege that it was unaware of these bankruptcy filings, or that it was not paid for its post-petition services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Analysis of this argument requires a short statement of what a critical vendor is, at least in the Second Circuit. In general, granting a party critical vendor status is a way a debtor can obtain a bankruptcy court's authority to violate the fundamental general rule that pre-petition unsecured debts are not paid post-petition, and authorize the payment of pre-petition debt as necessary (critical) to facilitate the rehabilitation of the debtor. The court in\n   <em>\n    In re Ionosphere Clubs, Inc.\n   </em>\n   stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   It was first articulated by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Miltenberger v.

This rule recognizes the existence of the judicial power to authorize a debtor in a reorganization case to pay pre-petition claims where such payment is essential to the continued operation of the debtor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"[T]he 'necessity of payment' doctrine ...

However, what is crucial to a doctrine of necessity request is to spell out who will be paid on a pre-petition claim, how much they will be paid, and why that payment is essential to the debtor's ongoing operations and its efforts to reorganize; to require less would be to convert a doctrine born of necessity into a license to do what may be convenient for a debtor to avoid deterioration in its relations with its vendors or suppliers. Further, while this Court is certainly poised to interpret and enforce the orders it has entered, it is not prepared to reimagine what it might have done had it been asked to provide significantly different relief on notice to parties-in-interest with an opportunity to object and be heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   KMT and the Trust refer to the following cases. In\n   <em>\n    Osborne v. Howell Electric Motors (In re Fultonville Metal Prod.

M.D. Fla. 2005). Howell asserted various defenses. Relevant here, in seeking summary judgment on estoppel, law of the case, and res judicata, Howell relied on its critical vendor status.

The circumstances are entirely different here. The Essential Vendor Order did not require that any payments be made, did not identify any vendors who might be beneficiaries\n   of the order, and because Longwood had been paid pre-petition it could not possibly be deemed a beneficiary of that order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Zenith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9041480\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/319/810/#p813\">\n    319 B.R. at 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Zenith\n   </em>\n   court observed that Zenith did not seek to assume and assign any of Longwood's contracts; while an order to assume and assign an executory contract mandates cure payments, the essential vendor order in\n   <em>\n    Zenith\n   </em>\n   provided that payment of pre-petition claims was \"wholly discretionary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9041480\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/319/810/#p813\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hayes Lemmerz Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9214294\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/313/189/#p193\">\n    313 B.R. 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193 (Bankr.

In striking Longwood's critical vendor defense, the\n   <em>\n    Zenith\n   </em>\n   court emphasized that even if the parties stipulated that Zenith would have included the pre-petition payment in its essential vendor motion, Longwood's defense would still fail: \"It is speculative to conclude that no party in interest ... would have objected or that the Court would have granted a motion that had not been made....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 817.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, the parties refer to\n   <em>\n    AFA Inv.

KMT supplied three affidavits in support of its Motion, primarily directed to demonstrating that its services were critical to Debtors' proposed sale to Quality One: (i) an affidavit by Robert Desio, PCD's former National Service Manager (\"Desio Aff.\") [adv. dkt item 35], (ii) an affidavit by Todd Mazza, PCD's former Vice President of Sales to Verizon (\"Mazza Aff.\") [adv. dkt item 34], and (iii) an affidavit by Darin Mickel, KMT's principal (\"Mickel Aff.\") [adv. dkt item 33]. These affiants acknowledge that the Repair Service Vendors were critical to Debtors' ability to honor their warranty claims and to refurbish phones returned out of warranty, and that the loss of the Repair Service Vendors would have caused a severe disruption to the Debtors' business. [\n   <em>\n    Desio Aff.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7;\n   <em>\n    Mazza Aff.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13] Affiants stated that it would have taken Debtors many months to locate, engage and train another vendor to perform the repairs Defendant provided. [\n   <em>\n    Desio Aff.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    Mazza Aff.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14] KMT also asserts that it would have been impossible for Shine to perform the repairs being performed by KMT, thus causing a severe disruption to Debtors' business, thus preventing the sale from being consummated. Accordingly, KMT argues, no one would have objected to approving payment of the alleged preferential transfers in the CPM and accompanying orders. Therefore, had all of this occurred, says KMT, the Court would have approved of the payments and a preference waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In support of its Opposition,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff provided three creditor declarations: (i) the Declaration of HTC America, Inc.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ii) the Declaration of Huawei Device USA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (iii) the Declaration of TCT Mobile Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   [adv. dkt item 37-1] The declarations state that each respective creditor would have objected to the inclusion of a preference waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This Court rejects KMT's theory of hindsight extrapolation, of trying to consider and then make findings of fact on what it might have approved at the initial stages of this case if a request had been made to waive a nearly $4,000,000 claim in addition to paying nearly $1,000,000 on pre-petition claims. This Court will not at this juncture conjecture as to whether Debtors would have made that request and who might have objected to it and what ruling the Court might have made. Rather, this Court will enforce the orders it did enter, which are not ambiguous and do not support KMT's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   KMT, as the movant, has failed to establish that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
