The email dated June 20, 2017, at 10:05 a.m., from Debtor's counsel to counsel for Mohave County represented that the Debtor had been instructed \"to set up an auto pay to have a check cut on the 15\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   of every month so there are no issues ...\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Attached as Exhibit \"H\" to the Esplin Declaration is a copy of a subsequent email dated March 7, 2018, on the subject of the \"Verification of Payments by Mohave Agrarian Group.\" That email is from counsel for Mohave County to counsel for the Debtor. The email lists ten checks of various dates sent on behalf of the Debtor, as\n   well as the dates on which each check was received by Mohave County. Out of the first five checks listed, three were received by Mohave County after the 18th day of the relevant month (June, July and October). The last five checks listed apparently were received before they were due under the Assessor Note.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   At the hearing in this matter, Debtor conceded that the list of checks set forth in the March 7, 2018, email from counsel for Mohave County, accurately sets forth the dates that payments on the Assessor Note were received by the Mohave County Assessor.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Second Rhodes Declaration, \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Requested Relief Revisited.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The language in the Settlement Agreement was the result of substantial negotiations between the parties during the Trial Hiatus. Both the Debtor and its principal acknowledged that they were represented by legal counsel in drafting, negotiating, and executing the Settlement Agreement, and fully and clearly understood all of its terms and effects. The pertinent language certainly requires the Debtor's payments to the Mohave County Assessor to be \"\n   <em>\n    received ... on or before the due date\n   </em>\n   \" under the Assessor Note. The Settlement Agreement was approved by the court after noticed hearing and no appeal was taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The same language from the Settlement Agreement was included in the Third Amended Plan submitted for confirmation by the Debtor. The same language was included in the Confirmed Plan as well as in the Plan Confirmation Order submitted by the Debtor. No appeal was taken from the Plan Confirmation Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Contrail asserts that the first payment to Mohave County was due on May 17, 2017, under the language of Section 3 of the Assessor Note.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opposition at 13:17-19. Inasmuch as the first payment admittedly was received on June 26, 2017, Contrail maintains that the agreed requirements were not met, and the Option therefore terminated \"immediately and automatically\" and \"without further notice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:1-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Alternatively, Contrail argues that even if the first payment was due on June 19, 2017, and the 18th day of each month thereafter, the first payment still was not received by Mohave County until June 26, 2017, well after any ambiguity was resolved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opposition at 13:21 to 14:6. Under the language of the same Operative Documents, the Option immediately and automatically terminated without further notice. Moreover, even if the first payment was excused, the Option separately terminated as a result of the payments received after the 18th day in July 2017 and October 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:10-13 and 9:4-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Debtor does not dispute that on at least two occasions it missed the applicable payment deadline under the Assessor Note,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   discussion at 911-12,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , but argues that it should be excused from the consequence set forth in the Settlement Agreement, Confirmed Plan, and Plan Confirmation Order. That consequence by its express terms, however, was immediate and automatic, and therefore self-executing. This was the specific bargain\n   reached by the parties during the Trial Hiatus. If the settlement had not been reached, the trial on the First Amended Plan, Valuation Motion, Stay Relief Motion, Encore Sale Motion, and Hammer Sale Motion would have proceeded. Both sides took vastly different positions regarding the fair market value of the Arizona Property: Debtor's expert asserted that it was worth $31,400,000, while Contrail's expert asserted that it was worth $9,625,000. Both sides had much to lose inasmuch as the Debtor sought to confirm a dirt for debt plan over Contrail's objection, while Contrail sought relief from stay to foreclose on the entire Arizona Property. The uncertain outcomes, as well as the attendant legal expenses, were avoided by both parties through a carefully negotiated settlement that would be expressly incorporated in the Debtor's proposed plan of reorganization.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Debtor's request to be relieved from its agreement is based solely on Section 105(a) and FRBP 9019(a). As to the latter, the rule merely sets forth the manner in which approval of a settlement or compromise may be sought in a bankruptcy proceeding. FRBP 9019(a) does not, however, provide any basis or authority for granting relief from a settlement that previously was approved. The Settlement Approval Order was never appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As to the former, Section 105(a) provides in pertinent part that a bankruptcy court \"may issue any order ... that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of\" the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

In this case, the Confirmed Plan has been substantially, if not fully consummated, with the completion of the Arizona Property sale to Contrail.

The court cannot relieve any of the parties from the effect of the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As a matter of law, the Confirmed Plan cannot be modified. As a matter of law, the Confirmed Plan is binding. Under these circumstances, the court concludes that Section 105(a) does not permit the relief requested by the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   But even if the court was able to apply equitable considerations and maxims as a source of relief from the payment deadline, the court concludes that the relief requested by the Debtor is inappropriate. In this case, the Third Amended Plan that ultimately became the Confirmed Plan was proposed by the Debtor, rather than a creditor's committee or any other interested party. Irrespective of the statutory import of Section 1141(a), the doctrine of judicial estoppel would prevent the Debtor from asserting a position inconsistent with the express language of its Confirmed Plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire v. Maine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p750\">\n    532 U.S. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 750,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p750\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p750\">\n    149 L.Ed.2d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). But the Debtor in this case does not want to accept the consequences of the chosen language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Instead, the Debtor asserts the equitable maxim that \"equity abhors a forfeiture,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Motion at 9:17-21, and accuses Contrail of manufacturing a dispute and acting in bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion at 908-09,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . It even asserts that Mohave County has not declared a default on the Assessor Note in spite of the late payments,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Reply at 2:10 to 3:7, and that Contrail has no remedies available under the Assessor Note because it is not a party to the Assessor Note.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:8-9. Debtor's arguments, however, miss the point of giving effect to the express language chosen by contracting parties. No one forced the Debtor or Contrail to settle the various contested matters, and the creation of the Option was not an equitable remedy imposed by the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the arguments raised by the Debtor suggest why Contrail bargained for the specific language in the Settlement Agreement, Confirmed Plan, and Plan Confirmation Order: the time of delivery to, and receipt of the payments by, the Mohave County Assessor were entirely within the Debtor's control. Timely compliance was easily confirmable, and Mohave County's subsequent treatment of the payments under the Assessor Note was immaterial to the creation and preservation of the Option under the Settlement Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Immediate and automatic termination of the Option was the self-executing consequence of the Debtor's failure to meet a simple and clear requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, the court required Contrail to provide evidence of the legal expenses it has incurred in connection with the Motion so that the court could take such costs into account. While the amount incurred by Contrail might or might not pale in comparison to the legal fees incurred by the Debtor in this proceeding,\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   the record plainly establishes that this Chapter 11 proceeding essentially has involved a dispute between two well-funded and sophisticated parties. At its core, reorganization through Chapter 11 is intended by Congress to permit a debtor to pay its creditors, retain its employees, and preserve the equity of its investors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Debtor had no employee expenses and paid no salaries during the Chapter 11 proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The equity holders consisted of entities owned or controlled by the Debtor's principal, and the new equity holders are the same or similar entities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Disclosure Statement, Art. V, \u00a7 5.7(b)(1); Confirmed Plan, Art. I, \u00a7 1.66; Rhodes Confirmation Declaration at \u00b6 2. In other words, this Chapter 11 proceeding has done little to serve the purposes that Congress intended. Under these circumstances, granting the Debtor relief from the specific consequences of the very plan of reorganization that it negotiated has little or no equitable basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Because relief from requirements under Section 1127(b) and Section 1141(a) is not available under Section 105(a) nor under FRBP 9019(a), the court concludes that the Option terminated under the express terms of the Settlement Agreement, Confirmed Plan, and Plan Confirmation Order. Moreover, to the extent that equitable authority to grant relief exists, the Debtor has failed to meet its burden of persuasion and proof that equitable relief from the Settlement Agreement, Confirmed Plan, and Plan Confirmation Order is appropriate under the circumstances in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the instant Motion will be granted in part and denied in part.

Debtor's principal attested that an extensive hearing to confirm the plan would not be necessary because,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , there \"is nothing complex or obscure in the Plan and supporting documents.\" Id. at 6:26.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The Confirmed Plan consists of six classes of claims or interests, five of which are impaired.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Confirmed Plan, Art. II, \u00a7 2.3, 19:1 to 25:18. Contrail's Class \"2\" claim is treated in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. Mohave County Assessor's Class \"3\" claim is treated through the Assessor Note secured by the Arizona Property. The Class \"4\" unsecured claim of John Garrett receives no distribution. The Class \"5(a)\" claims of non-insider general unsecured creditors, as well as the Class \"5(b)\" of insider unsecured creditors Avery Land Group, f/k/a Kingman Farms, LLC, and Shumway Well Waters Systems, also receive no distribution. The Class \"6\" interests of former equity holders have their equity interests cancelled and receive no distribution.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    A copy of the \"Assessor Refinanced Secured Tax Promissory Note dated May 17, 2017\" (\"Assessor Note\") was attached as Exhibit \"3\" to the Second Rhodes Declaration. Under the Assessor Note, in the principal amount of $86,331.72, Debtor is the payor and the Mohave County Treasurer is the payee. The note is secured by the Arizona Property. It is signed by the Debtor through its manager, Truckee Springs Holdings, Inc. Because it is neither an obligor nor an obligee, Contrail is not a party to the Assessor Note.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    At the hearing on the Motion, however, Contrail requested that the court rule on the merits of the Debtor's request and did not object to the reopening of the Chapter 11 proceeding.

Assuming the Debtor is referring to a legal trap rather than a physical one, e.g., a hole in the ground covered with branches, it seems to ignore its express acknowledgment in the Settlement Agreement that it was represented by legal counsel and clearly understood all of its terms, provisions, and effects.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    note 10,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    . Also included in the Settlement Agreement was a provision releasing the Debtor's principal of his personal guaranty upon completion of the sale to Contrail, while providing the Option under express conditions. Even the Debtor's principal expressed that the Confirmed Plan and related documents contained nothing that was complex or obscure.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    note 5,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    . Moreover, it is somewhat odd for the Debtor to assert that it was the victim of a trap when its counsel specifically recommended easy steps to avoid falling into it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    note 15,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Contrail apparently incurred legal expenses in excess of $700,000 during the Chapter 11 proceeding,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Barbarich Declaration at \u00b6 9, and incurred another $19,328.00 in connection with the Debtor's instant Motion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Supplemental Noall Declaration at \u00b6 10.
