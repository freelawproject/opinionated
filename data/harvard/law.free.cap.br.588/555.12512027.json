The appearances of counsel were noted on the record. After arguments were presented, the matter was taken under submission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 28, 2010, a voluntary Chapter 11 petition was filed by Rafael Mirchou dba Alexa Professional Plaza, LLC (\"Debtor\"). (ECF No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 14, 2010, a proof of claim in the amount of $489,543.73 was filed by Real Time Resolutions, Inc. (\"Real Time\"),\n   secured by property located at 2021 S. Valadez Street, Las Vegas, Nevada 89117. That proof of claim (\"Real Time POC\") specifies that notices in connection with the creditor should be sent to: Agent for BAC (fka Countrywide), 1750 Regal Row, Suite 120, Dallas, TX 75235. Attached to the Real Time POC are copies of a Home Equity Credit Line Agreement and Disclosure Statement dated June 8, 2006, in the amount of $450,000, as well as a Deed of Trust of the same date, recorded on June 14, 2006 (\"Real Time DOT\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 28, 2010, a request for special notice was filed on behalf of Wachovia Bank, N.A.

Valdez\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Street, Las Vegas, Nevada 89117 (\"Valadez Property\"). On his secured creditor Schedule \"D,\" Debtor listed Wachovia as having a claim in the amount of $1,443,387 secured by a first mortgage against the Valadez Property. Debtor also listed Real Time as having a claim in the amount of $495,975.51,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   secured by the Valadez Property. Debtor also listed the value of the Valadez Property as $1,745,500, which was the same value shown for the same property on his Schedule \"A.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 9, 2010, a request for special notice was filed on behalf of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., aka Wachovia Mortgage, etc. (\"Wells Fargo\"). (ECF No. 31). On the same date, Wells Fargo filed a proof of claim in the amount of $1,498,741.88, secured by the Valadez Property. The proof of claim specifies that notices in connection with the creditor should be sent to: Pite Duncan, LLP, 4375 Jutland Drive, Suite 200, P.O. Box 17933, San Diego, California 92177-0933.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 13, 2010, a request for special notice was filed on behalf of The Bank of New York Mellon fka The Bank of New York, as Trustee for the Certificateholders of Cwalt, Inc., Alternative Loan Trust 2006-OA16, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-OA16.

On amended Schedules \"A\" and \"D,\" the value of the Valadez Property was shown as $1,200,000, rather than $1,745,500.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On amended Schedule \"D,\" Wells Fargo was listed as\n   having a claim in the amount of $1,498,741.88 secured by a first mortgage against the Valadez Property.

Debtor also listed Real Time as having a claim in the amount of $449,861, secured by a second mortgage against the Valadez Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 6, 2011, a request for special notice was filed on behalf of Bank of America, N.A., Successor by Merger to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP. (ECF No. 145).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 13, 2011, Debtor filed a Disclosure Statement (\"DS\"), Exhibit \"A\" to which is a proposed Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (\"Proposed Plan\"). (ECF No. 167). The DS states that under Class 1a of the Proposed Plan, the claim of Wells Fargo will be deemed fully secured, but that the Valadez Property will be sold through a court-approved short sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DS at 7:10-15. The Proposed Plan similarly indicates that in Class 1(a), the Valadez Property will be subject to a short sale, but that any unsecured portion of Wells Fargo's claim would be treated as an unsecured claim in Class 5 (which did not exist in the proposed plan).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Plan at 2:9-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 23, 2011, Debtor filed a motion to sell the Valadez Property (\"Valadez Sale Motion\") to a buyer identified as Jaldeep Daulat (\"Daulat\"). (ECF No. 168). The motion was noticed to be heard on January 25, 2012. (ECF No. 170). On the same date, Debtor filed a motion to employ a real estate broker for the sale to Daulat. (ECF No. 172). The latter motion also was noticed to be heard on January 25, 2012. (ECF No. 174).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 11, 2012, opposition to the Valadez Sale Motion was filed by the Debtor's estranged spouse, as well as by Wells Fargo. (ECF Nos. 178 and 179).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 23, 2012, Debtor filed a reply in support of the Valadez Sale Motion. (ECF No. 181).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On January 25, 2012, the Valadez Sale Motion was heard by the assigned bankruptcy judge who denied the motion, but granted the Debtor permission to sell the Debtor's interest in the Valadez Property. Debtor's bankruptcy counsel, however, did not submit a written order memorializing the court's ruling on the Valadez Sale Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On August 10, 2012, Debtor filed a Motion to Value Collateral, \"Strip Off\" and Modify Rights of Secured Creditors Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and \u00a7 1123 (\"Valuation Motion\").

(ECF No. 221). A certificate of service was filed by the Debtor's counsel (\"Service Certificate\") attesting that the Valuation Motion and Hearing Notice were electronically transmitted to counsel for various parties, were served by certified mail on Wells Fargo, and were\n   served by first class mail on counsel for various entities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 226).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On August 29, 2012, Debtor filed a First Amended Disclosure Statement (\"FAD\") to which was attached another proposed Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (\"Second Proposed Plan\"). (ECF No. 235). The FAD disclosed that the Valadez Property will be surrendered to the holder of the secured claim under Class 2(f) and any deficiency would be treated as unsecured debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAD at 9:22-28. The attached plan similarly indicated that the Valadez Property would be surrendered and specified that Wells Fargo held the first mortgage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Proposed Plan at 29:13-19. A notice was filed scheduling a hearing to approve the FAD for October 24, 2012. (ECF No. 237).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On September 13, 2012, an order was entered granting the Valuation Motion (\"Valuation Order\"). (ECF No. 240). The Valuation Order was prepared and submitted by Debtor's bankruptcy counsel. Attached to the Valuation Order is the same certification under Local Rule 9021(c) that was attached to the proposed order accompanying the Valuation Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   note 6,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . In addition to granting the Valuation Motion, the order includes the following provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the [Valadez] Property is valued at NINE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ZERO CENTS ($950,000.00) and it is further\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that REAL TIME RESOLUTIONS, INC., Account No.\n   <strong>\n    xxxxx9392\n   </strong>\n   (Second Mortgage and/or Second Deed of Trust) is avoided, \"stripped off\" and extinguished, as a wholly unsecured second lien pursuant to section 506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and it is further\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that REAL TIME RESOLUTIONS, INC., Account No.\n   <strong>\n    xxxxx9392\n   </strong>\n   (Second Mortgage and/or Second Deed of Trust) secured rights and/or lien-holder rights in the [Valadez] Property are hereby terminated; and it is further\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Debtor must complete the Chapter 11 plan and receive a discharge or the full lien may be reinstated; and it is further\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that as provided by Fed.

(ECF Nos. 245, 247, and 248).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On October 31, 2012, an order was entered denying approval of the FAD. (ECF No. 260).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On December 31, 2012, Debtor filed a Second Amended Disclosure Statement (\"SAD\") to which was attached another proposed Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (\"Third Proposed Plan\"). (ECF No. 267).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The SAD states that the Valadez Property will be surrendered to the holder\n   of the secured claim under Class 2(f) and any deficiency would be treated as unsecured debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAD at 11:9-16. The attached plan similarly indicated that the Valadez Property would be surrendered and specified that Wells Fargo held the first mortgage. It also specified that the unsecured portion of Wells Fargo's claim would be treated in unsecured Class 5.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Proposed Plan at 31:9-16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notices were filed scheduling a hearing to approve the SAD (as amended) for February 27, 2013. (ECF Nos. 270 and 272).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On February 12, 2013, a motion for relief from stay was filed by Wells Fargo with respect to the Valadez Property. (ECF No. 292). A notice was filed scheduling a hearing for March 30, 2013. (ECF No. 293).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On February 13 and February 16, 2013, objections to approval of the SAD were filed. (ECF Nos. 298 and 305).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On March 27, 2013, an order was entered granting Wells Fargo relief from stay with respect to the Valadez Property. (ECF No. 317).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On August 1, 2013, the Office of the United States Trustee (\"UST\") filed a motion to dismiss the Chapter 11 proceeding (\"Dismissal Motion\"). (ECF No. 333).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On August 8, 2013, Debtor filed a Third Amended Disclosure Statement (\"TAD\") to which was attached another proposed Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (\"Fourth Proposed Plan\"). (ECF No. 344). The TAD disclosed that the Valadez Property would be surrendered in some fashion under Class 1 to permit the Debtor's former wife to attempt to refinance or modify the loan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAD at 8:6-20. The attached plan similarly indicated that the Valadez Property would be surrendered in some fashion, but represented that the Valadez Property had an estimated value of $1,642,276. Additionally, Debtor's proposed plan represented that there was a second position lienholder that would have an unsecured claim of $150,972.63 treated along with other unsecured creditors in Class 11.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fourth Proposed Plan at 31:5-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On August 9, 2013, the court entered an order denying the Debtor's request for conditional approval of the TAD and to set an expedited hearing on confirmation of the Fourth Proposed Plan. (ECF No. 357). Because the request for an expedited hearing was denied, the hearing on disclosure statement approval was scheduled to be held on October 9, 2013. (ECF No. 360).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On August 12, 2013, the UST filed a notice scheduling a hearing on its Dismissal Motion for October 9, 2013, i.e., the same date as the hearing on approval of the TAD. (ECF No. 359).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On September 25, 2013, objections to approval of the TAD were filed by various parties. (ECF Nos. 372, 375, 376, 377, and 378).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On October 9, 2013, the court concluded at the hearing that the Chapter 11 proceeding should be converted to Chapter 7. As a result, the court also denied approval of the TAD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On October 18, 2013, the court entered an order converting the Chapter 11 proceeding to a Chapter 7. (ECF No. 397). On the same date, a notice was issued informing parties in interest that a meeting of creditors in the Chapter 7 proceeding would be held on November 18, 2013, that a deadline to file proofs of claim in the Chapter 7 proceeding had been set for February 18, 2014, and that Brian D. Shapiro had been appointed as Chapter 7 trustee\n   (\"Trustee\") to administer the estate. (ECF No. 399).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On October 22, 2013, an order was entered denying approval of the TAD. (ECF No. 404).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On October 30, 2013, Debtor's bankruptcy counsel filed applications for approval of final compensation for services rendered in the Chapter 11 case. (ECF Nos. 408 and 410). Notice of the applications and of the hearing date (ECF Nos. 409 and 411) was served on the Debtor and all parties in interest. (ECF Nos. 412 and 414). The applications were granted by orders entered on December 16, 2013 and December 23, 2013 (\"Fee Orders\"). (ECF Nos. 428 and 430).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On January 13, 2014, Debtor filed his amended Schedules and SOFA (\"Post-Conversion Schedules\"). (ECF No. 431)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On January 30, 2014, the Trustee filed objections to exemptions that the Debtor claimed in his ownership interests in various entities (\"Exemption Objection\"). (ECF No. 454).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On March 12, 2014, an order was entered sustaining the Trustee's Exemption Objection.

(ECF No. 533).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   A notice of hearing was filed scheduling the Motion to be heard on May 16, 2018. (ECF No. 537).

(ECF No. 541).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Real Time seeks to reopen the Debtor's Chapter 7 proceeding under FRBP 5010\"in order to further administer the assets of the Bankruptcy Estate - specifically the [Valadez] Property and the [Real Time deed of trust].\" Motion at 3:5-6. After the Debtor received his discharge, and acting as Trustee of the Villa Roma Trust, Debtor apparently sold the Valadez Property to Daulat in March 2016 without satisfying the lien under the Real Time DOT.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:20-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In October 2017, Daulat commenced the State Action apparently seeking declaratory relief to quiet title to the Valadez Property. Daulat named Real Time as a defendant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   in addition to RRA CP Opportunity Trust 1, the Debtor, the Debtor's former wife, and the Villa Roma Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In February 2018, the Daulat MSJ was filed, and the Real Time MSJ was filed the following month. In connection with those proceedings, Daulat has asserted that the Real Time DOT against the Valadez Property was \"stripped off\" or otherwise voided as a result of the Valuation Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Real Time asserted that the result was conditioned on the Debtor obtaining a Chapter 11 discharge, which he failed to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On April 10, 2018, the State Court conducted an initial hearing on the summary judgment motions. The day before the hearing, however, Real Time apparently filed an emergency motion to stay the proceedings so that clarification of the Valuation Order could be sought from the bankruptcy court. The State Court granted the emergency motion and continued the summary judgment motions for a status check to be held on July 24, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Real Time's instant Motion is brought under FRBP 5010 which permits a case to be reopened on the motion of a party in interest \"pursuant to \u00a7 350(b) of the Code.\" F ED .

Under the latter statutory provision, a case may be reopened \"to administer assets, to accord relief to the debtor, or for other cause.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20350\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The decision to reopen a case is committed to the discretion of the bankruptcy court,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Elias v.

Instead, he argues that the State Court has concurrent jurisdiction to interpret the bankruptcy court's order and that Real Time's request to reopen the Chapter 7 proceeding therefore should be denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opposition at 8:11 to 9:18. Even though Real Time does not seek relief from the Valuation Order under FRCP 60(b), Daulat also argues that relief under that rule is time barred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:1-28. More important, and notwithstanding his position that the State Court should interpret the Valuation Order, Daulat argues that the subject order actually resulted in the so-called \"stripping\" of Real Time's lien against the Valadez Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:19 to 13:21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The court, having considered the written and oral arguments of counsel, together with the record presented, concludes that the bankruptcy case should be reopened and that the Valuation Order did not result in the avoidance of the lien created by the Real Time DOT. The court reaches these conclusions for a number of reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , reopening the Chapter 7 case is appropriate for cause shown by\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   Real Time and Daulat. The court agrees with Daulat that reopening the case is not necessary to permit the Trustee to administer assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Id. at 8:1-10. There is no question that the Valadez Property was disclosed during the bankruptcy proceeding and that the Trustee had full knowledge of the asset.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TFR, Form 1, Ref. 5. Because the Trustee exercised his discretion not to liquidate the Valadez Property, any interest of the bankruptcy estate was administratively abandoned to the Debtor when the case was closed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20554\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), and the Trustee has no further interest in this proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Debtor also does not oppose reopening the case. It appears that the Debtor was served with the instant Motion and has not filed written opposition, nor did he appear at the hearing to contest the relief requested. Debtor has received his Chapter 7 discharge, and reopening the case is not necessary to provide additional relief to the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Both Daulat and Real Time, however, seek to apply the Valuation Order in their respective favor, and have repeated virtually all of the arguments raised before the State Court in their summary judgment motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ordinarily, the bankruptcy court that enters an order is in the best position to interpret its meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Real Time and Daulat have not requested changes in the language of the Valuation Order, but only an interpretation that favors their respective legal positions.

The Real Time POC specified that notices in connection with its claim were to be sent to a specific address in Dallas, Texas. There is nothing in the record indicating that a request for special notice was filed in the case by any attorneys on behalf of Real Time. The Service Certificate supporting the Valuation Motion evidences only that Wells Fargo was served by certified mail, that two entities other than Real Time (BAC Home Loan Servicing LP and Ascension Capital Group) were served by regular mail, that six law firms that previously entered appearances on behalf of entities other than Real Time also were served by regular mail, and that various attorneys and the UST were served by the ECF system. Under Local Rule 5005(c)(4), electronic service of notice to an attorney does not constitute service on the client unless the attorney is authorized to accept service by the client. Likewise, under Local Rule 5005(e)(4), an attorney's waiver of any right to receive notice by first class mail or personal service does not constitute an agreement to accept service or notice on behalf of a client. Under these circumstances, it is questionable whether Real Time ever received adequate or perhaps even any prior notice of the Valuation Motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , the Post-Conversion Schedules filed by the Debtor lists the Debtor's assets and liabilities as of January 13, 2014.

In his amended Schedule \"F,\" Debtor does not list Real Time, Bank of America, or Wells Fargo as having unsecured claims for any deficiency.

The docket of the bankruptcy case discloses no effort by the Trustee to avoid the Real Time DOT under Sections 544, 545, 547, 548, 549, or 724(a). Likewise, the record discloses no efforts by the Debtor to avoid the lien created by the Real Time DOT as impairing an exemption available under Section 522.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the record discloses that no party in interest objected to the Real Time POC at any time during the Debtor's Chapter 7 proceeding.

Neither dispute that while he was in Chapter 11, Debtor was a debtor in possession who had all of the avoiding powers of a bankruptcy trustee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201107\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Finally, the record discloses that neither the Debtor nor any other party in interest objected to the Real Time POC at any time during the Chapter 11 proceeding. As a result, the Real Time POC was deemed allowed under Section 502(a) during the Chapter 11 proceeding and the lien created by the Real Time DOT, therefore, was not void under Section 506(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The only remaining question is whether the Debtor otherwise achieved an avoidance of the Real Time DOT while he was attempting reorganization under Chapter 11. Clearly he did not. The record reflects that none of the Chapter 11 plans proposed by the Debtor included a so-called \"lien strip\" of Real Time's secured claim. Debtor's original Proposed Plan provided for the Valadez Property to be sold at a short sale, rather than being retained by the Debtor sans the Real Time junior lien.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion at 557-58,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Debtor's Second Proposed Plan provided for the Valadez Property to be surrendered to Wells Fargo in full satisfaction of Wells Fargo's secured claim, rather than being retained by the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion at 559,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Debtor's Third Proposed Plan also provided for the Valadez Property to be surrendered to Wells Fargo in full satisfaction of Wells Fargo's secured claim, rather than being retained by the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion at 559-60,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Debtor's Fourth (and last) Proposed Plan also provided for the Valadez Property to be surrendered, apparently to his former wife, rather than being retained by the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion at 559-61,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Nowhere in any of the Debtor's proposed Chapter 11 plans did he propose to void Real Time's lien against the Valadez Property,\n   nor did any of the proposed plans subsequent to the entry of the Valuation Order incorporate by reference any of the terms of the Valuation Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Elimination of Real Time's lien through a proposed plan of reorganization would have been an alteration of Real Time's rights under its deed of trust, thereby giving Real Time an impaired claim under Section 1124. As previously discussed at 567-68,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Debtor would have been required to solicit Real Time's acceptance of his proposed Chapter 11 plan. Real Time could have rejected its treatment under the proposed plan, thereby requiring Debtor to meet the cramdown requirements for plan confirmation under Section 1129(b), including the \"fair and equitable treatment\" of Real Time's claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Real Time also could have objected to plan confirmation, thereby requiring the Debtor to either pay all of the unsecured portion of Real Time's claim in full, or, to pay all of the Debtor's projected disposable income over at least five years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(15).\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, Debtor took none of the steps required in the bankruptcy reorganization process contemplated by\n   <em>\n    Dewsnup\n   </em>\n   to permit \"an involuntary reduction of the amount of a creditor's lien for any reason other than payment on the debt.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227736\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/410/#p419\">\n    502 U.S. at 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6507836\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/112/773/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is not surprising then that even the Debtor recognized that Real Time's claim was still secured by the Valadez Property when he filed his Post-Conversion Schedules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Valuation Order contemplated that any final benefit received by the Debtor was conditioned upon completion of a Chapter 11 plan and his receipt of a discharge. This was consistent with the requirements for an individual to obtain a discharge in Chapter 11.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5). That such benefit would include an \"avoidance, strip off, extinguishment, or termination\" of Real Time's rights under its deed of trust,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   discussion at 559,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , is appropriate because no part of its claim was secured under Section 506(a), and its allowed unsecured claim would be discharged upon completion of a Chapter 11 plan. That legal result would have occurred after discharge regardless of the effective date of the Valuation Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   That the Debtor failed to confirm a Chapter 11 plan and failed to obtain a Chapter 11 discharge did not prevent him from subsequently attempting to \"strip\" Real Time's lien through another bankruptcy reorganization. As previously discussed,\n   the Chapter 7 discharge relieved the Debtor of his personal liability for his prebankruptcy debts, but did not affect the liens. Debtor originally filed his Chapter 11 petition on September 28, 2010. The conversion of his Chapter 11 proceeding to Chapter 7 related back to the petition date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20348\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).
