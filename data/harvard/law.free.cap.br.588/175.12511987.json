The Plan, as amended by the Plan Supplement and modified at the hearing, is confirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Debtors' Business\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Debtors lease used semi-trucks, purchased on the wholesale market, to independent owner-operators through a weekly renewable rental program with an option to purchase. Operating out of Gulfport, Mississippi, Debtors have developed a national market, leasing trucks from a commercial fleet to individuals from more than thirty states. Revenue sources include rental fees, forfeited deposits, compliance and other fees, and vehicle sales to contracted renters and other customers. One Debtor partners with the renters on the operation, use, and repair of the trucks and constantly updates the fleet; the other Debtor generates revenue from vehicle repairs and sales, acting as a dealer for the sale of the fleet's inventory as it ages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Modification in the Plan Supplement Is Immaterial.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   PACCAR Financial Corp. asserts two arguments in opposition to the Plan Supplement. First, PACCAR argues that the Plan Supplement materially changes the terms of the Plan by moving twelve of its trucks from the operable (\"keep\") list to the inoperable (\"return\") list and moving four other trucks from the inoperable list to the operable list,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   thereby changing the amounts of PACCAR's secured and unsecured claims; and by using \"orderly liquidation value\" instead of \"replacement value\" for the unsecured claims' initial value. Second, Paccar argues that the Plan Supplement was insufficiently noticed because it was filed the Friday before a long holiday weekend, with confirmation set for the following Tuesday. Both arguments fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The proponent of a chapter 11 plan may modify the plan \"at any time before confirmation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

PACCAR similarly is not aggrieved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Notwithstanding the modification's immateriality, the Plan Proponents have offered PACCAR a concession. In their post-hearing brief, they agree to remove six trucks from the return list and to also take into account a seventh truck that is the subject of an insurance dispute with PACCAR. According to the Plan Proponents, this concession would reduce the Plan Supplement's impact on PACCAR's claims, decreasing the net difference between the pre- and post-modification Plan to $60,000-a 2% change.

Only Warmimi put on expert testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Warmimi's expert is certified in machinery and equipment appraisal, but has no particular expertise in semi-trucks and only three years' experience, two of which were spent in an apprenticeship. On cross-examination, he testified that he had appeared as an expert witness half-a-dozen times, but never in bankruptcy court. He also said he had no specific knowledge about the semi-truck leasing business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   He testified that the trucks should be valued at fair market value, defined as what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller when neither is under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both have reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts about the property. He derived this value using the market data approach, in which he looked at other trucks of the same year, make, and model and what they sold for on the open market. He then selected a value between the comparables as the replacement value for the trucks. He further testified that although he did not use the income approach to valuation, he did calculate the future financial benefit of rental income as a hypothetical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Plan Proponent's expert has been an appraiser for 35 years and has served for the past 20 years as the director of appraisal services for a company that performs appraisals of over-the-road equipment for national lenders, carriers, and lessors. He estimated that over the past ten years, he has performed $70-80 billion in appraisals. His curriculum vitae includes a list of law firms that have hired him as an expert witness and courts in which he has testified, including bankruptcy courts in ten jurisdictions. He appraised the Debtors' fleet in 2014 and again in 2017 and is familiar with how their business and others like it operate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   He testified that the trucks should be valued at 10% below orderly liquidation value (OLV). This value assumes the seller is under some time duress. Like Warmimi's expert, the Plan Proponent's expert used the market approach, but he then triangulated the values. He searched for both retail asking prices and auction sales, then adjusted downward from the retail prices and slightly upward from the auction\n   sales to get the OLV, from which he then derived the replacement value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The difference of opinion between Warmimi's expert and the Plan Proponent's expert boils down to retail value versus wholesale value. In arguing for retail value, Warmimi emphasizes that the standard under\n   <em>\n    Rash\n   </em>\n   is the price a willing buyer would pay to obtain like property from a\n   <em>\n    willing\n   </em>\n   seller, and a willing seller would expect more for its equipment than a seller under the duress implicit in OLV. But Warmimi fails to appreciate that the Debtors are not buying trucks at retail; the Debtors routinely buy at wholesale, which is even less than OLV. As the Plan Proponent's expert recognized, the Debtors have to buy on the wholesale market, because buying retail would eat up their profit margin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court finds the Plan Proponent's expert more credible because of his decades of experience, his specialization in over-the-road equipment, and his understanding of how the Debtors use the trucks. Accordingly, the Court accepts his opinion as to the replacement value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    C.

Secured Creditors in Classes 3 and 4 will receive both actual property as the indubitable equivalent of their claims and deferred payments on collateral that is not returned at the replacement valuation with interest while retaining their liens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Based on legislative history and applicable case law, this Court finds that the alternative treatments delineated in \u00a7 1129(a)(2)(A) are neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive. In the absence of specific statutory authority prohibiting the Plan's treatment of secured truck claims, the Court finds that the treatment of these claims does not unfairly discriminate and is fair and equitable under the Plan as required by \u00a7\u00a7 1129(b)(1) and (b)(2). The objections to the treatment of secured truck claims are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Because the Plan as modified by the Plan Supplement does not discriminate unfairly and is fair and equitable as defined under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) with respect to each impaired rejecting class, confirmation is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that all objections are\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULED\n   </strong>\n   and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the plan proponents submit a proposed Order of Confirmation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    All capitalized words are terms defined either in the Opinion and Order, the Plan, or the Plan Supplement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    PACCAR Financial Corp.

The Reorganized Debtors will keep the operable trucks. As to the inoperable trucks, the Reorganized Debtors will, at the option of the creditor, either return them to the creditor in exchange for a credit or will sell them, with the creditor receiving part of the proceeds.

The Plan Proponents asserted the figure was approximately $246,000.00. The Yolo Group stated in its Supplemental Memorandum in Support of Confirmation that the Plan Proponents would be willing to reduce the difference in value between the keep list and the return list caused by the Plan Modification by removing some trucks from the return list, thereby reducing the difference to approximately $60,450.00.
