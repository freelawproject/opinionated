Crowley and First Class Printing, Inc. (together, the \"Defendants\"); (2) the \"Response in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony\" (Docket No. 157, the \"Response\") filed by Jeffrey A. Weinman, as Chapter 7 Trustee for the Estate of Peter H. Blair, Sr. (the \"Chapter 7 Trustee\"); and (3) the \"Reply in Support of Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony\" (Docket No. 158, the \"Reply\") filed by the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the Motion to Exclude, the Defendants requested that the Court exclude proposed expert testimony from Mark Dennis, an expert accounting witness whose testimony the Chapter 7 Trustee intends to offer at trial on the issue of the purported insolvency of the Debtor, Peter H. Blair, Sr. (the \"Debtor\"), as of May 7, 2011. In the Response, the Chapter 7 Trustee opposed exclusion of the testimony of Mr. Dennis and argued that the anticipated testimony would be reliable and relevant. Thereafter, the Court conducted an evidentiary\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing on the Motion to Exclude and Response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Based upon the arguments in the Motion to Exclude and the Response, as well as the evidence submitted with the Motion to Exclude and Response and at the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing, the Court determines that Mark Dennis qualifies as an expert in the area of accounting and insolvency by reason of his specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, and education. Furthermore, in assessing the Debtor's solvency, Mr. Dennis purports to employ an accepted methodology: a fair value balance sheet approach. However, while paying lip-service to the fair value balance sheet method, Mr. Dennis does not have sufficient facts or data, as required by such method. Further, he fails to properly apply the method to the collected facts and data. As a result, Mark Dennis' expert opinion on the Debtor's solvency is unreliable. Furthermore, the proffered expert opinion is irrelevant because it does not assist the Court (as the trier of fact) to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. Accordingly, the Court excludes the opinion testimony of Mark Dennis and will not consider such proffered testimony at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Procedural and Factual Background\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Bankruptcy Case and Adversary Proceeding\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Debtor filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on May 7, 2015 in the case captioned:\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peter H. Blair\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 15-15008 TBM (Bankr. D. Colo.) (the \"Bankruptcy Case\"). Shortly after initiating the Bankruptcy Case, the Debtor died. (Docket No. 106 in Bankruptcy Case.) Thereafter, the Court converted the Bankruptcy Case from a Chapter 11 reorganization to a Chapter 7 liquidation. (Docket No. 141 in Bankruptcy Case.) On August 20, 2015, the United States Trustee appointed Jeffrey A. Weinman as the Chapter 7 Trustee for the Debtor's estate in the Bankruptcy Case. (Docket No. 143 in the Bankruptcy Case.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   About two years after the commencement of the Bankruptcy Case, the Chapter 7 Trustee initiated this Adversary Proceeding against Suella M. Crowley (\"Crowley\"), the Debtor's widow, and First Class Printing, Inc. (\"First Class\"), an entity allegedly affiliated with Crowley. (Docket No. 1.) As set forth in the operative \"Amended Complaint\" (Docket No. 6), the Chapter 7 Trustee asserts five claims against Crowley and three overlapping claims against First Class. The Chapter 7 Trustee alleges that the Debtor: (1) gave at least $8,144 in cash to Crowley (the \"Cash Transfers\"); (2) transferred at least $55,762 to Crowley through First Class (the \"Business Transfers\"); and (3) paid $358,593 to satisfy Crowley's mortgage on her home (the \"Real Property\") located at 2777 South Elmira Street, Denver, Colorado. Based on these allegations, the Chapter 7 Trustee claims that the Debtor made the Cash Transfers and the Business Transfers with actual intent to defraud in violation of Colorado Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (the \"CUFTA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. First and Fifth Claims and COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 38-8-105(1)(a). He also asserts that the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers constitute constructive fraud under the CUFTA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. Second and Sixth Claims and COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 38-8-105(1)(b). Further, the Chapter 7 Trustee seeks to \"preserv[e] any and all avoided transfers,\" disallow Crowley's claim in the Bankruptcy Case, and obtain a declaratory judgment that the Debtor owned at least half of the Real Property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. Third, Fourth, Seventh and Eighth Claims. The Defendants answered and denied any liability. (Docket No. 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After completion of the pleadings, the Court issued its \"Scheduling Order under Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b) and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7016\" (Docket No. 37, the \"Scheduling Order\"), pursuant to which the Court set the case for a three-day trial commencing on August 6, 2018. Subsequently, the parties engaged in numerous discovery skirmishes. But the discovery deadlines now have passed, and the Adversary Proceeding will be proceeding to trial in short order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Motion to Exclude, Response, and\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n    Hearing\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Debtor's financial position (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   whether solvent or insolvent) at the time of the allegedly fraudulent transfers is a central issue in this Adversary Proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 38-8-105(2)(i) (consideration may be given to whether \"the debtor was insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was made\"). Accordingly, the Chapter 7 Trustee engaged Mark Dennis as an expert witness on solvency issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 16, 2018, Mr. Dennis issued a \"Solvency Opinion\" (the \"Expert Report\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was disclosed in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B) and (D), as incorporated by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7026, and the Scheduling Order. In the Expert Report, Mr. Dennis opined that the Debtor \"was clearly insolvent as of May 7, 2011 .... and no information has been provided to indicate that he became solvent thereafter.\" Expert Report at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thereafter, the Defendants filed the Motion to Exclude. The Defendants argue that Mark Dennis' expert testimony, as disclosed in the Expert Report, should be excluded as unreliable and irrelevant under Fed. R. Evid. 702,\n   <em>\n    Daubert,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Kumho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132917\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/137/\">\n    526 U.S. 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132917\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/137/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In further support of the Motion to Exclude, the Defendants\n   attach the Expert Report, the transcript of the deposition of Mark Dennis (hereinafter cited as \"Dennis Dep. at ___\"), excerpts from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, excerpts from the deposition of Peter H. [Hy] Blair, and an email. In the Response, the Chapter 7 Trustee opposes exclusion of the testimony of Mark Dennis. In support of the Response, the Chapter 7 Trustee attaches an Affidavit of Mark Dennis (hereinafter cited as \"Dennis Aff. \u00b6 ___\"), a pleading from a state court probate action, and a letter. Notably, the Chapter 7 Trustee does not object to consideration of the materials submitted by the Defendants, including, among other things, the Dennis Deposition Transcript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Neither the Defendants nor the Chapter 7 Trustee requested an evidentiary\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing in the Motion to Exclude or Response. However, to protect the due process rights of the parties, and consistent with controlling precedent of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the Court afforded a further opportunity for the parties to request an evidentiary\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing. (Docket No. 164.) Subsequently, the Chapter 7 Trustee requested a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing. (Docket No. 168.) The Court conducted a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing on August 1, 2018, during which it received additional evidence including the testimony of Mark Dennis and a copy of a book offered by the Chapter 7 Trustee: Israel Shaked and Robert F. Reilly,\n   <em>\n    A Practical Guide to Bankruptcy Valuation\n   </em>\n   239 (ABI, 2d ed., 2017) [hereinafter \"\n   <em>\n    Valuation Practical Guide\n   </em>\n   \"].

During the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing, he testified that he performed work in about 500 bankruptcy cases and performed \"valuations\" in nine of such bankruptcy cases. He was unclear whether the \"valuation\" work included solvency analysis. In any event, there was no showing made by the Chapter 7 Trustee that Mr. Dennis has ever previously testified in any court as an expert on solvency. The Chapter 7 Trustee also did not establish that solvency analysis (as distinct from general \"valuation\") was part of Mark Dennis' education, training, or work. Instead, Mr. Dennis engaged in what appears to have been a high-profile international career in the derivates industry in which he traded futures and\n   options and worked in sales and business development. None of that experience bears on determining solvency. Then, he changed his career. He has been at Dennis &amp; Co., P.C., only a few years.

The Court assesses Mark Dennis' qualifications to issue a solvency opinion as rather weak. He appears to be a tax and general accounting practitioner with no specialized \"knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\" about solvency analysis. However, in the Motion to Exclude, the Defendants did not contest Mark Dennis' qualifications. Accordingly, in the absence of any objections to his qualifications, the Court determines that Mark Dennis passes the qualifications step (but just barely) because he has some \"knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,\" generally in finance, economics, and accounting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Fair Value Balance Sheet Methodology\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Methodology\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The initial judicial inquiry centers on identification of the methodology.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crabbe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3647232\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/556/1217/#p1220\">\n    556 F.Supp.2d at 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But it is a method identified - even mandated - in law. Mark Dennis relied on the definition of the term \"insolvent\" contained in Section 101(32)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 101(32)(A) states that, with respect to persons\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (such as the Debtor), the term \"insolvent\" means:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   ... [a] financial condition such that the sum of such [person's] debts is greater than all of such [person's] property, at a fair valuation, exclusive of - (i) property transferred, concealed, or removed with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud such [person's] creditors; and (ii) property that may be exempted from property of the estate under section 522 of this title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Mark Dennis never explained why he relied on the Bankruptcy Code definition of \"insolvent\" for purposes of choosing a methodology. The Chapter 7 Trustee's fraudulent transfer claims in the Amended Complaint are based upon Colorado law. So, Colorado law (the CUFTA) provides the substantive law governing the solvency issues. But, fortunately for Mr. Dennis, the definition of \"insolvent\" under the Bankruptcy Code is very similar to the definition of \"insolvent\" under Colorado law. COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 38-8-103 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (1) A debtor is insolvent if the sum of the debtor's debts is greater than all of the debtor's assets at a fair valuation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (2) A debtor who is generally not paying his debts as they become due is presumed to be insolvent ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (4) Assets under this section do not include property that has been transferred, concealed, or removed with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors or that has been transferred in a manner making the transfer voidable under this article.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Furthermore, under COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 38-8-102(2)(b), an \"asset\" does not include \"[p]roperty to the extent that it is generally exempt immediately prior to the time of transfer under nonbankruptcy law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Thus, under both Colorado law and the Bankruptcy Code, the fair value balance sheet method is essentially mandated for individuals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CB Richard Ellis, Inc. v.

The authors of\n   <em>\n    Valuation Practical Guide\n   </em>\n   (a publication upon which the Chapter 7 Trustee relies) also endorse the fair value balance sheet method although they use slightly different terminology: the \"asset-accumulation [AA] method\" which is one of the methods used in the \"asset-based approach\" for valuing businesses.\n   <em>\n    Valuation Practical Guide\n   </em>\n   at 227-259.

But that left five more active financial accounts of the Debtor as of May 7, 2011: \"UBS X3623\"; \"Capital One Bank\"; \"Chase Credit Card\"; \"KeyBank Portland\"; and \"Gorham Savings Bank.\" Next to each of these financial accounts on the balance sheet, Mark Dennis noted: \"No data available.\" In the body of the Expert Report, Mark Dennis wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   References were made in the materials to five additional accounts owned by Mr. Blair, however no data was available in the materials to show the balances of these accounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Expert Report at 3. To his credit, Mark Dennis asked the Chapter 7 Trustee's counsel for data on the missing bank accounts. Dennis Dep. at 19:1-21:16. However, the Chapter 7 Trustee's counsel told him that the data was not available and instructed him \"to proceed based on what I had.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:25-20:5. So, what did Mark Dennis do in the absence of the bank account information? He simply concluded that all five of the financial accounts with no data should be valued at \"$ 0.\" This was rank speculation. Mark Dennis just as easily could have guessed that such financial accounts had $5, $5,000, $500,000, or more. But it is undisputed that he simply had no facts or data about the five bank accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In the \"Investments\" category of the Expert Report, Mark Dennis listed two other assets of the Debtor: (1) his equity interest in Blair Oil Investments, LLC (\"BOI\"); and (2) his equity interest in BPI Partners LLC (\"BPI Partners\"). Expert Report at 3-4. With respect to the Debtor's\n   equity in BOI, Mr. Dennis apparently attempted to value such equity under a fair value balance sheet approach just as he had for the Debtor. Expert Report at 3 (\"a comparative balance sheet has been prepared for 2010 and 2011 [for BOI]\"); Expert Report, App. III.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the Daubert hearing, he conceded that a proper equity valuation on a balance sheet method for BOI would require determining the fair market value of all of BOI's assets and then subtracting the entity's liabilities.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Dennis Dep. at 61-62. But he was not able to follow such method because he had no information to do so. Mark Dennis testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Q: ... if one is using the balance sheet approach to valuing an asset like BOI, one would use the market value of its assets, not the book value, correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   A: Ideally, yes, if the information is available.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Q. Yes. What information was made available to you about the market value of BOI's assets?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   A. None.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61:21-62:4;\n   <em>\n    see also Id\n   </em>\n   . at 66:16-67:12 (Mark Dennis stated that he \"used a balance sheet approach [for BOI] to make my judgment\" but \"didn't pursue trying to obtain\" data on the market value of BOI's assets because \"obtaining additional information in the context of this project was going to be very difficult\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   With insufficient information, what did Mark Dennis do? First, he created a balance sheet for BOI based on book values, rather than fair market values for assets. He did this even though he acknowledged that at least \"sometimes\" book values bear little relationship with fair market values. Dennis Dep. at 59:25.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   And then he departed from the accepted methodology and simply assumed that because BOI had suffered losses in 2010 and 2011 (and had total accumulated capital contributions of $4,935,699), the Debtor's equity in BOI should be valued at $0. But, again, it is clear that Mr. Dennis lacked information to perform the fair market value balance sheet method that he himself had selected. So, he altered the methodology. Alteration of an established methodology is a \"step that renders the analysis unreliable [and] renders the expert's testimony inadmissible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    Goebel v.

Thus, Mark Dennis lacked sufficient information to satisfy the valuation methodology he himself identified for BOI and didn't pursue the other generally accepted methods of valuation because the exercise was \"not worthwhile.\" Dennis Dep. at 64:10-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   With respect to BPI Partners, Mark Dennis was required to value the Debtor's equity in the entity as of May 7, 2011. But he had only two scraps of data about BPI Partners. First, the Debtor valued his equity interest in BPI Partners at $156,164 in 2015 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , about 4 years after the May 7, 2011 valuation date). Second, the Debtor showed no income or loss for the entity on his 2011 tax return. Mr. Dennis confirmed that \"no other information is available about this investment.\" Expert Report at 4. Again, Mark Dennis lacked the data required to perform the fair market balance sheet method he himself espoused. He also did not utilize any other generally accepted methodology for valuing BPI Partners. So, in the absence of sufficient information, he just used a number supplied by the Debtor four years later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   After Mark Dennis purported to identify and value assets, he did the same for the Debtor's liabilities. In the Expert Report, he indicated that the Debtor's principal liability was $2,298,346 based upon the \"ARB Trust Judgment.\" The other liabilities identified by Mark Dennis paled in comparison to the \"ARB Trust Judgment.\" The ARB Trust Judgment is a judgment entered on March 27, 2015 by the Probate Court for the City and County of Denver, Colorado in the probate proceeding:\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Audrey R. Blair Revocable Trust, GST-Exempt Marital Trust, and Non-Exempt Marital Trust\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 12-PR-2227. Expert Report at 1. In his analysis, Mr. Dennis used the ARB Trust Judgment and listed the following as liabilities on the adjusted fair value balance sheet that he created for the Debtor:\n  </p>\n  <table id=\"p-93\">\n   <tbody>\n    <tr>\n     <td>\n      ARB TRUST JUDGMENT - UBS BOI LOC\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $1,000,000\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>\n      ARB TRUST JUDGMENT - PERSONAL INCOME TAXES\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $ 501,048\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>\n      ARB TRUST JUDGMENT - TRANSFER TO PERSONAL TRUST\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $ 255,000\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>\n      ARB TRUST JUDGMENT - LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $ 37,848\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>\n      ARB TRUST JUDGMENT - TAX BENEFITS\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $ 504,450\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n   </tbody>\n  </table>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In other words, to identify the Debtor's liabilities as of May 7, 2011, Mark Dennis relied on a judicial decision issued about four years later in a case that had not even been filed as of the May 7, 2011 valuation date. He conceded that as of May 7, 2011, the Debtor's liability was a \"contingent liability\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the judgment had not entered). Dennis Dep. at 121:8-121:20. Furthermore, he confirmed that the proper approach to value a contingent liability was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   You would still put it in on the balance sheet as a liability. You would attach a probability perhaps to that judgment or different components of the judgment. So maybe it would be a smaller number [than the judgment issued four years later].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121:21-122:6. He testified the same way at the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Valuation Practical Guide\n   </em>\n   at 239 (confirming that for contingent liabilities such as litigation claims, the analyst must consider the \"probabilities associated with the debtor company's future contingent liability payments.\") Ignoring these general principles, Mark Dennis just assumed that the amount of a judgment issued four years after the May 7, 2011 date used in his Expert Report should be inserted as a liability. Why did he do so? Perhaps because Mark Dennis lacked sufficient data\n   or information to value the contingent liability as of May 7, 2011. He testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Q. Without the benefit of hindsight of the judgment ... , do you have sufficient information that would allow you to make a reasonable estimate of the loss as of [May 7, 2011]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   A. No. I don't have sufficient information to do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Dennis Dep. at 140:20-25. So, he had no information with which to perform the normal method of valuing the contingent liability as of May 7, 2011. Mark Dennis reconfirmed the foregoing lack of information in his Affidavit where he stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   [T]he Debtor passed away in 2015. Thus, I did not have access to the Debtor or any of his sworn testimony regarding the allegations in the Probate Court Judgment.

During the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing, he acknowledged the lack of information problem. He testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   \u2022 I gathered data \"substantial in volume, not necessarily in usefulness.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   \u2022 \"Maybe not all the data that we would have liked was available.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   \u2022 The asset based approach \"seemed best\" because \"we had maybe not as much information as we would have liked.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   \u2022 The asset based approach was the \"best we could do.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   \u2022 \"Mr. Blair's financial records were hard to reconstruct.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   \u2022 We had \"limited availability on information.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   \u2022 There was \"limited information.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Bottom line: the entire Expert Report and proffered balance sheet for the Debtor are unreliable.

After carefully considering the Expert Report, the Affidavit, Mark Dennis' deposition, and Mark Dennis' testimony at the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing, the Court concludes that Mr. Dennis failed in numerous ways to reliably apply the facts and data in accordance with his own selected methodology. At least in part, the shortcomings of the Expert Report can be traced to the lack of facts and data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   As noted previously, Mark Dennis purported to use a fair market value balance sheet methodology for determining the Debtor's solvency as of May 7, 2011. While such methodology is entirely proper, Mark Dennis failed to follow it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   With respect to \"Cash on Hand,\" Mark Dennis identified five financial accounts of the Debtor (open as of May 7, 2011) for which there was no data. He asked for data and was told that it was not available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   So, he just assumed that all of the financial accounts were worth nothing. That is not an acceptable application of methodology. The same is true for valuing the Debtor's equity in BOI. Mark Dennis chose the fair value balance sheet method for valuing BOI. But he had no information concerning the fair market value of BOI's assets so could not value BOI under his own methodology. He also had no information with which to perform any of the other generally accepted valuation methodologies for BOI. So, Mark Dennis shifted to use historical cost basis balance sheets that do not show fair market values at all. And then he abandoned his methodology entirely to assert that because BOI had suffered losses of income and filed for bankruptcy four years later, it should be valued at zero. The unsupported theory that historical income losses must mean lack of any enterprise equity may come as a surprise to many large American business (such as Google and Tesla) that have operated at a loss for years. But the point for now is only that Mark Dennis did not apply his own methodology to reach his conclusion regarding BOI. And he was unable to point to any generally accepted accounting principles, in the\n   <em>\n    Valuation Practical Guide\n   </em>\n   that he endorsed or otherwise, to support his position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The same for BPI Partners. Rather than truly assess value on a fair market value basis, Mark Dennis just punted and inserted the Debtor's valuation from many years later. Again, that is not proper application of a methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The liabilities side of the Expert Report is every bit as suspect, and probably more so. Mark Dennis' own proposed methodology required him to identify liabilities as of May 7, 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CB Richard Ellis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988188\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/251/523/#p532\">\n    251 P.3d at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (in order to apply the balance sheet test, the court must determine the value of assets and liabilities \"at the time of each contested transfer\"). The only significant liability Mr. Dennis identified was the ARB Trust Judgment that was issued four years later. The lawsuit against the Debtor was filed in 2012 (more than a year after the May 7, 2011 valuation date). Response Ex. 2. Mark Dennis conceded that the claims against the Debtor, even on an informal basis, were first made after May 7, 2011. Dennis Dep. at 44:8-12 (Mr. Dennis' \"best information\" was that \"claims with dollar amounts on them\" were not made until after May 7, 2011). So, at best, there was an unasserted contingent liability. Mark Dennis agreed that the liability was contingent in 2011 and that the generally accepted approach is that such contingent liabilities must be valued by applying a probability of success factor to the amount of the claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121:21-122:6;\n   <em>\n    See also Valuation Practical Guide\n   </em>\n   at 239.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Colorado law on insolvency follows the generally accepted methodology for valuing contingent liabilities. Under Colorado law, contingent liabilities (such as pending litigation that has not been reduced to judgment) must be discounted by the probability of the contingency's becoming non-contingent (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   by the likelihood that a judgment will actually enter) as of the\n   date of the alleged fraudulent transfer.\n   <em>\n    CB Richard Ellis\n   </em>\n   is the seminal case. Therein, the Colorado Court of Appeals held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   While an insolvency determination measures a debtor's assets against its liabilities at a \"fair valuation,\" section 38-8-103(1), such determination will depend on whether the liability is certain or contingent.

However, no judgment existed at the time of the transfer, and the trial court found that the parties had a bona fide dispute over whether the claim should be paid at all.

Mr. Dennis did not mention the \"Cash Flow Insolvency\" portion of the Expert Report at the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing.

COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 38-8-103(1) establishes the fair value balance sheet methodology for determining insolvency. On the other hand, COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 38-8-103(2) provides for a presumption that arises if a party proves that the debtor \"is generally not paying his debts\" as of the date of an alleged fraudulent transfer.

REV. STAT. \u00a7 38-8-103 Official Comment (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 38-8-103(2) presumption appears to be based only on a simple factual inquiry: At the time of the alleged fraudulent transfers, was the Debtor paying his debts as they became due, or not? It is a factual question and not really the province for an expert analysis. No expert \"knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\" seems needed to ascertain whether someone is paying their debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   As a result, there is no real expert methodology that bears on the issue. And Mark Dennis has not suggested any specific expert methodology except \"our experience as a firm.\" But, again, even if an expert analysis were required to ascertain whether someone was paying their debts, that simply is not the mandatory statutory insolvency test under Colorado law or the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Facts and Data\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Mark Dennis did not have sufficient data to determine whether the Debtor was \"generally not paying his debts as they became due\" on May 7, 2011. In his Expert Report, he stated: \"An analysis of Mr. Blair's primary bank account statements for the months of January through July of 2011 was carried out and summarized in Appendix XII.\" Expert Report at 6. Mr. Dennis then generated a graph showing the Debtor's income and expenses from January 2011 to May 2011.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Notably, the entire analysis is based on only one of the Debtor's bank accounts (Wells Fargo\n   X3363). As explained earlier, the Debtor had numerous financial accounts including at least five other active bank accounts during the time period for which Mark Dennis had \"No available data.\" Expert Report, App. I. So, it was a very strange exercise to examine one bank account only and then try to reach a conclusion about whether someone was paying his bills when due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Application\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   If the issue is whether the Debtor \"generally was paying his debts as they became due\" as of May 7, 2011, Mark Dennis conceded that the Debtor was. He testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   Q. Was Peter Blair [the Debtor] actually able to pay his debts as they became due in 2011?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   A. Drawing on both exempt and non-exempt assets?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   Q. Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Dennis Dep. at 173:4-10. So, that would seem to be the end of the inquiry on the \"paying his debts as they become due\" presumption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   But Mark Dennis departed from this rather simple exercise and manufactured an entirely novel framework. The odd idea seems to be that even though the Debtor actually paid all his bills on time in 2011, none of that should count because some of the Debtor's income was not regular (such as a monthly pay check), some of the Debtor's income might have been derived from exempt assets, and Mark Dennis did not have data on the source of some of the income. For example, some of the Debtor's non-regular income during the time period (about $117,702) was from distributions from a trust which might have been an exempt asset. And there were three other deposits for which Mark Dennis had insufficient information so he just subtracted them too: $40,400 (from \"an unidentified generic 'deposit' \"); $12,748 (from \"Aud Rock\"); and $255,000 (from a source \"not known [to Mark Dennis]\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Dennis hypothesizes that if all of the Debtor's foregoing income were deleted, then the Debtor actually would not have been able to pay his bills in 2011. Or something like that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   This is the worst sort of made up \"expert\" analysis and has no place in an insolvency determination. Such approach is not supported by either generally accepted accounting principles or law. All Mr. Dennis' approach really does is serve to discredit Mark Dennis as an expert. But for purposes of admissibility, the central point is that Mark Dennis did not apply a generally accepted methodology to known facts. Instead, he is apparently proposing a \"generally paying his debts as they become due\" methodology for insolvency that runs contrary to the applicable Colorado statute. Then, after conceding that the Debtor actually was paying his debts as they became due, he manufactured the\n   novel idea of subtracting \"extraordinary\" or non-recurring income or income for which he did not have data or income from possibly exempt assets - or really whatever income he chose to delete. Obviously, such an approach is inadmissible and unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    No Help to the Court\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The base-line for admissibility is whether the proposed expert testimony would assist the Court in any meaningful way. The Expert Report proffered by Mark Dennis and the Chapter 7 does not. It is unreliable, irrelevant, and inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court determines that the Chapter 7 Trustee failed to meet his burden to establish grounds for admission of Mark Dennis' expert opinion under Fed.
