Instead, they continued their profitable dairy operation. After a trial, the bankruptcy court awarded JLE damages based on disgorgement of the relevant portion of the Debtors' net profits plus the value of silage, a form of cow feed, which the Debtors' cows consumed after the lease terminated. The court separately calculated the damages that accrued before and after the Debtors filed their bankruptcy petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This Panel affirmed the bankruptcy court's judgment except for the portion of the damages that consisted of the value of silage consumed during the postpetition period. On remand, the bankruptcy court deducted that portion from the total damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Both sides are dissatisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Debtors argue that the bankruptcy court should have also reduced the damages by the value of silage consumed during the prepetition period, even though the Panel did not address this point. We reluctantly agree. In the first appeal, the Debtors argued at length that the postpetition silage damages were improper; they only challenged the prepetition silage damages in a single terse footnote. As a result, this Panel's prior decision was silent about the prepetition silage damages, and our silence misled the bankruptcy court. We perceive no reason why the prepetition and postpetition silage should be treated differently, and we will adjust the judgment accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   JLE cross-appeals, arguing that the bankruptcy court too narrowly followed the Panel's mandate and incorrectly calculated the other elements of damages. We agree in part. Our mandate did not preclude the bankruptcy court from recalculating all damages on remand. We agree with one of JLE's contentions about the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We therefore REVERSE and REMAND for entry of judgment in the amount set forth below. We publish to clarify the rule of mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Prepetition events\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Debtors operated a dairy farm on real property (the \"Property\") owned by Sonora Desert Dairy, LLC. In May 2013, Sonora Desert Dairy, which was a debtor in a separate bankruptcy case, informed\n   the Debtors that their lease would terminate on November 30. Separately, a foreclosure sale of the Property was set for December 6. Despite reminders that they needed to vacate the Property, the Debtors failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Around this time, the Debtors inquired about moving their operation to another farm owned by Brian Van Leeuwen (the \"Van Leeuwen Property\"), but they learned that there was not enough room for all of the cows. The Debtors were also worried about the silage inventory, which they claimed would be worthless if they had to relocate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   JLE purchased the Property at the December 6 foreclosure sale, but the Debtors refused to leave, insisting that the lease entitled them to stay on the Property. JLE filed a forcible entry and detainer proceeding (\"FED Action\") in state court against the Debtors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Bankruptcy events\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The day before a scheduled trial in the FED Action, the Debtors filed a chapter 11 petition. The bankruptcy court later modified the automatic stay to allow the state court to hold the trial and determine the Debtors' right to possession. It also ordered JLE not to pursue a writ of restitution or otherwise enforce the judgment and prohibited JLE from removing or repossessing livestock, personal property, or feed on the Property without further order from the bankruptcy court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Following trial, the state court found that the nonjudicial foreclosure of the deed of trust terminated the Debtors' leasehold interest, such that the Debtors remained on the property \"without any right to be there.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   JLE then asked the bankruptcy court to compel the Debtors to vacate the Property. The bankruptcy court ordered the Debtors to vacate the Property by June 1, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   JLE filed a proof of claim for over $8.8 million in damages arising from the Debtors' trespass. It sought damages measured mostly by the disgorgement of the Debtors' profits and its own lost profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   By May 31, 2014, the Debtors had removed all of their cows from the Property. They relocated their dairy operation to the Van Leeuwen Property, including approximately 2,000 cows, but had to sell at auction 1,405 cows that could not fit on the smaller property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the issue of the Debtors' trespass. The bankruptcy court ruled that the state court's judgment (that the Debtors were trespassers) was entitled to issue preclusive effect and also independently found that the Debtors were trespassers under Arizona law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   JLE filed an administrative claim for $7.9 million based on the Debtors' postpetition trespass and moved for summary judgment. The bankruptcy court granted the motion in part as to the unlawful trespass. However, the court denied summary judgment as to whether the trespass was intentional and the extent to which the Debtors benefitted from the trespass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In November 2015, the bankruptcy court held a trial to determine whether the Debtors' trespass was conscious and the appropriate measure of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The bankruptcy court found that the Debtors were conscious trespassers after the foreclosure sale on December 6, 2013. It held that the Debtors were liable to\n   JLE for the benefits that the Debtors received from wrongfully staying on the Property. The court decided that the Debtors realized two benefits from their retention of the Property: first, they earned additional net profits from keeping a larger herd at the Property than they could have maintained at the Van Leeuwen Property; and second, they used silage that would otherwise have gone to waste.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To calculate net profits, the bankruptcy court began with the Debtors' draft financial statement which indicated that the Debtors' net income for the first six months of 2014 was $2,762,587. (In doing so, it rejected JLE's argument that the court should use the monthly operating reports to determine net income.) The court adjusted this amount to reflect that the relevant period for purposes of damages was December 6, 2013 to May 31, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The bankruptcy court then subtracted the Debtors' profit realized from the sale of the cows ($1,050,835), because the court determined that the Debtors would have earned the same profit even if they had not remained on the Property after the lease was terminated. The total net profit was $1,711,752.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The court prorated the net profits between the prepetition period and the postpetition period based on the number of days in each period (forty-seven days and 128 days, respectively).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, the court further reduced the net profits component of the damages by about sixty percent because the Debtors could have moved about sixty percent of their herd to the Van Leeuwen Property and made a corresponding profit. The court explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The Debtors directly benefitted to the extent they profited from being able to use the 1405 cows that they could not use on the Van Leeuwen Property; their likely and eventual business home. Where the Debtors owned 3538 cows on the petition date, those 1405 cows made up 39.71% of their herd.\n   <strong>\n    Thus, 39.71% of the net profits generated by the Debtors['] dairy operations were a direct benefit from their trespass.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (Emphasis added.) In other words, the bankruptcy court concluded that 39.71 percent of the Debtors' net profit represented the additional benefit that they gained from wrongfully trespassing on the Property, in excess of what they would have earned had they not trespassed and instead moved their cows to the Van Leeuwen Property. According to the court, only that portion of their total profit needed to be disgorged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, the bankruptcy court turned to the amount of silage that the Debtors owned and used. The bankruptcy court reasoned that the silage should be included in the benefits received by the Debtors from their trespass because Mr. de Jong testified that moving the silage would have ruined it. Therefore, \"the Debtors benefitted from the use of what would otherwise have been worthless silage ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The court calculated that the Debtors used an average of $8,864.34 of silage per day, based on available data for an overlapping period. The court calculated that the Debtors used $416,623.98 of silage during the prepetition trespass and $1,134,635.52 of silage during the postpetition trespass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The bankruptcy court totaled the silage and profit amounts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It then reduced the award by the prorated amounts that the Debtors paid in pre- and postpetition rent and taxes. It concluded that JLE's prepetition\n   damage claim was $558,716.24 and its postpetition administrative claim was $1,517,069.64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The bankruptcy court later entered an amended award (\"Amended Damages Order\") that reduced the credit for the amount of rent paid to correspond with its proration of the additional \"benefit\" received by the Debtors from their trespass: \"to ensure that the Debtors do not receive a duplicative credit for rent paid, the amount of the rent paid that would not be attributable to JLE's disgorgement damages (60.29%) should be credited to reduce JLE's damages award.\" It thus laid out its final calculations as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-42\"><em>Pre-petition</em> Pre-petition silage $416,623.98 Pre-petition profits<sup>5</sup> $191,541.45 Pre-petition hay conversion $720.00 Subtotal $608,885.43 Credit for 60.29% of pre-petition rent <em>($29,812.92)</em> ($49,449.19\u00d7.6029) <strong>Total pre-petition claim</strong> <strong>$579,072.51</strong> <em>Post-petition</em> Post-petition silage $1,134,635.31 Post-petition profits<sup>6</sup> $521,644.79 Subtotal $1,656,280.31 Credit for 60.29% of pre-petition rent <em>($84,364.20)</em> ($139,930.67\u00d7.6029) <strong>Total post-petition claim</strong> <strong>$1,571,916.11</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Editor's Note:\n   </strong>\n   The preceding image contains the references for footnotes\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The first BAP appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Debtors appealed from the bankruptcy court's Amended Damages Order. They argued that the bankruptcy court erred by: applying issue preclusion to the state court's findings in the FED Action; independently deciding that the Debtors were trespassers; finding that the Debtors were conscious trespassers; and applying an incorrect measure of damages that exceeded the fair market rental value of the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Debtors also contended that the bankruptcy court improperly calculated JLE's postpetition damages. They argued that the bankruptcy court erroneously counted silage as a profit, when in actuality it was an operating cost. As such, the\n   value of the silage could not be awarded to JLE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The BAP affirmed the bankruptcy court in all respects except for the last damages issue. It held that the bankruptcy court erred in calculating the postpetition profits by \"double counting\" the silage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   This double-counting occurred because the court took the amount of silage used in the relevant time period and added that figure to a portion of the net income derived from its profits gained from operating a larger dairy operation on JLE's property. Debtors argue that it was error to include both items in the measure of restitution. Debtors also contend that the court's analysis of the amount of silage utilized by Debtors during their occupancy is not a proper method to calculate \"profits\" since it is an expense item. We agree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202417189\">\n    2017 WL 2417189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13. The BAP thus instructed the bankruptcy court to recalculate the postpetition damages:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The proper measure of recovery in this case must be the benefits, or net profits, received by Debtors from the wrongful use of JLE's property. Net profit is the business's gross revenues less any operating expenses. An operating expense would include the silage that was bought by Debtors to feed their cows, including the extra cows that Debtors kept on the property by virtue of their wrongful trespass. Debtors did not generate a direct profit, or benefit, by use of the silage after their trespass. Instead, they simply avoided a loss of something that they had already paid for. Nonetheless, their purchase of the silage was a legitimate operating expense because it was fed to the cows which generated the profits that accrued to Debtors as a direct result of their wrongful trespass.\n   <strong>\n    Accordingly, the bankruptcy court erred by considering the silage as a separate component of damages which resulted in overstating and double counting the wrongfully obtained profits.\n   </strong>\n   Therefore, we vacate the bankruptcy court's postpetition damage award and remand for a calculation of damages consistent with this memorandum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *14 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Proceedings on remand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On remand, the bankruptcy court recalculated JLE's damages by eliminating the line item for postpetition silage damages. The court also called attention to its award of prepetition silage damages. It noted that the BAP's decision specifically concerned postpetition damages only, despite the rationale for awarding silage damages being the same across both pre-and postpetition periods. It indicated that it might be appropriate to eliminate the prepetition silage award but that it was constrained by the BAP's directive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Accordingly, the bankruptcy court issued its order (\"Order After Remand\") holding that JLE was entitled to a prepetition claim of $579,072.51 and a postpetition administrative claim of $437,280.59, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-55\"><em>Pre-petition</em> Pre-petition silage $416,623.98 Pre-petition profits $191,541.45 Pre-petition hay conversion $720.00 Total $608,885.43 Credit for 60.29% of pre-petition rent <em>($29,812.92)</em> ($49,449.19\u00d7.6029) <strong>Total pre-petition claim</strong> <strong>$579,072.51</strong> <em>Post-petition</em> Post-petition silage $0 Post-petition profits $521,644.79 Total $521,644.79 Credit for 60.29% of post-petition rent <em>($84,364.20)</em> ($139,930.67\u00d7.6029) <strong>Total post-petition claim</strong> <strong>$437,280.59</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Debtors filed a timely notice of appeal from the Order After Remand.

The bankruptcy court awarded JLE less than it wanted, but JLE was apparently willing to live with the reduced award. It is easy to say, knowing what we know now, that it would have been more efficient if JLE had raised all of its arguments in the first appeal. But we have the benefit of hindsight, and we cannot expect an appellee like JLE to have perfect foresight. To require an appellee to raise all possible challenges to a damages award, even if the appellee is willing to live with the result, would expand the scope of many appeals, increasing the burden on appellants, appellees, and appellate courts.

In contrast, the bankruptcy court believed that our mandate precluded it from doing so. We disagree with both JLE and the bankruptcy court. The mandate did not require the bankruptcy court\n   to recompute the profits, and also did not preclude the court from doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Panel said that \"[t]he proper measure of recovery in this case must be the benefits, or net profits, received by Debtors from the wrongful use of JLE's property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202417189\">\n    2017 WL 2417189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14.

Thus, nothing in the Panel's prior decision required the bankruptcy court to recompute the damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   On the other hand, nothing in the Panel's decision prevented the court from doing so either. The prior Panel did not reach the issue of whether the bankruptcy court's calculations of net profits were correct. JLE correctly points out that, if the Panel intended to preclude such a reassessment, the Panel could have simply struck the postpetition silage award rather than remanding the case. Therefore, the bankruptcy court was free to revisit that issue on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The bankruptcy court incorrectly thought that our mandate precluded it from recalculating the profits.

We also stated that net profits are determined by subtracting operating costs from gross revenues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   But the bankruptcy court did not award all of the net profits that the Debtors earned while trespassing on JLE's property. Instead, it reduced the net profits by 60.29 percent, because the Debtors could have moved 2,133 of their 3,538 cows to the Van Leeuwen Property and earned a profit there. This reasoning suffers from a fatal logical flaw; it impermissibly capped the calculation of net profits. As JLE argues, if the Van Leeuwen Property were large enough to accommodate the Debtors' entire herd, the bankruptcy court's formula would find that the Debtors received no \"benefit\" from trespassing on the Property. That a trespasser could have earned some or all of those profits without trespassing does not negate the fact that these net profits were earned by trespassing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Therefore, the Debtors were required to disgorge all of their net profits earned during the trespass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Fortunately, we need not remand again for calculation of damages. The bankruptcy court has already determined the daily net profits, and we are persuaded that those calculations are consistent with the methodology we outlined in the prior appeal (the bankruptcy court apparently thought so too, because, unlike its two alternative silage calculations, it did not offer any alternative calculation of daily net profits).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   As we have noted above, the bankruptcy court's calculation of the Debtors' net profits started with $2,762,587 net income for the first six months of 2014 (those six months are not coterminous with the period of trespass, but they largely overlap and appear to be the closest period of reliable data presented to the court). The bankruptcy court then deducted the Debtors' profit from the sale of the cows ($1,050,835), because that profit was not shown to have resulted from the trespass, to arrive at net profit of $1,711,752 for that six month period. Next, the bankruptcy court recognized that the Debtors' profits were not necessarily spread out evenly during the half-year period, so the bankruptcy court compared milk sales during the trespass portion of 2014 (January 2014 through May 2014) with milk sales after the trespass ended (June 2014), and determined that 90.56 percent of the net profits were earned during the trespass period from January 1 through May 31, 2014 -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , $1,550,162.61 in net profits ($1,711,752 x 90.56%). Then the bankruptcy court converted this figure to a daily net profit amount: it divided the total of $1,550,162.61 by the number of days from January 1 through May 31, 2014 (151 days, including the start and end days). This yields a daily net profit of $10,262.98 ($1,550,162.61/151 days).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the herd size did not change between the 2014 trespass period and the December 2013 trespass period, the court used the same daily net profit figure for December 2013, so the daily net profit throughout the entire trespass period was $10,262.98. Neither party has established any clear error in the court's determination of daily net profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   We convert these daily net profits into total profits below. Meanwhile, we note that, as the bankruptcy court recognized, any damages must be reduced to account for rent and taxes that the Debtors paid. Because we reject the bankruptcy court's proration of the net profits, we also do not prorate the credit for rent and taxes paid that the court applied to offset the damages award. Accordingly, we subtract $49,449.19 (rather than $29,812.92) from the prepetition damages and $139,930.67 (rather than $84,364.20) from the postpetition damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    4. We reject JLE's other points of error, with one minor exception.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   JLE raises other arguments related to the calculation of profits and urges us to increase the damages award accordingly. With one minor exception, we decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   First, JLE argues that the bankruptcy court should have calculated the Debtors' profits using the monthly operating reports, rather than the draft financial statement. But the bankruptcy court thoroughly explained its reasons for rejecting the monthly operating reports, which it found to paint an incomplete picture of the Debtors' finances. We discern no clear error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   JLE also argues in passing that the bankruptcy court should have awarded it the profits that the Debtors realized from the sale of the 1,405 cows. We find no error. There was no evidence that the profit gained from the sale of the cows was tied to the wrongful trespass. For example, there is no evidence that the cows gained value during the period of the trespass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Regarding the number of days pre- and postpetition, we disagree with JLE's argument that they are entitled to forty-eight post-trespass/prepetition days. The court awarded net profits for forty-seven days, which excludes the date of the foreclosure sale and continues through the day before the Debtors filed their petition. JLE does not provide any evidence that we should count the entirety of December 6, 2013 as a compensable trespass day. The bankruptcy court counted the days of trespass beginning the following day, and we find no clear error with its calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   However, we agree with JLE's assertion that the bankruptcy court miscounted the number of postpetition/post-trespass days. The period from January 23, 2014 to May 31, 2014 is 129 days inclusive of the petition date and the end date. We adjust the postpetition net profits calculation by an additional day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Finally, JLE contends that the trespass period lasted until June 15, 2014, not May 31. But the bankruptcy court found that the Debtors had vacated the Property by May 31 as it had ordered, and we discern no clear error. Although some machinery and equipment remained on the Property until June 15, there is no dispute that the Debtors removed the cows by May 31. Disgorgement is based on the profits earned while the Debtors wrongfully remained on the Property, and the Debtors were no longer earning money from the Property after May 31. The bankruptcy court was correct to order disgorgement of profits only until May 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the bankruptcy court's Order After Remand as to (1) the award of prepetition silage, (2) the pre-and postpetition net profits calculation, (3) the proration of the rent credits, and (4) the number of postpetition days used in the net profits calculation. With these four modifications, the prepetition claim and postpetition administrative claim are adjusted as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-114\"><em>Pre-petition</em> Pre-petition silage $0 Pre-petition profits $482,360.06 (47 days @ $10.262.98/day) Pre-petition hay conversion $720.00 Subtotal $483,080.06 Credit for 100% of pre-petition rent <em>($49,449.19)</em> <strong>Total pre-petition claim</strong> <strong>$433,630.87</strong> <em>Post-petition</em> Post-petition silage $0 Post-petition profits $1,323,924.42 (129 days @ $10,262.98/day) Subtotal $1,323,924.42 Credit for 100% of post-petition rent <em>($139,930.67)</em> <strong>Total post-petition claim</strong> <strong>$1,183,993.75</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   We REMAND for entry of judgment in the foregoing amounts.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Unless specified otherwise, all chapter and section references are to the Bankruptcy Code,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -1532.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    For a more comprehensive background, see\n    <em>\n     de Jong v.
