Newman (\"Newman\"), seeking a determination that a debt owed by Newman to Heritage is non-dischargeable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A), 523(a)(4), and/or 523(a)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Though the parties dispute the precise nature and extent of the transactions, it is undisputed that Heritage and Newman engaged in a financial relationship whereby Newman, a real estate agent, purportedly transferred her interest in expected sales commissions to Heritage, and in consideration for these transfers, Heritage purportedly provided Newman with cash advances on such commissions. Heritage filed this adversary proceeding in Newman's underlying Chapter 7 case,\n   <em>\n    In re Nancy L. Newman\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 15-30382 (the \"Main Case\"), asserting its claim, arising from six specific real estate transactions, was non-dischargeable because Newman committed various frauds in the course of those transactions. Newman denied the allegations of fraud, advanced various defenses, and filed a counterclaim alleging violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2042\">\n    Conn.

As to Newman's counterclaim against Heritage, the court finds Newman failed to meet her burden of proof to establish a violation of CUTPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND STANDING\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This court has jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut's General Order of Reference dated September 21, 1984.

Ex. 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117.

Each agreement listed the address of a property for which a sale was pending, and the settlement or closing date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   b.

AP-ECF No. 114. According to Heritage, Newman's debt should not be discharged because Newman forged the signature of her broker on the Notices of Assignment; falsely represented that monies paid by Heritage to Newman pursuant to the various Sale and Assignment Agreements were to be used for business purposes; used money she received from Heritage for personal expenses; failed to turn over commissions to Heritage; and, caused Heritage to suffer injury as a result. In short, Heritage seeks a determination that more than $178,000 is non-dischargeable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A), 523(a)(4) and 523(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Newman did not dispute she signed the Master Security Agreement, the six Sale and Assignment Agreements, the six Notices of Assignment (both for herself and Joseph Fazekas) or the Business Purpose Checklist. However, she testified she understood the transactions to be loans.\n   <em>\n    Testimony of Newman\n   </em>\n   , AP-ECF No. 102, 00:24:00 - 00:24:20. Newman's answer to the complaint asserted she repaid such advances, and she testified - without introducing any documentation into evidence to support the assertion - that she repaid $51,000.00 to Heritage. AP-ECF No. 28; No. 102, 01:20:50 - 01:21:00. She disputed that her act of signing the broker's name on the Notices of Assignment was forgery, asserting she had authorization to sign Joseph Fazekas's name on behalf of RE/Max Marketplace and argues that any advances she received from RE/Max Marketplace were general in nature rather than tied to specific transactions. Her counterclaim asserted Heritage engaged in unfair and deceptive business practices in violation of CUTPA, as Heritage was not licensed to make \"small consumer loans\" in Connecticut and charged usurious interest.

Given that the central dispute here starts with the question of how much Newman owes Heritage, it was striking that neither party provided documentary evidence such as bank statements, copies of checks or other financial information to explain who paid what to whom, or when. Both Moore and Newman conceded the Sale and Assignment Agreements did not accurately reflect the parties' course of dealing with one another.\n   <em>\n    Testimony of Newman\n   </em>\n   , AP-ECF No. 102, 00:37:30 - 00:37:55;\n   <em>\n    Testimony of Moore\n   </em>\n   , AP-ECF No. 101, 00:43:00 - 00:44:00. Moore acknowledged that the record before the court contains only a snapshot of many rolled over transactions. The court concludes the Sale and Assignment Agreements are generally unreliable because a review of those Agreements fails to accurately reflect the following: the amount of money Heritage paid Newman; whether a given transaction was a roll over transaction; and, whether, if a roll over, the figure states in each Agreement was the result of set-offs from other transactions, interest\n   or fee accruals or new consideration paid to Newman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <em>\n    The Nature of Newman's Transactions with Heritage\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   For her part, Newman understood and expected that if a real estate closing failed and Heritage was not paid, she would still owe Heritage the money she had received. Aside from the question of whether the transactions were loans or part of a factoring arrangement, Newman's overall understanding of the transactions is relevant to her state of mind, and thus relevant to the substantive allegations of fraud common to each count of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757818,8450918\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/469/278/\">\n    469 F.3d at 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Newman's own testimony was that she was only entitled to a commission if the sale closed, and if a sale did not close, she still owed Heritage any money that had been advanced for the transaction. She repeatedly testified that she had understood the transactions were loans, notwithstanding the language of the various Heritage documents that Heritage asserted created a factoring relationship. Newman's testimony on this point is consistent with the Master Security Agreement that provided for different remedies in the event of a delayed or incomplete closing. Pl. Ex. 102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The court need not determine whether the transactions were factoring agreements, or simply loans, to make the determination of whether the outstanding debt owed by Newman to Heritage - if any - is non-dischargeable. However, the court notes that Heritage's characterization of these transactions does not comport with the generally accepted definition of factoring, and the parties themselves behaved as if the transactions were loans rather than true sales of the commissions. Factoring is defined as \"[t]he buying of accounts receivable at a discount. The price is discounted because the factor (who buys them) assumes the risk of delay in collection and loss on the accounts receivable.\" FACTORING,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (9th ed. 2009). Three parties exist in a factoring transaction, the factor, who buys the account receivable from, a client, and an account debtor, whose account has been sold. A leading treatise defines a \"factor\" as \"a person who purchases trade accounts at a discount from its clients in a 'true sale,' taking title to the accounts as a matter of law.\" David B. Tatge, et al.,\n   <em>\n    American Factoring Law\n   </em>\n   , 895 (1st ed. 2009). Here, the third party relating to each transaction would have been Newman's client - the residential home seller or purchaser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   However, \"[w]here the factor assumes no credit risk and purchases accounts with full recourse, most cases characterize the transaction as a secured borrowing rather than a true sale of accounts.\"\n   <em>\n    American Factoring Law\n   </em>\n   , 268;\n   <em>\n    see also,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dessert Beauty Inc. v.

BAP 2011) (\"In instances \"[w]here the 'seller' retains 'virtually all of the risk of noncollection,' the transaction cannot properly be considered a true sale.\") ). Here, Newman retained all the risk and Heritage retained full recourse to collect any unpaid amounts from Newman. If a given transaction did not close and therefore no commission would be earned, or if Newman simply did not pay an earned commission to Heritage, both Newman\n   and Heritage understood that Heritage could pursue Newman to collect the debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <em>\n    The Forged Notices of Assignment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Newman signed her name to six documents entitled \"Notice of Assignment,\" which purported to: a) inform RE/Max Marketplace, Newman's licensed real estate broker that supervised her work as a real estate agent, that Heritage was entitled to be paid sales commissions that she earned upon the closing of specific real estate transactions; and, b) direct RE/Max Marketplace to pay such commissions directly to Heritage. Newman also signed the name of Joseph Fazekas of RE/Max Marketplace on the Notices of Assignment. While Newman testified that she had authorization to sign Joseph Fazekas' name, Mr. Fazekas testified that she did not. Heritage asserted that Newman forged Mr. Fazekas' signature. However, even if Newman did forge Mr. Fazekas' signature, the forgery was not material to the financial transactions described in the complaint because, according to Moore, the Notices of Assignment were required to be completed for each transaction\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the commissions were sold to Heritage.\n   <em>\n    Testimony of Moore\n   </em>\n   , AP-ECF No. 94, 01:32:20 - 01:32:50; 01:36:00 - 01:38:20. There was no evidence that the Notices of Assignment, forged or not, had any bearing on whether Heritage agreed to purchase a commission from Newman or paid money to Newman. Heritage could not have relied on the forged Notices of Assignment before funding because as the parties described the transactions, the forgery post-dated each sale of a commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   As to the specific point of whether or not Newman actually signed Fazekas' name to the Notices of Assignment without Fazekas' authorization, the court concludes that Heritage failed to establish this fact by a preponderance of the evidence. Newman, Patrick Severese (Newman's adult son who worked at RE/Max Marketplace for a time),\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Elizabeth Scalise testified that Fazekas had given Newman authorization to sign his name at times, and specifically, Ms. Scalise testified Fazekas gave her authorization to sign his name at times. Although Fazekas denied giving Newman permission to sign his name, he acknowledged that he was rarely in the RE/Max Marketplace office in 2012. Considering the balance of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, the court cannot conclude Newman signed Fazekas' signature on the Notices of Assignment without his authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <em>\n    Justifiable Reliance by Heritage\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   To prevail on its claims under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), Heritage must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that it did not, \"blindly [rely] upon a misrepresentation the falsity of which would be patent to [it] if [it] had utilized [its] opportunity to make a cursory examination or investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Field,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"323761\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/59/#p73\">\n    516 U.S. at 70-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6476672,323761\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/116/437/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here Heritage has not met its burden. The extensive testimony of both Moore and Newman regarding the roll over nature of at least some of the six transactions identified in the six counts of the complaint undercuts Heritage's effort to establish that it justifiably relied on Newman's representations in the various Heritage documents about the fail-safe nature of a particular real estate transaction. The purpose of each roll over transaction was to cover for one or more failed real estate closings where the commissions had not, in fact, been earned by Newman or were earned\n   but not paid to Heritage. Significantly, no accounting of the extent of the roll over transactions was presented through testimony or documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The evidence is uncontroverted that Heritage knew that Newman's transactions frequently did not close. When a closing did not occur, Heritage frequently rolled over the liability from the failed transaction into another transaction, hoping to be repaid. As previously stated, the parties acknowledged that the Sale and Assignment Agreements did not accurately reflect the parties' course of dealing. Thus, to the extent Heritage relied on Newman's signature on a given document, the admitted inaccuracies and lack of transparency (on both sides) in the Sales and Assignment Agreements undermine the justifiableness of Heritage's reliance on that documentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <em>\n    The Parties' Competing Theories of the Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Heritage's theory of the case rested almost exclusively on the documents submitted into evidence. In short, Newman signed six Sale and Assignment Agreements in which Heritage agreed to pay Newman money in exchange for Newman selling her right to receive a commission for the sale of six specific homes. Taken strictly at face value, they purport to paint a clear picture of the terms to which Newman and Heritage agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Newman's defense was that Heritage failed to perform its end of the bargain, because, in all but two cases described in more detail below, Heritage did not actually pay Newman any money. Although Newman's testimony at trial was possibly self-serving and not entirely forthcoming, it was also unrebutted on the point that Heritage did not advance Newman the funds as described on the six Sale and Assignment Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Heritage, for its part, did not offer any evidence that it in fact paid Newman money according to the terms of the six Sale and Assignment Agreements. Rather, when asked - repeatedly - whether Heritage paid Newman money, Moore could not give a clear or coherent answer, and stated only that Newman received some form of \"value\" as consideration. Although Moore alluded to the existence of accounting records, Heritage did not submit any proof that it complied with this essential term of the various Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Instead, Moore testified extensively that Heritage and Newman frequently entered into roll over transactions to \"cover\" for other, failed transactions. But, Heritage failed to submit evidence as to which transactions were roll over transactions or how much principal, interest, or fee was rolled over in each instance. This testimony undermined the credibility of the six Sale and Assignment Agreements, because it suggested to the court that the terms of the written Agreements were not representative of the parties' actual agreements or arrangement or course of conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Heritage cannot have it both ways - it cannot simply point to a Sale and Assignment Agreement as evidence of Newman's liability for a transaction and simultaneously acknowledge or admit that the Sale and Assignment Agreements do not reflect the actual terms of the transactions. The admitted absence of any records, testimony, or credible evidence substantiating the amount of funds advanced, payments received, date of default, interest and fees charged for \"cover\" or \"roll over\" transactions, undermines Heritage's theory of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   A. Count 1: 11 Lake Drive\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Newman admitted that she was paid $5,008.00 from Heritage for the 11 Lake Drive transaction, but disputed that the amount paid to her was the $5,400.00 recited\n   in the 11 Lake Drive Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Testimony of Newman\n   </em>\n   , AP-ECF No. 102, 00:50:30 - 00:50:55. The sale of 11 Lake Drive failed to close.\n   <em>\n    Testimony of Newman\n   </em>\n   , AP-ECF No. 102, 01:43:50 - 01:44:00.

It appears undisputed that the documentation between the parties contained certain statements that were not strictly accurate, including the amount of money paid by Heritage to Newman, and whether Newman had already sold a portion of the commission to another party. None of these things were as set forth in the paperwork because Heritage paid Newman $5,008.00 in money (rather than $5,400.00) and Newman sold $500.00 of the commission to another party (RE/Max Marketplace) before entering into the 11 Lake Drive Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   However, assuming Newman still owed Heritage the $5,008.00 she admits she received, Heritage failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that this debt was incurred by \"false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A).

However, the court finds that the evidence submitted with respect to this transaction impacts the balance of payments between Newman and Heritage. As previously noted, the evidence supports a conclusion that Newman received a total of $7,008.00 from Heritage; $5,008.00 for Newman's commission for 11 Lake Drive, and $2,000.00 for Newman's commission for 12 Clubhouse Drive.

As previously stated, because the documents, including the Sale and Assignment Agreements, were not representative of the parties' actual course of dealing, there is a lack of evidence regarding what actually occurred between the parties.
