Homer Drake, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The above-styled case came before the Court for a hearing on confirmation of the Debtor's Amended Plan on April 26, 2018. At the hearing, the Chapter 13 Trustee (\"Trustee\") raised objections to confirmation of the Debtor's amended plan. After hearing argument from counsel at the hearing, the Court requested briefs from both parties. Having considered the record in this case, the arguments of counsel, and the briefs filed with the Court, the Court concludes as set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The instant case was filed on January 1, 2018. The Debtor is a below-median income debtor. The Debtor's Chapter 13 plan, as proposed, calls for payments of $350 per month for thirty-six (36) months. Among other terms, the plan proposes that the Debtor will retain all income tax refunds received during the life of the plan. For unsecured creditors, the Debtor proposes a pro rata share of $500, which is a 4.4% dividend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Trustee objects to confirmation on the grounds that the Debtor (1) does not contribute all of his disposable income to funding the plan as required by \u00a7 1325(b), and (2) has failed to propose his plan in good faith as required by \u00a7 1325(a)(3). The Debtor's proposed retention of all federal tax returns is the crux of the Trustee's objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This matter is a core proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C \u00a7 157(b)(2)(L).

Instead, the Debtor believes that he may prorate these refunds into his Schedule I disposable income calculation, and as a result of his Schedule J expenses, keep the tax refunds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Further, the Debtor asserts that he does not have to show an actual expense that requires the retention and use of the refund, but that he must only show that a reasonable need exists. In support of this, the Debtor relies on\n   <em>\n    Marshall v. Blake,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516265\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1065/\">\n    885 F.3d 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2018), a case in which the Seventh Circuit addressed a similar factual situation. In\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   , Ms. Blake was a below-median income debtor whose proposed plan did not provide for the turnover of post-petition tax refunds to the trustee. Instead, Ms. Blake prorated her anticipated refunds and included this amount into her calculation of monthly income. She also prorated certain reasonably expected expenditures and included this amount into her calculation of monthly expenses. The trustee objected on the grounds that Ms. Blake should be required to turnover her post-petition refunds. The Seventh Circuit, affirming the bankruptcy court, overruled the trustee's objections and held that Ms. Blake did not have to turn over the refunds to the trustee, but could instead prorate the anticipated refunds, as well as the expenditures that she reasonably anticipated making with the refunds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, the Debtor attempts to take the same action as the debtor in\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   . The Debtor, instead of turning over all refunds to the Trustee, amended his Schedule I to include prorated refunds. The Debtor also increased certain expenses on his amended Schedule J. The effect of the increase in Schedule J expenses is to allow the Debtor to retain the refunds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court does not agree with this approach for two reasons. First, this contradicts the regular practice of the Court, which requires the turnover of refunds absent a showing by a debtor of a specific, actual need for a refund. The Debtor does not provide, nor is the Court aware, of any binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit that supports the Debtor's actions. Second, even if the Court were to allow the Debtor to prorate the refunds, the refunds must still be paid into the plan because they constitute disposable income. The Debtor has not shown a specific need or expense, but merely suggests the funds are needed for expenses that might arise in the future. Further, although\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   is similar to the instant case, a significant factual distinction exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit recognized that the bankruptcy court allowed Ms. Blake to retain the refunds to pay for\n   <em>\n    known\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    virtually certain\n   </em>\n   future expenses. (emphasis added)\n   <em>\n    Marshall,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516265\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1065/\">\n    885 F.3d 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, Ms. Blake stated she needed the refunds for expenditures involving her son's high school graduation, as well as bedroom furniture for her children. These expenses were reasonably necessary and, more importantly, were known and disclosed to the bankruptcy court. In the instant case, the Debtor, unlike\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   , has not shown the Court that the refunds are needed for any specific, actual expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Debtor also asserts that the refunds are needed for reasonable and necessary expenses that may arise in the future. At first glance, based on the Debtor's amended Schedule J - the Debtor's assertion appears to bear some weight. However, upon comparing the amended Schedules I and J with the original Schedule I and J - the Court is not convinced. The Debtor's original Schedule I indicates a monthly take-home income of $2,400. The Debtor's original Schedule J lists expenses for, among others, \"utilities\" (line 6) in the amount of $195 per month, \"food and housekeeping supplies\" (line 7) in the amount of $567 per month, and \"medical and dental\" (line 11) in the amount of $85 per month. This results in total monthly expenses in the amount of $2,120, leaving\n   the Debtor with a monthly net income of $280. On the amended Schedule I, the Debtor prorated his 2017 refund and included that value into the income calculation, resulting in a $448 increase in the Debtor's income. On the amended Schedule J, the Debtor increased the expenses for \"utilities\" from $195.00 to $235.00, \"food and housekeeping supplies\" from $567.00 to $875.00, and \"medical and dental\" from $85.00 to $115.00. This results in a $348.00 increase in expenses compared to the expenses asserted in the original Schedule J. The Debtor provides no explanation for this increase. The timing of the amended expenses in relation to the inclusion of the tax return, the inability to explain the increased expenses, and the Debtor's stated intent to create an emergency fund leads the Court to infer that the purpose of increasing these expenses is to simply allow the Debtor to retain his tax refunds for no specific purpose other than \"in case of an emergency.\" As a result, the Debtor's actions do not fall within the factual purview of the Seventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Marshall.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the Debtor's reliance on Marshall is unavailing. The Court will not condone the practice of retaining tax refunds simply for the purpose of having a \"rainy day\" or \"comfort\" fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Debtor submits, as a matter of public policy, that he should be allowed to retain the refunds because he receives an Earned Income Tax Credit (\"EITC\"). Since the purpose of the EITC is to support low-income families and help such people meet the basic costs of life, the Debtor believes he should be able to keep these funds in case of an emergency that may arise during the case. The Debtor also maintains that this will enable him to have immediate access to these funds and avoid the delay and cost of filing motions. The Court does not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Debtor's concerns regarding unexpected future expenses and the need for an emergency fund are not enough to warrant the Debtor's retaining the entire refund amount. There are several procedural avenues available through which the Debtor can alleviate his concerns. The Debtor may file a Motion to Retain Tax Refunds and may do so upon a showing that such funds are reasonably necessary for the support of the Debtor's household. The Debtor may also file a Motion to Suspend Plan Payments, if circumstances arise which necessitate such action. Further, addressing the need for an \"emergency fund\", \u00a7 2.3 of this District's local form plan allows the Debtor to retain up to $2,000 of any income tax refund without having to file any request or motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Addressing the EITC concerns, the Court notes that a breakdown of the Debtor's 2017 refund reveals that the EITC component only amounts to less than half of the Debtor's total federal refund. In 2017, the Debtor received a federal income tax refund of $5,247.00. Of that total, only $2,471.00 is derived from the EITC. As noted above, the form plan allows, and the Trustee has acquiesced, to the Debtor's retention of up to $2,000 of his tax refund in a year, no questions asked. This amounts to the majority of Debtor's EITC refund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Good Faith Requirement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"The principal purpose of the Bankruptcy Code is to grant a 'fresh start' to the 'honest but unfortunate debtor.' \"\n   <em>\n    Marrama v.

In evaluating this objection, the Court analyzes the Debtor's income, claimed expenses, and the treatment of unsecured creditors - the first, second, and thirteenth Kitchens' factors. The \"good faith\" standard of \u00a7 1325(a)(3) does not set any minimum amount or percentage of payments that must be made to unsecured creditors. Colliers on Bankruptcy, \u00b6 1325.11 (16th Ed.).

S.D. Fla. 1987) ) (this Court found a debtor who did not fully commit his disposable income cannot be said to have proposed the plan in good faith).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As discussed in the preceding section, it is the practice of this Court, along with many others, to require tax refunds be paid into the plan unless the Debtor can prove an actual need exists that requires retention of the refunds. Further, the Debtor offers no explanation, other than\n   \"in case of an emergency,\" for the increase of expenses on amended Schedule J. As a result, and in accordance with the preceding section, the Court finds that the tax refunds are not necessary for the reasonable and necessary expenses of the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court cannot overlook the treatment of unsecured creditors in the instant case and finds that allowing the Debtor to retain the tax refunds creates a preposterous result. The Debtor purposes to retain tax refunds for the years 2017 through 2019. The Debtor's 2017 federal income tax refund was $5,247.00, which is more than two months of the Debtor's net income and more than the Debtor proposes to pay into the plan for an entire year. As there is nothing to suggest, and no assertions to the contrary, that these refunds will not remain approximately the same value going forward,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Debtor will retain approximately $15,741.00 during the life of case. By contrast, the Debtor proposes only a $500.00 pool to be paid pro rata to unsecured creditors, which amounts to a 4.4% dividend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Trustee submits, and the Court agrees, that the Debtor can provide a substantially larger return for unsecured creditors and still retain a portion of the tax refunds. For example, the Debtor could retain $2,000 of his tax refund each year while paying any amount over $2,000 into the plan. Given the anticipated value of the refunds, this would increase the dividend to unsecured creditors from 4.4% to approximately 74%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court acknowledges that exceptional circumstances could exist that support a finding of good faith, even though the Debtor proposes only a nominal repayment to unsecured creditors.\n   <em>\n    In re Kitchens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6126443,1848030\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/885/\">\n    702 F.2d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 889 (11th Cir. 1983) (citing\n   <em>\n    Matter of Bellgraph,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6531013\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/4/421/\">\n    4 B.R. 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. W.D.N.Y. 1980) ). However, the Debtor has made no attempt to show exceptional circumstances that justify the disparity between the unsecured creditors' treatment and the amount of money retained by the Debtor. The Court will not confirm a plan that provides so little to unsecured creditors and allows the Debtor to retain such a large sum. Given the circumstances of the case, the proposed plan does not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1325(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Therefore, in accordance with the foregoing, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the objections to confirmation are sustained.
