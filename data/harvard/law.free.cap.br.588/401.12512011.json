INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This court previously determined that a transfer of property to a municipality pursuant to a tax sale and foreclosure, where there was no competitive bidding, can constitute a fraudulent conveyance under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), not barred by the United States Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    BFP v. Resolution Trust Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147304\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/531/\">\n    511 U.S. 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147304,6534573\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/114/1757/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147304\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/531/\">\n    128 L.Ed.2d 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994).\n   <em>\n    In re GGI Properties, LLC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n    568 B.R. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D.N.J. 2017). The court additionally concluded that the transfer could constitute an avoidable preference under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). It thus denied the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by City of Millville (\"City\") on those grounds. But as it further found that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding the value of the property transferred on December 31, 2015 (the time of the transfer via foreclosure) and March 8, 2016 (the petition date) (together, the \"Relevant Dates\"), it set trial on that issue. The trial having concluded and the parties having submitted memoranda of law, the court now values the property at $530,000. It finds that the debtor, GGI Properties, LLC (\"GGI\"), did not receive reasonably equivalent value for the transfer, therefore the transfer can be avoided as constructively fraudulent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

HISTORY OF THE PROPERTY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Glass-making has American roots in South Jersey, an area rich in the sand and iron used in glass, as well as in trees for\n   fuel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 1779, several glassblowers from Wistarburgh Glass Manufactory, which had opened in 1739 in Alloway, New Jersey, established their own \"glass works\" in what became Glassboro, New Jersey.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then in 1888, Dr. Theodor Corson Wheaton, a pharmacist, began making his own pill bottles in Millville, New Jersey in a company that became Wheaton USA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2002, GGI's predecessor bought Wheaton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Kenneth Rock, 75 years old, spent his career in the glass industry. T1, p. 116.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He worked for the Coming Glass Works out of college, then Sylvania to build a glass factory in Kentucky and serve as General Manager for 19 years, and finally for Wheaton Industries in Millville.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pp. 116-17. Wheaton hired Mr. Rock in the 1990s as vice president of its glass tubing operations, and later promoted him to president and put him on its board, T1, pp. 116-17. Wheaton had its corporate headquarters, two glass factories, a research facility and a plastics division in Millville.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 117. It also had operations in Elmer, Mays Landing, and Williamstown, New Jersey; a large glass factory in Flat River, Missouri; and a joint venture in China with Beijing General Glass Company.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 117; see pp. 120-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At some point, Wheaton was purchased by Alusuisse, which was acquired by Alcan (and which later became part of Rio Tinto).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 118.

It is not known what The Glass Group paid for Wheaton. According to Mr. Rock, the company was losing money when The Glass Group bought it, and though he was able to bring it up to break-even condition, in 2005 it filed chapter 11 in Delaware.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 121;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Bankr.

T1, pp. 132-33;\n   <em>\n    In re GGI Properties, LLC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n    568 B.R. at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . GGI is owned by in equal halves by the Leonard Nave Revocable Trust, trustee Leonard Nave, and the Kenneth C.

D-16. It is not known who the beneficiaries of these trusts are.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the time of GGIs purchase of Lot 1 in 2006, the property was assessed at $2,650,000, with $365,100 allocated to the land and $2,285,000 to the improvements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ex. P-20. In 2008, GGI successfully appealed that assessment, lowering the assessment to $1,676,400 as of October 1, 2007, reflecting the same $365,100 Value for the land while reducing the amount allocated to the improvements to $ 1,311,000.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2009, GGI stopped paying its real estate taxes. T1, p. 137-38. In September 2009, it listed the property for sale for $1,649,000 but it did not sell.\n   <em>\n    In re GGI Properties, LLC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n    568 B.R. at 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr. Rock testified that in 2009, GGI had terminated two leases on the property at the City's request due to its concern that they were creating a hazard to the community. T1, p. 171. However, an appraisal created for GGI in 2012 (the \"Kay Appraisal\") referenced a month-to-month lease existing in 2012.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pp. 120, 172. In any case, after the leases were terminated, GGI did not re-let any of the premises.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 138. In August 2010, the City purchased the tax certificate for the unpaid taxes of 2009 and 2010.\n   <em>\n    In re GGI Properties, LLC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n    568 B.R. at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2012, still not paying its taxes, GGI again appealed its assessment. T1, p. 83. The Kay Appraisal estimated the fair market value of the property from between $300,000 and $600,000.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pp. 83-84; T2, p. 94. GGI and the City eventually settled on an assessed value of $600,000 as of October 1, 2011\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   based on this appraisal, again reflecting an assessed value of $365,100 for the land, but now only $234,900 for the improvements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pp. 82-83, 94; T2, p. 94. The County Tax Board entered judgment on the settlement thereafter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 113. GGI argues that the property is worth \"at least $600,000\" based on this assessment remaining in place as of the Relevant Dates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Despite the reduction in the assessment, GGI did not resume paying its taxes. The City filed a complaint for an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   foreclosure on October 21, 2014 and obtained a final judgment on December 31, 2015, reflecting unpaid taxes at that time of $427,767.45. Ex. P-15;\n   <em>\n    In re GGI Properties, LLC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n    568 B.R. at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After that complaint had been filed but before judgment on it was entered, GGI entered into a contract for sale of the property. On January 9, 2015, Community Development, LLC (\"CDL\"), a company created by Richard Brooks for this purpose, signed an agreement to purchase the property for $700,000. T2, p. 34; Ex. P-4 (the \"CDL Agreement\"). Mr. Brooks, whose former business was demolition and liquidation, testified that he anticipated several types of businesses operating at the property, including a truck and auto auction site; an R &amp; D lab; residential boiler manufacturing; food court backed by a microbrewery; UPS distribution/warehousing and equipment surplus as needed by local food companies such as Campbell's Soup and Progresso; resurrection of Money Talks Magazine (for which he'd been a founder and publisher in New York). T2, pp. 21-23. He would also demolish one and a half buildings to harvest the steel, which he estimated was worth between $800,000 and $1 million, at only a $250,000 cost to demolish,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The CDL Agreement set the purchase price at $700,000 with a down payment of $25,000 to be held in escrow with CDL's title insurance company. Ex. P-4, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3(a). At closing, CDL would pay $275,000, plus, if it so chose, assumption of the property taxes outstanding at the time of closing, with a credit against the purchase price of the outstanding property taxes as\n   of January 1, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 3(b), (c).

The CDL Agreement disclosed existing liens and encumbrances as the property taxes and a mortgage in favor of Mr. Rock, which had been disclosed as in the amount of $332,429.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 3(j); Ex, D-16. Despite this disclosure, the contract did not provide either for the assumption or the payment of the mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Closing on the CDL Agreement was to be held no later than 45 days from the execution of the agreement, \"or at any other date as may be selected by the mutual agreement of Seller and Purchaser ...,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 3(k), though time was also made \"of the essence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 4(d). Forty-five days would have been on or around February 23, 2015, but according to Mr. Brooks, the parties did not close on account of the \"reluctance\" of one of his funders regarding the back taxes. T2, pp. 15-16. Mr. Brooks had asked the City to allow him to pay the back taxes over 12 months,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 16, a request the City rejected via email on April 17, 2015.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Nevertheless, on June 1, 2015, GGI and CDL amended the CDL Agreement. Ex. D-17 (the \"First Amended CDL Agreement\"). This amendment ratified the original agreement and added indemnification by GGI against any and all claims arising from any hazardous substances discharged \"at any time up until the date of the Closing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2. The First Amended CDL Agreement provided that to the extent GGI failed to so indemnify CDL, then CDL could deduct such costs against the mortgage payments owed by CDL.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 3. The First Amended CDL Agreement also stated that the due diligence period had expired and would not be extended, and that the closing would be June 15, 2015 or earlier, at the buyer's discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6. That CDL further contracted with GGI and the amendment only concerned environmental issues suggests that the failure of the CDL Agreement to close had more to do with the remediation issues and nothing to do with the property taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   But the parties still did not close on the transaction. Rather, on August 15, 2015, GGI and CDL ratified the CDL Agreement and entered into another amendment. Ex. D-22 (the \"Second Amended CDL Agreement\"). The Second Amended CDL Agreement replaced the First Amended CDL Agreement, but included an environmental indemnification provision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. Under this agreement, CDL would pay at closing $25,000, plus an amount to pay the real estate taxes in full.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In addition, CDL was to pay half of GGI's legal and filing fees to GGI's bankruptcy counsel, estimated to be $6,776, and half of \"fees paid to Kinney [sic \"Kenny\"] Environmental Services, estimated to be $3,000.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   CDL was also to execute a note and second mortgage (after Mr. Rock's) on the property, for the balance of the purchase price less $100,000, payable semi-annually and due one year from closing with interest at 5 percent per annum.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   CDL would execute yet another note and third mortgage in the amount of $100,000, payable three years from closing with interest at 5 percent per annum.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (A requirement to pay the third mortgage semi-annually was crossed out and initialed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The closing date was changed to September 30, 2015.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, using the $429,767 figure for the taxes, CDL would\n   be allowed to stretch approximately $136,000 over the first year and pay $ 100,000 in the third year after closing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Regarding the payment of GGI's bankruptcy counsel, this related to a chapter 11 bankruptcy case filed by GGI in this court through the Law Offices of Seymour Wasserstrum on June 25, 2015-after the First Amended CDL Agreement and before its June 15th closing date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankr. No. 15-21939-ABA (the \"2015 Bankruptcy\"). This clause may have been drafted in haste, as the provision had the parties reversed: it stated that Seller (GGI) would make these payments on the Buyer's (CDL's) behalf. Ex. D-22. But Mr. Brooks testified that it was indeed the buyer's responsibility. T2, pp. 33-34. And in this instant chapter 11 case, GGI disclosed that it paid its prior bankruptcy counsel $6,717 on June 25, 2016 and a debt for \"environmental services\" payable to Kenny Environmental Services, LLC in the amount of $4,000, Ex. D-16 (SOFA and Schedule E/F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Thus the list of errors/oddities in the various CDL agreements include: \"time of the essence\" despite moving the closing date several times; crediting taxes as of January 1, 2014; no provision for payment or assumption of Mr. Rock's mortgage; and the seller paying attorney and Kinney fees rather than the buyer. None of the agreements appeared to be drafted by an attorney, and all were signed by Mr. Nave. In addition, at 81 years old, T2, p. 21, Mr. Brooks had some difficult testifying. He did not recognize the First Amended CDL Agreement or the Second Amended CDL Agreement,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p, 26; and could not remember whether he knew that the City had filed a foreclosure action,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 28; or what attorney Wasserstrum's involvement was,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pp. 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Two weeks before entry of the City's foreclosure judgment, on December 15, 2015, GGI entered into a contract with Anthony DeSantis of Brooklyn, New York, \"as agent for an entity to be formed\" for $530,000. Ex. P-6 (the \"$530,000 Contract\"). Mr. DeSantis testified that his main business is recycling plastic for other customers. T1, p. 26. He was interested in this property for its location near prospective workers and an existing bus stop, industrial water and sewer, heavy power supply, and rail access.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pp. 26, 28-29, 40-41, 66. His immediate plan was to remodel some offices immediately and set them as a local headquarter for the entity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 32. He would remodel the nurses' station for a place for engineers to stay, and then work \"around the clock\" to get a couple of buildings up and secured to have a safe, secure place for storage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The contract called for a down payment of $50,000 with the balance of the $530,000 purchase price paid at closing. Ex. P-6, \u00b6 5. It also provided for GGI to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [p]rovide for payment of all outstanding liens, mortgages or other monetary encumbrance which are liens against the Property, including all real estate taxes or other amount levied upon the Property by any governmental agency which create or may create if unpaid a lien upon the Property, which payment may be made out of the Purchase Price to be paid at closing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14.2. Mr. DeSantis was granted a due diligence period until February 5, 2016.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   There was no explanation provided at trial for the fact that $530,000 would not cover both the real estate taxes and Mr. Rock's $332,429 mortgage. Possibly the provision was poorly drafted and was not intended to include the mortgage, or Mr. Rock agreed to take a loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   GGI agreed as a condition of closing to comply with its ISRA obligations, including, prior to closing, obtaining a Remediation\n   Certification, approval of a Remedial Action Workplan, or a waiver or other approval from the NJ DEP, as well as obtaining and maintaining a \"Remediation Funding Source\" approvable by a Licensed Site Remediation Professional or NJ DEP. Ex. P-6, \u00b6 9.12. It also would assign to the purchaser the Glass Group Indemnification Agreement (to be discussed below).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9.13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   GGI did not inform Mr. DeSantis that it had outstanding property taxes or that the City had filed a complaint in foreclosure against it. This appears to be in breach of GGI's representation in the $530,000 Contract that it \"represents that it has no knowledge of any pending or threatened litigation affecting the Property or Seller's interest in the Property and that Seller is not a party to any litigation affecting the Property.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9.9. Rather, Mr. DeSantis learned about the tax issue through his own due diligence. T1, p. 28. But before he could meet with the City, the City had foreclosed on the property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While walking the property in January 2016, Mr. DeSantis ran into Joseph Sooy, one of the City's commissioners, and \"... that's when [the City] became aware [of us] and we became aware of everything that was - what type of fiasco was going on.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On March 17, 2016, after GGI had filed this bankruptcy case and this adversary proceeding, the $530,000 Contract apparently was mutually cancelled and Mr. DeSantis and Linda Salamon, \"as agents for an entity to be formed,\" entered into a contract of sale with GGI to purchase the property for $690,000. Ex. P-7 (the \"$690,000 Agreement\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Rock testified that the increased purchase price reflected the amount GGI owed in taxes, the $200,000 cost of an indemnification agreement, and administrative costs that GGI incurred in connection with the property. T1, p. 147. The court rejects this reason because GGI had already agreed to sell for $530,000-that Mr. Rock wanted more money is not grounds to void that contract in order to force a price increase, and Mr. DeSantis could have added Ms. Salamon as a member of the original \"entity to be formed\" rather than enter into a new agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   More credibly, Mr. DeSantis testified that he offered more to close quickly. \"The increased price was our perception of the weights and balances where we would pay a higher price to close the property sooner\" which would keep Ms. Salamon in the deal. T1, p. 38. Mr. DeSantis's \"group\" later-around July 2017-purchased the adjacent 27.56-acre property, a working glass factory known as Gerresheimer Glass, for $1.7 million (approx., $61,683 per acre); at the time of the hearing, he had posted it for rent. T1, pp. 56, 58, 71, 85. Mr. DeSantis testified that the two properties share an internal fence and a rail line, and Gerresheimer has an easement to discharge water into Ada Pond, located on GGI's property. T1, p. 57. At the time of the trial, Mr. DeSantis appeared to still be interested in purchasing GGI's property, so likely the higher price also reflected the desire to own both parcels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The $690,000 Agreement recited that \"Upon execution of this agreement the amounts currently on deposit and held in escrow by Lincoln Land Services, LLC in the amount of $50,000 shall be deemed the earnest money deposit under this agreement.\" Ex. P-7, \u00b6 5.1(a). GGI did not disclose in this bankruptcy any interest in funds held in escrow, and there was no testimony regarding whether the $50,000 was paid. Ex. D-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The $690,000 Agreement required a cash payment of $100,000 at closing, plus an amount equal to the amount owed in taxes to the City prior to its foreclosure judgment, \"and any other outstanding liens upon the Property including amounts owed for real estate taxes [,] water and sewer charges, etc., provided the aggregate amount does not exceed the Purchase Price....\" Ex. P-7, \u00b6\u00b6 5.1 (a), (c). Any remainder owed would be paid pursuant to a promissory note payable three years from the date of closing at the rate of three percent per annum.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5.1(d). The agreement provided that the buyer could \"withhold payment of principal and interest from the Seller in the event the Seller, its successor and or assigns (which shall include Buyer) are deemed liable for any environmental remediation relating to the Property. The Seller shall be allowed an offset directly against the principal and interest for any environmental remediation that the Seller, its successors and/or assigns are liable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But with the City owed at least $400,000, Mr. Rock $332,429, and the $50,000 down payment and $100,000 cash due at closing totaling over $690,000, it seems that there would be no need for a promissory note, unless, again, the \"liens\" were not intended to include Mr. Rock's mortgage, in which case the closing price approximates $530,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The $690,000 Agreement provided for a closing date of April 15, 2016 \"or such earlier date as Buyer and Seller may determine,\" ex.

He stated that at some time certain Chinese investors were told by the City that the City could sell the property to them cheaper than GGI could. T1, pp. 138-39. But the investors purchased property in North Jersey instead.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Rock stated that the price with the Chinese investors was whatever the taxes were plus $ 100,000.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 139.

Mr. Rock, Mr. DeSantis and Mr. Sooy testified regarding the condition of the property at various dates: Mr. Rock in November 2015, T1, p. 151; Messrs. DeSantis and Sooy in early January 2016, T1, pp. 42, 51-52; T2, p. 141; and Mr. DeSantis again around April 2016. T1, p. 52. Mr. Sooy had worked at Wheaton from 1986 to 1989, so as with Mr. Rock, he had some familiarity with the property. T2, p. 140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In general, the court gained the sense that the 18-acre property has been continually deteriorating since the closing of the plant due both to age and vandalism. As industrial buildings, none sounded especially appealing in their current state, and any intact buildings would need restoration-new drywall, painting, flooring, possibly window replacement-to be usable by a new owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   According to the property record cards, T1, p. 91, the bulk of the buildings were built in the 1930s and 1940s, with one as\n   early as 1924 and the most recent in 1977. Ex. P-20. The biggest example of the effects of age was the observation that the roof on a metal building was deteriorating prior to December 2015 and finally collapsed sometime after January 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   T1, pp. 30, 155; T2, p. 171. This was a building that Mr. Rock testified he had intended to take down to salvage the steel. T1, p. 155. Mr. Rock testified about steel being worth $820,000 as of the trial. T1, p. 156. He did not disclose it in the 2015 Bankruptcy because, he claimed, it is an \"intangible asset\" that would not be recorded on a balance sheet.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pp. 176, 181.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Mr. Rock admitted that graffiti existed prior to December 2015, and he and other witnesses testified that it increased substantially after.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   T1, pp. 31 (less graffiti before than after), 61-62 (no graffiti in the nurse's station); T2, pp. 150 (more graffiti between January 2016 and March 2016), 160 (more graffiti since December 2015). Similarly, testimony regarding windows noted them intact in certain buildings prior to December 2015 and January 2016,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   T1, pp. 55, 61-62 (windows in nurse's station intact), 151 (windows in office building intact), but broken between January 2016 and March 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   T2, p. 150.

There's constant vandalizing.\" T2, p. 178. That vandalism \"for years\" included theft of copper and transformers. T2, p. 176.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   T2, p. 142 (testimony of Mr. Sooy that in January 2016, \"large copper wires ... they were all gone.\"). Messrs. DeSantis and Sooy were in agreement that all or most transformers were missing in January 2016. T1, p. 55; T2, p. 148.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Testimony was conflicting regarding water damage in the main administrative building. Mr. Rock testified that all water except for fire hydrants had been shut off long before 2015, T2, p. 177, but Mr. Sooy noticed a broken water pipe on his site visit in January 2016, and had the water department shut the water off. T2, pp. 147-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mr. Rock testified positively about the quality of many of the buildings on site in November 2015. An office building had all of its windows, T1, p. 151; a finishing building built in 1989\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a so-called \"quality\" building in good condition,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pp. 152-53, a maintenance shop in \"move-in\" condition. T1, p. 154. As industrial buildings, they mostly had concrete floors,\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269139\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pp. 151-55 (maintenance building), 157 (small storage building); T2, p. 171 (metal building with roof collapse). The flooring in the office building had been removed for asbestos remediation, thus according to Mr. Rock needed carpeting, as well as the bathrooms \"spruced up\" and the ceiling tile removed.

T2, pp. 142-143. One side of the concrete batch house was cracked. T2, p. 144. Another building had mold, pigeon droppings and broken glass on the floor. T2, p. 144. It appeared to him that people had been living there, as he saw clothing, human feces, and glassine envelopes typical of drugs. T2, p. 144. The bathrooms there were destroyed. T2, p. 144. A building where glass had been molded was \"wrecked,\" with parts of the metal ceiling falling in, no electrical bus, \"holes and just a general state of disrepair.\" T2, p. 145. Another building had a homemade skateboard park with ramp made with plywood and other found material. T2, p. 147.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The City did some clean-up work on the property, e.g. cutting down trees in the alleyways to facilitate access to Rio Tinto for its environmental remediation work, putting steel plates over several floor pits at an alleged cost of $25,000430,000, and patching fences.

Mr. Bainbridge did not consider any salvageable steel value because the estimated $1 million cost of demolition and asbestos removal that the City provided him would dwarf the value of any steel.

It was an unconsummated contract, not merely an offer; the buyer was to pay cash, no creative financing. It acknowledged the environmental issues and provided for indemnification. It agreed to purchase \"as is.\" Mr. DeSantis was motivated to purchase the property. The property had been exposed to the market since 2009 when it had been listed at $1,649,000 but did not sell. It is not known whether Mr. DeSantis was aware of Mr. Rock's alleged mortgage, but the $530,000 Contract did not require payment of any liens. Similarly, though he did not know about the outstanding taxes, those were allocated to GGI through a customary \"to be adjusted as of the closing date\" clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex.

Thus, unconsummated contracts have evidentiary weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Importantly, had Mr. DeSantis\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   entered into the $530,000 Contract, the court may have been inclined to discount it as untested by due diligence. But he returned-with more money and another investor-effectively ratifying his earlier offer without suggesting that the property was worth any more than his original offer. Rather, he offered more solely to close more quickly, incentivized by his desire to own both this and the Gerresheimer tract and to keep Ms. Salamon in the deal. While the $690,000 purchase price included an unsecured note for the balance owed after the closing date, as explained above, there would be no balance since $690,000 would not cover $150,000 plus the City's prepetition and postpetition tax claim and Mr. Rock's mortgage. Alternatively, if Mr. Rock's mortgage was not intended to be included in the liens to be paid off at closing, then, as the City argued (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 48, p. 17), the majority of the increase was contained in this unsecured note, further supporting that the \"real\" price was $530,000. By the time of the $690,000 Agreement, Mr. DeSantis knew the City had foreclosed, thus he understood the ownership contingency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In coming to this conclusion, the court acknowledges that with a foreclosure judgment looming at the time of the $530,000 Contract, GGI was under a compulsion to sell. Though \"distress\" sales usually result in a price lower than fair market value,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tedesco v. Montclair Twp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"797091\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-tax/21/95/#p99\">\n    21 N.J. Tax 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99 (Super. Ct. App. Div. 2003), here the court believes that, for once, GGI accepted only what it could get. At $530,000, GGI would not get covered both the taxes and Mr. Rock's loan, neither of which have anything to do with the value of the property. GGI rushed this contract, falsely warranting that there was no pending litigation involving the property. In contrast, as to CDL, $700,000 was more than the market could bear, with Mr. Brooks unable to get his financers to close. And after GGI's 2016 Bankruptcy filing (which it may not have informed Mr. DeSantis about), GGI felt free to negotiate again, pushing the price up to cover its losses again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   That Mr. DeSantis agreed to increase the price reflected his desire to own both parcels. But so-called assemblage prices generally do not reflect fair market value.\n   <em>\n    See The Appraisal of Real Estate,\n   </em>\n   pp. 363-64 (Appraisal Institute, 14th ed. 2013) (\"Certain parcels can achieve a higher value as part of an assemblage.... [A] buyer who purchases a site with the intent to assemble it with other parcels might have to pay a higher-than-market value for that site ....

The\n   <em>\n    Mocco\n   </em>\n   court rejected evidence of an unconsummated contract because the court had not been provided a copy of the 11-year old contract to determine whether it had any contingencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Thus, while the City makes a fair legal point, it also supports the court's targeting the $530,000 value. The due diligence contingency ended in February prior to the price increase in March. Though the $530,000 Contract required GGI to comply with its ISRA obligations such as to permit sale, the City did not question GGI's ability to comply with this condition, and Mr. DeSantis was seemingly unconcerned enough about it to recruit additional financing to re-contract. At the time of the $530,000 Contract, GGI owned the property, and Mr. DeSantis only conditioned closing on due diligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In arriving at a $530,000 value, the court includes no value to any salvageable steel on the property. Mr. DeSantis expressed no interest in it, GGI did not disclose its value in its 2015 bankruptcy filing, and Mr. Rock's explanation that he did not consider it an asset because it was an intangible is nonsense: One, steel is not an intangible, and two, intangible assets still must be disclosed. As a former CEO, certainly he understands that. While Mr. Brooks stated that he worked in demolition, he was not qualified as an expert,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 702, and otherwise his testimony was confused. Mr. Brooks testified that he planned to salvage the steel for a net of $550,000 to $750,000, but if so, then query why he was not able to close the deal. Similarly, if the net value of the steel was so high, it is inconceivable that GGI would not have sold it to pay the taxes to prevent foreclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Durso Supermarkets, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6455340\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/193/682/\">\n    193 B.R. 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 709 n.23 (Bankr.

Nobody presented the court with credible evidence, by expert or otherwise, of an estimate of the amount of steel and a price per pound as of the Relevant Dates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The court also does not increase the contract price for the $200,000 ascribed to the Glass Group Indemnification Agreement, as GGI agreed in the $530,000 Contract to assign it to the buyer, therefore it was accounted for in the price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The court cannot take into account the $61,683 per-acre price of the Gerresheimer property, since it has no evidence as to the condition of that property such as the comparability of usable improvements (Mr. DeSantis testified that it was a working glass factory), or its environmental condition, and because the purchase occurred in 2017, remote in time to the Relevant Dates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The court also attaches little weight to CDL's $700,000 offer. Mr. Brooks did not testify as to how he came up with that price. GGI's appraisal estimated the value just three years earlier at $300,000-$600,000, and nobody testified that the property had increased in value since then. The $700,000 Agreement also was not a cash offer, instead providing for an unsecured note for the balance of the price after payment of only $275,000 at closing. There also was no credible reason given for its failure to close. GGI argued that it was the City's fault for not letting CDL pay the taxes off over time. But CDL entered into two amendments of the sale contract after being notified of that refusal, both with stated closing dates with \"time of the essence.\" The court supposes that the price was too high for Mr. Brooks to find investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   What of the $600,000 assessed value? First, that the $600,000 came about by way of settlement does not mean that it did not reflect fair market value in 2012.

Tax 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 549 (1985), the presumption was applied against the municipality because it sought to establish a value for the property that exceeded the value indicated by the judgment of the County Board of Taxation. Moreover, once the presumption is rebutted, a court may \"consider the totality of the evidence presented without reliance on any presumption.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Curtis Papers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202777277\">\n    2008 WL 2777277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Bankr. D.N.J. July 17, 2008). GGI conceded this in its post-trial brief in stating that the presumption \"can only be overcome via definite and certain competent evidence.\" Doc. No. 47, p. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The court finds here that the $600,000 assessment was rebutted not only by the $530,000 Contract but by the continued deterioration of the property. The property has sat vacant for years. It was last only partially occupied in 2012. By agreement of GGI and the City, the assessed value of the improvements dropped from $2,285,000 in 2005 to $1,311,000 in 2007 to $234,900 in 2011. If, as GGI contended in 2012, the property's value could drop from\n   $1,676,000 to $600,000 in two years' time, naturally it would not hold steady at $600,000 over the following four to five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   While GGI complains that the City did not secure or repair anything during its ownership, it presented no evidence that it had maintained the property in any manner other than fencing. The owners of GGI reside in Kentucky, not in New Jersey available to make certain that the property is secured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   A roof that caved in would have caved in and the burst pipe would have burst, drug users and skateboard riders could get through fences, regardless of the owner. The City at least covered liability-begging holes in the floors. Mr. Rock admitted that transformers and copper have been removed over many years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The photographs admitted into evidence show a decaying behemoth. Mr. Rock's testimony that the photos only showed the \"bad\" buildings carries no weight with the court since there was no reason GGI could not have offered its own photographs of these alleged move-in ready buildings. GGI's argument that the significant deterioration occurred solely after the City took possession due to its failure to adequately secure the property is unsupported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The court assumes that GGI made a strategic decision not to submit an appraisal, as even in 2012 its own appraiser estimated that the value could be as low as $300,000 (which is less than the $365,100 historically attributed to just the land). This might reflect the biases inherent to property valuation, i.e., that parties' valuation arguments change depending upon the purpose of the valuation with taxpayers seeking low valuations and property sellers seeking high ones. That $300,000 value, GGI's failure to submit that or any appraisal, together with the passage of four years while the property lay vacant, leads the court to conclude that the property is no longer worth $600,000. If GGI is to hold the City to its settlement at $600,000, then certainly it cannot disavow that it argued in 2012 that the property might be worth half as much.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The court acknowledges that an assessor has a statutory duty to perform assessment maintenance, but considering the property was left vacant the City more likely improperly rolled the assessments over from year to year.

GGI's allegation that the City interfered with a possible sale to Chinese investors was not supported by any evidence: Mr. Rock could not remember the investors' names, did not produce any contract, and his allegation that the City told the investors that it could sell the property to them cheaper than GGI, even if true, seems valid since Mr. Rock wanted $100,000 on top of whatever the delinquent taxes had accrued to, while the City would only sell for the amount of the taxes. Moreover, the investors allegedly purchased property in North Jersey instead, suggesting that their interest was low to begin with.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The court already debunked GGPs argument about the City's refusal to let CDL pay the taxes over time. Notably, the City had filed its tax foreclosure complaint six months prior to CDL's request. GGI produced no evidence that the City's request that it end certain leases on the property was inappropriate. The City proceeded in good faith by allowing GGI to appeal its assessment in 2012 without first bringing the taxes current, something it did not have to do,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. \u00a7 54:3-27, and for not commencing foreclosure until more than five years after the 2009 default, despite\n   the property not earning any income, and GGI not paying any more taxes or (in 2015, at least) insuring the property. Despite the court's reproach in its previous opinion, GGI did not cite to any duty of the City to cooperate with its sale effort. Thus, the court finds that the City acted in good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Nevertheless, the court holds that $530,000 is not reasonably equivalent value to $429,767.

D. Conn. 1999), finding the dollar amount of difference more important than any percentage guideline. As the City received $100,233 more than its debt through this transfer, not an insignificant amount considering the $372,537 in claims it could be applied to pay, GGI did not receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The court further finds that GGI was insolvent or became insolvent at the time of the transfer. It agrees with the City that some of GGI's scheduled debts look suspicious as possibly belonging to insiders that may have made capital contributions rather than loans. But suspicion is not proof, and the City did not present any evidence of the beneficiaries of the two-member family trusts, or the NARO or RONA trusts, to rebut GGI's assertion of insolvency. Moreover, GGI's schedules reflect that at the time of the transfer, its debts were greater than all of its property. Again, the City did not present any evidence to rebut this. Finally, if not already insolvent, certainly the transfer of arguably its only asset left GGI insolvent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Thus, the transfer was constructively fraudulent as there has been a transfer to the City of an interest of GGI in property within 2 years before the date of the filing of the petition, which GGI did not receive reasonably equivalent value, and at the time of the transfer, GGI was or became insolvent.
