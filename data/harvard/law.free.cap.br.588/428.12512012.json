Appellant's Suppl. Br. 3. McCabe argues that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine is inapplicable because he is \"not attacking the merits of the state court judgment\" and although the judgment is valid, the validity of a judgment does not prevent its discharge in bankruptcy. Appellee's Br. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Rooker-Feldman doctrine did not prohibit the Bankruptcy Court from considering whether the CCP judgment was dischargeable because: (1) bankruptcy courts are empowered to discharge state court judgments, and (2) the federal claim was not inextricability intertwined with the state adjudication. As Rooker-Feldman is a jurisdictional doctrine, the Court reviews the issue\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re United Healthcare Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9034100,9031405\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/396/247/\">\n    396 F.3d at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Rooker-Feldman is a jurisdictional doctrine, which stands for the principle that \"federal district courts lack jurisdiction over suits that are essentially appeals from state-court judgments....\"\n   <em>\n    Great W.

The Rooker-Feldman doctrine provides that federal courts lack jurisdiction under two circumstances: (1) the federal claim was actually litigated in state court prior to the filing of the federal action, or (2) \"the federal claim is inextricably intertwined with the state adjudication.\"\n   <em>\n    Madera v. Ameriquest Mortg. Co.

A federal claim is inextricably intertwined with the state adjudication if a federal grant of relief would require the federal court to determine the state court judgment was in error, or to take other action that would negate the state court judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3485538,4131164\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/228/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court did not violate the Rooker Feldman doctrine by\n   discharging the state court judgment.\n   <em>\n    Knapper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8972512,8973840\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/407/573/\">\n    407 F.3d 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 583 n.22 (3d Cir. 2005). Rather, the Bankruptcy Court properly exercised its exclusive statutory power to determine whether McCabe's debt was dischargeable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Rooker-Feldman doctrine did not prohibit the Bankruptcy Court from hearing the claim because the federal claim was not actually litigated in state court. In addition, the claim was not \"inextricably intertwined\" with the CCP judgment because the grant of relief requested by McCabe did not require the Bankruptcy Court to determine that the CCP judgment was in error, nor take action that would negate the CCP judgment. Indeed, McCabe did not request that the Bankruptcy Court review or reject the merits of the CCP judgment. Rather, McCabe was attempting to prevent the Bankruptcy Court from giving effect to the CCP judgment. In sum, the Rooker-Feldman doctrine did not deprive the Bankruptcy Court of the subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court AFFIRMS the Bankruptcy Court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The Bankruptcy Court reviewed the Damages Hearing transcript and determined that, even if the Bankruptcy Court admitted the CCP Damages Hearing transcript, the transcript contradicted Corcoran's assertion that McCabe intended to cause a willful and malicious injury to Corcoran. This Court finds that the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in making this conclusion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The Rooker-Feldman doctrine applies differently to bankruptcy courts, as \"[b]ankruptcy courts have extensive powers to modify or discharge state-court judgments.\"\n    <em>\n     Loucas v.
