The issue is not only important to each of these debtors but also to the City of Chicago (City), which relies upon collection of parking and red-light ticket revenue to fund approximately 7% of the City's budget.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   George Peake (Mr. Peake or Debtor) owns a 2007 Lincoln MKZ vehicle (MKZ) with approximately 200,000 miles and valued by him at $4,310. GO Financial holds a first priority lien on the MKZ securing a debt in the amount of $7,312.79. After Mr. Peake, as owner of the MKZ, accrued several final determinations of liability for parking and automated red-light violations, the MKZ was immobilized and later impounded by the City of Chicago.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The immobilization\n   took place on May 31, 2018, and, a day later, the City towed and impounded the MKZ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Peake works at an Amazon facility in Joliet, Illinois, approximately 45 miles from his southside of Chicago residence and relies upon the MKZ to drive to and from work. Without his car, he has been forced to pay others to drive him to Joliet. Like so many others in this district, Mr. Peake chose on June 9 to file a chapter 13 petition in an attempt to pay his outstanding traffic violation fines through his plan. Mr. Peake alleges that the City would not release his MKZ unless he complied with one of two options proposed by the City: (1) wait until his plan was confirmed treating the City as a fully secured creditor with a 60-month plan, or (2) provide treatment for the City as a fully secured creditor in a 60-month plan and pay as much as $1,250 immediately for release of the MKZ. George Peake's Motion for Turnover, Docket No. 16, at 4, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. Mr. Peake did not agree to or was unable to comply with the demand for immediate payment for the release of the MKZ. He has treated the City's claim in his proposed amended plan as secured in section 3.2. George Peake's Plan, Docket No. 31, at \u00a7 3.2. Through confirmation of his proposed plan Mr. Peake would be able to drive his MKZ and use his disposable income to make payments to the City as well as other creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After trying and failing to obtain the release of his vehicle by notifying the City of his bankruptcy filing, Mr. Peake filed this motion to enforce the automatic stay and to compel the City to turn over the MKZ. The narrow question presented in this case is whether the City's retention of possession of a vehicle in which the Debtor has an ownership interest on the petition date violates the automatic stay, in particular section 362(a)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unless one of the automatic stay exceptions, namely section 362(b)(3) or (b)(4), applies, the City's conduct in retaining possession of the vehicle violates section 362(a)(3) as that section has been interpreted by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. General Motors Acceptance Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5895949,3648271\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/699/\">\n    566 F.3d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2009) (\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ). There, the Seventh Circuit held that the act of passively retaining an asset \"constitutes exercising control over it, and such action violates section 362(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code.\"\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5895949,3648271\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/699/\">\n    566 F.3d at 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the court concludes that neither section 362(b)(3) nor section 362(b)(4) applies to the City's retention of the Debtor's vehicle in this case. The City, therefore, has violated the automatic stay by refusing to return the Debtor's car, and it must release the MKZ to the Debtor immediately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Thompson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The City first asks the court to decline to follow the Seventh Circuit's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   , which held that, upon the request of a debtor in bankruptcy, a creditor must return the debtor's vehicle to him even though the creditor was lawfully in possession of the vehicle at the time of the petition, and that, after return of the vehicle, the creditor may seek an order of adequate protection of its property interest in the bankruptcy court.\n   <em>\n    Thompson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5895949,3648271\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/699/\">\n    566 F.3d at 703, 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court, of course, is not at liberty to decline to follow a decision of the Court of Appeals for the circuit in which this court sits, at least unless subsequent events make it \"almost certain\" that the Court of Appeals would repudiate its prior decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colby v.

Ill. 2013). That certainty does not exist here, despite the fact that a circuit split has recently been created on the issue addressed by the court in\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    WD Equipment, LLC v. Cowen (In re Cowen)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277790,12272943\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/943/\">\n    849 F.3d 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2017). The City's request is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The City's Interest in Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The City's primary argument is that it does not have a duty to turn over the Debtor's vehicle pursuant to section 362(a) and\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   because its act of continuing to retain possession of the vehicle is an \"act ... to continue or maintain the perfection of [its] interest in property ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). For this provision to apply, an \"interest in property\" must exist as of the petition date.\n   <em>\n    In re 229 Main St. Ltd. P'ship\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9481599\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/262/1/#p5\">\n    262 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5 (1st Cir. 2001). The Debtor argues in substance that the City has no interest in property because the City ordinances giving it an interest in property are not valid exercises of the City's Home Rule authority. Because the City's ordinance-scheme is a valid exercise of the express statutory authority granted to it by the State of Illinois, and because that ordinance scheme in this case resulted in the City having a possessory interest\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the Debtor's vehicle as of the date of the petition, the Debtor's argument is rejected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The City's Ordinances Provide the Mechanism for its Asserted Interest in Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As the City notes, this case is a \"boot and impound\" case where the Debtor's vehicle was first immobilized and then towed to a City impound lot for accrued but unpaid parking and automated red-light violation tickets. The City first argues that its booting and impounding of the Debtor's vehicle is appropriate (1) under its ordinances and (2) under 625 ILCS \u00a7 5/11-208.2\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , which is the portion of the Illinois Vehicle Code permitting municipalities like the City to administratively adjudicate \"violations of traffic regulations concerning the standing, parking, or condition of vehicles, automated traffic law violations,\n   and automated speed enforcement system violations.\" 625 ILCS \u00a7 5/11-208.3. Chicago's inherent Home Rule authority, while usually broad, has been explicitly curtailed in this area by the Illinois legislature, and the City may not implement ordinances that are inconsistent with the state statutory scheme. 625 ILCS \u00a7 5/11-208.2 ;\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago v.

The role of the judge in such a proceeding is minimal. She may only verify whether the final determination of liability has been entered in accordance with the Illinois Vehicle Code and the applicable City ordinances. 625 ILCS \u00a7 5/11-208.3(f).

The number of\n   final determinations required before a vehicle is eligible for immobilization is determined by local ordinance. 625 ILCS \u00a7 5/11-208.3(c)(1). The City's ordinances set the number at two or three, the former number being used only if the final determinations of liability have been outstanding for over a year. M.C.C. \u00a7 9-100-120(b). Going back to the Illinois statute, the law provides for both immobilization and towing/impoundment following an immobilization. 625 ILCS \u00a7 5/11-208.3(c)(3), (4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Given the statute's express linkage with final determinations of liability,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   625 ILCS \u00a7 5/11-208.3(c)(1), it is clear that the State of Illinois has authorized municipalities like the City to bypass the traditional panoply of collection remedies in a narrowly defined set of circumstances.

What this means is that the execution lienor could defeat the City's right to possession\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   paying the sums due to the City under its ordinances. For that reason, the City could not enforce its right to possession against that lienor. Thus, instead of being able to enforce its right to possession against\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   interest-takers, as it may while in possession, there would exist one class of interest-takers against which the City's right to possession would lose effectiveness if the City were to lose possession. And for that reason, the City's lien becomes unperfected when it loses possession, even if the lien lives on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Thus, possession is an implied, if not express, perfection requirement for the City's interest, and this is not changed by the fact that there are circumstances under which the City's lien would survive a loss of possession, at least as against the owner of the impounded vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hayden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9252331\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/308/428/#p432\">\n    308 B.R. at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]lthough not specifically stated in the statute, possession is necessary for the lien to retain its priority, especially where the statute provides that the vehicle 'may not be released' until the applicable towing and storage costs are paid.\"). The City's continued retention of possession thus \"continues or maintains\" the perfection of its interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   With that being said, the court turns to the purposes behind section 362(b)(3). Then, the court explains why the City's continued maintenance of the perfection of its interest is not an\n   <em>\n    act\n   </em>\n   to continue or maintain the perfection of that interest within the meaning of section 362(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Purposes of Section 362(b)(3)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Section 362(b)(3) has two purposes. First, section 362(b)(3) protects lienors or interest holders from the danger of non-perfection following the dismissal or closure of a bankruptcy case. If, for example, a financing statement lapses during the pendency of the bankruptcy case, a lienor's lien might remain perfected during the bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Paul\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6106428\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/67/342/#p347\">\n    67 B.R. 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 347 (Bankr.

Ill. 1982) (applying this rationale in a case under chapter 11 where the debtor, not a trustee, remained in possession of property of the estate). But unless a new financing/continuation statement is filed or some other act to perfect is taken the\n   <em>\n    very day\n   </em>\n   that the bankruptcy case is dismissed, the lienor runs the risk of having its lien subordinated or eliminated as against a subsequent interest-taker during the time period between dismissal of the bankruptcy case and the time that he files a new financing statement or otherwise perfects the interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   810 ILCS \u00a7\u00a7 5/9-308(a), 5/9-310(a), 5/9-515 ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    In re Wilkinson\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-62223,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201192780\">\n    2012 WL 1192780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (Bankr.

Section 362(b)(3) therefore allows the lienor to protect itself from that post-bankruptcy contingency during the pendency of the bankruptcy case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201192780\">\n    2012 WL 1192780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Second, section 362(b)(3) protects lienors or interest holders who have no\n   <em>\n    perfected\n   </em>\n   lien or interest in property at the time of the bankruptcy petition but who have the ability to take an act to perfect and have that act of perfection relate back to a time prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case, usually the date of the creation of the interest in property.\n   <em>\n    In re Grede Foundries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754161,4183943\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/786/\">\n    651 F.3d 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 791 (7th Cir. 2011) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   625 ILCS \u00a7 5/3-202(b) (allowing a 30-day relation-back period whereby the date of perfection is deemed to have occurred when the interest in property was created).

The first is where a lienor or interest holder has a perfected interest in property as of the date of the bankruptcy petition and wishes to continue his perfection under\n   <em>\n    nonbankruptcy law\n   </em>\n   during the pendency of the bankruptcy case notwithstanding his continued perfection under bankruptcy law during the pendency of the bankruptcy case.

The second is the situation where a lienor or interest holder has an interest in property that is not perfected as of the date of the bankruptcy petition but who may, under nonbankruptcy law, take acts necessary for the perfection of its lien and have that date of perfection relate back to a time prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy petition, usually the date of the creation of the interest in property. The \"act to perfect\" language of the subsection applies in this situation.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The City's interest would fit the first purpose if the City's argument were accepted. It had a perfected interest in property as of the petition date and it wishes to continue or maintain the perfection of that interest by retaining its possession of the property. The Debtor argues, however, that the City's passive retention of the vehicle is not an act to continue or maintain the perfection of its interest in the vehicle because section 362(b)(3) contemplates a definite, positive act to continue or maintain perfection, such as filing a continuation statement under the Uniform Commercial Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The City counters that the language in section 362(b)(3) is broad enough to cover its continued retention of possession and that a ruling to the contrary would be inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   , which held that the passive retention of property constituted an \"act ... to exercise control\" over that property under section 362(a)(3).\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5895949,3648271\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/699/\">\n    566 F.3d at 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

But the term is also defined as \"the process of doing something,\" which covers continuing actions, such as the City's retention of possession following its initial taking of possession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The term, of course, must be placed in its wider context, including the real-world situations to which the language pertains.\n   <em>\n    Matter of Handy Andy Home Improvement Centers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1299641,1306915\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/144/1125/\">\n    144 F.3d 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1128 (7th Cir. 1998). The addition of the words \"maintain or continue the perfection of\" in the subsection does not support either definition, however. Perfection may be maintained or continued solely by taking a single positive, definite, act, such as filing a continuation statement under the U.C.C.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 810 ILCS \u00a7\u00a7 5/9-308(a), 5/9-310(a), 5/9-515. On the other hand, the continuing process of retaining possession also maintains or continues the perfection of an interest in property. Here, for example, the City's maintaining possession continues the perfection of its interest, since it may demand the sums of money defined in its ordinances in exchange for its right of possession, and, importantly, it may do this unequivocally as against\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   interest-takers in the vehicle, prior or future.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The meaning of section 362(b)(3)'s \"act ... to continue or maintain the perfection\n   of ...\" language becomes plain, however, when considered in the context of section 546(b), which is expressly referred to in section 362(b)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Khan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3952368\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/548/549/#p554\">\n    548 F.3d at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 362(b)(3) only excepts an act to continue or maintain the perfection of an interest in property where \"the trustee's rights and powers are subject to such perfection under section 546(b)....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). The trustee's rights and powers are subject to any generally applicable law that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   provides for the maintenance or continuation of perfection of an interest in property to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in such property before the\n   <em>\n    date on which action is taken\n   </em>\n   to effect such maintenance or continuation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20546\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B) (emphasis added). A \"date\" is defined as the \"time at which an event occurs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is the only definition of the term that makes sense in context, because the remainder of the statutory phrase, namely, \"on which action is taken\" plainly contemplates the occurrence of an event, namely, the taking of an action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20546\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B) (\"on which action is taken\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The term \"act\" in section 362(b)(3), therefore, must be referencing a single, positive, definite act, such as the filing of a continuation statement. If this is not true, and the City's continued retention of possession is an \"act\" to continue or maintain the perfection of its interest, there is no sensible way to apply the language of section 546(b)(1)(B) as that language appears on the face of the provision, because the time at which the City's \"action is taken\" is constantly updating, second by second, as long as it retains the possession of the property in which it claims an interest, and there is therefore no actual \"date\" on which action is taken to effect the maintenance or continuation of the perfection of its interest in property. There is, instead of a date, a never-ending passage of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The City's argument is also difficult to square with that part of section 362(b)(3) referencing section 547(e)(2)(A), which reads \"to the extent\n   <em>\n    such act is accomplished within the period\n   </em>\n   provided under section 547(e)(2)(A) of this title.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). That language, as it appears on the face of the provision, plainly contemplates an action being accomplished within a definite time period. According to the City's argument, its \"act\" to continue or maintain the perfection of its interest would by definition never be accomplished for as long as it retained possession. Thus, again, the statutory scheme points to a single, definite, positive act, namely one that occurs at a definite time and that may be sensibly tested as having fallen either within or without the 30-day period provided for in section 547(e)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In sum, therefore, the court concludes that the plain meaning of section 362(b)(3) requires that an act to continue or maintain the perfection of an interest in property be a definite, positive act, such as filing a continuation statement under the Uniform Commercial Code. Even if the court were to apply canons of statutory construction or consult legislative history, however, the result would be the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

That Congress was concerned with financing and continuation statements is also supported by the fact that, prior to the amendment in 1994, the Uniform Commercial Code (not considering the state-specific enacted versions of that code) contained a section expressly tolling the lapse of a financing statement after a bankruptcy petition had been filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.C.C. \u00a7 9-515 cmt. 4.

The action or proceeding was the administrative adjudication of the Debtor's parking, standing, and/or automated red-light traffic violations, and it may be assumed for the sake of argument that the actual adjudication of those violations resulted from the City's exercise of its police and regulatory power. That administrative adjudication\n   (or those adjudications) resulted in the entering of final determinations of liability, which are the administrative equivalent of judgments. Those final determinations of liability were what enabled the City to immobilize and impound the Debtor's car in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The City's continued impoundment of the vehicle constitutes one aspect of its enforcement of those final determinations of liability. The only question is whether those final determinations are \"money judgments\" as that term is used in section 362(b)(4), because the enforcement of money judgments does not fall within the section 362(b)(4) exception, even if that enforcement also constitutes an exercise of the governmental unit's police and regulatory power.\n   <em>\n    United States v.
