Battistelli's (\"Debtor\") checking account before he filed his bankruptcy petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant moves to dismiss, arguing that Debtor does not have an equitable interest in the garnished funds. Because the Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a plausible claim for relief, Defendant's motion is not well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff filed an adversary complaint (the \"Complaint\") against Defendant on April 24, 2018. The Complaint alleges the\n   following facts: Mark and Robin Fleming obtained a judgment against Debtor in the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas in Pennsylvania. The judgment was subsequently assigned to Defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Writ of Execution compelled WesBanco to garnish funds in Debtor's checking account to satisfy the judgment.

Chapters 5 and 7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (Compl. at 3, ECF No. 1). In Count Two, Plaintiff alleges that he is entitled to an order compelling Defendant to turn over the garnished funds pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff filed his\n   <em>\n    Response in Opposition to Defendant's Amended Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 10) on June 22, 2018. Plaintiff argues-and the Court agrees-that he does not \"have to prove the merits of his case to survive Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.

Taking the allegations as true, the Court finds that Plaintiff has stated a plausible claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant argues that the Complaint must be dismissed because it fails to establish all the elements of an avoidable transfer under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ; namely, that Debtor had an interest in the transferred property. Attached to the Motion is a handwritten letter between Defendant and Debtor, which purportedly shows that the funds in the checking account did not belong to Debtor. According to Defendant, Debtor's father contributed 100% of the funds in the checking account, which means that Debtor only had a legal interest in the checking account under Pennsylvania law, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) requires that the debtor have both a legal\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   an equitable interest in the property. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   First, the Court will not consider the handwritten letter because it is not the Complaint, an exhibit attached to the Complaint, a public record, or referred to in the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    Bassett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3579635\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/528/426/#p430\">\n    528 F.3d at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the Complaint refers to the checking\n   account as \"\n   <em>\n    the Debtor's\n   </em>\n   WesBanco checking account ending 3400 ....\" (Compl. at 3, ECF No. 1) (emphasis added). And Debtor's name is listed on the Redacted Checking Account Statement, which the Court can consider because it is attached as an exhibit to the Complaint. Accepting the allegations as true, the garnishment was a transfer of an interest of the Debtor in the funds in the account. Defendant may ultimately be correct-that Debtor had no equitable interest in the funds in the account because he made no contributions-but this is an issue of fact, yet to be determined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    Stanziale v.

D. Del. 2009) (when ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion, the court is not concerned with whether the plaintiff will ultimately prevail). Thus, Defendant's argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Turning to Count Two, the Court also finds the Complaint states a plausible claim for relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). That section provides that an entity in \"possession, custody, or control, during the case, [of property of the estate] shall deliver to the trustee, and account for, such property or the value of such property, unless such property is of inconsequential value or benefit to the estate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). \"Property of the estate\" generally includes \"all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant argues that Debtor only had the intent to hold the checking account for the benefit of his father. Thus, Debtor's interest in the funds \"is that of a trustee of a resulting trust, an interest which is not property of the estate.\" (Def.'s Am. Mot. Dismiss at 7, ECF No 10). Again, Defendant is putting the cart before the horse; Debtor's intent with respect to the account and the amount of contributions Debtor made to the account, if any, are issues of fact that will not be determined at this point in the case. Whether it be at trial or in a motion for summary judgment filed after discovery, Defendant will have an opportunity to raise his arguments. But at this stage of the litigation, the only question is whether Plaintiff's allegations, taken as true, state plausible claims for relief.
