This court finds no published opinion of a court that holds to the contrary.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Moreover, Mr. Augustin would fail the first prong of the test even if the court were to allocate expenses between his wife and him, as he requests. As shown in the above budget, Mr. Augustin has allocated household expenses to himself and his wife in varying degrees. He allocates two-thirds of the rent to himself and one third to his wife. He allocates a number of expenses on a 50/50 basis. But he allocates 100% of a number of expenses to himself. Specifically, he allocates to himself 100% of auto insurance ($137); rental insurance ($51); cable TV and internet ($124); heat electricity and gas ($117); clothing and dry cleaning ($200); cell phones ($340), and credit card payments ($500). His rationale for the allocation is that \"[b]ased on our cultural tradition, Plaintiff is responsible for paying most of the rent and [his wife] contributes toward other expenditures in the household.\" ECF 49 at 6. While the court respects Mr. Augustin's cultural tradition, it is simply arbitrary for him to allocate 100% of these expenses to himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For purposes of summary judgment, the court will consider the debtor's financial condition after allocating household expenses between the debtor and his wife based on their relative incomes, 59% of expenses to Mr. Augustin and 41% of expenses to his wife, as follows:\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-55\"><strong>Plaintiff's Income</strong> <strong>Wife's Income and</strong> <strong>and Expenses</strong> <strong>Expenses</strong> <strong>Total</strong> <strong>Monthly Income</strong> $3,904 $2,699 $6,603 <strong>Monthly Expenses</strong> 59% 41% 100% Rent $1,050 $730 $1,780 Auto Insurance $81 $56 $137 Rental Insurance $30 $21 $51 Cable TV and Internet $73 $51 $124 Heat Electric &amp; Gas $69 $48 $117 Clothing &amp; Dry Cleaning $118 $82 $200 Commuting/Food $354 $246 $600 Daughter's Car Usage $236 $164 $400 Food &amp; Housekeeping Supplies $590 $410 $1,000 Cell phones $201 $139 $340 Personal Care Products $118 $82 $200 Credit Card $295 $205 $500 Car Repairs $118 $82 $200 Wife Tithing in Churches $159 $111 $270 Wife Pledging in Churches $59 $41 $100 <strong>Total Monthly Expenses</strong> $3,551 $2,468 $6,019 <strong>Net Income</strong> $353 $231</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As shown, the allocation of household expenses based on relative incomes establishes that Mr. Augustin earns income sufficient to pay $353 toward his student loans. This amount exceeds the income-contingent repayment amount of $331, as preliminarily approved by the DOE. ECF 48-1 at 6, 21. Thus, the debtor fails the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The court notes that it reaches this conclusion even before making any expense adjustments to the budget as is so often done by courts within the Fourth Circuit.

The court will address two. The debtor lists a monthly cell phone expense of $340, which includes service for at least one adult child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The debtor also lists a $500 monthly credit card payment even though he has received a discharge of his debts and his budget is comprehensive on all other expenses. Mr. Augustin has submitted no justification for the necessity of these expenses. At least a portion of these amounts should be deleted from the debtor's monthly expense budget, thereby increasing his net monthly income. Because the court concluded above that the debtor has $353 of monthly income available to pay toward his student loans, the court need not be more precise than to say the debtor fails to establish, based on current income and expenses, that he cannot maintain a minimal standard of living for himself and his dependents if forced to repay the loans. Mr. Augustin therefore fails to meet the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Second Prong: Additional Circumstances\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The second prong is \"prospective ... and looks for exceptional circumstances beyond the debtor's current situation.\"\n   <em>\n    Frushour\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881122\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/393/#p399\">\n    433 F.3d at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, the record is clear as to Mr. Augustin's minimal efforts to make student loan payments. Up until 2015, Mr. Augustin obtained timely deferrals for his student loans. By his own admission, Mr. Augustin deferred his loans for approximately 26 years. ECF 49 at 1. Mr. Augustin did not provide any evidence that he was unable to make some sort of payment, at least on the interest, during those years. Continual deferments without making a payment or seeking out other payment options does not show good faith.\n   <em>\n    In re Mosko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3643896\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/319/#p324\">\n    515 F.3d at 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"without reasonable efforts to make subsequent payments, requesting deferments and forbearances alone does not establish good faith\").

This court, like the Fourth Circuit did in a similar case, finds that argument unavailing. In\n   <em>\n    Frushour\n   </em>\n   , the debtor there refused to participate in a repayment plan because \"it was not suited for her and she wanted a fresh start.\" The court rejected that argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   It is hard to see why these reasons are not simply shorthand for her lack of interest in repaying the debt. The consolidation plan would allow her both to remain at her preferred job and to maintain her current level of expenditures.
