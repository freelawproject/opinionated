Geltzer, the Chapter 7 Trustee of the Estate of Estella Brizinova and Edward Soshkin,\n   <em>\n    aka\n   </em>\n   Eduard Soshkin (together, the \"Debtors\"), commenced this adversary proceeding by filing a complaint (the \"Complaint\") against defendant Zlata Soshkin, aka Zlata Polukhina. Ms. Soshkin is the Debtors' daughter-in-law, and is married to the Debtors' son Nick Soshkin. The Trustee seeks to recover alleged estate property that, he asserts, the Defendant has improperly refused to turn over, in violation of Bankruptcy Code Section 542. The Trustee also seeks an award of compensatory and punitive damages based on a theory of common law conversion. And the Trustee seeks declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and compensatory and punitive damages pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Sections 362(a) and 362(k), based on Ms. Soshkin's alleged transfer of estate property in violation of the automatic stay. This is the second time that the Trustee has sought to recover the property at issue, although it is the first time that he has sought such a recovery from Ms. Soshkin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Trustee alleges that pursuant to Section 542, Ms. Soshkin is required to turn over post-petition sale proceeds in the amount of at least $42,431.66 (the \"Post-Petition Sale Proceeds\"), from ENSI Consulting, Inc. (\"ENSI\"), an auto supply parts company listed by the Debtors on Schedule B - Personal Property as owned one hundred percent by Debtor Brizinova. The Trustee also alleges that Ms. Soshkin willfully and knowingly converted estate property, namely the estate's one hundred percent interest in ENSI and the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds, damaging the estate in the amount of at least $42,431.66, and seeks an award of punitive damages in an amount to be determined by this Court. And the Trustee alleges that the estate is entitled to recover damages in the amount of at least $42,431.66, under Bankruptcy Code Sections 362(a)(3) and 362(k), for violations of the automatic stay arising from Ms. Soshkin effectuating post-petition sales of ENSI auto parts, depositing the proceeds into her PayPal account, and using certain of the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds for her own, her husband's, and her brother-in-law Igor Soshkin's purchases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Soshkin seeks the dismissal of this action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), made applicable here by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7012(b), on grounds of \"lack of cause of action,\" that this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this proceeding, that the statute of limitations has expired, and pursuant to the common law doctrine of laches. Mot. to Dismiss at 19, ECF No. 5. Ms. Soshkin also invites the Court to revisit its decision in\n   <em>\n    Robert L. Geltzer, Chapter 7 Trustee v.

Reply at 9, ECF No. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The questions posed by this motion are whether in this action, the Trustee adequately pleads claims for turnover of property of the estate, conversion of estate property, and violations of the automatic stay, as well as for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief.

For these reasons, this Court has jurisdiction and the authority to consider and enter judgment on these claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and the Standing Order of Reference dated August 28, 1986, as amended by Order dated December 5, 2012, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Selected Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Debtors are husband and wife who filed this joint bankruptcy petition on April 24, 2012. The Trustee was appointed on that date. On Schedule B, the Debtors indicate that as of the petition date, Debtor Brizinova owned one hundred percent of the stock of ENSI, a New York corporation. According to Schedule B, the value of Debtor Brizinova's interest in the ENSI shares as of the petition date was zero.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 4, 2012, the Court entered an order pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 2004 directing the Debtors to produce certain documents \"as owners of NC Consulting, Inc., as well as any other businesses in which they have an ownership interest,\" for a period of six years before the petition date, and to appear for an examination by the Trustee. Order Auth. Rule 2004 Exam, at 1, Case No. 12-42935, ECF No. 25. The Trustee alleges that the Debtors each testified at their Rule 2004 examinations, and Debtor Edward Soshkin testified at his deposition, that the business of ENSI was the sale of auto parts through the internet and eBay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 13, 2014, the Trustee commenced an adversary proceeding against Nick Soshkin and Igor Soshkin, the Debtors' sons, seeking to recover allegedly fraudulent transfers by the Debtors to their sons of certain interests in real and personal property located in Florida. The parties resolved the Trustee's claims by entering into a stipulation of settlement, which was approved by this Court on December 12, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 23, 2015, the Trustee commenced an adversary proceeding against the Debtors (the \"Brizinova Adversary\"), seeking turnover of property of the estate, declaratory and related relief, including compensatory and punitive damages for their knowing and willful violation of the automatic stay, and compensatory and punitive damages based on the Debtors' knowing and willful conversion of property of the estate. Compl., Adv. Pro. No. 15-01073, ECF No. 1. The Debtors moved to dismiss that complaint, and on July 20, 2016, this Court entered an order denying in part and granting in part the Debtors' motion to dismiss. There, the Court concluded that with respect to the Trustee's claims for turnover of post-petition sale proceeds pursuant to Section 542(a), stay relief pursuant to Section 362(a), and conversion of Debtor Brizinova's ownership interest in ENSI, the Trustee had adequately alleged those claims, and denied\n   the motion to dismiss. But with respect to the Trustee's claim for conversion of the sale proceeds attributable to Debtor Brizinova's ownership interest in ENSI, the Court granted the motion to dismiss, and allowed leave to replead that claim. The Trustee did not replead his conversion claim, and that adversary proceeding is still pending.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On November 9, 2017, the Trustee commenced this adversary proceeding against Ms. Soshkin. On April 2, 2018, the Court heard argument on the Motion to Dismiss, at which the Trustee and Ms. Soshkin, each by counsel, appeared and were heard, and reserved decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     The Allegations of the Complaint\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, as in the Brizinova Adversary, the Trustee alleges that as of the petition date, Debtor Briznova held a one hundred percent ownership interest in ENSI, and that upon the filing of the petition that interest became an asset of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In addition, the Trustee alleges that based on documents produced by eBay and PayPal during discovery, \"and additional information and documents obtained from the internet,\" ENSI continued to sell auto parts post-petition beginning on the petition date of April 24, 2012, and ending no earlier than July 18, 2015. Compl. \u00b6 12, ECF No. 1. The Trustee alleges that an eBay user identification account, \"buydashtrims,\" was \"used by ENSI pre-petition to effectuate sales of auto parts via eBay,\" and that \" 'buydashtrims' ... was and is registered to Zlata Polukhina,\" which is Ms. Soshkin's maiden name, and that the registration indicates her address as 288 Timber Ridge Drive, Staten Island, NY 10306, where she and Nick Soshkin reside. Compl. \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Trustee asserts that post-petition, purchasers from \"buydashtrims\" made their payments to a PayPal account registered in Ms. Soshkin's name and address. He alleges that additional records produced by PayPal show that Ms. Soshkin used some of the funds from that PayPal account for personal purchases. The Trustee linked the PayPal account to bank accounts at JPMorgan Chase and TD Bank in the name of Zlata Polukhina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Trustee alleges that \"unauthorized\" ENSI sales during this time generated the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds of approximately $42,431.66, which are property of the Debtors' estate and must be turned over to him. And the Trustee alleges that notwithstanding his repeated demands, Ms. Soshkin has not turned over the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In his First Claim for Relief, seeking turnover pursuant to Section 542, the Trustee alleges that the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds are estate property in Ms. Soshkin's possession, custody and/or control, and that notwithstanding demand, Ms. Soshkin has failed to turn over the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds of at least $42,431.66, plus interest. The Trustee seeks an order directing Ms. Soshkin to turn over to him the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In his Second Claim for Relief, for conversion of estate property, the Trustee alleges that Ms. Soshkin willfully, knowingly, and wrongly converted property of the estate in the form of the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds. The Trustee seeks an order\n   awarding damages in the amount of at least $42,431.66, plus interest, and punitive damages in an amount to be determined by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In his Third Claim for Relief, for violations of the automatic stay pursuant to Section 362(a) and (k), the Trustee alleges that despite her knowledge of the Debtors' bankruptcy filing, and that the Trustee had become the owner of their interest in ENSI, Ms. Soshkin made post-petition sales of ENSI auto parts on eBay, deposited those proceeds into her PayPal account, and used certain of the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds for her personal expenses. The Trustee seeks a declaratory judgment that Ms. Soshkin violated the automatic stay, an order enforcing the stay and enjoining Ms. Soshkin from making further transfers of the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds, damages of at least $42,431.66, plus interest, and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     This Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On December 14, 2017, Ms. Soshkin filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint, and a memorandum of law in support of the motion (the \"Def's Mem.\"). She makes several arguments in support of her request that the Complaint be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ms. Soshkin seeks to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), on grounds that it fails to state a claim, is untimely and barred by laches, and that this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear it. Ms. Soshkin argues that the Complaint does not satisfy the pleading standards established by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    550 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) and\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v. Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    556 U.S. 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). She asserts that the Complaint is neither \"factually plausible\" nor \"legally viable,\" and that Debtor Brizinova's ownership interest in ENSI, and thus the Trustee's, \"does not create property of the estate in the assets of ENSI.\" Mot. to Dismiss at 6, ECF No. 5. That is, she argues, the Trustee's ownership interest in ENSI is property of the estate, but the assets of ENSI, a non-debtor entity, are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   More specifically, as to the First Claim for Relief, seeking turnover, Ms. Soshkin argues that since there is no estate property here, the claim for turnover of estate property fails. She argues that while the Trustee may sell the Debtors' shares in ENSI, he may not sell the corporate assets of ENSI, and for these reasons, he is not entitled to turnover of the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As to the Second Claim for Relief, for conversion, Ms. Soshkin states that since there was never any estate property to be the subject of the conversion claim, there can be no conversion. And because the estate does not have a possessory right in the assets of ENSI, Ms. Soshkin could not have exercised dominion over that property or interfered with it in derogation of the Trustee's rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Ms. Soshkin also notes that here, the Trustee seeks to apply the law of the case doctrine to different parties, and a different case, and where there has been no controversy determined by the Court, only a ruling on a motion to dismiss. Ms. Soshkin asserts that the law of the case doctrine does not apply beyond the parties to the case in which the ruling was rendered, and that to apply law of the case here would deprive her of due process. She argues that the issues addressed in the Brizinova Adversary differ from the issue raised here - whether the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds are property of the estate. Ms. Soshkin states that this Court \"previously proceeded under the impression that the property [was] property of the estate,\" and suggests that this is incorrect, is dicta, and is not controlling. Reply at 15. And\n   she argues that in all events, this claim is barred by the three-year statute of limitations for conversion, because although the Trustee alleges that the conversion began in 2012, he did not commence this action until 2017, more than three years after he discovered the alleged conversion. She also argues that the doctrine of equitable tolling does not apply because the Trustee has not \"established\" that any fraudulent conduct concealed the cause of action during the period that the Trustee seeks to have tolled. Reply at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   With respect to the Third Claim for Relief, for stay violations, Ms. Soshkin states that there was no stay in place with respect to ENSI, a non-debtor, and so selling ENSI assets did not violate the automatic stay. And she argues that because no acts were taken with respect to property of the estate, the estate has not been damaged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     The Trustee's Opposition\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Trustee opposes the Motion to Dismiss. He responds that the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds at issue here are the same estate assets that are the subject of the Brizinova Adversary. He further responds that the Complaint states claims that are substantially similar to those asserted in the Brizinova Adversary, and that much of that complaint survived a motion to dismiss, as set forth in the Court's memorandum decision (the \"Brizinova Decision\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Trustee also responds that Ms. Soshkin is barred by the law of the case doctrine from arguing that the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds are not property of the estate. He argues that in the Brizinova Adversary, \"Dahiya did not argue in the dismissal motion ... that the [Post-Petition Sale Proceeds] were not property of the bankruptcy estate,\" and that this Court held that the Trustee had adequately alleged that the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds were property of the estate. Opp. Mem. at 2, ECF No. 8. That is, he points out that in the Brizinova Adversary, the defendants did not make that argument even though they were represented by the same counsel, and there, the Court sustained similar claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   With respect to his turnover claim under Bankruptcy Code Section 542, the Trustee responds that the Complaint states a claim for turnover against Ms. Soshkin that is plausible on its face, because the allegations set forth the elements of that claim, and are \"in most instances virtually identical\" to the allegations of the turnover claim that was sustained in the Brizinova Adversary. Opp. Mem. at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Addressing the adequacy of his conversion claim, the Trustee responds that here again, the allegations of the Complaint are \"substantially similar to those alleged\" in the Brizinova Adversary, with respect to the conversion of the one hundred percent interest of ENSI. Opp. Mem. at 10. And under both the law of the case doctrine and applicable case law, the Trustee contends that he adequately pleads this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   With respect to the laches and statute of limitations issues, the Trustee asserts, among other things, that he did not discover, and could not have discovered, Ms. Soshkin's conversion of estate assets until July 25, 2017. For this reason alone, he asserts, Ms. Soshkin should be precluded from asserting a laches defense to the conversion claim. Alternatively, the Trustee responds that even if the Court applies the three-year limitations period to the conversion claim, it should encompass \"at the very least\" Post-Petition Sale Proceeds for the three-year period from November 9, 2014, to November 9, 2017. Opp. Mem. at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   With respect to the allegations of stay violations, the Trustee responds that here as well, the allegations in the Complaint\n   are \"substantially similar to those contained in the Trustee's complaint\" in the Brizinova Adversary, and the Court has determined that the stay violations claim is adequately pleaded there. Opp. Mem. at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, with respect to the allegations that the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the Complaint, the Trustee responds that the Court determined that the substantially similar Brizinova Adversary is a core proceeding, and that for the same reasons, the Court has constitutional authority to enter a final judgment here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Law of the Case\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   At the outset, the Court considers the Trustee's argument that, based on the Brizinova Decision, and the law of the case doctrine, this Court must conclude that here, the Trustee's claims for turnover and conversion of estate property are adequately pleaded, and that the Motion to Dismiss must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As the Supreme Court has explained, the law of the case doctrine \"generally provides that 'when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.' \"\n   <em>\n    Musacchio v.

She does not dispute the Trustee's allegations that the bankruptcy estate owns a one hundred percent interest in the ENSI shares, and notes that the Trustee may sell the shares of ENSI. But she argues that he may not \"reach the assets of a non-debtor corporation.\" Mot. to Dismiss at 13. And she argues, in substance, that the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds are proceeds from the sale of ENSI\n   <em>\n    assets,\n   </em>\n   rather than proceeds of the ENSI\n   <em>\n    shares.\n   </em>\n   And for that reason, she argues, the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds are not property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Trustee responds, among other things, that the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds are in Ms. Soshkin's possession, custody, or control, and supports this assertion with allegations that set forth his efforts to trace the path of the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds from internet transactions undertaken on the \"buydashtrims\" website, to eBay, PayPal, and bank accounts in Ms. Soshkin's name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Trustee also notes that the allegations that comprise his turnover claim here are \"substantially similar, and in most instances virtually identical,\" to the allegations in his turnover claim in the Brizinova Adversary. Opp. Mem. at 10. According to the Trustee, because the Court held in its Brizinova Decision that these allegations adequately set forth each of the required elements of a turnover claim, under the law of the case doctrine, those same allegations should be sufficient here to withstand Ms. Soshkin's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   To allege adequately this element of a turnover claim, the Complaint must state that the property at issue is in the possession, custody, or control of an entity other than the Debtors. Here, the Trustee\n   alleges that the eBay user account \"buydashtrims\" was linked to ENSI and is registered to Ms. Soshkin, and that \"sale proceeds derived from ENSI's ... post-Petition Date sales ... were deposited [to a] PayPal account registered to [Ms. Soshkin].\" Compl. \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   For these reasons, and based on the entire record, the Court concludes that the Trustee adequately alleges the first element of a claim under Bankruptcy Code Section 542 for turnover of the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds, that the property at issue is in the possession, custody, or control of another entity, here, Ms. Soshkin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    Whether the Trustee Adequately Alleges that the Property at Issue Is Property that He May Use, Sell, or Lease\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The second element that the Trustee must allege to state a Section 542(a) claim is that the property at issue is property that the Trustee may use, sell, or lease under Bankruptcy Code Section 363. Such property is defined broadly by Section 541 and includes \"all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case\" as well as \"[p]roceeds, product, offspring, rents, or profits of or from property of the estate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (a)(6). And as this Court has found, this element is adequately pleaded where the plaintiff seeks the turnover of\n   <em>\n    property of the estate\n   </em>\n   that can be put to use in connection with the\n   <em>\n    administration of the estate\n   </em>\n   , including paying the claims of creditors and the costs of administration of the estate.\n   <em>\n    In re Brizinova,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923024\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/554/64/\">\n    554 B.R. at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Ms. Soshkin argues that the Trustee's turnover claim is not viable because in defining the scope of the Debtors' estate, the Trustee \"blurs the boundaries of estate and make[s] it all encompassing,\" resulting in an improper construction of the term \"estate.\" Mot. to Dismiss at 5-6. She argues, in substance, that the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds belong to ENSI, which is not in bankruptcy, not to the Debtors, and that they are simply not property of the estate. For these reasons, she concludes, the Trustee does not adequately allege this element of his turnover claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Trustee responds that the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds are property of the Debtors' estate as provided for in Bankruptcy Code Section 541. He argues that they are \"proceeds and profits from the same entity, ENSI, as to which the Debtors' estate holds the 100% ownership interest,\" and constitute property of the estate as set forth in Bankruptcy Code Section 541(a)(6). Opp. Mem. at 7. And here too, he argues that the Complaint adequately states a turnover claim because it is substantially the same claim that he asserted in the Brizinova Adversary, and it survived a motion to dismiss there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   As noted above, Bankruptcy Code Section 541 provides the framework to determine whether property is \"property of the estate.\" With these concepts in mind, whether the second element of the Trustee's claim is adequately alleged turns on whether proceeds from the sale of ENSI assets - the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds - are \"proceeds\" of property of the estate as contemplated by Section 541(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   It is beyond doubt that where a debtor owns the shares of a corporation, a sale of those shares for cash or other consideration results in \"proceeds.\" In such a transaction, all that has occurred is that property of the estate has changed from one form - shares of stock - to another form - cash or other consideration. But the parties have not cited, and the Court has not found, controlling or persuasive authority to support the Trustee's assertion that in these circumstances, the proceeds of a sale of a non-debtor corporation's\n   <em>\n    assets\n   </em>\n   should be afforded the same treatment as the proceeds of a sale of its\n   <em>\n    shares.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   This is consistent with principles that are long and well established. Courts in New York recognize that there is a difference between ownership of a corporation's shares and ownership of its assets. Long ago, the New York Court of Appeals observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   [T]he corporation in respect of corporate property and rights is entirely distinct from the stockholders who are the ultimate or equitable owners of its assets ... even complete ownership of capital stock does not operate to transfer the title to corporate property and ... ownership of capital stock is by no means identical with or equivalent to ownership of corporate property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    Brock v.

That is, the Trustee alleges that Ms. Soshkin took steps to exercise control over and transfer the property at issue, in the form of the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds, after the Debtors filed their bankruptcy case, when the automatic stay was in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   For these reasons, and based on the entire record, the Court concludes that the Trustee adequately alleges the first element of his Bankruptcy Code Section 362 stay violation claim, that the automatic stay was in effect at the time of the alleged violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <em>\n    Whether the Trustee Adequately Alleges that the Property at Issue Was Property of the Estate\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The second element that the Trustee must allege to state a claim based upon a violation of the automatic stay is that the property at issue was property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Here again, Ms. Soshkin argues, in substance, that the Trustee cannot state a plausible claim for violation of the automatic stay because this element requires the Trustee to allege that the property at issue - the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds - is property of the estate, and here, ENSI is not a debtor, and its assets are not property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   And here again, the Trustee responds, in substance, that he adequately alleges this claim for many of the same reasons that he adequately asserts his Section 542(a) turnover claim, and that the Complaint adequately identifies the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds as property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The Complaint states, among other things, that after the Debtors filed their bankruptcy case, Ms. Soshkin violated the automatic stay by causing the post-petition sale of ENSI auto parts, and converting the sales proceeds, which were estate property. But because ENSI is not a debtor, and because the Trustee does not adequately allege that the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds are \"proceeds of or from property of the estate,\" he does not adequately allege the second element of his stay violation claim, that the Post-Petition Proceeds are property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   For these reasons, and based on the entire record, the Court concludes that the Trustee does not adequately allege the second element of his Bankruptcy Code Section 362 stay violation claim, that the property at issue was property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <em>\n    Whether the Trustee Adequately Alleges that the Conduct in Question Violates the Automatic Stay\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   The third element that the Trustee must allege to state a claim based upon a violation of the automatic stay is that the conduct in question violates the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Ms. Soshkin argues, in substance, that the Trustee cannot state a plausible claim for violation of the automatic stay because ENSI is not a debtor, and that \"there was no stay regarding ENSI.\" Reply at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The Trustee responds, in substance, that he adequately alleges this claim for many\n   of the same reasons that he adequately asserts his Section 542(a) turnover claim, and that the Complaint adequately identifies conduct, including retention and transfers of the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds, that violate the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Here, the Complaint states that Ms. Soshkin violated the automatic stay by causing the post-petition sale of ENSI auto parts, depositing the proceeds derived from those sales into her PayPal account, and using certain of the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds for personal purchases for herself and her family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   But here too, because ENSI is not a debtor, and because the Trustee does not adequately allege that the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds are \"proceeds of or from property of the estate,\" he does not adequately allege the third element of his claim under Bankruptcy Code Section 362 for a stay violation, that the conduct in question violates the automatic stay, because actions with respect to property that is not property of the estate simply do not violate the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   In sum, the Court has carefully considered each of the arguments advanced by Ms. Soshkin with respect to whether the Trustee adequately alleges the Third Claim for Relief, for a declaratory judgment that she violated the automatic stay, an order enforcing the stay and enjoining further transfers of the Post-Petition Proceeds, damages in the amount of at least $42,431.66, plus interest, and punitive damages. The Court concludes that the Trustee adequately alleges the first element of his stay violation claim, that the automatic stay was in effect at the time of the alleged violation. But the Trustee does not adequately allege the second element of this claim, that the property at issue was property of the estate, or the third element of this claim, that the conduct in question violates the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   For these reasons, and based on the entire record, the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Trustee's Third Claim for Relief, for violations of the automatic stay, is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     The Question of Leave To Replead\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15, made applicable here by Bankruptcy Rule 7015, states that permission to amend a complaint should be freely granted \"when justice so requires.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). As the Supreme Court observed more than fifty years ago, \"[i]f the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Foman v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450547\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/178/#p182\">\n    371 U.S. 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450547\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/178/#p182\">\n    83 S.Ct. 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450547\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/178/#p182\">\n    9 L.Ed.2d 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1962).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   And as this Court has noted, \"[w]here a plaintiff has made a single attempt to state a claim, and the prospect of a plausible claim is suggested, but not established, by the allegations, then it may be that a court's discretion should tip in favor of allowing an amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Ridley v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. Co. (In re Ridley),\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180491\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/453/58/#p77\">\n    453 B.R. 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 77 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 2011). At the same time, this Court has also noted that \"where a proposed amended pleading would not survive a motion to dismiss, it is within a trial court's discretion to deny leave to replead.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Ridley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180491\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/453/58/#p77\">\n    453 B.R. at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Ultimately, the question of leave to replead is committed to the sound discretion of the court. As one court has stated, \"it is well-established in the Second Circuit that leave to amend should be granted freely though the district court may exercise its discretion to deny a motion to amend if there is a good reason for it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <em>\n    In re Ashanti Goldfields Sec. Litig.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%20626810\">\n    2004 WL 626810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2004) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   The Court notes that this is the Trustee's first attempt to state these claims against Ms. Soshkin. The Court also recognizes that each of the Trustee's claims falls short for substantially the same reason - that the Trustee does not adequately allege that the Post-Petition Sale Proceeds are property of the Debtors' estate. Based on the entire record, and noting that the question is a close one, the Court is satisfied that the \"the prospect of a plausible claim is suggested,\" but not established, in the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    In re Ridley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180491\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/453/58/#p77\">\n    453 B.R. at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   For these reasons, and based on the entire record, leave to replead is granted with respect to each of the claims in the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, the Motion to Dismiss is granted, and leave to replead is allowed. An order in accordance with this Memorandum Decision shall be entered simultaneously herewith.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    Ms. Soshkin invites the Court to revisit its determination of the Motion to Dismiss in that action. Though that adversary proceeding and this one arise in connection with the same Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, they are different actions, against different parties, and Ms. Soshkin has advanced different arguments here than were made by the Defendants in the Brizinova Adversary. For these reasons, among others, the Court declines Ms. Soshkin's invitation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    Another consideration, in the appropriate circumstances, may be the extent of the administrative costs likely to be associated with recovery of the property at issue. This Court leaves for another day the question of whether this element or claim may be alleged adequately where the record shows that the cost of obtaining the asset approaches or even exceeds the value of the asset.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
