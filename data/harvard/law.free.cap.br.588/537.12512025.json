On August 22, 2016, Juddy Olivares &amp; Eric Panitz (individually, \"Olivares\" and \"Panitz\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") filed a complaint against Dason to determine dischargeability of debt (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6) ) and for attorney's fees. On September 20, 2016, the complaint was amended. On January 11, 2017, the Court dismissed Panitz from the complaint. On March 7, 2017, Olivares filed her second amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 9, 2017, Dason filed an answer and a counter-claim\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   against Olivares. On October 2, 2017, Olivares filed her answer to the counter-claim. On January 19, 2018, Olivares filed the instant motion for summary judgment. On February 13, 2018, Dason filed his opposition to the motion for summary judgment. On February 21, 2018, Olivares filed her reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court notes that Dason has conceded that his counter-claim is moot in light of this Court's order annulling the automatic stay. As a result of this concession, the Court will\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   dismiss the counter-claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court held a hearing on the motion for summary judgment on March 7, 2018. At the hearing, the Court informed the parties that it would take the matter under further consideration and issue a decision in the coming weeks. Specifically, Olivares argues that \"willfulness\" is inherent in the hostile workplace sexual harassment claim she brought in state court, and Dason argues that willfulness is not necessarily inherent in a\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   sexual harassment claim when that claim is, at least partially, premised on constructive termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Olivares began working as a dental assistant in 2010 for Colton Dental Group, the business name of Dason's dental corporation, Sam Daniel Dason, DDS (\"Dason\n   DDS\"). Olivares states that she \"was subjected to offensive sexual comments and inquiries, and other unwelcome, sexually-based, offensive conduct by Defendant.\" Furthermore, Olivares states that she \"was subjected to repeated unwelcome sexual touching at the hands of Defendant,\" which is extensively detailed in the complaint and the motion for summary judgment. On January 17, 2013, Olivares left early and did not return to work. On February 26, 2016, the San Bernardino County Superior Court entered a judgment against Dason and Dason DDS in the amount of $1,724,996.34 (the \"Judgment\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judgment contained the following components:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1) $300,000 for past emotional distress-hostile work environment\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2) $200,000 for past emotional distress-\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   sexual harassment\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   3) $500,000 for future emotional distress\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   4) $100,000 for punitive damages\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   5) $1,875 for future psychiatric care\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   6) $8,125 for future psychological care\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   7) $6,735.22 for past lost income\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   8) $608,261.12 for attorney's fees and costs\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Olivares contends that the judgment is non-dischargeable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6). Olivares bases her motion for summary judgment both on issue preclusion and the record in this case. Dason argues that the record in this case cannot support summary judgment and that the state court judgment does not contain adequate findings to support issue preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Olivares requests that the Court apply issue preclusion and find that the Judgment is non-dischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6).

App'x 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 693 (9th Cir. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Olivares argues that \"[c]ourts analogize\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   sexual harassment to 'extortion,' which is not only an intentional tort but is also a crime.\" [Dkt. No. 68, pg. 14, lines 24-26]. The Court finds the analogy to be apt. The injury sustained in a\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   sexual harassment claim is a tangible, negative effect on employment terms.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Henson v. City of Dundee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"539065\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/682/897/#p909\">\n    682 F.2d 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 909 (11th Cir. 1982). The\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   conditioning of these employment terms is, necessarily, an intentional action of the employer. As noted in section III, \"willfulness\" requires an intentional injury, not merely an intentional act. In the case of\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   sexual harassment, the distinction is illusory-intentionally and negatively conditioning an individual's employment terms with unwanted sexual advances is the equivalent of intentionally causing an injury. Therefore, that part of the Judgment which deals with\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   sexual harassment contains a finding of \"willfulness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   At the hearing on March 7, 2018, Dason argued that constructive termination operates as a unique exception to the above analysis. Dason's argument rests on the premise that when the tangible, negative effect on employment is constructive termination, it is the employee, not the employer, which initiated the change in employment terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court notes that it is not exactly clear what Olivares alleged in state court was the tangible, negative effect on employment terms. At one point, Olivares argues that: \"Sam Dason is liable for quid pro quo sexual harassment because he tied Olivares's raise amount to her assent to traveling with him, and going out to lunch with him.\" [Dkt. No. 70, Ex. 5, pg. 11, lines\n   13-15]. At another point, however, Olivares argued that: \"Olivares contends that she was constructively terminated by Dason's behavior. Thus, here, there was a tangible adverse employment action against Olivares in retaliation for her complaints.\" [Dkt. No. 70, Ex. 5, pg. 11, lines 24-26]. And, finally, at trial Olivares argued that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   And just briefly, the quid pro quo-it occurred specifically on two occasions about a year; part one, the first time when she asked for a raise, and she said that he said it's contingent upon you showing me a good time, then the last time when she went to the hour-and-a-half meeting in January of 2013 during which he said go to Vegas and that didn't occur.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [Dkt. No. 70, Ex. 3, pg. 60, lines 9-14]. Based upon the foregoing, while it is not entirely clear whether constructive termination was the basis for Olivares's\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   claim, at the summary judgment stage the Court must conclude that the state court could have relied on constructive termination as the basis for its award. As a result, the Court will consider Dason's argument that constructive termination does not inherently contain a finding of willfulness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   While neither party explicitly briefed this issue, fortunately for the Court, the California Supreme Court has previously considered the issue. In\n   <em>\n    Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1981830\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/7/1238/#p1249\">\n    7 Cal. 4th 1238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1249-1250,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20223\">\n    32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=876%20P.2d%201022\">\n    876 P.2d 1022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Cal. 1994), the California Supreme Court imposed a heightened requirement for constructive discharge: \"the employer must either deliberately create the intolerable working conditions that trigger the resignation or, at a minimum, must know about them and fail to remedy the situation in order to force the employee to resign.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1250,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20223\">\n    32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=876%20P.2d%201022\">\n    876 P.2d 1022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the employer, or those representing the employer, [must have] either created or knowingly permitted working conditions to remain intolerable\"). The Court concludes that the\n   <em>\n    Anheuser-Busch\n   </em>\n   standard, which stops short of requiring an intent to cause a resignation, but does requires a showing of intent to cause intolerable conditions, is sufficient to satisfy the \"willfulness\" requirement of \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The analysis regarding hostile workplace, however, is different. As noted by Olivares, the \"hostile workplace\" theory of sexual harassment generally requires unwanted sexual advances that have the \"effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance.\"\n   <em>\n    Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203537\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/57/#p65\">\n    477 U.S. 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 65,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203537\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/57/#p65\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203537\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/57/#p65\">\n    91 L.Ed.2d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). In contrast to the\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   liability, where the injury results from an employer's intentional reaction or retaliation, the injury under a hostile workplace theory is dependent upon the employee's perspective. A hostile work environment sexual harassment claim does not require a showing of intent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lyle v. Warner Bros. Television Prods.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3853114\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/38/264/\">\n    38 Cal. 4th 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%202\">\n    42 Cal.Rptr.3d 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20P.3d%20211\">\n    132 P.3d 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Cal. 2006) (outlining elements);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Landucci v.

Cal. 2014) (same). An employer is certainly capable of unintentionally, negligently, or recklessly creating a hostile work environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The issue preclusion section of Olivares's motion for summary judgment focuses on the\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   theory of sexual harassment. The Court agrees with Olivares's that \"willfulness,\" as it is used in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6), is implicit within a judgment for\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   sexual harassment. But it is not necessarily implicit in a judgment under the \"hostile workplace\" theory of sexual harassment-the hostile workplace could be created negligently or unintentionally,\n   based on incorrect assumptions of the employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Dason has not advanced any argument why the application of collateral estoppel to the facts of this specific case would not be \"fair and consistent with sound public policy.\" Dason's opposition concedes Dason was aware that a trial was scheduled and the date when the trial would occur. Yet, after three years of litigation, no appearance was made on behalf of Dason at the trial. Given the extensive litigation that occurred in state court and the fact that the non-appearance of Dason at trial was due to a conscious choice, and part of a deliberate litigation strategy, the Court concludes that application of issue preclusion would continue the preserve the integrity of the judicial system and promote judicial economy. Thus, partial application of issue preclusion would further the policy and interests underlying the doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Baldwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11102497,11108370\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/249/912/\">\n    249 F.3d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 919-920 (9th Cir. 2001) (describing policies underlining collateral estoppel).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Absence of a Genuine Issue of Material Fact\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Olivares alternatively argues that the record in this case is sufficient to warrant summary judgment independent of the state court judgment. The Court disagrees. The record in this case essentially consists of: (1) Olivares's extensive and detailed description of the alleged sexual harassment; and (2) Dason's denial of the allegations. After the partial application of issue preclusion noted above, the only remaining factual issue is whether the \"willfulness\" requirement of \u00a7 523(a)(6) is satisfied as to that part of the Judgment which arises from a hostile workplace theory of sexual harassment. Here, the Court is simply presented with competing declarations from Dason and Olivares which assert, respectively, that Dason did not intend to create a hostile workplace environment and that it can be inferred that Dason had such an intention. Apart from those declarations, the record contains two pages of a deposition of Cesar Espinoza stating that Olivares complained that Dason grabbed her posterior at some point in time. Given the paucity of the existing record and the unambiguously contradictory declarations of Dason and Olivares, the Court concludes that summary judgment is inapplicable on this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For the reasons outlined above, and as supplemented on the record at the hearings of May 30, 2018, and March 7, 2018, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to damages related to past lost income and past emotional distress-\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   sexual harassment, totaling $206,735.22, and otherwise DENIES Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. Defendant's counter-claim is DISMISSED as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Dason incorrectly refers to the counter-claim as a cross claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The Court notes that the state court judgment included an additional $17,694.60 for labor code violations which are not at issue here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The Judgment contains a notation next to this line that states: \"Def. did not show up although ordered.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The Court notes that Dason's position regarding the \"maliciousness\" test is unclear. On page 6 of Dason's opposition [Dkt. No. 79], Dason cites case law that states that sexual harassment clearly satisfied the malicious test, although in the final paragraph of the opposition Dason asserts that the state court made no finding regarding maliciousness. Given the uncertainty regarding of Dason's position, the Court will simply point to a portion of the quotation provided by Dason: \"As a matter of law, violations of Title VII will meet the actual malice standard under\n    <em>\n     Stelluti\n    </em>\n    for purposes of a \u00a7 523(a)(6) determination.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
