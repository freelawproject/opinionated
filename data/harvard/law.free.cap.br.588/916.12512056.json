The Debtor, who is related to Edmund and Jann Cates,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   executed the note on August 1, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In conjunction with the note, the parties also drew up a deed of trust on August 1, 2012 (the \"Deed of Trust\"), which encumbered a condominium at 308 Hillcrest, Unit 404, Durango, Colorado 81301 (the \"Property\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   to secure payment of the note.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor executed the Deed of Trust on October 10, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 24, 2013, the Debtor created a revocable one-party living family trust, named The Diann M.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The issue on appeal is when the transfer of an interest in the Deed of Trust occurred for preferential transfer purposes. Both parties agree the transfer occurred when the lien created by the Deed of Trust was perfected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee argues that under Colorado law, considered in the manner prescribed by \u00a7 547(e)(1)(A), a lien created by the Deed of Trust can only be perfected when: (i) the Debtor could have conveyed the Property to a hypothetical bona fide purchaser; (ii) the lien created by the Deed of Trust could have been perfected against the bona fide purchaser; and (iii) the bona fide purchaser could not acquire an interest superior to the Deed of Trust. The Chapter 7 Trustee asserts that these requirements can only be satisfied when both (a) the Deed of Trust is recorded\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (b) the grantor of the Deed of Trust (here the Debtor) holds record title to the Property encumbered by the Deed of Trust. Under the Chapter 7 Trustee's logic, because the Family Trust (not the Debtor) held legal and record title to the Property on the date the Deed of Trust was recorded, the lien created by the Deed of Trust was not perfected at that time. Instead, the lien created by the Deed of Trust was perfected within the preference period when the Family Trust quitclaimed the Property back to the Debtor, which is the first time the Debtor held record title to the Property after recordation of the Deed of Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The bankruptcy court determined and Edmund and Jann Cates on appeal argue that: (i) under Colorado law the Debtor retained an ownership interest in the Property during the time the Debtor's revocable self-settled Family Trust owned and held record title to the Property; (ii) the Debtor's ownership interest in the Property was subject to the Deed of Trust when it was recorded on March 4, 2013; and (iii) under \u00a7\u00a7 547(e)(2)(B) and (e)(3), because the Debtor had an ownership interest in the Property on the date the Deed of Trust was recorded, the transfer occurred on that date rather than the recording date of the quitclaim deed from the Family Trust to the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because we conclude that the transfer in question occurred upon recordation of the Deed of Trust regardless of whether the Debtor held any rights in the Property on that date, we will affirm the bankruptcy court without addressing what rights the Debtor had in the Property as of the date of recording of the Deed of Trust. We agree the transfer occurred on March 4, 2013, outside the preference period, and therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Application of Section 547(e)(1) and (2)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   With exceptions not applicable here, section 547(b) entitles a Chapter 7 trustee to avoid any \"transfer\" of an interest in the debtor's property: (a) to or for the benefit of a creditor; (b) made on account of an antecedent debt of the debtor; (c) made while the debtor was insolvent; (d) made within ninety days of the petition date (or one year if the creditor qualifies as an insider) (the \"preference period\"); and (e) that allows the creditor to receive more than the creditor would receive if the transfer had not been made and the debtor had filed a Chapter 7 case on the date the transfer in fact was made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The only issue on appeal is whether the \"transfer\" under \u00a7 547(b) occurred within the preference period. \" 'What constitutes a transfer [for purposes of \u00a7 547 ] and when it is complete' is a matter of federal [bankruptcy] law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 547(e)(2) contains three alternative scenarios that determine whether a transfer is made during the preference period. First, a transfer is made \"at the time such transfer takes effect between the transferor and the transferee, if such transfer is perfected at, or within 30 days after such time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, a transfer is made \"at the time such transfer is perfected, if such transfer is perfected after such 30 days.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, a transfer is made \"immediately before the date of the filing of the petition, if such transfer is not perfected at the later of - the commencement of the case; or 30 days after such transfer takes effect between the transferor and the transferee.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The parties agree that the middle scenario applies here; therefore, the time of transfer is governed by \u00a7 547(e)(2)(B) and the transfer occurred when the transfer was perfected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties disagree on when the transfer was perfected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Section 547(e)(1)(A) governs the time of perfection of an interest in real property. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   a transfer of real property other than fixtures, but including the interest of a seller or purchaser under a contract for the sale of real property, is perfected when a bona fide purchaser of such property from the debtor against whom\n   applicable law permits such transfer to be perfected cannot acquire an interest that is superior to the interest of the transferee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under \u00a7\u00a7 547(e)(1)(A) and 547(e)(2)(B), for purposes of avoiding the transfer under \u00a7 547(b), the transfer occurred when the lien created by the Deed of Trust was perfected. As applied to the transfer at issue, the transfer was perfected when a bona fide purchaser of the Property from the Debtor, against whom Colorado law permits such transfer to be perfected, cannot acquire an interest that is superior to the interest of the transferees under the Deed of Trust, Edmund and Jann Cates. Section 547(e)(3) provides further that for purposes of \u00a7 547(e), \"a transfer is not made until the debtor has acquired rights in the property transferred.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    (1) Colorado law on bona fide purchasers of real property applied in the context of section 547(e)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In accordance with \u00a7 547(e)(1)(A), to determine when the transfer was perfected, we turn to Colorado law, which is the applicable law governing when a bona fide purchaser of the Property from the Debtor cannot acquire an interest that is superior to the interest of Edmund and Jann Cates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, when, under Colorado law, could a bona fide purchaser of the Property from the Debtor not obtain an interest superior to the rights of Edmund and Jann Cates in the Deed of Trust?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   First, we note that the properly executed but unrecorded Deed of Trust created a lien against the Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor executed the Deed of Trust at a time the Debtor owned the Property in fee simple. As such, the lien became effective between the Debtor and Edmund and Jann Cates when the Deed of Trust was executed on October 3, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Colorado's race-notice recording statute\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   governs when third parties were put on constructive notice of the lien. Colorado's race-notice recording statute requires \"a secured party properly to record his interest in real property with the clerk and recorder of the county in which the property is located in order to protect his interest against those who subsequently claim interests in the same property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The statute protects a later grantee with rights in real property against a prior executed but unrecorded instrument to which it is not a party, if the later grantee lacks notice of the prior unrecorded instrument and records first.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The purpose of the recording \"statute is to protect 'purchasers of real property against the risk of prior secret conveyances by the seller [and] to permit a purchaser to rely on the condition of title as it appears of record.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[P]roper recording of documents\n   provides constructive notice of interests affecting title.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"As a race-notice state, ... Colorado protects [bona fide purchasers] who acquire an interest in property without notice of a prior unrecorded deed or encumbrance on the same property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Under Colorado law, a purchaser of an interest in real property from the Debtor is charged with searching the chain of title in the grantor and grantee indices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Colorado law requires each county clerk and recorder in the State to keep a grantor index and a grantee index of documents concerning or affecting real estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Documents within the chain of title in a sale or lien transaction are documents that can be found searching these indices with reasonable diligence to find transfers and encumbrances linked to prior and subsequent transfers or encumbrances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, to search the chain of title, the searcher is required to search the records as against each prior owner of the property only from the time such prior owner actually acquired the title interest being searched through the date of recordation of the transaction that transferred the interest from the owner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   A conveyance recorded after the record title reflects that the transferor had already parted with title is not within the chain of title because a searcher has the right to assume that a party who has parted with record title will make no further conveyances of the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The recordation of the quitclaim deed from the Debtor to the Family Trust on February 4, 2013 caused the record title to reflect that the Debtor had parted with title to the Property. The Deed of Trust, recorded after the recordation of the quitclaim deed from the Debtor to the Family Trust, and, therefore, after Debtor had parted with record title, was not within the chain of title. A searcher exercising reasonable diligence ordinarily would have the right to assume that the Debtor, having parted with record title, would make no further conveyances or encumbrances of the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   But that does not end our inquiry. Documents outside the chain of title provide constructive notice of interests affecting real property if \"a possible irregularity appears in the record which indicates the existence of some outside interest by which the title may be affected. In such cases, a purchaser is bound to investigate and is charged with knowledge of the facts to which the investigation would have led.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Here, if a bona fide purchaser from the Debtor after the recordation of the Deed\n   of Trust had searched the grantor-grantee index for the Property under the Debtor's name, the bona fide purchaser would have found the quitclaim deed from the Debtor to the Family Trust. The Chapter 7 Trustee argues that the quitclaim deed does not contain any irregularities indicating the existence of an interest in the Property outside the chain of title and therefore triggered no duty on the part of a purchaser from the Debtor to investigate. But the existence of the quitclaim deed in the chain of title itself is an irregularity viewed from the standpoint of a purchaser from the Debtor. The quitclaim deed shows the Debtor had transferred the Property to the Family Trust, which suggests the Debtor could not still convey good title to the Property. A bona fide purchaser from the Debtor, exercising reasonable diligence, after learning from a search within the chain of title that the Debtor had already parted with record title, would have continued to search the grantor-grantee index under the name of the Debtor for transactions affecting the Property after recordation of the quitclaim deed to the Family Trust. That search would have disclosed the Deed of Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee argues the Deed of Trust is incapable of providing notice to a subsequent purchaser from the Debtor because the Deed of Trust is a \"wild deed,\" or one outside the chain of title. None of the cases the Chapter 7 Trustee cites in support of this argument involve a possible irregularity appearing in the chain of title which would indicate the existence of some outside interest by which the title may be affected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Having constructive notice of the Deed of Trust, no bona fide purchaser from the Debtor could obtain superior title to the lien created by the Deed of Trust after March 4, 2013. Therefore, under \u00a7 547(e)(1)(A), the transfer was perfected on March 4, 2013 and, under \u00a7 547(e)(2)(B), the transfer occurred for preference purposes on that date. Since March 4, 2013 is well outside either preference period specified in \u00a7 547(b)(4), the transfer of an interest in the Property by recordation of the Deed of Trust does not constitute an avoidable preferential transfer under \u00a7 547(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We reach this conclusion regardless of the nature of the Family Trust. We would reach the same result even if the Family Trust had not been a self-settled revocable trust created by the Debtor. Had the Debtor sold the Property to an unrelated third party after March 4, 2013, the third party still would have constructive notice of the Deed of Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    (2) Bona fide purchasers for value from the Debtor's transferee\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee argues that a buyer of the Property from the Family Trust would not discover the Deed of Trust because it is outside the Family Trust's chain of title, having been recorded after the Family Trust took title. The Chapter 7 Trustee strongly urges that if Colorado law is construed so that a bona fide purchaser from the Family Trust would take title subject to an unknown lien outside the chain of title, it would have a chilling effect on real estate lending in\n   Colorado because it would effectively make it impossible to insure title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The time of transfer for preference purposes, however, is predicated on whether \"a bona fide purchaser ...\n   <em>\n    from the debtor\n   </em>\n   ... cannot acquire an interest that is superior to the interest of the transferee.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is immaterial to the analysis under \u00a7 547(e) whether a bona fide purchaser\n   <em>\n    from the Family Trust\n   </em>\n   could acquire an interest that is superior to the interest of Edmund and Jann Cates under the Deed of Trust because \u00a7 547(e)(1)(A) does not require us to consider whether a purchaser from the Debtor's transferee could locate an encumbrance. We also note that under \u00a7 550(b) a transferee from a debtor who takes for value, in good faith and without knowledge of the voidability of a transfer is protected, as are the immediate and mediate good faith transferees of the immediate transferee from the debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Application of Section 547(e)(3)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Subsection (3) of \u00a7 547(e), which provides that for purposes of \u00a7 547(e), \"a transfer is not made until the debtor has acquired rights in the property transferred,\" does not alter our conclusion that the transfer occurred on March 4, 2013 when Edmond and Jann Cates recorded the Deed of Trust, at a time when the Family Trust, not the Debtor, held record title to the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Analyzing whether a transfer was made within the preference period is a three-step process under \u00a7 547(e). First, the Court determines whether there has been an actual transfer of an interest in property effective between the transferor and the transferee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the Court must determine under \u00a7 547(e)(2) whether the transfer is deemed to have been made within the applicable preference period, which depends on when the actual transfer of an interest in the property was perfected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, the Court determines whether \u00a7 547(e)(3) alters the deemed transfer date under \u00a7 547(e)(2). The deemed transfer date is the transfer date for preferential transfer purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As discussed above, the actual transfer date between the Debtor and Edmund and Jann Cates is October 3, 2012 and the deemed transfer date under \u00a7 547(e)(2) and Colorado law is March 4, 2013. We now turn to whether \u00a7 547(e)(3) alters the deemed transfer date under \u00a7 547(e)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Section 547(e)(3) provides that \"a transfer is not made until the debtor acquires rights in the property transferred.\" However, \u00a7 547(e)(3) does not require that the debtor had rights in the\n   property at the time the lien was\n   <em>\n    perfected\n   </em>\n   . Instead, \u00a7 547(e)(3) means that a transfer in the form of a grant of lien against property cannot occur before the debtor acquires an interest in the specific item of encumbered property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, for purposes of determining whether a transfer was made within the applicable preference period, the transfer cannot occur with respect to future property the debtor will acquire before the debtor has actually acquired the property. Section 547(e)(3) was intended by Congress to overrule pre-Bankruptcy Code cases which held that a transfer occurred with respect to liens granted in after-acquired property, such as after-acquired accounts receivable, when the lien was granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   With respect to the lien created by the Deed of Trust, under \u00a7 547(e)(3) the transfer will not be deemed made under \u00a7 547(e)(2) for preference purposes until the Debtor has acquired rights in the specific Property encumbered by the Deed of Trust sufficient for the lien to attach to that specific property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, when the Debtor granted the Deed of Trust, the Property was not after-acquired property, the Debtor already had rights in the Property, and the lien attached to the Property. Thus, \u00a7 547(e)(3) does not change the deemed transfer date under \u00a7 547(e)(2), March 4, 2013, even though the Deed of Trust was later recorded at a time when the Family Trust held record title to the Property. Because the Debtor had rights in the Property on the date she granted the Deed of Trust, the lien created by the Deed of Trust attached to the Property on the date the Debtor executed the Deed of Trust in favor of Edmond and Jann Cates. The recording date, March 4, 2013, is the perfection date, the deemed transfer date under \u00a7 547(e)(2)(B), and the applicable date of transfer for determining whether the transfer is an avoidable preference under \u00a7 547.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The Chapter 7 Trustee's remaining arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee raises several other arguments in his brief, asserting the bankruptcy court erred in its application of the Colorado case\n   <em>\n    Pandy v. Independent Bank\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   and in its consideration of Arizona law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   We need not address either of these arguments. First, for the reasons stated above, pursuant to \u00a7 547(e)(1) and Colorado's race-notice statute, any bona fide purchaser of the Property from the Debtor after March 3, 2013 would have\n   had constructive notice of the Deed of Trust. The fact that the Debtor transferred the Property to a revocable self-settled trust before the Deed of Trust was recorded is irrelevant for preferential transfer purposes because the lien of the Deed of Trust attached at the time the Debtor granted the Deed of Trust. Because \"we may affirm on any basis supported by the record, even if it requires ruling on arguments not reached by the [trial] court or even presented to us on appeal,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   we need not consider the bankruptcy court's conclusion that under\n   <em>\n    Pandy\n   </em>\n   the Debtor retained the \"functional equivalent of ownership\" of the Property titled in the Family Trust's name thereby permitting perfection under Colorado law at a time the Debtor was not the record owner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Furthermore, because the Court need not consider the impact of the quitclaim deed from the Debtor to the Family Trust, Arizona trust law is also irrelevant and does not affect the outcome. Regardless, the bankruptcy court could \"not conclude a different result is reached\" by application of Arizona law and we see no error in this conclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, the Chapter 7 Trustee argues the Tenth Circuit case\n   <em>\n    In re Bryan\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   has persuasive effect in this matter. In\n   <em>\n    Bryan\n   </em>\n   , the Tenth Circuit held the recorded judgment lien did not attach to the debtor's equitable interest in the spendthrift trust's assets. Under Colorado law, judgment liens do not attach to real property until properly recorded and attach to all property owned at the time of or acquired after recording. By contrast, the Deed of Trust is a consensual lien and the Debtor owned the Property in fee simple when she granted the Deed of Trust. The lien created by the Deed of Trust attached to the Property when it was granted, even though the lien was perfected at a later time, when the Deed of Trust was recorded. Thus, we find\n   <em>\n    Bryan\n   </em>\n   inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The record before us supports the conclusion that a bona fide purchaser of the Property from the Debtor after March 4, 2013 would have had constructive notice of the Deed of Trust upon its recording on March 4, 2013. Accordingly, under Colorado law, a bona fide purchaser could not obtain superior title to Edmund and Jann Cates as of March 4, 2013. This means the grant of the Deed of Trust was perfected and the transfer for preference purposes occurred on March 4, 2013, the date the Deed of Trust was recorded. Because the transfer occurred outside of any applicable preference period, the Deed of Trust is not an avoidable preferential transfer. Accordingly, judgment of the bankruptcy court is AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    All future references to \"Code,\" \"Section,\" and \"\u00a7\" are to the Bankruptcy Code, Title 11 of the United States Code, unless otherwise indicated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <em>\n     Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and Memorandum Brief in Support\n    </em>\n    at 5,\n    <em>\n     in\n    </em>\n    Appellant's App. at 26.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The record does not indicate the relation; however, the Debtor does not contest this fact.\n    <em>\n     Answer\n    </em>\n    at 1,\n    <em>\n     in\n    </em>\n    Appellant's App. at 19 (the Debtor admits allegation the Edmund and Jann Cates are relatives in paragraph 9 of the\n    <em>\n     Complaint\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <em>\n     Promissory Note\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     in\n    </em>\n    Appellant's App. at 9.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    <em>\n     Deed of Trust\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     in\n    </em>\n    Appellant's App. at 11.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <em>\n     Revocable One-Party Living Trust\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     in\n    </em>\n    Appellant's App. at 115.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    <em>\n     Quitclaim Deed\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     in\n    </em>\n    Appellant's App. at 17.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <em>\n     Quitclaim Deed\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     in\n    </em>\n    Appellant's App. at 18.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    <em>\n     Schedule A\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     in\n    </em>\n    Appellant's App. at 75.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    <em>\n     Schedule D\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     in\n    </em>\n    Appellant's App. at 82.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    <em>\n     Straight v.
