Between 2009 and 2014, Caesars affiliates Desert Palace, Inc. (\"Desert Palace\") and Boardwalk Regency Corporation d/b/a Caesars Atlantic City (\"Boardwalk\") entered into agreements with entities affiliated with Rowen Seibel (the \"Seibel Agreements\") to design, develop, construct, and operate restaurants in Caesars' casinos in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Specifically, in 2009, Desert Palace contracted with Seibel affiliate MOTI Partners, LLC (\"MOTI\") to design, develop, construct, and operate the Serendipity restaurant at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2012, Desert Palace contracted with Seibel affiliate LLTQ Enterprises, LLC (\"LLTQ\") to design, develop, construct, and operate a restaurant branded under the name of celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. In 2014, Boardwalk contracted with Seibel affiliate FERG, LLC (\"FERG\") to design, develop, construct, and operate a second Ramsay-branded restaurant at Caesars Atlantic City in New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Each of the Seibel Agreements included representations, warranties, and conditions to ensure that Caesars and its affiliates (the \"Caesars Affiliates\") were not entering into business relationships that would jeopardize their good standing with gaming regulators. To ensure that the Caesars Affiliates were not doing business with an \"Unsuitable Person,\" as defined in the agreements, the Seibel Agreements required Mr. Seibel to provide at the outset of the business relationships \"Business Information Forms,\" in which Mr. Seibel represented that he had not been a party to a felony in the last ten years and that there was nothing that would prevent him from being licensed by a gaming authority. The Seibel Agreements also required Mr. Seibel and his entities to update those disclosures if they became inaccurate; they never provided an update.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Unbeknownst to the Caesars Affiliates, when the parties entered into the Seibel Agreements, Mr. Seibel was engaged in criminal conduct that rendered him \"Unsuitable\" as defined by the Seibel Agreements. Specifically, beginning in 2004 Mr. Seibel was using foreign bank accounts to defraud the IRS. In April 2016, Mr. Seibel was charged with and pleaded guilty to one count of a corrupt endeavor to obstruct and impede the due administration of Internal Revenue Laws. In August 2016 Mr. Seibel was sentenced to federal prison, home confinement, and community service. Mr. Seibel never informed the Caesars Affiliates of any of his criminal activities or his conviction, which the Caesars Affiliates discovered from August 2016 press reports. The Caesars Affiliates terminated the Seibel Agreements on September 2, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    The Caesars Bankruptcies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Caesars and numerous affiliates including Desert Palace and Boardwalk each filed chapter 11\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   bankruptcy petitions in the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois in January 2015. The cases were ordered jointly administered, with Caesars designated as the lead case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In June 2015, Caesars moved to reject the LLTQ and FERG agreements related\n   to the operation of the Ramsay-branded restaurants. In January 2016, Caesars moved to reject the MOTI agreement related to the operation of the Serendipity restaurant. LLTQ and FERG filed a request for payment of administrative expenses in November 2015. MOTI and MOTI Partners 16, LLC (the \"MOTI Entities\") filed a request for payment of administrative expenses in November 2016. The motions to reject and requests for payment of administrative expenses-which involve the impact of Mr. Seibel's criminal activity on the parties' rights and liabilities under the Seibel Agreements-remain pending before the Illinois bankruptcy court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Caesars' plan of reorganization was confirmed on January 17, 2017, and the plan's effective date occurred on October 6, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Nevada State Court Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On August 25, 2017, Desert Palace, Boardwalk, Paris Las Vegas Operating Company, LLC, and PHWLV, LLC (\"Caesars Plaintiffs\"), filed a lawsuit against LLTQ, LLTQ Enterprises 16, LLC, FERG, FERG 16, LLC (collectively, \"LLTQ/FERG\"), the MOTI Entities, and others\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the District Court of the State of Nevada, Clark County (\"Nevada Action\"). The complaint seeks three counts of declaratory relief against all defendants: Count I seeks a declaration confirming that under Nevada law the Caesars Plaintiffs properly terminated their agreements with the Seibel-affiliated entities; Count II seeks a declaration that under Nevada law the Caesars Plaintiffs have no current or future obligations to the defendants under the Seibel Agreements because they were fraudulently induced to enter into the Seibel Agreements and because Mr. Seibel and his affiliated entities breached the agreements by failing to disclose material facts; and Count III seeks a declaration that under Nevada law the Seibel Agreements do not prohibit or limit existing or future restaurant ventures between the Caesars Plaintiffs and Gordon Ramsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Proceedings in the Nevada Bankruptcy Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 27, 2017, the MOTI Entities and LLTQ/FERG each filed Notices of Removal of certain claims in the Nevada Action to the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada, creating Adv. Nos. 17-1237 and 17-1238. The Caesars Plaintiffs filed identical motions in each adversary proceeding to remand the removed claims to the Nevada state court. They argued that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because (1) the removed claims did not arise under the Bankruptcy Code; and (2) the claims were not sufficiently related to the bankruptcy proceedings to confer jurisdiction on the bankruptcy court because Caesars had already confirmed a plan of reorganization and the claims did not satisfy the \"close nexus\" test for postconfirmation jurisdiction. In the alternative, the Caesars Plaintiffs argued that even if the court had jurisdiction, it should remand on equitable grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After a hearing, the bankruptcy court took the matters under submission and issued findings of fact and conclusions of law and orders (1) granting the Caesars Plaintiffs' motions to remand; and (2) denying the MOTI Entities' and LLTQ/FERG's motions to transfer venue as moot. In its findings, the bankruptcy court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the removed claims because\n   the removing parties had not established the requisite close nexus between those claims and Caesars' confirmed plan. Alternatively, the bankruptcy court determined that if it had jurisdiction, it would exercise its discretion to remand the claims to the state court on equitable grounds pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201452\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The MOTI Entities and LLTQ/FERG timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Motions to dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As discussed below, Appellees, the Caesars Plaintiffs, have moved to dismiss these appeals; Appellants oppose the motions.

Or. Feb. 13, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Appellants have not shown that the jurisdictional questions presented in the remand motions were \"difficult issues\" that could be addressed only by the Illinois bankruptcy court. Appellants argue that the Illinois court was \"more invested\" in the case and \"better equipped to address\n   the jurisdictional and remand analysis,\" because the matters had been pending in that court for over two years and because that court would ultimately have to reconcile and deal with the consequence of the decision on the remand motions. We find these arguments unconvincing, and conclude that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in considering the remand motions first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Because we agree with Appellees that we are prohibited from reviewing the remand orders, we need not address the waiver argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Two federal statutes dealing with removal and remand are relevant here.

Instead of dismissing or affirming on that basis, the Panel exercised its discretion to review the record it had to see whether any plausible basis existed on which the bankruptcy court might have exercised its discretion to remand.
