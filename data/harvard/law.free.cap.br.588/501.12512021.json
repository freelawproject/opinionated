Pursuant to the Dissolution Agreement, the Debtor was awarded only three vehicles (2007 Saab Turbo, 2011 Nissan Titan, and Maroon Honda Shadow). The Trustee valued the Blue Honda Shadow at $3400.00 but was unable to determine the values of the Mustang or the Pathfinder because the Defendant did not provide the relevant information. The values of the vehicles awarded to the Debtor were $4300.00, $100.28, and $3400.00, respectively. The Trustee asserts that the vehicles were distributed equally and have no impact on whether the Debtor received reasonably equivalent value. The Defendant made no effort to refute this fact, and the Court accepts the Trustee's statement. Regarding the real properties and the Artwork, the Dissolution Agreement provided an inequitable division.

N.D. Ohio 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Trustee set forth facts indicating that the Debtor was insolvent on the dates of the Transfers, and the Defendant's assertions that these facts are disputed was unsupported by competent summary judgment evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) and LBR 7056-1(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In the present case, the record reflects that the Debtor has a history of not paying her debts and of filing for chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case 3:97-bk-0172; Case 3:05-bk-07327; and Case 3:15-bk-03894. Such history supports the fact that the Debtor was unable to pay her obligations as they became due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Furthermore, the record reflects that on the date of the Brentmeade Transfer and the Artwork Transfer (April 16, 2014), the Debtor had liability of at least $124,800.00, which far exceeded the value of the assets the Debtor received pursuant to the Dissolution Agreement (three vehicles with an aggregate value of $7,800.28). Finally, on the date of the Cliffview Property transfer (April 28, 2015), the Debtor had liability of at least $170,449.26, which far exceeded the value of the Debtor's assets of $53,630.00 (the value of the Debtor's assets on the Petition Date). Accordingly, the Court finds that the Debtor was insolvent on the dates of the Transfers or became insolvent as a result of the Transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Actual Fraud\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Trustee's complaint pled two distinct causes of action: (1) constructive fraud pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B) ; and (2) actual fraud pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A).
