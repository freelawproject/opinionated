Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The relevant facts are drawn from the parties' papers, the proofs of claim, the identical \"Addendum\" attached to each proof of claim, and the court's docket.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties agree no facts are in dispute. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 7890, Tr. dated Feb. 21, 2018, at 4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Origin of the Stockton Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The origin of the dispute lies in a casino sale three decades ago. In 1988, Trump Taj Mahal Associates LP and Trump Taj Mahal Realty Corp. (the \"Trump entities\") sold the Showboat Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey (the \"Showboat property\") to Atlantic City Showboat, Inc., a predecessor to debtor Showboat Propco. The sale documents contained a use covenant that said the Showboat property could only be operated as a \"first class hotel casino\" until December 15, 2082 - nearly a century (the \"Trump use covenant\"). The Trump use covenant was duly recorded on November 17, 1988, and March 14, 1989, with the Clerk of Atlantic County, New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sixteen years later, in September 2014, Showboat Propco entered into negotiations\n   to sell the Showboat property to Stockton. At the time, the casino on the Showboat property was shuttered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stockton planned to build and operate a university campus extension there. The negotiations between Showboat Propco and Stockton lasted about four months. During that period, no one from CEOC or Showboat Propco told Stockton about the Trump use covenant, and Stockton did not conduct a title search that would have revealed its existence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Trump use covenant must either have been forgotten or ignored, because during the negotiations Showboat Propco recorded a Declaration of Restrictive Covenant with the county clerk that prohibited gaming or gambling on the Showboat property until November 2024 and gave CEOC enforcement rights (the \"Showboat restrictive covenant\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Showboat restrictive covenant directly contradicted the Trump use covenant. One prohibited gaming or gambling; the other required it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The contradiction went unnoticed. A month later, Stockton and Showboat Propco came to final terms on the sale. Stockton agreed to buy the Showboat property for $18 million. Stockton knew about the Showboat restrictive covenant but had no concerns: the Showboat property would be used as a university campus, not a casino.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   But Stockton claims to have been unaware of the Trump use covenant. According to Stockton, it first learned of the Trump use covenant when it at last obtained a title report a week or so before the closing set for December 12, 2014. Stockton was understandably troubled at the discovery: Stockton had thought the Showboat property encumbered with a covenant prohibiting gaming, not one demanding it. Stockton told CEOC and Showboat Propco there would be no deal unless the Trump use covenant were released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   CEOC and Showboat Propco were receptive to Stockton's concerns. They asked the Trump entities about a release, and the Trump entities were willing to consider one. But there was a hitch. The Trump entities were themselves debtors in bankruptcy cases. Releasing a use covenant in their favor would arguably require bankruptcy court approval - after 21-days notice and hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) ; Fed. R. Bank. P. 2002(a)(2). A release could not be obtained in time for the December 12 closing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To avoid postponing the closing date, the parties agreed to add to the Purchase and Sale Agreement (the \"PSA\") a provision addressing the Trump use covenant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   From and after the Closing, [Showboat Propco] shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at its sole cost and expense, to obtain from [the Trump entities] (with ... bankruptcy court approval) an executed written release of the [Trump use covenant] in recordable form .... If and\n   when [Showboat Propco] obtains such Use Covenant Release, [Showboat Propco] shall deliver the original thereof to [Stockton]. From and after the Closing Date and continuing until such time as [Showboat Propco] delivers to [Stockton] such Use Covenant Release, if at all, [Showboat Propco] shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless [Stockton] from any Liabilities arising out of or in connection with any claim or action by [the Trump entities] (or successors or assigns) to enforce the Use Covenant against the Property and/or any judgment thereon (the \"Use Covenant Indemnification Obligations\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The \"Liabilities\" were defined as \"all damages, claims, demands, liens, costs, judgments, losses, liabilities and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.\" CEOC agreed in the PSA to guarantee Showboat Propco's \"payment and performance\" of its indemnification obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The parties agreed that the PSA would \" inure to the benefit of and be binding on the parties ... and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns.\" Critically, though, the PSA's binding effect was subject to a condition: Stockton could not assign its rights or delegate its duties under the PSA \"without the prior written consent of [Showboat Propco].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The PSA was signed, the sale closed, and Stockton took possession of the Showboat property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   About a month later, on January 15, 2015, CEOC, Showboat Propco, and more than 150 other Caesars affiliates filed voluntary chapter 11 petitions. As of the petition date, Showboat Propco and CEOC had not obtained a release of the Trump use covenant. In fact, they never obtained one. (They claim to have tried in early 2015, even characterizing their efforts as \"robust.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Obj. at 11). But if so, they were unsuccessful.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With the Trump use covenant still in place, the chief executive officer of Trump Entertainment Resorts, Inc. (parent of the Trump entities) warned Stockton in March 2015 that the Trump entities would be \"forced to exercise all available remedies\" in connection with Stockton's breach. (Resp. at 5). This appears to have been so much noise. Nothing in the record suggests the Trump entities ever took any action against Stockton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Still, Stockton maintained that CEOC and Showboat Propco had not only breached the PSA but had also committed fraud in connection with the sale of the Showboat property. Because of the undisclosed and unreleased Trump use covenant, Stockton claimed to have suffered nearly $10 million in costs in connection with a property it could not use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Stockton Proofs of Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Stockton filed two identical proofs of claim in the jointly-administered bankruptcy cases, No. 3597 against CEOC and No. 4223 against Showboat Propco on May 23, 2015. The claims were later amended on November 24, 2015, by proofs of claim Nos. 5575 and 5574, respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amended claims are also identical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the proofs of claim, Stockton alleges that CEOC and Showboat Propco are liable\n   to it in connection with the sale of the Showboat property under a host of tort and breach of contract theories. Specifically, the proofs of claim list the following \"claims and/or causes of action relating to the Showboat Transaction and/or arising under and relating to the [PSA]\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   a. breach of contract\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   b. breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   c. breach of express representations, warranties and covenants;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   d. fraud in the inducement, and/or fraud in the execution;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   e. fraud in the performance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   f. intentional or negligent misrepresentations;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   g. fraudulent intentional or negligent concealment of material facts;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   h. unjust enrichment and unclean hands;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   i. indemnification; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   j. action to quiet title to the [Showboat property] and/or declaratory relief with respect to the unenforceability of the [restrictive covenant].\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Stockton's Transfer of the Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In January 2016, less than a year after filing its proofs of claim, Stockton sold the Showboat property to Renaissance for $23 million. In September 2016, Renaissance was able to obtain from the Trump entities a release of the Trump use covenant. According to the debtors, Renaissance now operates a hotel on the Showboat property. (Obj. at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As part of the sale, Stockton assigned to Renaissance its claims against Showboat Propco and CEOC. The assignment was made under a Partial Assignment of Claims Agreement dated January 15, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 3397; SP Dkt. No. 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On February 23, 2016, Renaissance filed notices of transfer in the CEOC and Showboat Propco bankruptcy cases showing \"Stockton University\" as the transferor and \"Showboat Renaissance LLC\" as the transferee. (Dkt. No. 3307; SP Dkt. No. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The notices of transfer were necessary to comply with Bankruptcy Rule 3001(e)(2), Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(e)(2), which supplies the procedure when a claimant transfers its claim other than for security. Rule 3001(e)(2) requires the clerk of the court to notify the transferor when a purported transferee files \"evidence of a transfer.\" Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(e)(2). The transferor then has 21 days from the mailing of the notice to object.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If the \"alleged transferor\" does not object in that time, \"the transferee shall be substituted for the transferor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Prime Clerk mailed notices of the claim transfers to Stockton on March 14, 2016, in the Showboat Propco case and on March 11, 2016, in the CEOC case. (Dkt. No. 3400; SP Dkt. No. 10). On March 15, Renaissance filed amended notices of transfer in both cases clarifying that the transfers were made \"to the extent provided for\" in the Partial Assignment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 3397;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   SP Dkt. No. 9). Stockton was notified of the amended notice of transfer in the Showboat Propco case on March 23, 2016 (SP Dkt. No. 11), but appears not to have been notified of the amended transfer in the CEOC case. In any event, Stockton did not object to the transfers. Renaissance was therefore \"substituted\" for Stockton. Renaissance is now the record holder of the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Under the confirmed plan, holders of claims are entitled to certain cash distributions on account of their claims, but only if and to the extent the claims are allowed. (Dkt. No. 6318 Ex. 1 at 44-54, 76-78, &amp; 82-83). The debtors have objected to the allowance of the Stockton claims on the ground that fatal problems with the assignment mean Renaissance lacks \"standing\" to assert the claims. The objection is fully briefed and ready for ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The debtors' objection will be sustained, but not on standing grounds. Renaissance does have standing to assert the claims, as that term is properly understood. The claims will instead be disallowed because Renaissance cannot enforce them. The obstacle to enforcement the debtors raise is substantive, not jurisdictional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   First, the \"standing\" point. Standing is a jurisdictional requirement rooted in Article III of the Constitution, which confines a federal court's power to the adjudication of \"cases\" and \"controversies.\" U.S. Const. Art.

The tort claims were thus not legally assignable under New Jersey law, and Renaissance cannot enforce them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Because Renaissance has forfeited any argument in opposition to the debtors' objection to the tort claims, and because the objection was well-taken in any event, the objection as to the tort claims will be sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. The Breach of Contract Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The debtors' objection will also be sustained as to the breach of contract claims. Just as New Jersey law is irrelevant to the tort claims, the PSA is irrelevant to the breach of contract claims - not because Renaissance has forfeited its arguments under the PSA but because it has waived them. The argument Renaissance has chosen to advance instead, one based on Bankruptcy Rule 3002(e), is a non-starter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In its objection, the debtors argued not only that Renaissance was not a party to the PSA but also that Renaissance could obtain no rights under the PSA by assignment. (Obj. at 8 &amp; n.8). That was so, the debtors said, because the PSA forbade an assignment without the consent of Showboat Propco, and consent had not been given or even requested. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Their characterization was accurate. The PSA expressly barred Stockton from assigning its rights or delegating its duties \"without the prior written consent of [Showboat Propco].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Confronted with this argument, Renaissance disclaimed any reliance on the PSA. Renaissance declared in its response: \"The PSA assignment language is not relevant - Renaissance is not arguing that it is an assignee of all rights and obligations under the PSA.
