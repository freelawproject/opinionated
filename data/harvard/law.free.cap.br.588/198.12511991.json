For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the City is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on both counts of the complaint. As such, the City's motion for summary judgment will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction to determine the interests of the parties in this matter. That jurisdiction is conferred by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Internal Operating Procedure 15(a) of the United States\n   District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The matter is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(I).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The material facts in this case are gleaned from the docket, the pleadings, and the summary judgment statements and response, as well as the exhibits attached thereto. Many such facts are derived from the City's statement of facts in support of its motion (\"PSOF\") and have been admitted by Spielman in his response. Other facts come from Spielman's statement of additional facts (\"DSOF\") and are deemed admitted because the City failed to file a statement controverting those facts pursuant to Local Rule 7056-1(C).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Spielman is the sole member and manager of Sound Solutions Windows &amp; Doors, Inc. (\"Sound Solutions\"), which operated from January 2006 through June 2014. (DSOF \u00b6 24.) On November 4, 2009, a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   relator\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the \"District Court\") against Spielman, Sound Solutions, and others, alleging violations of the federal False Claims Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203720\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq., and the City's False Claims Ordinance, Municipal Code of Chicago (\"MCC\") chapter 1-22. (PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 1 &amp; 2.) The claims were based on contracts that Sound Solutions and the City executed in connection with work that Sound Solutions performed at O'Hare and Midway Airports in Chicago. (DSOF \u00b6 27.) The contracts required Sound Solutions to comply with the City's construction programs aimed at benefitting minority- and women-owned businesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) According to the complaint, Spielman conspired to defraud the City through the submission of false claims for work purportedly performed by minority-owned businesses, when the work was, in fact, not performed by such businesses. (PSOF, Ex. A.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The District Court complaint was unsealed on January 7, 2013 and thereafter served on Spielman on February 11, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Spielman subsequently appeared by counsel in the District Court on February 13, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During the litigation, Spielman and Sound Solutions engaged in settlement negotiations with the City until July 2014. (DSOF \u00b6 35.) At no time did Spielman file an answer to the complaint, and, on September 9, 2014, nearly eighteen months after he was served with the complaint, Spielman was declared to be in default. (PSOF \u00b6 5.) The District Court found that there was no good cause for Spielman's failure to file an answer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 17, 2015, the City filed a motion for default judgment against Spielman and Sound Solutions. (DSOF \u00b6 47.) That motion was granted as to Spielman on April 27, 2015; however, the amount of the judgment was not determined at that time. (PSOF \u00b6 6.) The District Court docket reflects that Spielman requested a prove-up hearing in order to contest the amount of the default judgment. (N.D. Ill. Case 09-CV-06948 (\"District Court Case\"), Dkt. No. 108.) A prove-up hearing was thereafter scheduled for May 22, 2015. (PSOF \u00b6 6.) Three days before the hearing, on May 19, 2015, Spielman filed his chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, which stayed the proceedings in the District Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6 &amp; 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 16, 2015, this Court entered an order modifying the stay which permitted the proceedings to resume in the District Court. Once the stay modification order became effective, Spielman filed a motion seeking vacation of the default judgment in the District Court and leave to file an answer. (DSOF \u00b6 54.) After the motion was fully briefed, it was denied on April 18, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; PSOF \u00b6 10.) In its order denying the motion, the District Court noted that Spielman had not presented a meritorious defense to the claims asserted against him. (PSOF, Ex. B.) Spielman later filed a motion to reconsider, which was also denied. (District Court Case, Dkt. Nos. 138 &amp; 145.) On May 3, 2016, the City moved for entry of a final default judgment against Spielman in the amount of $13,554,832. (PSOF \u00b6 11.) Spielman filed a response to the City's motion, and the City filed a reply. (District Court Case, Dkt. Nos. 149 &amp; 152; PSOF \u00b6 12.) The District Court referred the matter to a magistrate judge for a recommendation. (PSOF \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 11, 2017, the magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation, which recommended that the City's motion for default judgment be entered against Spielman and ascertained the amount of damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14 &amp; Ex. C.) The report shows that the magistrate judge considered the arguments of both parties before\n   reaching a final decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. C.) On December 18, 2017, the District Court issued an opinion and order adopting the magistrate judge's recommendation, over Spielman's objection, and entered judgment against Spielman in the amount of $13,554,508.01. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15 &amp; Ex. D.) Spielman did not appeal the final order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The District Court's opinion awarded damages as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1) the City's actual damages resulting from the contracts between the City and Sound Solutions, in the amount of $4,454,836;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   2) the City's treble damages pursuant to the False Claims Act and MCC \u00a7 1-22-020, less the amount representing actual damages, in the amount of $8,909,672; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   3) civil penalties pursuant to MCC \u00a7 1-22-020, in the amount of $190,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. D, pp. 10-11.) In this adversary proceeding, the City seeks a determination that the judgment award is nondischargeable pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) and (a)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

This section excepts from discharge any debt \"for money, property, services, or an extension, renewal, or refinancing of credit, to the extent obtained by ... false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud, other than a statement respecting the debtor's or an insider's financial condition[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A). Three separate grounds for nondischargeability are included under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) : false pretenses, false representation, and actual fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The City argues that the first portion of the judgment award representing its actual damages is nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) because Spielman defrauded the City in connection with the construction contracts. Accordingly, the City contends, it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Count I of the adversary complaint through the application of collateral estoppel. Because the District Court entered a default judgment on the City's claims that Spielman submitted false and fraudulent claims, the City argues that Spielman is estopped from relitigating the elements of fraud in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Bankruptcy courts ordinarily make independent decisions as to whether debts are nondischargeable under the provisions of \u00a7 523(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meyer v.

Thus, the Court must now determine whether Spielman participated to a sufficient degree in the District Court litigation to satisfy the \"actually litigated\" element and warrant the application of collateral estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Spielman was served the District Court complaint in February 2013, and two days later he retained counsel to represent him in that litigation. Although Spielman never filed an answer to the District Court complaint, his counsel continued to appear on his behalf and file motions to extend the time to answer. In April 2015, more than two years after Spielman was served with the complaint and appeared via counsel, the City moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted the motion, which was unopposed, but allowed Spielman a prove-up hearing to determine the amount owed. Before the hearing could be held, Spielman filed his chapter 7 petition. Once the District Court litigation resumed after this Court modified the automatic stay, Spielman participated extensively by filing a motion to vacate the default judgment, which was fully briefed and denied, and then another motion to reconsider the denial. When the City filed its final motion for default judgment, Spielman filed a response, the City a reply, and the motion was referred to a magistrate judge for consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Based on the recommendation of the magistrate judge and the opinion of the District Court, the City's final motion for default judgment was considered on its merits. (PSOF, Exs. C &amp; D.) In her Report and Recommendation, the magistrate judge clearly considered Spielman's arguments\n   before ruling in the City's favor. This is not a situation in which Spielman did not have his day in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that all elements of collateral estoppel have been satisfied. As such, Spielman is estopped from relitigating the fraud claims relating to the False Claims Ordinance which were previously decided by the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court further concludes that the facts presented demonstrate that all of the elements required for nondischargeability pursuant to the fraud prong of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) have been satisfied. Accordingly, the City's motion as to Count I will be granted under that statutory exception to discharge, and judgment will be entered declaring that damages in the amount of $4,454,836, which represent the actual damages suffered by the City, are nondischargeable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Spielman does not argue that these portions of the judgment are dischargeable; in fact, he argues merely that collateral estoppel does not apply to default judgments. As that argument addresses only Count I of the adversary complaint, Spielman has not mounted a defense as to Count II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As an initial matter, in regard to both components of the judgment award that the City argues are nondischargeable pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(7), the City is undoubtedly a \"governmental unit\" as that term is used in the Bankruptcy Code. In particular, the Code defines \"governmental unit\" as including a municipality.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The third component of the judgment award represents $190,000 for civil penalties awarded by the District Court to the City for Spielman's violation of the False Claims Ordinance. MCC \u00a7 1-22-020(7); PSOF, Ex. C, p. 1 (adopted by the District Court, PSOF, Ex. D, p. 1). Such penalties are precisely the type of debt that is nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(7). The penalties are unrelated to the City's \"actual pecuniary loss\"; rather, they are imposed by statute. Thus, there is no doubt that the civil penalties awarded by the District Court in the amount of $190,000 are nondischargeable.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winters v.
