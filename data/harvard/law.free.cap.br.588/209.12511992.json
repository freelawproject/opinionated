BARNES, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter comes before the court on the Creditor's First Amended Complaint for Determination of Dischargeability and Objecting to Debtor's Discharge Pursuant to Section 727 of the Bankruptcy Code [Adv. Dkt. No. 12] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   \") filed by Hector Vallecillos (the \"\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff\n   </em>\n   \") in the above-captioned adversary proceeding (the \"\n   <em>\n    Adversary\n   </em>\n   \"). Despite the title of the Complaint, the Complaint seeks only the denial of the discharge of Adan Salgado (the \"\n   <em>\n    Debtor\n   </em>\n   \") under section 727 of title 11 of the United States Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (the \"\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy Code\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Each of the two counts of the Complaint is promulgated under section 727(a)(4)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code, the provision regarding false oaths or accounts. Count I alleges that the Debtor misrepresented under oath his previous ownership of three pieces of real property. Count II alleges that the Debtor made false statements under oath regarding his possession of tools and employment status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The matter was tried before the court in a two-day trial that began on July 17, 2018 and concluded on July 18, 2018 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Trial\n   </em>\n   \"). Having considered all the evidence and arguments and for the reasons set forth herein, the court finds that the Plaintiff fails to satisfy the statutory requirements of Count II. The Plaintiff has, however, carried his burden with respect to Count I. Accordingly, the Debtor's discharge will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   JURISDICTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The federal district courts have \"original and exclusive jurisdiction\" of all cases under the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

N.D. Ill. 2011) (Goldgar, J.) (recognizing same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Prior to proceeding to the Trial, each of the parties sought summary judgment in the matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Motion for Summary JudgmentAgainst [sic] Defendant-Debtor and in favor of Plaintiff-Creditor Hector Vallecillos [Adv. Dkt. No. 61]; Debtor's Motion for Summary Judgment [Adv. Dkt. No. 62]. On October 10, 2017, the court conducted a hearing on the crossing motions. At that hearing, the court determined that there was no material dispute regarding three of the elements of Count I: (1) the statements being made under oath; (2) the statements being false; and (3) the statements being materially related to the bankruptcy case. The court found the facts and applicable law favored the Plaintiff, thus finding the Plaintiff satisfied these three elements required under section 727(a)(4)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court found there to be a material dispute regarding the Debtor knowingly and fraudulently making the false statements, however. Summary judgment will almost never be available when fraudulent intent is a part of the cause of action. This is because intent is a factual issue that is ordinarily a subjective inquiry, making the Debtor's testimony and credibility germane to this determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Through the motions for summary judgment, the court was also able to resolve the Debtor's affirmative defenses. The court determined that English as a second language is not an affirmative defense, but rather is part of the analysis when determining fraudulent intent. The court also determined that unclean hands is not an applicable defense under section 727 as a violation of section 727 is an offense against the bankruptcy estate, not any individual creditor. As a result, the court entered orders granting in part and denying in part each of the respective motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Partial Summ. J. Orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   EVIDENTIARY RULINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On February 27, 2018, the court entered the Final Pretrial Order in the Adversary. The Final Pretrial Order states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   No motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   is necessary for any objection raised in the Pretrial Statement. Any other motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   will be due with the Pretrial Statement unless the court orders otherwise. Any exhibit to which an objection is not raised in the Pretrial Statement will be received in evidence without the need to establish foundation. Any objection to an exhibit (other than weight/relevance) which is\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   raised in the Pretrial Statement will be waived. Whether evidence is considered by the court and what weight the court gives the evidence depends upon the party relying on such evidence to demonstrate at the trial the relevance and reliability of that evidence in relation to the party's case. If an exhibit is not mentioned by the parties at the trial, it will not be considered to be relevant by the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Final Pretrial Order, at p. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On June 29, 2018, the parties jointly submitted the Pretrial Statement. On that same date, in addition to the stipulations in the Pretrial Statement, the parties separately submitted the Stipulations. Each of the parties' stipulations, those in the Pretrial Statement and those in the Stipulations, bind the parties. To the extent they differ in a way material to the outcome of this matter, that difference will be resolved herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the Pretrial Statement, each of the parties raised numerous objections to the other party's exhibits. Among those objections are numerous objections on the basis of relevance. While it is true that Federal Rule of Evidence 403 affords the court the authority to \"exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence,\" Fed. R. Evid. 403, the purpose of the Final Pretrial Order's statement regarding weight and relevance is for parties not to file such objections.

Unless an exception applies, hearsay as defined in Federal Rule of Evidence 801 is inadmissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 802. The rule against hearsay, however, makes clear that hearsay is defined by its use. Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)(2) (hearsay is a statement that \"a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement\"). Given that hearsay is difficult to determine until a party actually attempts to use a\n   statement in trial, all hearsay objections were preserved for the Trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   One objection of particular importance was to the admissibility of a letter from the Debtor's counsel to the chapter 7 trustee assigned to the Debtor's bankruptcy case (the \"\n   <em>\n    Trustee\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX No. I.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   While, on its face, the letter appears more helpful to the Debtor in establishing an immediate attempt to rectify the alleged misstatements than it was harmful, the Debtor objected to the admission and use of the letter under Federal Rule of Evidence 408. Rule 408 provides that evidence is \"not admissible-on behalf of any party- ... to impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction ... conduct or a statement made during compromise negotiations about the claim ....\" Fed. R. Evid. 408(a)(2). The Debtor argued that the letter to the Trustee was in the nature of a compromise and thus could not be used for any purpose, including impeachment. At the time of the objection, the court was convinced that the letter, though it makes no mention of settlement or compromise, was contextually in the nature of a compromise and sustained the objection. The letter, PX No. I, has not therefore factored into the court's analysis herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, two evidentiary rulings were taken under advisement at the Trial. The court allowed use of the exhibits at the Trial while reserving ruling on the objections to both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The first was labeled Plaintiff's Exhibit No. CC at the Trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Exhibit is a sworn affidavit provided by an employee of Visio Limited, the company that sold all three of the Properties (defined\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ) to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff sought to admit the Exhibit to establish the dates that the Debtor entered into the contracts to purchase the Properties. The Debtor objected to the Exhibit as hearsay. That objection is well taken.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Oto v. Metro. Life Ins.

The Exhibit is also clearly not the best evidence of the closing dates. As the Plaintiff failed to use the Exhibit during the Trial, the court would have assigned it a weight of zero even if it were admitted. As a result, the objection to Plaintiff's Exhibit No. CC is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The second objection was to Plaintiff's Exhibit No. K. This Exhibit is the interrogatory answers of the Debtor. The Debtor objected to the Exhibit's admission, except for the purposes of impeachment. During the Trial, the Plaintiff used the Exhibit to impeach the witness, but did not otherwise use the Exhibit. As result, the court has been given no reason to consider this Exhibit beyond the impeachment use, to which the Debtor did not object. Plaintiff's Exhibit No. K is therefore excluded, except as it was used for impeachment purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Debtor purchased and took title to three pieces of real property in 2010,\n   2011 and 2012, respectively: (1) 1143 N.

Hamlin Avenue, Chicago, Illinois (the \"\n   <em>\n    Hamlin Property\n   </em>\n   \"); and (3) 8223 45th Street, Lyons, Illinois (the \"\n   <em>\n    Lyons Property\n   </em>\n   \") (collectively, the \"\n   <em>\n    Properties\n   </em>\n   \"). In March 2013, the Debtor transferred the Properties into a trust for his mother's, Maria Chavez-Espinoza (\"\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   \"), benefit. Chavez has been the landlord for all of the leases entered into for the Properties since the transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In April 2015, the Plaintiff obtained two default judgments against the Debtor from the Circuit Court of Cook County. The judgments were for breach of contract relating to the Properties and unpaid wages relating to a tire shop the Debtor and the Plaintiff previously operated together. The Debtor subsequently filed for bankruptcy under chapter 7 in October 2015 and listed the Plaintiff as a creditor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On December 18, 2015, the Debtor attended the meeting of creditors required under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"\n   <em>\n    341 Meeting\n   </em>\n   \"). A translator was not present at the 341 Meeting even though English is the Debtor's second language and he is better able to communicate in Spanish. During the 341 Meeting, the Plaintiff's counsel asked the Debtor if he ever owned the Properties. The Debtor replied \"no\" to ever owning each of the Properties. The Debtor subsequently testified at an examination authorized by Bankruptcy Rule 2004 in June 2016 (the \"\n   <em>\n    2004 Examination\n   </em>\n   \"), where he clarified that he had in fact owned the Properties and transferred the Properties, but alleged he purchased the Properties with Chavez's money that Chavez had received from an insurance check, and transferred the Properties to her in replace of returning the money to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   FINDINGS OF FACT\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   From the review and consideration of the procedural history, as well as the evidence presented at the Trial, the court determines the salient facts to be as follows, and so finds that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (1) The Debtor is originally from Mexico.

First he argued that he had denied ownership as he had purchased the Properties with Chavez's money and considered them to be hers. Debtor's Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 7012 of the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, at \u00b6 18 [Adv. Dkt. No. 17-1] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Debtor's Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   \"); Debtor's Motion for Summary Judgment, at \u00b6 24; Pretrial Stmt., at pp. 2-3, \u00b6 1. Then he argued and testified at the Trial that he did not understand the questions because of his lack of proficiency with English. Tr. at pp. 91-93, July 17, 2018; Tr. at pp. 218-19, July 18, 2018. Last, at the Trial, the Debtor seemed to adopt a new explanation that while he owned the Properties, his transfer of the Properties was done to correct his misuse of Chavez's money, so he did not believe it required disclosure. Tr. at p. 214, 234, 239, July 18, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Similarly, the Debtor denied in his Answer having entered into the contracts to purchase the Properties for his personal benefit. Answer, at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19, 21, 47. At the Trial, however, his testimony demonstrated that his own personal funds were included in those used to purchase the Properties, tr. at p. 89, July 17, 2018, that he managed the Properties as his own until they were transferred,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 62-65, and that he took the income from the Properties and used them for his own personal benefit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 102. With respect to the Elston Tire Shop, prior to the Trial, the\n   Debtor admitted to having an ownership interest. Answer, at \u00b6 47; Debtor's Motion to Dismiss, Affid. [Adv. Dkt. No. 17-4]. At the Trial, he was adamant that he had nothing to do with the Elston Tire Shop. Tr. at pp. 75-76, July 17, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In summary, the court finds the testimony of the Debtor to be of limited probative value in his defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As previously noted, the Complaint is organized into two Counts, each under section 727(a)(4)(A). The more straightforward of the Counts is Count II, the allegations regarding the Debtor's employment and tools. The court will therefore consider Count II before looking to Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Count II: Employment and Tools\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Count II alleges that the Debtor, under oath, misrepresented his unemployment status and failed to disclose his ownership of tools he was storing in the garage at the Merrimac Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   These statements were made both as part of the Debtor's schedules filed with the court and later at the 341 Meeting. JX. No. A, at p. 4. As such, these statements are under oath for the purposes of satisfying the\n   <em>\n    Stamat\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <em>\n    Hartford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347331\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/525/895/\">\n    525 B.R. at 907-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A debtor's petition, schedules, statement of financial affairs, statements made at a section 341 meeting, testimony given at a Bankruptcy Rule 2004 examination, and answers to interrogatories all constitute statements under oath for purposes of section 727(a)(4)(A).\"). The first\n   <em>\n    Stamat\n   </em>\n   factor is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The fifth factor is also satisfied, as both the tools and the Debtor's employment status \"bear a relationship to the debtor's business transactions or estate, or concern the discovery of assets ....\"\n   <em>\n    Costello\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9092555\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/299/882/#p889\">\n    299 B.R. at 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The second factor has not, however, been satisfied. Not unsurprisingly, the Debtor at the Trial denied owning the tools or operating a tire shop out of the garage. Tr. at pp. 115-16, July 17, 2018; Tr. at p. 207, July 18, 2018. That testimony is questionable given the Debtor's inconsistent statements concerning his role at the Elston Tire Shop, his self-interest in the matter and his general credibility issues. However, the Debtor's testimony was corroborated by Chavez, who the court found to be forthright and credible. Chavez testified that the Debtor neither stored tools in the garage at the Merrimac Property nor operated a tire shop from said garage. Tr. at pp. 172-73, July 17, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   No other evidence offered by the Plaintiff went to the Plaintiff's burden on this matter. As a result, the court cannot conclude on the record before it that the statements and alleged omissions denying ownership of the tools and claiming unemployment are false. The Plaintiff has failed to establish an essential element of section 727(a)(4)(A) on Count II of the Complaint. As a result, the Debtor need not defend and the court need not discuss the third and fourth elements. Judgment on this Count will be rendered in favor of the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Count I: The Properties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Given the court's earlier narrowing of the issues on this Count, what remains is whether the Debtor made the false statements regarding the Properties knowingly and with fraudulent intent. For the reasons set forth below, the court finds that he did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Beginning with this: There was no equivocation in the statements made by the Debtor at the 341 Meeting. The questions by the Trustee and the Plaintiff's counsel were direct and clear. The Debtor\n   showed no signs of confusion, nor did he ask for clarification, or request the translation assistance he now argues that he needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   With respect to that latter issue, it should be tautological that court proceedings in the United States are conducted in English.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rivera-Rosario\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11418499\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/300/1/#p5\">\n    300 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"It is clear, to the point of perfect transparency, that federal court proceedings must be conducted in English.\"). A meeting under section 341 of the Bankruptcy Code is just such a proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   It would be fundamentally unfair, however, to deny a debtor the ability to participate meaningfully in his or her bankruptcy proceedings because the debtor does not speak English. As a result, in accordance with Exec. Order No. 13166,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Fed.%20Reg.%2050121\">\n    65 Fed. Reg. 50121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Aug. 11, 2000) (Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency), the United States Trustee's Program makes interpreters available for free upon request. As the handbook for chapter 7 trustees states, \"[i]ndividuals with limited English proficiency (LEP) may seek assistance in order to participate in the meeting of creditors. The trustee must advise LEP individuals of free telephone and interpreter services offered by the program for the purposes of the meeting or that they may choose, at their expense, a qualified interpreter to assist them.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20586\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" Handbook for Chapter 7 Trustees, at p. 3-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   There was, therefore, the ability to receive free translation assistance at the 341 Meeting. The Debtor, who was represented by counsel who could and should have advised him of his ability to avail himself of the same by claiming limited English proficiency, made no request for an interpreter. Thus, the Debtor, who professed at the Trial that in all his meetings with his attorneys he had the assistance of his wife as an interpreter, tr. at pp. 91-92, July 17, 2018, and who arranged an interpreter for the Trial itself, chose to attend the 341 Meeting without any such assistance. While the court is sympathetic to the Debtor's claims, his actions do not lend credence to his claim of language issues. The Debtor has lived in the United States for more than twenty years and agreed in the Pretrial Statement that he \"speaks English when necessary, and understands and reads English.\" Pretrial Stmt., at p. 6, \u00b6 17. Further, on at least one occasion at the Trial, the Debtor answered the question posed to him in English before the interpreter could translate. Tr. at p. 163, July 17, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The questions before the Debtor at the 341 Meeting should not have come as a surprise. As noted above, the Debtor commenced his underlying bankruptcy case after having received an adverse judgment in state court litigation with the Plaintiff here. The court finds it difficult to believe that the Debtor did not understand that, when he was questioned at the 341 Meeting by an attorney for the Plaintiff, the very same issues were in play. His denial of an interest in or transfer of the Properties under those circumstances strikes more as an intentional tactic to obstruct the Plaintiff's attempts to see these issues fully aired before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The court therefore concludes that the Debtor's statements at the 341 Meeting regarding his ownership and transfer of the Properties were knowingly false. As to whether these statements were made with fraudulent intent, as just noted, the court finds it likely that the Plaintiff's denials at the 341 Meeting were an intentional obstruction of the Plaintiff. As such, the statements were made with fraudulent intent. Even absent that, as noted above, the court may infer intent from the totality of the circumstances. For the totality of the\n   circumstances discussed herein, the court makes such an inference here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Debtor has also shown a pattern of reckless disregard for the truth starting at the 341 Meeting and continuing through the Trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yonikus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6521656,10517633\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/974/901/\">\n    974 F.2d at 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding the debtor's evasive responses to questions to be of significance in finding a pattern of fraudulent deception);\n   <em>\n    Dilbay v.

The multiple inconsistencies in the Debtor's testimony, lack of credibility at the Trial and false statements at the 341 Meeting demonstrate at the very least a pattern of reckless disregard for the truth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Plaintiff has, therefore, established his\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case under section 727(a)(4)(A). The Debtor, in response, defends with the language issues, his belief regarding the ownership of the Properties and his belief regarding the transfers. None of these theories are convincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As previously noted, the Debtor's language proficiency is in question. Even if he is of limited English proficiency, however, he chose not to avail himself of an interpreter at the 341 Meeting when one was available for free. He made no indication in his answers of any difficulty understanding the questions put to him. Rather than support his defense, his argument bolsters the case for recklessness.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Layng v. Urbonas\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Urbonas\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345225\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/539/533/#p551\">\n    539 B.R. 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 551 (Bankr.

(\" 'it be [speaks] a reckless indifference to truth' for a non-native speaker not to seek advice of counsel if the debtor does not understand the legal meaning of a term necessary to accurately complete schedules.\") (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Skavysh v. Katsman\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Katsman\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4309364,4291573\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/1048/\">\n    771 F.3d 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1050 (7th Cir. 2014) ). It also speaks to willful ignorance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor's argument regarding English proficiency does not defeat the Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Debtor's argument that he believed the Properties were owned by Chavez is also unconvincing. While it appears true that a large portion of the purchase price for the Properties came from Chavez (without her knowledge), the evidence does not support a conclusion that the Properties were therefore hers. Not only did the Debtor use a portion of his own money to purchase the Properties, but he contracted to purchase and titled the Properties in his name. The Debtor admitted to purchasing the Properties without Chavez's knowledge and with the business purpose of rehabbing them and \"flipping them\" for a profit. During the time that he held title to the Properties, the Debtor had tenants who he collected rent from and used the rent proceeds to help fund his tire shop. He also eventually transferred the Properties into\n   a land trust for Chavez's benefit. All of these actions are inconsistent with a belief that the Properties were somehow Chavez's before the transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Finally, the Debtor touched on the defense of not being an educated businessman. Bankruptcy courts have used the debtor's education and business experience in determining fraudulent intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stamat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874464,4029774\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/635/974/\">\n    635 F.3d at 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding debtor's education and business experience factored into a showing of reckless disregard);\n   <em>\n    Chavin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11705288,1540671\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/726/\">\n    150 F.3d at 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (debtor was a mature and experienced businessman making it unbelievable he did not understand to disclose certain assets).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   While the Debtor is not a highly educated man, his experience in business and testimony demonstrate he knew his past ownership of the Properties should have been disclosed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , 290 B.R. at 333, n.2 (finding a debtor with below level of sophistication and understanding clearly understood the transfer of a property should have been disclosed at a creditor's meeting). The Debtor owned real property before he purchased the Properties and was involved in litigation regarding that property. Tr. at p. 207, July 18, 2018. The Debtor purchased the Properties as a business investment, intending to renovate and \"flip them.\" Further, the Debtor was at one point the part owner of a business. Finally, when the Debtor transferred the Properties to Chavez, it was not by way of a simple conveyance, but by a land trust. All of these factors speak to the Debtor's ability to understand his business dealings and some modicum of legalities regarding real property and title held thereto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The court therefore finds the Plaintiff has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the Debtor made the statements denying past ownership and transfer of the Properties knowingly and with fraudulent intent. Accordingly, the Plaintiff has satisfied all of the elements required under section 727(a)(4)(A) for the court to enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff regarding Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Plaintiff has shown that the Debtor acted with fraudulent intent when he denied his previous ownership and transfer of the Properties at the 341 Meeting thus satisfying the burden under Count I. The Plaintiff has not, however, satisfied his burden regarding Count II of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, judgment will be entered in favor of the Plaintiff under section 727(a)(4)(A) on Count I of the Complaint. Judgment will be entered in favor of the Defendant on Count II of the Complaint. A separate judgment will be issued with this Memorandum Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <em>\n    JUDGMENT ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   This matter comes before the court on the Creditor's First Amended Complaint for Determination of Dischargeability and Objecting to Debtor's Discharge Pursuant to Section 727 of the Bankruptcy Code [Adv.
