The Trustee asserts that the money used to pay the tax liabilities of Elbert Hatchett and his law firm belong to Debtor's bankruptcy estate, and the payments constitute fraudulent transfers pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 8, 2017, the IRS filed the present Motion to Dismiss the Trustee's complaint.

Specifically,\n   \u00a7 544(b)(1) permits a trustee to step into the shoes of an actual creditor who has a fraudulent transfer remedy under other \"applicable law\" (i.e. a state fraudulent transfer statute) and exercise that creditor's remedies on behalf of the bankruptcy estate.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) provides, in relevant part, that a \"trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable under applicable law by a creditor holding an unsecured claim...\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The key difference between an action under \u00a7 548 and an action under \u00a7 544(b)(1) is the reach-back period.

Section \u00a7 544(b)(1) looks to the specific state statute's reach-back period, which is generally longer than two years. Thus, a bankruptcy trustee seeking to recover transfers made more than two years prior to the filing of the bankruptcy must file an action under \u00a7 544(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Sovereign Immunity and Section 544(b)(1)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The doctrine of sovereign immunity bars all lawsuits against the United States or its agencies in the absence of its consent as expressly manifested by Congress.\n   <em>\n    Block v.

Since the taxes were not personally owed by the debtor, the Chapter 7 trustee argued that the payments were fraudulent transfers which could be recovered under \u00a7 544(b)(1).

There is no limitation or restriction on the abrogation accomplished by that statute. Regardless of how sovereign immunity may be invoked by Wayne County in a fraudulent transfer\n   action brought under MUFTA [now known as MUVTA] against it outside of a bankruptcy case, Wayne County's right to assert sovereign immunity in a fraudulent transfer action brought under MUFTA by the Trustee under \u00a7 544(b)(1) is abrogated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Lewiston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4114693\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/528/387/\">\n    528 B.R. at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Notwithstanding the well reasoned Ninth Circuit opinion and the case law cited above, the IRS argues strenuously that the IRS's immunity from suit has not been abrogated by \u00a7 106(a). As discussed above, the crux of the IRS's argument is that \u00a7 544(b)(1) requires that an actual creditor exist who could sue the IRS in state court. Because the IRS has never waived its immunity from suit based on a state law cause of action in state court, the IRS argues that no actual creditor exists who could bring a fraudulent transfer action in state court against the IRS. According to the IRS, since outside of bankruptcy the IRS could not be sued, the IRS is immune from suits brought under \u00a7 544(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In support of this argument, the IRS relies on an opinion issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,\n   <em>\n    In re Equipment Acquision Resources, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072820,4227615\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/743/\">\n    742 F.3d. 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2014) (hereinafter \"EARS\"). In that case, the Seventh Circuit concluded that absent the existence of an actual creditor who could prevail in a state court action against the IRS (i.e. a creditor whose shoes the bankruptcy trustee could step into for purposes of bringing a derivative state court action under \u00a7 544(b)(1) ), waiver of immunity under \u00a7 106(a)(1) does not permit a trustee to seek recovery from the IRS. The Seventh Circuit concluded that the IRS's state law immunity is a valid defense to the Trustee's suit for the recovery of a fraudulent transfer under \u00a7 544(b)(1).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pyfer v.

D. Md. 1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   This Court finds the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit, and that of my colleague from this District, to be far more persuasive than the reasoning of the Seventh Circuit. This Court acknowledges that the Bankruptcy Code's abrogation of sovereign immunity as to suits brought pursuant to \u00a7 544(b)(1) allows a trustee to bring a fraudulent transfer action that could not have been brought absent the abrogation of immunity. But that is precisely the point of \u00a7 106(a)(1). One of the primary goals of bankruptcy is to provide a mechanism for the orderly liquidation of assets and the orderly distribution of assets to a debtor's creditors.\n   <em>\n    DBSI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266706,12269843,12266719\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/1004/\">\n    869 F.3d at 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Sherwood Partners, Inc. v.

To effectuate this goal, the Bankruptcy Code permits trustees to recover assets fraudulently transferred by a debtor prior to bankruptcy so that those assets may be distributed to\n   <em>\n    debtor's\n   </em>\n   creditors. If a party received a pre-bankruptcy payment from a debtor in payment of an obligation that was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   an obligation of the debtor, and for which the debtor received no value, that payment\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be recovered for the benefit of\n   <em>\n    debtor's\n   </em>\n   creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   It is undisputed that Debtor does not have a tax liability to the IRS. In its fraudulent transfer action under \u00a7 544(b)(1), the Trustee is simply seeking to recover money that Debtor should have used to pay her own creditors. In abrogating governmental immunity for suits brought under \u00a7 544, Congress's clear intention was that the fraudulently transferred property must be recovered for the benefit of\n   <em>\n    Debtor's\n   </em>\n   creditors, regardless of the status of the recipient of the fraudulent transfer. In light of the clear language of\n   \u00a7 106(a), the Court finds the IRS's argument that it should be protected from defending fraudulent transfer suits on the merits unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Does a Fraudulent Transfer Action under \u00a7 544(b)(1) Create a Substantive Cause of Action that Runs Afoul of\n     <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n      11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (a)(5) ?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The IRS also argues that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) precludes the Trustee from pursuing a fraudulent transfer action against the IRS.

The substantive cause of action that the Trustee is pursuing against the IRS is a fraudulent transfer action, permitted under otherwise existing law, specifically, \u00a7 544(b)(1). The fact that the IRS could assert the\n   <em>\n    defense\n   </em>\n   of sovereign immunity\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   of bankruptcy against an unsecured creditor has no bearing on the availability of that defense against a trustee\n   <em>\n    inside\n   </em>\n   bankruptcy. This Court understands the IRS's argument that, by reading \u00a7 106 (a)(1) to permit the Trustee's suit, it is allowing the Trustee to bring a cause of action against it that an unsecured creditor in state court would not be able to bring, but that does not, in this Court's view, create a substantive cause of action that does not otherwise exist. This Court's ruling simply recognizes that there are defenses available in state court that are not available in federal court under the Bankruptcy Code. In sum, because a fraudulent transfer action does not create a new substantive cause of action, \u00a7 106(a)(5) does not protect the IRS from having to defend a fraudulent transfer action on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, this Court concludes that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) abrogates the IRS's immunity from suits brought by a trustee under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) and Michigan's fraudulent transfer statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Preemption\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The IRS also seeks to dismiss the Trustee's suit on the grounds of federal preemption.

The IRS characterizes the Trustee's action as a state law cause seeking a refund\n   of federal taxes, and then argues that the use of state law to recover taxes is preempted by the IRC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The flaw in the IRS's argument is that it mischaracterizes the nature of the Trustee's suit. If this case was about collecting or refunding federal taxes, the Court would agree that the IRC controls the resolution of all issues. This case, however, has nothing to do with the collection or refund of Debtor's taxes. The parties agree that debtor, Laurestine Hatchett, has no outstanding federal tax issues- she has no outstanding federal tax due, nor is she seeking a refund or adjustment of any prior federal taxes paid. What the Trustee seeks to recover is property of the Debtor (and Debtor's estate) which was given to the IRS to pay\n   <em>\n    someone else's\n   </em>\n   tax obligations. The IRS is not a creditor in this action, it is, allegedly, the recipient of a fraudulent transfer. Section 544(b)(1) is a federal cause of action which permits a trustee to recover fraudulently transferred property\n   <em>\n    in a federal court\n   </em>\n   using a state law statute of limitations. As the Ninth Circuit stated in\n   <em>\n    DBSI\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 544(b)(1)\"does not authorize a trustee to bring an avoidance action in state court, rather the statute permits a trustee to pursue a federal cause of action in bankruptcy court ... Simply put, we fail to see any Supremacy Clause issue here.\"\n   <em>\n    DBSI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266706,12269843,12266719\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/1004/\">\n    869 F.3d at 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Since \u00a7 544(b)(1) is a federal cause of action to recover property fraudulently transferred by a debtor, there is no conflict between state and federal law which might give rise to a preemption argument. The Trustee's cause of action under \u00a7 544(b)(1) is not preempted by the IRC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The IRS also argues that IRC \u00a7 7422 (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207422\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) prohibits the Trustee's recovery of a fraudulent transfer under \u00a7 544(b)(1). Section 7422 of the IRC governs civil actions for refunds. The statute states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   No suit prior to filing claim for refund.--No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Secretary, according to the provisions of law in that regard, and the regulations of the Secretary established in pursuance thereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207422\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   This Court finds that this statute has no applicability to a suit brought by a bankruptcy trustee to recover a fraudulent transfer under \u00a7 544(b)(1). The Trustee is not seeking a tax refund, the Trustee is seeking to recover property that Debtor should have used to pay her own creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DBSI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266706,12269843,12266719\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/1004/\">\n    869 F.3d at 1004, n. 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ( IRC \u00a7 7422\"simply has no bearing on [our] interpretation of sections 544 and 106\" because the trustee is not standing in the shoes of the debtor seeking a refund, the trustee is standing in the shoes of a creditor seeking to recover property fraudulently transferred);\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    VMI Liquidating Trust v.
