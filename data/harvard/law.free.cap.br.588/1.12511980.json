(the \"Debtor\", and together with Comlink, L.L.C., the \"Debtors\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   was a Michigan corporation that owned and operated a 6,500-mile fiber-optic network that connected long-distance calls of national exchange carriers such as AT &amp; T, Verizon, Sprint and Qwest with local exchange carriers. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-22) The Debtor's network provided telecommunications services to commercial and residential customers in Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota. (Compl. \u00b6 21)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Officers' Schemes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Beginning in 2010, the Debtor's officers perpetrated four schemes designed to charge national exchange carriers with illegal tariffs, thereby artificially inflating the Debtor's profits. (Compl. \u00b6 33) First, as part of their \"traffic pumping scheme,\" the\n   officers caused the Debtor to enter revenue sharing agreements with certain local exchange carriers and \"traffic aggregators,\" including LEC-MI. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-37) The revenue sharing agreement between the Debtor and LEC-MI required LEC-MI to route call traffic onto the Debtor's network in violation of certain rules and regulations promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission (the \"FCC\"). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-39, 49-50) In order to facilitate the scheme, LEC-MI created a new transport facility known as \"Trunk Group 331\" that allowed it to deliver 1-800 number traffic onto the Debtor's network. (Compl. \u00b6 39) In return, the Debtor paid approximately $2.4 million to LEC-MI between January 2012 and May 2016. (Compl. \u00b6 40)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As part of the traffic pumping scheme, the Debtor also paid other third parties in exchange for their agreements to route traffic onto LEC-MI's switch in Southfield, Michigan. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43-47) From there, LEC-MI routed traffic to Trunk Group 331 and subsequently delivered it onto the Debtor's network. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44, 46) As a result of the traffic pumping scheme, the Debtor benefited from an extraordinary increase in call traffic between 2010 and 2014. (Compl. \u00b6 48)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The traffic pumping scheme had another adverse consequence. The Debtor was required to file updated tariffs according to FCC rules and regulations. (Compl. \u00b6 50) Despite this requirement, the Debtor's chief operating officer intentionally filed erroneous tariffs with the FCC so as not to reveal the scheme he and the other officers had implemented. (Compl. \u00b6 50) By intentionally filing incorrect tariffs, the Debtor's chief operating officer further contributed to the traffic pumping scheme. (Compl. \u00b6 50)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Second, as part of their \"mileage pumping scheme,\" the officers caused the Debtor to use a circuitous, inefficient route for directing calls. (Compl. \u00b6 54) Rather than route calls from its switch in Southfield, Michigan to AT &amp; T's switch in Bloomfield Township, Michigan, a distance of only seven miles, LEC-MI routed calls to the Debtor's switch in Westphalia, Michigan. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 56-57) By adding seventy-six miles of transport in violation of FCC rules and regulations, the Debtor was able to charge its national exchange carriers for traffic routed over unnecessary distances. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59-60)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Third, as part of the \"inflated tariff rates scheme,\" the officers caused the Debtor to charge approximately 30 times that of the closest local exchange carrier in violation of FCC rules and regulations. (Compl. \u00b6 62) Similarly, the Debtor's officers caused the Debtor to charge a tandem switching rate of nearly 50 times that of the closest local exchange carrier. (Compl. \u00b6 64) In order to charge these rates, the officers caused the Debtor to represent in FCC filings that it was a rural carrier, when in reality it was not. (Compl. \u00b6 65)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, as part of the \"fraudulent rates scheme,\" the officers caused the Debtor to charge fraudulent tariffs for services it never provided. (Compl. \u00b6 68) Instead of billing national exchange carriers by applying LEC-MI's operating company code, the Debtor billed the carriers for 83 miles of transport by using the wrong code in violation of FCC rules and regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68-70)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Debtor's Disputes with Carriers and Officers' Misrepresentations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2012, AT &amp; T and other national exchange carriers began to suspect that the Debtor was engaged in improper conduct and started to withhold payments. (Compl. \u00b6 71) The Debtor's officers, however, concealed the reasons for the withheld payments by advising the Debtor's board of directors that the Debtor was experiencing billing disputes with the carriers. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 72-73) According to the officers, the billing disputes amounted to nothing more than matters of collection. (Compl. \u00b6 73) Although communications detailing the schemes were sent by the national exchange carriers, the officers intentionally concealed the communications from the board. (Compl. \u00b6 74)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In late February 2014 and with the schemes continuing, certain national exchange carriers filed an informal complaint with the FCC against the Debtor and LEC-MI. (Compl. \u00b6 75) At a meeting of the Debtor's board a few weeks later, the officers did not apprise the board of the true facts surrounding the disputes. (Compl. \u00b6 75) Instead, the officers advised the board that the billing disputes presented an opportunity to \"bring negotiations to a head\" and characterized the Debtor as the victim. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75-76)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In April 2014, a second informal complaint was filed by AT &amp; T. (Compl. \u00b6 79) The board was informed of the complaint in late April 2014 but, again, the officers did not disclose the basis for the complaint. (Compl. \u00b6 79) Instead, the officers continued to misrepresent the nature of the disputes to the board. (Compl. \u00b6 76) Thereafter, the officers caused the Debtor to take countermeasures by, among other things, filing a complaint against AT &amp; T with the Michigan Public Service Commission. (Compl. \u00b6 76) In its complaint, the Debtor claimed that it had no control over how LEC-MI routed call traffic. (Compl. \u00b6 76)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Around the same time, the officers informed the board that the Debtor was experiencing cash flow difficulties and that the Debtor would soon need access to additional funds. (Compl. \u00b6 79) The officers again concealed the real reasons for the Debtor's financial difficulties. (Compl. \u00b6 79) Instead of informing the board that the Debtor needed funds as a result of their schemes, the officers told the board that the funds were necessary for \"continued growth.\" (Compl. \u00b6 79)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Debtor's financial condition continued to deteriorate over the next two years. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 80, 93, 96-97) In October 2014, AT &amp; T filed a formal complaint with the FCC alleging that the Debtor was involved in an unlawful tariff scheme. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 81-82) The formal complaint described in detail the traffic pumping, mileage pumping, inflated rates and fraudulent rates schemes. (Compl. \u00b6 82)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In March 2015, the FCC found in favor of AT &amp; T when it concluded that the Debtor had violated various FCC rules and regulations. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 84-88) In addition to awarding AT &amp; T significant damages, the FCC required the Debtor to reduce its tariffs, which ultimately rendered the Debtor insolvent. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 92-94, 96)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Debtors' Bankruptcy Cases\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On January 25, 2016, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11. After the Debtors sold substantially all of their assets, the court confirmed the Debtors' plan of liquidation on March 27, 2017 [Dkt. No. 37].

However, LEC-MI has not done so at this stage of the litigation.

Here, the Trustee has alleged sufficient facts for the court to infer that LEC-MI played a role in the Debtor's financial collapse. In the Complaint, the Trustee alleges that the Debtor's improperly inflated 1-800 call traffic could not have been delivered onto the Debtor's network without LEC-MI's involvement. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-39) The Complaint further alleges that the revenue sharing agreement entered into by LEC-MI and the Debtor provided LEC-MI with an incentive to engage in the unlawful tariff scheme and provided it with benefits in the form of kickbacks. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39-40, 153, 156) Moreover, according to the Complaint, LEC-MI was aware of the illegality of the tariffs charged, as well as the circuitous nature of the call routing. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 56-59, 62-65)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Complaint further states that because of LEC-MI's unlawful concerted action or conspiracy with the officers to deceive the FCC, the Debtor suffered a \"predictable and precipitous financial collapse.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 157-158, 164) The Complaint states that LEC-MI \"directly benefited\" from the officers' breaches of fiduciary duty by \"reaping financial rewards\" to which it was not otherwise entitled by virtue of the revenue sharing agreement. (Compl. \u00b6 169) Finally, the Complaint alleges that the Debtor was forced to repay and cancel outstanding obligations as a result of the kickbacks retained by LEC-MI. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 180-184)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Contrary to LEC-MI's suggestion, the Complaint does not solely allege that the Debtor's financial collapse was due to the Debtor having to reduce its own fraudulent tariffs. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 92-93) As noted above, the Complaint states that the Debtor was damaged by LEC-MI's alleged retention of kickbacks under the revenue sharing agreement, as well as by the monetary damages and injunctive relief awarded to AT &amp; T by the FCC. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 94, 164, 169, 181) LEC-MI is alleged to be complicit in such conduct. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 156, 157, 163, 167-168, 179-181) Although the FCC may not have found that LEC-MI charged unlawful rates in its order, the Complaint alleges that LEC-MI had knowledge of the Debtor's illegal tariffs and continued to participate in the scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 57-59, 62-65) All of these allegations support the element of causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Trustee has alleged sufficient facts to plausibly plead that LEC-MI was a cause of the Debtor's demise. The court will therefore deny LEC-MI's request to dismiss Counts VI, VII, VIII and X for lack of proximate cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Statute of Limitations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   LEC-MI next argues that the Trustee's claims for concert of action, conspiracy, aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment are time barred. LEC-MI notes that the Complaint alleges that the officers' fraudulent scheme began in 2010. LEC-MI further observes that in Michigan the statute of limitations for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty is three years and the statute of limitations for the remaining claims is six years. Because the schemes not only began in 2010, but also began causing injury at\n   that time, LEC-MI argues the claims should be dismissed as untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In response, the Trustee notes that section 108(a)(2) tolls the statutes of limitations for his state law claims by two years so long as the statutes did not run prior to the petition date. Thus, the Trustee posits that all of his claims subject to a six-year statute of limitations are timely if they accrued on or after January 25, 2010. The Trustee also argues that his unjust enrichment claim is timely because the kickbacks allegedly paid to LEC-MI began on January 24, 2012, rendering his claim well within the six-year statute of limitations. Finally, the Trustee notes that even though the statute of limitations for aiding and abetting is only three years, he nonetheless has complied due to an allegedly applicable discovery rule under Michigan law and tolling under section 108.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   LEC-MI does not mention section 108 in its analyses of the timeliness of the Trustee's claims. Section 108, however, is paramount to the statute of limitations arguments raised by LEC-MI. Section 108 provides in pertinent part that if \"applicable nonbankruptcy law... fixes a period within which the debtor may commence an action, and such period has not expired before the date of the filing of the petition,\" the debtor may commence such an action within two years after the order for relief.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20108\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). The Debtor's voluntary petition was filed on January 25, 2016. Section 108(a)(2) renders any claim as to which the statute of limitations had not expired on the petition date timely if it was filed on or before January 25, 2018. The Complaint in this adversary proceeding was filed well before that date. For the reasons discussed below, the court concludes that none of the Trustee's state law claims are time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    1.

The claim for unjust enrichment accrued when the Debtor began paying kickbacks to LEC-MI pursuant to the revenue sharing agreement on January 24, 2012.

First, as noted by the Trustee, section 108(a) renders claims accruing on or after January 25, 2010 timely. The allegation highlighted by LEC-MI does not contain a date, and it is certainly possible that LEC-MI's retention of payments pursuant to the scheme began after that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Second, LEC-MI argues that an unjust enrichment claim accrues upon the retention of the first payment and any later benefits accrued are not distinct injuries.

According to LEC-MI, the Trustee must include specific details in the Complaint regarding each transfer subject to avoidance under sections 544(b) and 548, regardless of whether the particular transfer is actual or constructive.
