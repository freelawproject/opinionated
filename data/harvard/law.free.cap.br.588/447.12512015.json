(\"TWST\") against a supplier of electrical equipment, Myers Controlled Power, LLC (\"Myers\"), for the avoidance and recovery of an alleged preference under Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The Court heard the evidence on February 1 and March 29, 2018. For the reasons stated below, the Court finds in favor of the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court, having heard the evidence, makes the following findings of fact:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   1. TWST was one of a group of affiliated companies doing business under the name \"Truland.\" Truland and its affiliates\n   comprised one of the largest electrical contractors in the United States, with very substantial contracts, including the contract at issue in this case, the Rehabilitation of the Orange/Blue Line - Stadium Armory to National Airport - for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    A. The Parties' Contractual Arrangements.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   2. Clark Construction Group, LLC (\"Clark\") was the General Contractor on the Orange and Blue Line renovation contract for WMATA. The project was a $273 million renovation, involving electrical upgrades, architectural upgrades, the installation of 26 kiosks and mechanical upgrades and repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   3. In January 2011, TWST, as Subcontractor, entered into a Subcontract Agreement with Clark Construction Group, LLC (\"Clark\") as the prime contractor on the Orange/Blue Line job. The total sum to be paid under the Subcontract was $45,000,000.00. Def. Ex. A, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   4. In connection with this contract, Truland caused its bonding companies, Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland and Zurich American Insurance Company (together, \"Zurich\"), to issue Performance Bonds and a Payment Bond on the job. Def. Ex. L, at 00014-00019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   5. Partial payments were permitted under the Subcontract for 95% of the approved work and for on-site stored materials. Def. Ex. A, at 2, \u00b6 4(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   6. The Subcontract contained what is generally known as a \"flow down\" provision, meaning that TWST as a Subcontractor was contractually obligated to pay its subcontractors and suppliers, and to avoid any bond claims against the surety that guaranteed TWST's performance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    \u00b6 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   7. At first, Truland intended to use Powell Electrical as a second-tier subcontractor to supply the needed electrical equipment and switches. Powell's circuit breakers did not test properly, however, and were rejected by WMATA. Truland ended up replacing Powell with Myers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   8. Myers did not subcontract directly with TWST. Rather, Myers entered into a Supplier Subcontract with a Disadvantaged Business Entity (\"DBE\"), Nationwide Electrical Services, Inc. (\"NES\"), for services and equipment. Def. Ex. B. The total amount to be paid under the Myers-NES Supplier Subcontract was $17,041,113.00.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    at 1, \u00b6 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Myers-NES Supplier Subcontract contained a flow down provision similar to the one in the Clark-TWST Subcontract.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   9. The initial proposal from Myers was in the amount of $17,211,342.32. Def. Ex. D. This amount included $170,229.32 for payment and performance bonds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the end, the requirement for Myers to supply payment and performance bonds was dropped, so the price was reduced accordingly. Def. Ex. J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   10. With the exception of one invoice for stored material, Myers sent its invoices to NES. Def. Ex. K.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   11. NES sent invoices to TWST. Def. Ex. G. Most of the invoices state: \"Billing for Myers Controlled Power.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The parties - TWST and Myers - considered these invoices to be a fee for \"managing the Subcontract with Myers.\" Myers took its\n   directions exclusively from TWST, not from NES.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   12. When it came time to pay for the equipment, Clark would issue joint checks to TWST and NES. Def. Exs. E, at 1061, 0164; F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   13. Myers and the Trustee dispute whether there was ever a written subcontract between NES and TWST. The Trustee was unable to locate or produce one. The Court concludes that there was not a signed, written subcontract between NES and TWST.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Joint Check Agreement.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   14. In April 2014, the Truland companies engaged Charles Goldstein, a Managing Director with Protiviti, to act as their Chief Restructuring Officer. Mr. Goldstein testified that by the spring of 2014, Truland and its affiliates were \"out of trust\" with their suppliers, meaning that they were receiving payments from general contractors but were not paying the suppliers and subcontractors in violation of the flow-down provisions of their subcontracts, by approximately $23.7 million. Def. Ex. T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   15. On April 29, 2014, Charles Breeden of Clark stated: \"It was brought to my attention this afternoon that MCP (Truland's DC Gear Supplier) has notified Truland that they will not proceed with additional work until old invoices have been paid.\" Def. Ex. O (Charles Breeden e-mail, Apr. 27, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   16. On May 1, 2014, Charles (Chuck) Tomasco of Truland noted that \"MCP [Myers Controlled Power] has currently stopped delivering equipment which will delay the entire project and jeopardize the $28M K-Line change order we're awaiting from WMATA/Clark ... [W]e have also requested that Clark issue them payment via joint check but have not confirmed yet.\" Pl. Ex. 16 (Chuck Tomasco e-mail, May 1, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   17. Myers refused to release the equipment to TWST. Pl. Ex. 17 (Sanchez e-mail, May 7, 2014) (\"[W]e have had to stop testing and shipments of the ABB transformers. Presently six (6) transformers are ready for shipment.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   18. In light of Truland's payment default, Myers requested \"one party\" checks from Clark, that is, checks payable only to Myers, as well as a payment guarantee directly from Clark. Pl. Ex. 18, at CCG 0014-0015 (Sanchez e-mail to Charles Breeden, May 7, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   19. On May 9, 2014, Clark formally notified Truland of its default owing to Truland's failure to pay its suppliers and subcontractors. Def. Ex. O, at CCG 0005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   20. Clark, as the prime contractor, insisted on a joint check arrangement. Pl. Ex. 20, at 0059 (Charles Breeden e-mail, May 13, 2014) (\"Clark will issue Joint Checks to MCP/Truland that will be endorsed by Truland and then sent to MCP by Clark.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   21. A draft of a Joint Check Agreement (\"JCA\") (along with Joint Check Agreements on other Truland projects) was circulated on June 11, 2014. Def. Ex. M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   22. Clark, Myers and TWST entered into a Joint Check Agreement (\"JCA\"). Def. Ex. P. Although it is dated June 9, 2014, the JCA was still unexecuted as of June 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Ex. 39; Def. Ex. N, at 0049. Rick Sanchez of Myers testified that Myers signed the JCA about a week after June 9\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , thereby putting the effective date of the JCA at about June 16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    C. Myers Explores Making a Payment Claim on the Bond.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   23. As the negotiations for the Joint Check Agreement proceeded in May 2014,\n   Myers began exploring the process of making a claim against Zurich, Truland's bonding company on the Orange/Blue Line job. Def. Ex. L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   24. Although Mr. Sanchez testified that Myers \"commenced\" making claims under Truland's performance and payment bonds with Zurich, no bond claim was entered into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   25. The Court, therefore, concludes that Myers never made a formal claim on the bond. Rather, Zurich signed off on the Joint Check Agreement. Def. Ex. P.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    D. The Payment and the Release of the Equipment.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   26. On May 27, 2014, Myers, satisfied with Clark's representations that it would enter into a JCA, released equipment with a cost of $1,819,206.31. Def. Ex. R, at 001123. This invoice included $181,920.63 in \"Overhead/Profit,\" for a total of $2,001,126.94.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   27.

On July 11, 2014, Clark delivered a check (No. 10101212) to TWST in the amount of $2,107,039.86. Def. Ex. Q. The check was payable jointly to Myers and TWST.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   29.

The case is being jointly administered (but not substantively consolidated) with the Chapter 7 cases of The Truland Group, Inc., and its subsidiaries, in Case No. 14-12766-BFK.

This is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(F) (proceedings to determine, avoid or recover preferences) and (H) (proceedings to determine, avoid or recover fraudulent transfers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Trustee testified, without contradiction, that the payment to Myers will enable it to receive substantially more than it will receive as an unsecured creditor in the Chapter 7 liquidation of the Debtor. The issues to be resolved are: (a) whether Myers was a creditor of the Debtor at the time of the transfer; (b) whether the joint check was property of the Debtor's estate; and (c) whether Myers has met its burden of proof in establishing that there was a contemporaneous exchange for new value under Section 547(c)(1) of the Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    A. Was Myers a Creditor?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Section 547(b) allows the Trustee to avoid transfers \"to or for the benefit of a creditor,\" \"for or on account of an antecedent debt.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)-(2). Myers argues that it had no contract directly with the Debtor, and therefore cannot be considered to be a creditor. The term \"creditor\" is defined as one with a claim against the Debtor.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10)(A).

The cases indicate that a quantum meruit claim is in the nature of a contract and, therefore, the Court will look to the place of contracting to determine whether or not Myers would have had a claim against TWST at the time of the payment.\n   <em>\n    Precision Pipeline, LLC v.

All of the parties' communications were sent or received by e-mail, from their respective offices, so the place of contracting is not clear. Employing the place of performance analysis, the Court concludes that either D.C. or Virginia law governs whether or not Myers had a quantum meruit claim because the equipment was delivered for use in D.C. and in Virginia.

TWST clearly knew of the delivery of the equipment at all times. It was intimately involved in the negotiations that resulted in the JCA.
