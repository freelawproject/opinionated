The Debtors seek disbursement of sale proceeds based on their homestead exemption. Michael Klein, the Chapter 7 Trustee (\"Trustee\"), objects to disbursement on the grounds that the funds are subject to a one-year reinvestment condition under Washington's homestead statute. The Trustee asserts that he should be permitted to retain possession of the funds up until the Debtors contract for a new residence, and that the Trustee should only be required to disburse the funds upon closing. I continued hearing on the Motion to Disburse to allow the parties to brief whether the one-year reinvestment condition applies to homestead proceeds from a bankruptcy sale. Having considered the pleadings and arguments of counsel, and otherwise being fully advised, I grant the Motion to Disburse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Debtors filed a Chapter 13 petition on October 18, 2016. On their Schedule C, the Debtors claimed a Washington state law exemption of $125,000 in real property located at 19610 207\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Ave SE, Snohomish, Washington (\"Homestead Property\"). After confirmation of their Chapter 13 plan, the Debtors moved out of the Homestead Property. The case was subsequently converted to Chapter 7 on June 15, 2017, following a change in the Debtors' financial circumstances. The Trustee moved to sell the Homestead Property, indicating that he believed the Debtors were not entitled\n   to their previously claimed exemption. The Debtors objected to the sale motion on grounds that the Trustee did not intend to pay the claimed exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While the sale motion was pending, the Trustee filed an objection to the Debtors' homestead exemption, asserting among other arguments that the Debtors' lost their right to the exemption by abandoning the Homestead Property post-petition. The Debtors eventually agreed to sale of the Homestead Property provided that the Trustee hold the proceeds subject to further court order, including a decision regarding the objection to the Debtors' homestead exemption. I approved the sale motion and took the exemption objection under advisement. I subsequently overruled the Trustee's objection, and the Trustee appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the appeal was pending, the Debtors filed the Motion to Disburse, seeking distribution of the homestead exemption in the amount of $64,549.95.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   I construed the Trustee's response to the Motion to Disburse in part as a motion for stay pending appeal and in part as a substantive objection to disbursement based on the requirements of RCW 6.13.070(1). I subsequently granted stay pending appeal and took the substantive objection under further advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , each state may \"opt out\" of the federal exemption scheme and limit its residents to the state-created exemptions. Washington has not \"opted out,\" and therefore a debtor in Washington may choose either the exemptions afforded under state law or the federal exemptions under \u00a7 522(d).

The Trustee alternatively contends that if bankruptcy sales are construed to be forced sales under RCW 6.13.070(1), the Debtors are not entitled to an exemption in the sale proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Washington's \"Sunset Provision\" Only Applies to Voluntary Sales.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In Washington, homestead and exemption statutes are favored in law and should be liberally construed.\n   <em>\n    Lien v.

Like some other states within the Ninth Circuit, Washington's homestead statute contains a reinvestment requirement for proceeds of certain sales of homestead property. Such restrictions are commonly referred to as \"sunset provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Combs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6524450\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/166/417/#p420\">\n    166 B.R. 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 420 (Bankr. N.D. Cal. 1994). Based on a plain reading of the statute, the \"sunset provision\" only applies to voluntary sales. RCW 6.13.070(1) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) Except as provided in RCW 6.13.080, the homestead is exempt from attachment and from execution or forced sale for the debts of the owner up to the amount specified in RCW 6.13.030. The\n   <em>\n    proceeds of the voluntary sale\n   </em>\n   of the homestead in good faith for the purpose\n   of acquiring a new homestead, and proceeds from insurance covering destruction of homestead property held for use in restoring or replacing the homestead property, up to the amount specified in RCW 6.13.030,\n   <em>\n    shall likewise be exempt for one year from receipt, and also such new homestead acquired with such proceeds.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   RCW 6.13.070(1) (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The \"sunset provision\" is provided for in the second sentence of the above-paragraph, which concerns the proceeds of a voluntary sale. Forced sales are referenced in the first sentence of RCW 6.13.070(1), which provides that the homestead is exempt \"from execution or forced sale\" up to $125,000, with certain exceptions. Generally, a valid homestead exemption prevents an execution sale only when the owner's equity in the property is less than or equal to the homestead exemption amount. RCW 6.13.160. The statutory requirements for an execution sale of homestead property are addressed in RCW 6.13.100 -200. These provisions are often referred to as the \"excess value\" statutes.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Washington Credit, Inc. v.

The Trustee is correct that the\n   <em>\n    Jefferies\n   </em>\n   court upheld denial of a homestead exemption after concluding that the transfer of property was a forced sale under RCW 6.13.070(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jefferies\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5730215\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/468/373/\">\n    468 B.R. at 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the court offered no legal support or analysis as to why the proceeds of a forced sale would be ineligible for an exemption, given the express terms of RCW 6.13.170. I acknowledge that\n   <em>\n    Jefferies\n   </em>\n   involved a different factual setting and did not address whether bankruptcy sales are forced sales under the Washington homestead statute. However, to the extent the decision in\n   <em>\n    Jefferies\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that the proceeds of a forced sale are not exempt under Washington law, I disagree. The \"excess value\" provisions in RCW 6.13.100 -200 specifically provide for distribution to the \"judgment debtor\" ahead of lien creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This statutory framework would be meaningless if homestead proceeds from a forced sale were not entitled to an exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For these reasons, I conclude that a bankruptcy sale of homestead property is a forced sale within the meaning of RCW 6.13.070(1) and that the proceeds are exempt pursuant to RCW 6.13.160 -180.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In sum, I conclude that the one year reinvestment condition under RCW 6.13.070(1) does not apply to the proceeds of the Trustee's sale. The Debtors' Motion to Disburse is therefore GRANTED. However, because I have previously granted\n   the Trustee's motion for stay pending appeal, the exempt proceeds will remain with the Trustee pending further court order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The present decision does not affect any of the matters on appeal and is limited to the issue of whether homestead proceeds from a bankruptcy sale in Washington are subject to the one-year reinvestment condition under RCW 6.13.070(1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The parties agree that $64,549.95 is the amount of proceeds remaining after payment of senior encumbrances and costs of sale.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Unless otherwise indicated, all chapter and section references are to the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 101 -1532.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Section 5233 refers to \u00a7 548 (5233), Rem. &amp; Bal.
