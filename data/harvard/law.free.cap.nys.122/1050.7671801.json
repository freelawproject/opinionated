Robinson, and her son, respondent George Robinson, her only next of kin and heirs at law, and leaving an estate, real and personal, of between $300,000 and $400,000. This estate she left by will in trust, one half to.be invested and the income paid to her husband as long as he lived, and the principal then to go to her son, and the other half to be invested and the income paid to her son until he arrived at 25 years, when the principal was to be paid to him. One of the trustees, Gillender by name, having misappropriated some of the trust funds, he was removed, and appellant, Lawrence E. Brown, substituted 'as testamentary trustee in his place. Charles A. Robinson having married again and removed to Maine, the whole conduct of the estate was in the hands- of Brown since his appointment in 1904; 'and he having filed no account since his appointment, an application was made by respondent George Hyatt Robinson in the Surrogate\u2019s Court to compel an accounting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1074-15\">It having been determined by the Appellate Division in December, 1909, that the surrogate had no jurisdiction to compel an accounting by a substituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>trustee, appointed by the Supreme Court, the surrogate denied the application, and on December 24, 1909, George Hyatt Robinson presented a sworn petition to the Supreme Court and obtained an order requiring the trustees to show cause why they should not so account, returnable January 10, 1910. After the service of this order, Brown instituted suit against George Hyatt Robinson and others for voluntary accounting, together with an order to show cause why the special proceeding to compel the trustees to account should not he stayed during the pendency of Brown\u2019s action for the same purpose. The application in the special proceedings to compel the trustees to account, and Brown\u2019s action to stay the special proceedings, were heard at the same time. The motion for a stay was denied, and later an order granted for a compulsory accounting in the special proceedings. The order denying the stay was reversed by the Appellate Division, and the motion granted (122 N. X. Supp. 720), and Brown appeals from the order compelling the accounting in the special proceedings.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1075-5\">Argued before INGRAHAM, P.
