The answer of the appellant alleges, among other things, that the tr-ust created by the third paragraph of the will appointing the testamentary trustee is void for want of a defined, determinable object or beneficiary, and that an instrument executed by her confirming the trust was fraudulently obtained from her by the trustee; that the alleged trust property belonged to one Theodore G. White, the creator of the-trust; that she is his sole heir at law and next of kin, and by reason thereof entitled to the same. After issue had been joined, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>tiff moved that a referee be appointed to hear and determine. The motion was granted, and the appeal is from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">The real and substantial controversy is over the validity of the third clause of the will, as well as the validity of the instrument executed by the appellant, confirming the trust. It is quite apparent that these issues must be determined, even if an accounting be had, before a distribution can be made. If, at the trial, it should be determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 contention is correct, then the court can, of its own motion, send the matter to a referee to take and state the account and direct how the same shall be distributed. Before a reference is ordered, an interlocutory judgment should be entered determining these issues. The general rule is that an accounting cannot be referred prior to the trial of the other issues, and the entry of an interlocutory judgment settling and determining the same. Bushby v. Berkeley, 135 App. Div. 443, 119 N. Y. Supp. 739; Goodman v. Roth, 135 App. Div. 515, 120 N. Y. Supp. 328; Post v. Van Siclen, 132 App. Div. 796, 117 N. Y. Supp. 554; London v. Meryash, 132 App. Div. 323, 117 N. Y. Supp. 1; Gibson v. Widman, 106 App. Div. 388, 94 N. Y. Supp. 593. I think the rule is applicable to the case before us.'</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">The order appealed from, therefore, is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
