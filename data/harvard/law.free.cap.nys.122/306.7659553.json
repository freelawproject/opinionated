Thereafter plaintiff is claimed to have delivered 41,000 feet thereof, which were delivered and paid for, and the defendant in writing duly extended the time of delivery for the remainder of said lumber to and including the month of July, 1906 (the date 1905 in the complaint being concededly a clerical error). The complaint then proceeds as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\">\u201cSixth. That within such time the plaintiff duly proceeded to manufacture the remainder of the short leaf pine lumber agreed to be manufactured and delivered by it in accordance with said agreement; and of such remainder, and within such time, had manufactured 198,876 feet thereof, and duly delivered same to the defendant on dock at Belfast in the state of Georgia, at which place, as provided in said agreement, said lumber was to be delivered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">\u201cSeventh. That after plaintiff had so manufactured said 198,876 feet of short leaf pine lumber, \u00e1nd delivered same as aforesaid, and was manufacturing the remainder thereof, the defendant notified the plaintiff that it would not receive the said lumber manufactured or any part thereof, or the whole or any part of the remainder of said short leaf pine lumber, and has refused, and still refuses, to receive said short leaf pine lumber as aforesaid or any part thereof, all without the consent of the plaintiff; that due and prompt notice of the delivery of said short leaf pine lumber, as aforesaid, was given to the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">It is further alleged that the value of said 198,876 feet of lumber was $3,381.45, payment of which has been demanded and refused and no part of which has been paid. The complaint contains the following further allegation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">\u201cNinth. That plaintiff has performed on its part all the terms, covenants, and conditions of said agreement on its part to be performed, and at all the times mentioned herein 'has been ready and willing, and now is ready and willing, to perform all the terms, covenants, and conditions of said agreement on its part to be performed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Defendant demurred to this complaint upon the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Concededly the contract in question was an entire one and called fof the delivery of all the lumber specified before the end of July, 1906. The contract being entire, unless all the lumber had been manufactured and delivered at the place specified in the agreement before the expiration of the time fixed, the defendant was not bound to accept any of the lumber nor to pay for any quantity short of the entire amount contracted for. The complaint does not show when the 41,000 feet of lumber were delivered and paid for, save that it appears this was done at some time prior to the manufacture and delivery of the 198,876 feet. The payment for this portion delivered did not constitute a waiver of the complete performance of the contract, nor is any such claim made in the complaint, and the respondent\u2019s brief expressly admits that it is not claimed that the defendant has waived or agreed to accept a partial delivery of the contract. It is, however, contended that the plaintiff was excused from performance by reason of the fact that while plaintiff was manufacturing its lumber, and before the time to deliver the same had expired, the defendant by his own act prevented the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>from carrying out arid performing its agreement. If this had been properly alleged, the pleading would have been good; but it is nowhere set forth in the complaint that the defendant\u2019s notice that it would not receive the lumber manufactured was given prior to July 31, 1906, which was the latest day within which the contract could be performed. Nor can such an allegation be inferred from the pleading itself. The sixth paragraph, can only be construed to mean that the plaintiff had manufactured and delivered 198,876 feet of the lumber by July 31, 1906. The words \u201cwithin such time\u201d mean that up to, and not beyond, July 31st, that amount of lumber had been delivered, and they fix and determine July ,31st as the latest day up to which plaintiff claimed that performance had been made. It means more than simply saying \u201cbefore said time,\u201d for it fixes a range of the time of delivery from the date of execution at the extension agreement to July 31st, and in effect avers that the delivery was made within that compass of time and was not after the latest date.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">' The complaint then sets forth that after plaintiff had so manufactured and delivered the 198;876 feet (that is, in effect, after the expiration of a period of time ending on July 31, 1906), and while it was manufacturing the balance thereof, the defendant gave the notice that it would not accept a partial delivery nor the balance of the contracted amount. By no reasonable construction of the language used can this be interpreted to mean more than an allegation that after July 31, 1906, the notice in question was given by the defendant. This being so, notice given after the time fixed for performance cannot, excuse the plaintiff\u2019s failure to perform. When a contract entire in its nature is pleaded, and it affirmatively appears that plaintiff has not performed, and he seeks to excuse his failure to perform by notice given by the other party that the latter will not accept the merchandise agreed to be bought or manufactured, it must affirmatively appear by the complaint that such notice was given before the time when the contract by its terms was to be fully performed. .</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The ninth paragraph of the complaint does not assist plaintiff, nor help to set forth a good cause of action, for the provisions of section 533, Code Civ. Proc., have not been complied with, in that the word \u201cduly\u201d has been omitted. Therefore the inferences which might otherwise be drawn in favor of plaintiff cannot be supplied here. Clemens v. American Fire Ins. Co. of Philadelphia, 70 App. Div. 435, 75 N. Y. Supp. 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The interlocutory judgment appealed from should therefore be reversed, with costs, and the. demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to plaintiff to serve an amended complaint within 20 days, on payment of such costs as taxed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
