It is, however, specifically charged that the respondent is a domestic corporation of the fraternal beneficial order; that in the month of September, 1909, the relator was a member thereof in good standing and had been such during the past 13 years; that the constitution and by-laws of the association provided,, among other things so far as material to the decision of this appeal, that charges against a member may be made by a fellow member in writing, and that \u201ca duplicate charge must be read and accepted without debate,\u201d and a committee of three must then be appointed by the president to prefer the charges, and, if such committee finds \u201cthat there is some basis for the charge,\u201d the president must appoint \u201ca committee of seven to, act on the charges\u201d; \u2018that the committee shall send a copy of the charges to both parties, and keep a record of its proceedings and make a report thereon to the society at its next meeting; that, \u201cin order to find a member guilty, at least five members of the seven must be of th\u00e9 opinion that he is guilty of the charges and must find him so,\u201d\" and that \u201cduring such a proceeding the parties to the charge have a right to speak upon the question, and, after having spoken once upon the subject, must leave the meeting room, and that the accused as well as the accuser has a right to reject four of the members of the trial committee and in that event the president must appoint four others,\u201d and that \u201cthe accused as well as the accuser have a right to select counsel before said committee.\u201d It is further expressly stated in the affidavit that no committee of three was appointed, and that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>instead of appointing a committee of' three to investigate and prefer charges, a committee of ten was appointed, and that by the direction \u25a0of this committee a notice in writing was sent to the relator inclosing a copy of the charges filed against him by a brother member and sent -charges prepared and preferred by a committee of three and requesting him to appear before the \u201ccharges committee appointed by the president\u201d at a time and place specified \"to present your answer in defense of these charges\u201d; that he appeared before the committee, thinking it was the investigating committee, and was denied an opportunity and the right to speak upon the charges and was told to leave the room, and that he was \u201cdenied the right to select counsel \u25a0and the privilege of challenging jurors\u201d; that he was subsequently requested to pay the sum of $4.90 at the next meeting of the society to be held on the 18th day of September, 1909, and notified that, in the event of his failure so to do, he would be expelled, and that he refused to pay the fine and was expelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">The allegations that the relator was denied the right to select counsel and the privilege of challenging members of the trial committee \u2022are in a sense legal conclusions. It would- have been better pleading to have stated that he requested to be given or accorded the privilege of -exercising his right to select counsel or to present challenges and that his request was denied; but the liberal rule with respect to the \u2022construction of pleadings applies here, and in another sense it is clear that he could not be denied a right that he did not assert, unless the \u2022necessary inference is that the affirmative action of the committee was such as to render a request futile. Moreover, it is clearly stated that he was denied an opportunity to speak upon the charges and was directed to leave the room, and this we think is a sufficient statement of the fact that he was not afforded an opportunity or permitted to speak with respect to the charges. Assuming that he was, as he thus charges, denied the right to be heard in defense of the charges made against him, it is not material to consider the sufficiency of the charges, for in no event \u2022could he be legally expelled without being allowed to be heard in his defense. The answering affidavits deny these allegations, and thus a -question of fact was presented which the Special Term could not determine, for it was the right of the relator, since he prayed for that relief, to have an alternative writ, to the end that the material questions of fact might be determined by a jury. The learned counsel for the respondent contends that since it appears by the answering affidavits that the charges were properly prepared by a committee of three, and that a committee of seven was thereupon duly appointed to hear the charges, and that they were duly heard, and that the relator was afforded an opportunity to challenge members of the trial \u2022committee and to have counsel, the court was warranted in-ref using even an alternative writ and in denying the application. The only authorities cited in support of that contention are decisions holding that for the purpose of determining whether the petitioner is entitled to a peremptory writ the answering affidavits must be taken as true, &gt;or that, where the nature of the claim is such that in no event could .a peremptory writ of mandamus be issued, the court is justified in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>withholding an alternative writ. Here the petitioner requested in the alternative that he be granted a peremptory or alternative writ of mandamus, and the nature of his claim is such that a peremptory writ may be granted to reinstate him as a member of this association, for his membership carries with it certain rights of a pecuniary nature which are property rights of which he could not be deprived without due process of law, which in such case means that the proceedings affecting his rights must be had in substantial accordance with the provisions of' the constitution and by-laws, and he must be afforded an opportunity to be heard in defense of any charge made against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">It follows, therefore, that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for an alternative writ granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
