It appears that the defendant had paid all the alimony and counsel fees due down to the time that the order for his examination was made, and that his attorney then held enough money to pay the next installment of alimony to fall due. The order for examination sought to be vacated was made-on the application of the receiver, and directs the defendant to be examined \u201ctouching his property, real and personal, and also touching any property which he may now or which he may have formerly held possession of belonging to his wife, the plaintiff in this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">We have been referred to no authority, and have been able to find none, authorizing such an order as this. It does not fall within sections 803 to 809, Code Civ. Proc., relating to a discovery of books and papers, because the procedure therein authorized must be taken by a party to the action or proceeding, and defendant is not a party. Furthermore, it is an examination, and not a discovery, which is-, sought. Nor can the order be sustained under section 870 et seq., for these sections refer to examinations at the instance of a party, or of one who expects to be a party. Particularly is the order unauthorized in so far as it requires the defendant to be examined touching propertyof his wife which he has or had in his possession. With that the-receiver had nothing to do. His receivership extends only to the-property belonging to defendant, and not to property belonging to- the: wife, in whose hands soever it may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion to vacate order granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
