In view of this situation, I think that the attitude^ of the learned trial court was well calculated to prejudice the jury against the -cause of the defendant. The court repeatedly sustained objection to \u25a0questions propounded by the defendant\u2019s counsel which were in themselves proper. It is true that these questions were not very important, aad the rulings upon them, while erroneous, would, if considered alone, be insufficient to justify a reversal of the judgment. When these rulings are considered in connection with the attitude of apparent hostility which the learned court maintai\u00f1ed toward the counsel for the \u2022defendant, I think it becomes evident that the jury may well have been prejudiced against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Nothing is of greater importance than that all litigants, no matter what the charge against them may be, should have a fair trial. A \u2022careful examination of this record has impressed me with the opinion that this defendant was not accorded such a trial, and in the interests \u25a0of justice I think that the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial \u25a0ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">LEHMAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b725-7\">GAVEGAN, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"A2jF\">While the record on this appeal dis\u25a0closes incidents in the trial of the case which are most regrettable, I do not consider that the verdict of the jury was influenced in any degree by the attitude of the court towards the defendant\u2019s counsel. Believing, as I do, that the defendant\u2019s own testimony discredited him in the minds of the jury, I think the verdict should stand, and that the plaintiff should not be compelled to go to trial again on the issues which were found in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs to the respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
