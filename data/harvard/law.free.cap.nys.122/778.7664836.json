The package was labeled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-6\">\u201cPrice 25 cents. Kaseara Kathartics cure constipation. Faxon, Williams and Faxon, Mfg. Druggists, Buffalo, N. Y.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">On the reverse side:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-8\">\u201cDirections. Kaseara ICathattics can be taken at any time. As a laxative eat one tablet. For constipation, a tablet at bed time, and one before breakfast will prove satisfactory. In obstinate cases continue this treatment until cured. Children, one quarter to one-half tablet, according to age.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">On one side of the box:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-10\">\u201cStimulate the liver. Invigorate the bowels.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">On the reverse side:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-12\">\u201cPurely vegetable. Pleasantly effective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">The plaintiff and her husband each took one of the tablets, and after arriving at her home in Brockport, N. Y., the plaintiff partook of a cathartic, as she was a sufferer from chronic constipation. On Friday evening of the following week she started for New York and swallowed another tablet and three others at intervals of <em>12 </em>hours. She was afflicted on Saturday and Sunday with swollen face and gums, an excessive discharge of saliva, ulcers on the cheek, and other ills, which continued for a long time, and from the effects of which she claimed she had not recovered at the time of the trial in May, 1909.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">The evidence warranted the finding of the jury that the salivation and other injuries resulted from taking the tablets purchased of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-15\">The plaintiff and her husband testified that at the time they purchased the box of tablets the clerk who made the sale informed them that the preparation was the same as cascara segrada, only in tablet form. It was hardly possible for any one in defendant\u2019s employ to remember the sale, so that the evidence of the plaintiff and her husband as to that transaction was not directly contradicted. The plaintiff had long been taking cascara segrada for constipation. This preparation is a syrup cathartic made from the bark of a tree. Each tablet of the Kaseara Kathartics contains one-fifth of a grain of calomel combined with senna and podophyllin, which are laxative vegetable extracts, intended as a cathartic to expel the calomel from the system, although that ingredient is a laxative or cathartic. Th\u00e9 tablets were not, therefore, \u201cpurely vegetable,\u201d as represented on the labels, yet far the greater part of the preparation was a vegetable composition.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>The court, in charging the jury, made this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-5\">\u201cThere is not anything in this case which made it illegal for these defendants to sell this box without stating what its contents are, what the-contents of the tablets are, and it is not the gist of this action that these things are sold as cascara when they are not. cascara, nor is it the gist of this action that these things contain calomel when there is nothing in the representation made at the time of the sale to indicate that calomel was-contained therein. The gist of this action is negligence on the part of the-defendant in selling as a harmless remedy something which was detrimental to human health.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">He then left to the jury the two propositions for them to pass upon r First, whether the article was dangerous to human health when taken-according to the directions .contained on the label. Second, was the-defendant negligent in selling the tablets ? I think the evidence .contained in the record fails to establish either of these propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">First. The public health law (chapter 661, Laws 1893, amended by-chapter 667, Laws 1900; chapter 45, \u00a7 236, Consol. Laws) contains-an enumeration of the poisons which it is unlawful to sell at retail without affixing to the package \u201ca label containing the name of the-article and the word \u2018Poison\u2019 distinctly shown.\u201d Calomel is not included in the elaborate lists in these schedules. Again, the prohibition,, in any event, does not extend to \u201cthe manufacture and sale of proprietary medicines.\u201d Laws 1900, c. 667, \u00a7 199; Laws 1901, c. 648; Consol. Laws, c. 45, \u00a7 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Calomel is not a poison within the prohibited class, and- its use is-not per se dangerous to human health. The evidence shows that it is frequently used, and that the quantity which the plaintiff took, according to her testimony, would not be expected to be followed by any serious results.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Dr. Anderson, a witness on behalf of the plaintiff, and who attended her first after she had taken the tablets, testified that in administeringcalomel he gave \u201cone-tenth of a grain every hour until I have given, a grain,\u201d and he further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-10\">\u201cI remember that Mrs. Willson (the plaintiff) said that she had been taking-these tablets every day for quite a while. I think it was a matter of weeks, perhaps months. I would call half a grain of calomel at night and a half grain at morning for two or three days a moderate dose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">It seems that the plaintiff had been accustomed to take calomel for constipation.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">Dr. Hazen, her family physician in Brockport, testified that he gave her at one time 7% grains of calomel without causing salivation. He also testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-13\">\u201cIf this tablet contains sufficient other cathartic ingredients\u2014that is, podophyllin and senna\u2014to act freely, it would in all probability carry off calomel. I never heard of any case where the taking of one-fifth grain of calomel, except Mrs. Willson, produced salivation. I don\u2019t know that I ever heard, of such a case in the books.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-14\">Dr. O\u2019Gorman, a physician testifying for plaintiff, said'that one-tenth of a grain of calomel every half hour until a grain was taken, was safe practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>Dr. Clinton, on behalf of the defendant, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-4\">\u201cSenna is a vegetable drug used for cathartic purposes. Podophyllin is a resin and is also generally used for cathartic purposes. In my practice I have \u25a0often prescribed calomel. In my judgment the ordinary dose for a person, \u25a0such as Mrs. Willson, as I examined and found her to be, would be one to five grains for cathartic purposes and half a grain or a grain for laxative purposes. Calomel is sometimes given in small doses repeated at short intervals, and sometimes in large doses for a single taking. * * * I cannot recollect \u25a0ever having heard of a person being salivated by the taking with or without a cathartic of any amount of calomel less than one grain. That is less than \u25a0one grain over a period of 48 hours. It has never happened in my practice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">All the physicians agree that the salivation and other results following the taking of the small number of tablets as testified by plaintiff was unusual and not to be anticipated. Either the plaintiff was at the time peculiarly susceptible to calomel, or else she must have taken a far greater quantity than she stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The calomel was a cathartic, and its laxative properties were reinforced by the other two purgative ingredients composing the preparation, and, if taken as directed on the label, the person would not retain in the system sufficient of the mercury to produce any injurious results. A preparation is not \u201cdeleterious\u201d to human health, in the \u25a0ordinary acceptation of that term, simply because one person in a multitude of those using it happens to meet with ill effects from taking it.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Second. The proof utterly failed to establish the negligence of the\" -defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">The public health law (Laws 1900, c. 667, \u00a7 197, subd. 2) in force at the time the tablets were sold provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-9\">\u201cEvery proprietor of a wholesale or retail drug store, pharmacy, or other place where drugs, medicines or chemicals are sold, shall be held responsible for the quality and strength of all drugs, chemicals or medicines sold or dispensed by him except those sold in original packages of the manufacturer, and those articles or preparations known as patent or proprietary medicines.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">Upon the trial of the action these facts were stipulated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-11\">\u201cKascara Kathartics is a patent or proprietary medicine manufactured by Billings, Clapp &amp; Co., wholesale druggists of Boston, Blass. Billings, Clapp \u25a0&amp; Co. are well-known and reputable manufacturers of high-grade patent and proprietary medicines. Kascara Kathartics were sold by salesmen and by letter to the trade either in bulk or with a label of Billings, Clapp &amp; Co. attached, or in boxes with a special label of the customer attached. The boxes are usually 10 and 25 cents size retail. The quantities of Kascara Kathartics put upon the market are about 500 to 1,000 pounds a year, and they have been upon the market for about 10 years. Labels on the boxes are printed in various ways as designated by the customer with his name thereon, and, in the absence of any directions by the customer, Billings, Clapp &amp; Co. put on their \u25a0own labels, which are printed at the factory and the goods are packed there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">Also that Billings, Clapp &amp; Co. had been selling this preparation for 10 years and had 200 or 300 different customers \u201call through the \u2022eastern and northern parts of the United States\u201d; that this manufacturing firm had been in the business since 1857, and with the reputation \u201cof being first-class manufacturing pharmacists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">The evidence showed that the defendant had been selling these tablets since March, 1903, and had disposed of about 900 boxes during that time, and without complaint from any one. They were all sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>in the original packages as put up and labeled by the manufacturers. They were not analyzed by the defendant, and it appeared without dispute that proprietary medicines are not analyzed by the retail druggists.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The defendant was not required to exercise extraordinary care or the highest efficiency. It purchased of a long-established manufacturing company of excellent reputation, and was justified in placing reliance upon the capability and standing of this company. The test of reasonable care usually applied in actions of negligence (Carlson v. Ph\u0153nix Bridge Co., 132 N. Y. 273, 30 N. E. 750; Paul v. Con. Fireworks Co., etc., 133 App. Div. 310, 117 N. Y. Supp. 698) is pertinent in measuring the legal responsibility of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The cases cited by the respondent\u2019s counsel are not applicable. In Thomas v. Winchester, 6 N. Y. 397, 57 Am. Dec. 455, a leading case, the action was negligence. The defendant, a compounder of drugs and medicinal preparations, sold a package labeled as extract of dandelion, which was in fact extract of belladonna, a deadly poison, and it was finally administered to the plaintiff by her physician in, the belief that it was extract of dandelion. -The court, in commenting upon the effect of this poison, used this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-7\">\u201cThe death or great bodily harm of some person was the natural and almost inevitable consequence of the sale of belladonna by means of the false label.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">The article sold as medicine was \u201cimminently dangerous\u201d to human life, and the defendant was held liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">In Kuelling v. Lean Mfg. Co., 183 N. Y. 78, 75 N. E. 1098, 2 L. R. A. (N. S.) 303, 111 Am. St. Rep. 691, the action as construed by the Court of Appeals was not in negligence, \u201cbut is controlled by considerations resting upon the law applicable to willful and fraudulent deceit and concealment,\u201d and an entirely different rule of liability governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">In Torgeson v. Schultz, 192 N. Y. 156, 84 N. E. 956, 18 L. R. A. (N. S.) 726, 127 Am. St. Rep. 894, the plaintiff lost an eye by the explosion of a siphon bottle of aerated water sold to the plaintiff\u2019s employer by the defendant. The evidence was that the defendant knew that bottles so filled were liable to explode, and for that reason the court held that the question of .the defendant\u2019s'liability was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">The defendant in this case did not know that the tablets it sold to-the plaintiff\u2019s husband were dangerous, and in that fact is the controlling distinction. O\u2019Neill <em>v. </em>James, 138 Mich. 567, 101 N. W. 828, 68 L. R. A. 342, 110 Am. St. Rep. 321. It believed a person could safely take them without any deleterious results, and the belief was well founded on a long experience in selling them. They were not imminently dangerous, and the rule in the cases cited ought not to control in this case. Bruckle v. Milhau\u2019s Son, 116 App. Div. 832, 102 N. Y. Supp. 395; Loop v. Litchfield, 42 N. Y. 351, 1 Am. Rep. 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">A new trial should be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">Judgment and order reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs-to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
