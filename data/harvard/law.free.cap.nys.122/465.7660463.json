The moving affidavits are two\u2014of the treasurer of the defendant and of its attorney. The treasurer deposes that defendant desires to examine the plaintiff \u201cas to his business, and as to the damage which he alleges he has suffered by reason of the acts of the defendant, and as to the manner in which he will be irreparably injured if he is not granted the relief which he asks for in the amended complaint.\u201d The attorney only deposes that he verily believes, and has advised the defendant, \u201cthat, in order to properly defend this action, the deposition of the plaintiff before trial is material and necessary.\u201d The plaintiff sets forth in his complaint what his business had been, what business he proposes to carry on, and what the nature of the damages to his business was, and what the threatened damage to his business is, but he does not seek to recover compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-18\">If the purpose of the examination is to procure the items and details of such damages, the examination should have been refused, as it is not incumbent on the defendant to establish the items of the plaintiff\u2019s damage.

The allegation that the deposition before trial is material and necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>affords no ground for the relief in the absence of any facts that indicate that there is reason for that statement.
