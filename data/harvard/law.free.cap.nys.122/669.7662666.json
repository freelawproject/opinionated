The complaint was amended, so as to convert the action into one to foreclose a lien upon a chattel. When the case was concluded, the plaintiffs had proved that' they sold furniture to the defendant\u2019s wife under a conditional _sale agreement. The plaintiffs failed to show that the wife signed her husband\u2019s name to the agreement, or that she had any authority to act for her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-17\">Notwithstanding the proof, the return shows that the court \u201crendered as on a lien judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.\u201d The form of the judgment was consented to and is called by counsel a \u201cspecial form of judgment.\u201d Even the injunction to disregard \u201ctechnical errors and defects\u201d and do \u201csubstantial justice\u201d cannot close our eyes to the fact that the defendant was not a party to the conditional sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>agreement upon which he has been held liable, and that his wife, whose-property has been held to be subject to the plaintiffs\u2019 lien, is not a party to the action. Nor is the plaintiffs\u2019 theory, that the furniture was a necessary of the wife, adequate to the task of securing the affirmance of this judgment. Not only was the action not brought upon this theory, but the evidence shows that the defendant had sufficiently supplied his wife with necessaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed.
