The order for the examination of the assignor in proceedings supplementary to execution was served on the 24th day of September-, 1909. It thereupon applied to the Special Term setting forth merely the general assignment; that schedules had been duly filed and claims advertised for; that the assignee had duly qualified, and the order and the affidavit upon which it was granted. No other basis was shown for the order from which the appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-18\">A general assignment neither stays nor suspends the remedies of creditors of the assignor. It does not appear that the appellants have waived their right to the remedy afforded by the statute to examine the judgment debtor in proceedings supplementary to execution. Counsel for the respondent contends, in support of the order, that the only right which the appellants now have to examine the assignor is under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>section <em>22 </em>of the Debtor and Creditor Law (chapter 12, Consol. Laws). The provisions of that section were taken from section 21 of chapter 466 of the Laws of 1877, known as the \u201cgeneral assignment act,\u201d and it was well settled that, the examination thereby authorized was only in aid and furtherance of the assignment, and that while, as an incident to such examination duly authorized to ascertain the property subject to distribution and the creditors to whom distribution should be made, evidence might be adduced tending to show that the assignment was made in fraud of the rights of creditors, still the examination could not be had for that purpose. Matter of Holbrook, 99 N. Y. 539, 546, 2 N. E. 887; Matter of Sickle, 52 Hun, 527, 5 N. Y. Supp. 703; Matter of Workingmen\u2019s Pub. Ass\u2019n, 62 App. Div. 604, 71 N. Y. Supp. 248; Matter of Goldsmith, 10 Daly, 112; Matter of Wilkinson,. 36 Hun, 134. And if a creditor came in and participated in the assignment proceedings and pursued any remedy thereunder, he waived or ran a serious risk of waiving any right to attack the assignment for fraud. Matter of Holbrook, supra; Mills et al. v. Parkhurst, 126 N. Y. 89-93, 26 N. E. 1041, 13 L. R. A. 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The same rules of construction still obtain. The assignment is wholly voluntary. The law permits it as a means for a distribution of the property of an insolvent debtor among his creditors, and, if the assignment be made in conformity with the statute and without fraud on the part of the assignor, it will be sustained; but, if it be made by the assignor in fraud of the rights of creditors or in violation of the statute, then a creditor may, in disregard of the assignment, pursue his legal remedies against the property thus assigned, or may bring a suit in equity to set the assignment aside. Mills et al. v. Parkhurst, supra; Austin v. Bell, 20 Johns. 442, 11 Am. Dec. 297; McConnell v. Sherwood, 84 N. Y. 522, 38 Am. Rep. 537; Clark v. Taylor, 22 Wkly. Dig. 295; Ocean National Bank v. Olcott, 46 N. Y. 12; In re Assignment of Samuel Kapelovich et al., 22 Wkly. Dig. 13; Bishop on Insolvent Debtors, \u00a7\u00a7 223, 203, 204, 206. The appellants were therefore at liberty, notwithstanding the assignment, to discover, by examination on the proceedings supplementary to execution, any property of the judgment debtor, and the circumstances under which he had transferred his property, including the general assignment thereof. Matter of Sickle, supra; Seligman v. Wallach, 16 Abb. N. C. 317; Schneider v. Altman, 16 Abb. N. C. 312; In re Rindskopf, 16 Abb. N. C. 316, note. See, also, Lathrop v. Clapp, 40 N. Y. 328, 100 Am. Dec. 493. And if the remedies specially available to him as a judgment creditor proved fruitless, and the assignment be not set aside, he may ultimately come into the assignment proceeding and participate with other creditors in the distribution of the assigned estate. Mills et al. v. Parkhurst, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">It follows that the order should be. reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
