The plaintiff testifies that he helped to remove this header, and that the accident occurred within an hour and a half of the time that the header was taken away.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-17\">Obviously the notice served called attention only to a common-law right of action, and did not enlarge his rights. He is entitled to no greater consideration in asserting a common-law right of action because he served a notice that he had been injured by the neglect of a common-law duty of the master, and when it appears by plaintiff\u2019s own testimony that the place was made unsafe in the progress of the work, he himself participating in the very act which caused the accident, there is an end of his case. If the plaintiff had just come upon the work, with the header already removed, and had been directed by the foreman to go upon the projecting ends of these beams, unsupported by the header, he might be heard to say that he was not furnished a reasonably safe place in which to perform his labors; but this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>was not the case. He had worked there for several months in the remodeling of this building. The header was in position when he went to work on the very day of the accident, and he himself helped to take it down in the very work then under way, and the master certainly did not owe him such a duty of active vigilance as to come along and inspect these unsupported beams within one hour and a half of the time the plaintiff helped to remove them. This duty might have been due to a new employ\u00e9 coming upon the work at that time, but it was not due the plaintiff. The dangers to be anticipated were equally obvious to him as to the master, and the assurance of the working foreman that the beams ran through the wall was not an assurance on the part of the master.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Judgment and order affirmed on reargument, with costs. All concur, except HIRSCHBERG, P. J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
