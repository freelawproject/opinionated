Citing Miller v. Adams, 52 N. Y. 409; Title Guarantee &amp; Trust Co. v. Brown, 121 N. Y. Supp. 891. \u25a0 In the latter case, the affiant recited that he was \u201can attorney connected with the office of\u201d the attorney of the plaintiff, and the affidavit was held insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">The subsequent approval or adoption by the judgment creditor is ineffective, since the question is as to the authority of the judge who made the order when the papers first came before h'im. Brown v. Walker, 54 Hun, 639, 8 N. Y. Supp. 59, affirmed 121 N. Y. 717, 24 N. E. 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-14\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and' order for examination vacated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
