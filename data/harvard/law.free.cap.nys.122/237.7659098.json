By the will the testatrix gave all of her property, both real and personal, to the appellant, a grandnephew, in trust to pay to' her son, David Abbott Thorburn, from the income derived therefrom, the sum of $10 per week during the term of his natural life, and upon his death the remainder to the appellant. The son was the testatrix\u2019s only heir at law and next of kin. He died intestate without- issue on the 15th of August, 1909. The plaintiff is a nephew of the testatrix and brings this action under section 2653a of the Code of Civil Procedure to determine the validity of the will and codicil. In the complaint he alleges that he is \u201cone of the heirs at law and next of kin\u201d of the testatrix. The appellant sets up as a defense that after the death of the testatrix an agreement was entered into between the son and the appellant, whereby the former consented to the probate of the will and codicil of his mother, and the latter agreed to assign, transfer, and set over all of the property of the testatrix, together with all the accumulations derived therefrom, to the son at the expiration of five years after the admission of the will to probate, provided the son in the meantime had refrained from the use of intoxicating liquors and dfugs and proved himself capable of properly using and enjoying the estate. .The agreement also provided that the appellant in the meantime would pay to the son, out of the income derived from the trust estate, the sum of $15 per week instead of $10, the amount named in the will. The answer further alleges that the son failed to observe the conditions of the agreement, although he accepted the benefits thereunder and ratified the same up to the time of his death. After issue had been joined, the appellant moved that the plaintiff be compelled to reply to the affirmative defense referred to. The motion was denied, and he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>I am of the opinion the motion should have been granted. The only possible interest which the plaintiff has in the estate of the testatrix is such as he may have derived through the son. When the testatrix died, the plaintiff was not one of the heirs at law or next of kin. He would have had no standing to oppose the probate of her will, since the son was her only heir at law and next of kin, and during his life plaintiff could not have maintained an action to determine the validity of the will, because he would not have been a \u201cperson interested as devisee, legatee or otherwise, * * * \u201d in her will or \u201cinterested as heir at law, next of kin or otherwise\u201d in her estate. If the agreement pleaded as a defense is valid, then the plaintiff has now no standing to maintain this action. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 516, authorizes the court, in its discretion, to compel a reply to new matter contained in an answer and set up as a defense by way of avoidance, and this discretion ought to be exercised where the new matter is of such a character as to indicate that, if true, it will constitute a complete defense to the action; the object being to narrow the issues to be tried and prevent surprise at the trial. Here, the new matter pleaded is of such a character as called upon the court to exercise its discretion and require a reply. If it be true that the plaintiff relies upon any facts by which he expects to avoid the apparent sufficiency of the defense, there is no reason why he should not be required to state' it. This will enable the appellant to properly prepare for, lessen the expense of, and prevent surprise at, the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">: The order appealed from, therefore, is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
