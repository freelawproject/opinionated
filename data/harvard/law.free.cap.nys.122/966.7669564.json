The defendant demurred to the complaint upon the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and then the plaintiff moved for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">The trial of the issue raised by the demurrer could only be brought on as provided in section 977 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Notwithstanding the fact that the defendant had not served the notice of trial provided in the section, or asked for any affirmative relief, the court, nevertheless, assumed to dispose of the plaintiff\u2019s motion as though it were the trial of the demurrer, and made an order denying the motion and sustaining the demurrer, and directed judgment for the defendant, dismissing the complaint, with costs, unless within 10 days plaintiff paid the costs and served an amended complaint. The only motion before the court was one made by plaintiff for judgment in her favor, and only that motion should have been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">Besides, it would seem,'under Sanders v. Parshall, 67 Hun, 105, <em>22 </em>N. Y. Supp. 20, affirmed 142 N. Y. 679, 37 N. E. 825, that the complaint does state a cause of action; but that question must be determined on a trial of the issues raised by the demurrer, and.for that reason we do not at this time pass upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">The order appealed from, therefore, is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant, and the plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings denied, with $10 costs to the defendant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
