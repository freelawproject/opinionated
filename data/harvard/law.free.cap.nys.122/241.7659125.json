The defense was that the work was performed and the materials furnished for and at the request of the defendant\u2019s husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-17\">The plaintiff was his sole witness, and gave testimony to the effect \u2022that all of his transactions were had with the defendant, who stated to him that she owned and conducted the business where the cloaks, suits, and other goods embroidered by the plaintiffs were sold. He further testified that he transacted no business with the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>husband during the period in which the services were rendered and the materials furnished. His testimony was impeached by bills made out by the plaintiffs, addressed and sent to the defendant\u2019s husband, which show that during the period in question he was dealing continuously with the defendant\u2019s husband. Both the defendant and her husband denied that the defendant owned and operated the business in question, and both testified that the defendant\u2019s husband owned and operated it. Both also testified that all the business relations had with the plaintiff were had for and on behalf of the defendant\u2019s husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
