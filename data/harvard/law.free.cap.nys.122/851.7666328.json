Smith, deceased. The defendant was the brother and administrator of Augusta O. Smith, widow of William S. Smith, and one of her next of kin. She was the second wife of said William S. Smith, and was the stepmother of the plaintiff. The plaintiff and the defendant each claim to own the account. In 1891 Smith opened the account with money deposited by him, and had the bank book issued in the name of \u201cWilliam S. and Augusta C. Smith.\u201d In 1901 the account was changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>by adding the words, \u201cPayable to either or the survivor.\u201d Smith died November 6, 1901.' Mrs. Smith died September 5, 1907, not having withdrawn anything from the account.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b876-5\">Argued before SMITH, P.

KELLOGG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALF\">This case is reported upon a former appeal in 131 App. Div. 399, 115 N. Y. Supp. 1035, where a judgment in favor of the plaintiff was reversed because the trial court permitted her to swear to conversations with her father, since deceased, from whom the defendant derived title, or who was connected with the title of the defendant to the deposit in question. The court at the same time ruled that the statements made by the defendant\u2019s intestate were receivable in evidence as admissions against her interest. Upon this trial the court excluded said alleged admissions made by the defendant\u2019s intestate, and also conversations overheard between the plaintiff\u2019s intestate and defendant\u2019s intestate with reference to the ownership of the deposit in question; it standing upon the bank books in the name of both, payable \u201cto either or the survivor.\u201d The manner in which the deposits stood upon the bank books did not in itself determine the absolute title as between the parties in whose name it stood, and a conversation between them upon the subject was clearly admissible, and the admissions by the defendant\u2019s intestate with reference to the ownership of the fund were also clearly admissible. We are simply holding that the evidence was admissible, and do not consider what weight it may have in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">The judgment 'should therefore be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
