The action was for negligence. A verdict was rendered for $10,000. The clerk\u2019s minutes and the case and exceptions and the judgment state that a motion for a new trial under section 999, Code, upon the minutes, was made and denied, but no formal order to that effect appears in the record, and no notice of appeal from such order. The appeal is from the judgment alone, and therefore the weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>of the evidence as to the negligence of both parties and assumed risk cannot be considered. The only question is whether there was any evidence for the jury upon these questions, or whether there was such a failure of evidence as to authorize a nonsuit. From the recitations in the judgment and the affidavits on the motion, it appears that there have been three trials of the case in addition to the assessment of damages on defendant\u2019s default when the jury rendered a verdict of $10,000. The first trial was in November, 1907, when a verdict for plaintiff of $6,800 was rendered. Upon a motion by defendant upon the minutes and on stipulation of plaintiff this verdict was set aside, and a new trial granted. A second trial was had in September, 1908, when a verdict for plaintiff for $5,000 was rendered. This verdict on motion of defendant was set aside as contrary to and against the weight of the evidence, and a new trial granted. The third trial was had in January, 1909, when the present verdict of $10,000 was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The injuries for which the action was brought were received by plaintiff\u2019s head coming in contact with a low bridge in defendant\u2019s yard in Rochester. He was brakeman and switchman. We cannot hold that the case was one for a nonsuit, and therefore, the question of the weight of -evidence not being before us, not even as to the amount of the verdict, the judgment should be affirmed, unless the order appealed from denying the motion for a new trial for newly discovered evidence is reversed and an order made for such new trial. The appeal from the judgment was taken February 17, 1909. Thereafter the motion for a new trial for newly discovered evidence was made. The affidavits seem to have been made at different times during the year 1909, but the motion was not heard until November of that year. The judge who tried the case heard the motion. His judgment was that a new trial should not be had for newly discovered evidence. The case has been tried four times, and I do not think the defendant is likely to succeed so long as the questions involved are to be submitted to a jury. If it was entitled to a nonsuit, that question can be reviewed on appeal from the judgment to the Court of Appeals. This order I think therefore should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Second. As to the costs upon the appeal from the order denying motion for a new trial for newly discovered evidence, of course, the respondent is entitled to full costs upon the appeal from the judgment. The question is whether he should also have full costs upon the appeal from the order. The motion for such new \"trial had necessarily to be made upon a case and exceptions settled and filed. Sections 997, 999, Code Civ.. Proc.;. Bantleon v. Meier, 81 Hun, 162, 30 N. Y. Supp. 706; Harris v. Gregg, 4 App. Div. 615, 38 N. Y. Supp. 844. And in I such case the prevailing party was entitled to full costs at Special | Term as upon an appeal to the Appellate Division, and this order expressly so provided. Subdivision 3, \u00a7 3351, Code Civ. Proc.; Davis v. Railroad Co., 5 App. Div. 36, 39 N. Y. Supp. 71, and cases therein I referred to. Where the order appealed from is one made on any ofl the grounds specified in section 999, Code Civ. Proc., and costs arel allowed on an appeal from the judgment, no costs can be allowed onl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>the appeal from the order. Section 3239, Code Civ. Proc.; Syms v. Mayor of New York, 105 N. Y. 153-158, 11 N. E. 369. And very likely this is so when the motion is made on a case and exceptions settled, as well as when made upon the minutes alone. In either case only issues arising on the trial are involved, only one record made on appeal, only one set of points is needed, and only one argument made. But where the question of newly discovered evidence is involved, the motion is independent of the trial, and affidavits are used raising questions not involved in the trial. On appeal a different record is-made up, because these affidavits have no place in the record on the appeal from the judgment. A separate set of points and a separate-argument of the new questions involved are necessary, and we think in view of these considerations a full bill of costs should be allowed on the appeal from the. order under subdivision 4, \u00a7 3251, Code (above), notwithstanding the provisions of section 3239 (above). This was the view taken by the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court in Streep v. McLoughlin, 36 Misc. Rep. 165, 72 N. Y. Supp. 1061, which we approve of.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">There is no authority for allowing $10 costs. If any are allowed, they should be full costs under subdivision 4, \u00a7 3251, above. So far as the opinion relates to the appeal from the order, it is concurred in by SPRING and KRUSE, JJ. McEENNAN concurs in affirmance of order, but dissents as to allowance of a full bill of- costs thereon. ROBSON, J., dissents on ground that the motion for a new trial should have been granted. So far as opinion relates to appeal from the judgment all concur, except ROBSON, J., who dissents on ground new trial should have been granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
