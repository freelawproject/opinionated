Nor will it be set aside for mere errors in the receipt or exclusion of evidence. To justify the reversal of an award for error of law, it must be made to appear that the commissioners adopted an erroneous principle -in estimating compensation. Matter of Daly v. Smith, 18 App. Div. 196, 45 N. Y. Supp. 785; Harlem River &amp; Portchester R. R. Co. v. Reynolds, 50 App. Div. 575, 64 N. Y. Supp. 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">After a careful examination of the evidence in this proceeding we are not convinced that the commissioners adopted an erroneous principle of valuation, or that injustice has been done the claimant. We think, however, that the report of the commissioners of appraisal is erroneous, in that it does not contain a statement of the sum estimated and determined upon as just and equitable compensation to be made by the city to the owner, as required by section 13 of the act (Laws 1905, c. 724) under which the land was taken. The evidence before the commissioners shows, and their report states, that the ownership of the land, at the time it was taken, was in the appellant, subject to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>grant to the Citizens\u2019 Standard Telephone Company of- a right of way-for a telephone line over said premises, and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-3\">\u201cThe amount ascertained and determined by us as aforesaid to be paid to the-owners thereof and the persons interested in said land for the acquisition of the fee of the premises designated on said map as parcel No. 54, and for all damages sustained or which may be sustained by them by reason of the acquisition, use, and occupation of said fee for the purposes indicated in said act, is-the sum of two thousand eight hundred dollars ($2,800), as follows: Jacob. Mayer, owner, twenty-six hundred dollars ($2,600) subject to easement of the-Citizens\u2019 Standard Telephone Company of undetermined value; Winn &amp; Yam Steenburgh, the owners of the growing timber standing o.n said premises, two. hundred dollars ($200).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">It is apparent that the effect of this award is to compel the appellant to await the determination of the compensation to be made to the' Telephone Company. It does not estimate and award the damages to. which the appellant is entitled, and therefore it does not comply with, the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">It necessarily follows that the order appealed from, in so far as the-same relates to the amount awarded for parcel No. 54, should be reversed, and the report or award of the commissioners set aside, and! the matter remitted to the commissioners for a determination of the-amount to which the appellant is entitled, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
