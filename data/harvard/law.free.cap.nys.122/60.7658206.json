Delivery was to be made on or about July 31, 1904. The agreed price was $345. At about the same time-plaintiff delivered to Mr. Ogden, the manager of said company, a motor boat belonging to him, known as a \u201cBloomstrom boat.\u201d No tender of delivery of the Truscott boat was made until toward the close-bf the boating season and about September 9, 1904. Plaintiff refused to accept the boat at that time, and no claim is made that he was bound to do sb. Thereafter plaintiff made a demand upon defendant to return to him his Bloomstrom boat. This demand was not complied' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>with, and thereupon this action was begun to recover from defendant the sum of $150 damages for conversion of the boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">It is unnecessary for us to decide whether White Craft &amp; Power \u25a0Company were the agents of defendant, so that it was bound by the -agreement made with Ogden. If such agency be conceded, and the \u25a0scope thereof, this action cannot be maintained. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence is contradictory. At one time he claimed that Ogden agreed to take Iiis boat for $150 in part payment of the Truscott boat, and at another time that he agreed to sell it on plaintiff\u2019s account for not less than that sum. There is no evidence that plaintiff\u2019s Bloomstrom boat ever came into the actual possession of defendant. There is a suggestion, in a letter put in evidence by plaintiff, that it had been sold by the White Craft &amp; Power Company. That is the only evidence as to what became of it after it was sent to the yard of said company. If the White Craft &amp; Power Company sold plaintiff\u2019s boat, as it appears that it did, this does not constitute.conversion; for that was the very thing which plaintiff requested it to do. If the proceeds of the sale \u25a0came into the hands of defendant, or even of its duly authorized agent, as the contract for the sale of the Truscott boat fell through, an action for money had and received on account of the purchase price might lie, or, perhaps, after proper demand, an action for the conversion of such moneys. This is not such an action. It is an action \u25a0for the conversion of the boat alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u25a0 The judgment of the Municipal Court, appealed from, must be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur, except HIRSCHBERG, P. J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
