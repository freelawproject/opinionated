The owners of the property seized thereafter brought an action against the sheriff, and recovered a judgment for the value of the same, which judgment was affirmed by this court, and its determination affirmed by the Court of Appeals. The judgment was thereafter paid by the surety on the sheriff\u2019s bond, the plaintiff in this action. On the 30th of February, 1906, this action was commenced by the service of the summons, to recover the amount paid. The complaint was served on the 20th of March, 1906, and an amended answer on the 15th of December following, and plaintiff was given by stipulation until the 4th of April, 1908, to serve an amended complaint. On the 19th of November, 1908, the present attorney was substituted for the plaintiff, and he, on the 24th of January, 1910, filed a note of issue and served notice of trial for the following February term. The notice was immediately returned, and shortly thereafter a motion was made to dismiss the action for want of prosecution. The motion resulted in the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">The amount paid by the plaintiff as surety upon the sheriff\u2019s bond was something like $8,000, and while its delay in bringing the action to trial is not very satisfactorily explained, nevertheless, in view of the fact that the note of issue had been filed and the case noticed for trial before the motion was made to dismiss, taken in connection with the other facts and circumstances, we think the action ought hot to have been dismissed, and an opportunity should be afforded to the plaintiff to try the same. This, however, should only be upon condition that the plaintiff pay to the defendant the taxable costs to date, and in addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>tion $10 costs and disbursements of this appeal, and stipulate to try the case when reached without further delay. Mladinich v. Livingston, 112 App. Div. 181, 98 N. Y. Supp. 46; Fisher Malting Co. v. Brown, 92 App. Div.. 251, 87 N. Y. Supp. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">If such conditions be complied with, then the order appealed from is reversed, and the motion to dismiss denied; otherwise,' the order is affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
