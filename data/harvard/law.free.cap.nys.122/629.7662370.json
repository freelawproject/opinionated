The court set aside the verdict as against the receivers and dismissed the complaint as to them. Judgment was entered upon the verdict against the city. The latter appeals from this judgment, and the plaintiff appeals from the order and judgment setting aside the verdict and dismissing-the complaint against the receivers of the railway company.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-23\">It must be said that the verdict rested largely upon conjecture. The deceased, a young man about 19 years of age, was a helper on. an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>express wagon. He undoubtedly fell from the rear of the wagon to the street receiving the injuries which resulted in his death. No one saw him fall, and no one saw him immediately before he fell. The-driver of the wagon, who sat upon a seat in front, had seen the deceased about five or six blocks .away from the point of the accident. Deceased was then sitting towards the rear of the wagon on a loose covered box which was carried in the wagon and in which small articles were sometimes put. The wagon was then coming up West Broadway, below West Third street. It droye up University Place to a point above Eighth street, when the driver. turned his wagon sharply, from the westerly or south-bound track, in which it - had been running, to the easterly or north-bound track. The evidence indicated that in executing this operation the wagon \u201cskidded,\u201d and one of the wheels struck one of the rails. The driver testifies that at or about this moment he felt the wagon jolt or jar as if one of the wheels had run into a hole. The negligence complained of is permitting this hole to remain in the roadway. The street was paved with asphalt, laid upon a stone pavement. There is evidence that there were a number of holes or depressions in the pavement between Eighth and Ninth streets, and extreme discrepancies between the estimates of the different witnesses as to the depth of these holes. No one can positively identify the particular hole which caused the jolt of the wagon, and it is evident that some of the worst holes testified to could not have been the one which the driver attempts to identify as that into- which his wheel sank. The hole into which he thinks that the wagon wheel went the driver locates between the rails of the \u00abeasterly or north-bound track and estimates as being about two feet wide and one foot long. At one time he fixes its depth at five or six inches, and later on says that he saw no hole deeper than four inches. The evidence on the part of the defendant was that the street had been thoroughly repaired less than a month before the accident, and that there were no holes in the pavement at the time of, or immediately before, the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">\u25a0 It is quite evident that, in order to fasten responsibility upon the defendants, or either of them, because they permitted a hole to remain in the pavement, it is necessary to identify and describe with a reasonable degree of certainty the particular hole which caused the accident. Until so identified and described, it is impossible to say that it was of a character to produce the accident or to sustain a charge of negligence. Carson v. Village of Dresden, 129 App. Div. 728, 113 N. Y. Supp. 959. Especially is this true where, as in the present case, the evidence indicates another possible cause of the accident in the \u201cskidding\u201d of the wheels. To recover, the plaintiff must establish a cause of action by a preponderance of evidence, and she is not relieved of this burden, and entitled to cast the burden of proving a negative upon defendants, merely because accurate evidence of the manner and cause of the accident is not available. We cannot say upon the present record that the plaintiff maintained the burden which the law casts upon her. Upon the evidence the complaint was rightly dismissed as against the receivers of the railroad company.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The judgment in so far as appealed from by plaintiff is affirmed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>with costs. Upon the appeal of the city of New York the judgment and order appealed from are reversed, and a new trial granted, with \u25a0costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
