The payment of $3,000 annually for their lives to the testator\u2019s two daughters, a? directed in paragraph fifth, must be considered as upon a trust, separate and distinct from the trust provision for their benefit in paragraph seventh. The fifth paragraph does not relate, nor is it restricted, to income in the hands of the trustees during the 15-year period (provided for in paragraph sixth), and the powers of the trustees were not, necessarily, to come to an end under paragraph fifth when that period terminated. At that time paragraph seventh was to take effect, and, while a trust fund was to be set apart for the daughters sufficient to yield this same amount of income, there is no clear and reasonable indication that the payment for their \u201cnatural lives,\u201d in paragraph fifth, was intended as a mere temporary provision for 15 years. Since the persons who were to take the residue under the eighth paragraph, after the 15-year period, were such members of a designated class \u201cas may be then living,\u201d this residuary provision cannot be carried into effect by accelerating the bequest, for there was no present gift and no vesting of an estate in the residuary legatees, postponed merely as to the time of enjoyment. The persons to take were those who might fulfill the condition of survivorship, no remainders were to vest within the period of suspension allowed by law, and the gift itself is so dependent upon the void trust, with the attendant postponement for 15 years, that it cannot he given effect, if any regard be had to the testator\u2019s actual intention. Fargo v. Squiers, 154 N. Y. 250, 260, 48 N. E. 509: The trust estate for the two daughters, under paragraph 7, may properly b\u00e9 brought into existence by resort to the doctrine of acceleration (Kalish v. Kalish, 166 N. Y. 368, 59 N. E. 917), and the trustees have duties to perform with respect to the collection of income and the payments to these daughters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>of the annual sum of $3,000 for their lives, under paragraph fifth. In other respects the fifth paragraph does not operate to create a trust or to effect an equitable conversion. So. far as sales may be necessary to carry the trust provision for the daughters into effect, the trustees are undoubtedly possessed of a power of sale, according to the express words of the will; but there is no imperative direction to sell, and no apparent purpose is indicated' which would necessitate a sale, of all the real estate for the purposes of distribution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-5\">My conclusion is that the residuary estate is charged with the two trusts above referred to, for each of the testator\u2019s daughters, and that beyond this, as to the residuary estate, there was intestacy. Form of decision and judgment may be presented accordingly on notice of settlement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b506-6\">Argued before INGRAHAM, P.
