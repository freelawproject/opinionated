These facts are substantially undisputed; -the respondent\u2019s contention being that, after he had received this sum of $500, he was informed by Forbes that he and Thomson had settled the matter, and that Forbes directed the respondent to deliver the money to Thomson.. It was conceded that Thomson owned no property, and. the whole scheme was a very palpable device to swindle Forbes, in which the respondent seems to have been an active participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">We entirely agree with the referee that it was gross professional misconduct for the respondent, having received this money as trustee to be held for a specific purpose, to appropriate it to his own use, and that his alleged subsequent authority from Forbes to pay the money to Thomson without compliance with the terms of the trust upon which it was deposited with him is not even plausible. The respondent would not have been justified in paying the money to Thomson without.some express authority from Forbes, or the return of the receipt specifying the terms upon which the money was deposited. Assuming that he paid some part of this money to Thomson, he does not pretend that he paid it all. When the conditions upon which the money had been deposited with him had not been performed, this payment was of itself an express violation of the agreement under which he had received, it. Considering the whole testimony, we are entirely satisfied with the report of the referee, and constrained to the conclusion that the respondent is an entirely unfit person to remain a member of the profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">The application is therefore granted, and the respondent disbarred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
