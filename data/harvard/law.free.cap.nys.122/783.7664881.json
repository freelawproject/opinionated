St. Rep. 556, supra, the plaintiff asked of the defendant\u2019s physician on shipboard for five grains of quinine and was given calomel instead, which dose she took with serious results. She brought her action alleging that she relied upon the physician to give what she ordered and did not charge the defendant with negligence, and recovered. The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment'of affirmance, and, after reviewing the authorities determining the form of the action or nature of the responsibility of the defendant in actions of this kind, summed'up its conclusion in this language :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-5\">\u201cThe rule of liability applicable to a druggist in cases of this character is the same as .that which governs the liability of professional persons whose work requires special knowledge or skill, and a person is not legally responsible for any unintentional consequential injury resulting from a lawful act when the failure to exercise due and proper care cannot be imputed to him, and the burden of proving such lack of care, when the act is lawful, is upon the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The plaintiff claims he was entitled, in any event, to recover the sum he paid for the tablets, and the price stated on the label is 25 cents. That item is not made one of the charges in the complaint. The action is to recover substantial \u201e damages, and a new trial will not be ordered to enable the plaintiff to recover nominal damages and which are a mere incident to the chief claim. La Rue v.
