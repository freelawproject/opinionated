Donnelly, deceased, appeals from an order of the Surrogate\u2019s Court of Kings county, which directed that letters testamentary issue to the respondent as executrix under the will of the testatrix., The record does not show the contents of the will, or who was entitled to take thereunder. It appears, however, that after a contest the will was admitted to probate, and from the decree accordingly entered Elizabeth McGowan has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-22\">Upon the application for letters it appeared that the appellant took possession of the decedent\u2019s property upon her death, and now retains it; that the petitioner did not know the value of the estate, and desired an accounting and possession of the property of her testatrix. The affidavit of the appellant states that the estate consisted of money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>in several savings banks, stock of the Ninth Avenue Railroad Company, jewelry, and household furniture. It also alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">\u201cThat said Lizzie Riede\u2019s circumstances are such that they do not afford' adequate security to the creditors or persons interested in said estate. * * * Deponent further says that said Lizzie Riede is a person of absolutely no financial responsibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">These allegations are both conclusions, and no facts are alleged to-sustain them. Mrs. Riede\u2019s character, honesty, thrift, integrity, and business capacity were not challenged, and there is only the suggestion of financial irresponsibility. The absence of worldly wealth is-not of itself a controlling ground for denying letters. The intention to appeal, or appeal itself, did not deprive the surrogate of the power to issue letters. Section 2582 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">\u201cAn appeal from a decree of a surrogate, admitting a will to probate, * * * does not stay the issuing of letters, where, in the opinion of the surrogate, manifested by an order, the preservation of the estate requires that the letters should issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">It follows, therefore, that the order of the Surrogate\u2019s Court must be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
