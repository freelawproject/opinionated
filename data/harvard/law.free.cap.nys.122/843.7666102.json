The complaint and the affidavit upon which the order was obtained have two \u25a0characteristics in common\u2014length and irrelevancy. However, the complaint does contain at least one averment of a false representation, and doubtless upon a proper affidavit the plaintiff would be entitled to an examination of the defendant to obtain testimony to use upon the trial for the purpose of proving the falsity of that representation. But the affidavit does not state that that is the purpose of the examination or that the plaintiff intends to use the testimony obtained by the examination upon the trial. On the contrary, it expressly stated that the purpose of the examination is to enable the plaintiff \u201cto prepare * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b867-15\">for trial,\u201d that the examination is necessary \u201cfor the plaintiff\u2019s preparation for the trial of this action,\u201d and the number of irrelevant statements contained in the affidavit at least suggest a possible desire on the part of the plaintiff to harrass and annoy the defendant. The rules, governing applications of this kind have so frequently been stated by this court that the further statement of them ought to be unnecessary. The moving papers must show that the party applying for the examination intends to use the evidence obtained upon the trial \u25a0of the action. Bock v. Bock, 130 App. Div. <em>229, </em>114 N. Y. Supp. 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-16\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
