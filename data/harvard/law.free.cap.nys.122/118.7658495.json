The complaint alleged that on May 26, 1907, Mary Gray was lawfully passing along the sidewalk in front of the premises, and while so doing her foot and leg were caused to go into an opening of a partly uncovered coal hole, and thereby said deceased received severe injuries, which thereafter, on the 2d day of June, 1907, caused her death. The complaint alleges negligence, and also \u201cand in causing, permitting or allowing said hole or opening in the said sidewalk to be and remain a nuisance.\u201d At the close of the testimony, counsel for the city asked that the plaintiff be instructed to elect whether or not he is suing for a nuisance or a negligence, whereupon counsel for the plaintiff stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">\u201cI will elect on the ground that it is a nuisance.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">The court charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-12\">\u201cThe incident which the plaintiff claims herein was a wrongful act on the part of the city is that there was an open coal hole in the sidewalk of the property owned, not by a private person, but toy the city itself, and the law upon which the plaintiff relies now is that the public are entitled to unobstructed passage upon the streets, including the sidewalks, of the city, and that in such case it is not necessary to prove negligence. The persons walking on a public street, exercising the ordinary care of persons in walking, have a justifiable expectation that the streets there are as safe as otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">It appeared that on election night in November, 1906, this building, being unoccupied, was wrecked by boys to a considerable extent, and, among other things, the coal hole cover was stolen. The city\u2019s proof was that a flagstone was placed over the coal hole; but the main defense is that the woman did not fall into the hole at all. It is conceded that she fell in the street, that she broke her leg, that septicaemia developed, and that she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">The only witness claiming to have seen the accident was Mary E. Daggett, who testified that on the 26th of May, 1907, she resided at No. 254 West Houston street and had lived there about three years. She testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-15\">\u201cI saw an accident on the sidewalk of West Houston street on Sunday morning, the 26th of May, 1907, around 8 o\u2019clock. * * * I saw a woman go down in the hole in front of her. I never saw the woman in my life before. I was behind her at that time. * * * I saw her go down in the hole, and I went to help lfft her out. The hole was in the sidewalk, a coal hole. * * * There was no cover over the hole of any kind, nothing at all. * * * After I saw the woman go in the hole I lifted her out. There was a gentleman had a room off me, and he was right behind me, and I could not lift her alone, and I gave her assistance, and I took her as far as the corner of Varick street into the baker\u2019s, and I left her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Cross-examination: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">\u201cI do not know who the woman was who fell in that hole that I saw. I don\u2019t know to this day who that woman was. * * * Somebody was with me or close to me when I saw this accident, right behind me, a man by the name of Tom McCarty who had a furnished room off of me. I did make a statement, .but there was a man behind me. I couldn\u2019t lift her out of the hole alone. I made a statement that nobody was around to that gentleman, there (Mr. Sullivan). I did swear to that statement that there was nobody around me at all. * * * When I helped her out of the hole, I took her to the corner of Varick and Houston and left her. Varick is one block west of Houston street. * * * McCarty was with me at that time. It was after she got out of the hole that he helped me. She limped very lame. She went as far as Varick street, that 'is, only half a block, with the assistance of myself and some one else. * * * I left her at the corner of Varick and Houston, at the 'bakery shop. I didn\u2019t know where she went after I left her, I didn\u2019t ask her. I left her there. * * * I left her sitting right at the corner, nobody but herself. I went about my business, and I don\u2019t know where McCarty went. * *\u2022 * I left her standing at the comer, and that is all I know. I don\u2019t know how far she had walked from where she was hurt. It was in the middle of the block where she went into the coal hole. I was not at all interested in a stranger. She was a very heavy woman. I left McCarty there. He didn\u2019t go with me. He helped me lift her out of the hole. I don\u2019t know where she did go. I did not asir the woman at any time where she lived or where she was going or where she wanted to go. I said, \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 And she said, T am going to the corner.\u2019 I said, \u2018All right, I will help you.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Are you all right now?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 When I last saw her she was standing and nobody with her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">William Lynch testified that he knew Mrs\u2019 Gray, and in May lived at the same number she did, 559 Greenwich.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">\u201cI saw Mrs. Gray on Sunday morning, May 26, 1907. She said she was going to the baker\u2019s, Varick and Houston streets. * * * I saw her again in about three-quarters of an hour. Then she was up at Hudson and Houston streets. She couldn\u2019t go any further. She was injured. She sent a little boy with me, and then I went out with this gentleman up here. I found that the woman was hurt. I carried her home until we got down in front of the door, and then we put her in a chair and carried her up on the second floor, and the bone of the left leg was shot out about that long.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-11\">\u201cI saw this woman on Hudson street when she was injured. I am pretty sure it was not on Varick street; I am positive, yes. When I saw her, Mr. Seitter was there. Mr. Seitter and myself assisted her to her residence. Hudson street was torn up at the time, and so was Houston street. * * * Where I have made an X right near the curb on Hudson and Houston is where I saw her, in front of the butcher\u2019s shop. She was seated at the' time I saw her. She couldn\u2019t go any further. * * * Right near that door there, she was sitting down on the sidewalk, right up against the edge of that window. There were 8 or 10 people there. * * * Hudson street at the time was torn up on the west side. That was the side of the street which I found Mrs. Gray on. At the time that I found her she was distant about a block and a half. She was seated about 10 feet from the opening. * * * I saw her with the bone protruding from the left leg. * * * Varick street * * * is one block to the east of Hudson. She couldn\u2019t walk. She couldn\u2019t get up. We had to lift her up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">. Dr. O\u2019Mara, for the plaintiff, testified that he saw her on Sunday morning, the 26th of May.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-13\">\u201cI found a compound fracture of both bones of the leg, the left leg. I believe it was one of the bones in communication with the outside world. I treated her, I think it was, for two days until she went to the hospital.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">\u201cI did examine the nature of the fracture. * * * The bone was protruding ; that is, the tibia. * * * I don\u2019t think she could walk any distance with that. She could not walk half a block with it. I cannot say what a person\u2019s capability of suffering pain is, but my impression is that she could not walk at all. I did ask this woman what happened to her when she met with the injury. I wanted to know how she got hurt. She said that she fell on the street; I think she said Hudson street. * * * My recollection is she told me when I examined her on Sunday morning that she had fallen on Hudson street. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Redirect examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">\u201cQ. May she have said Houston street? A. Well, she might have; I won\u2019t swear to it, but my best recollection is that she said Hudson street.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">John Gray, the plaintiff, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-10\">\u201cI found Mrs. Daggett, the lady that was on the stand this morning. I never knew the woman before.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">For the defense a civil engineer testified that the length of the block between Hudson and Varick streets on the north side is 401 feet. The distance from No. 258 Houston to the corner of Hudson street is* 149 feet 6 inches, and to the comer of Varick street is 251 feet 6 inches. The width of Hudson street is 89 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">William Ryan, a policeman, testified he called at the house of Mrs. Gray on the 28th of May with Officer Dwyer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-13\">\u201cShe told me that while she was crossing Hudson street and Houston she stepped on a round stone and fell to the sidewalk. She said she was crossing Hudson street and Houston. When she made that statement, Officer Dwyer, and I think it was her daughter, were present. The young woman who is. in court with the black hat I think is her daughter. She was present when her mother stated that she had fallen crossing Hudson street. Hudson street was torn up at that time. * * * At the time I wrote down what she told me as to how the accident happened in a book. I have got the book. (Witness produced the book.) Q. Is this a memorandum made at the time? A. At the time. I did make a report at the station house that day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">The plaintiff did not offer this memorandum from the book or examine about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-15\">Dwyer testified that he was present at this conversation. This was when the ambulance was called to take Mrs. Gray to the hospital from her house' upon the advice of the doctor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-16\">\u201cThe officer asked the lady her pedigree, her name, and so forth, and also inquired how she received the accident, and she stated that Sunday morning she stepped on a stone at Hudson and Houston streets and turned on her ankle. There was a young lady present in the apartment. I think that is the young woman who is in court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-17\">Gustave Seitter testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-18\">\u201cI remember in assisting to carry Mrs. Gray home on the day she met with the accident. I found her at the corner of Houston and Hudson. I was there when the witness Lynch came there. She was sitting right in the doorway of the butcher shop. * * * She did not say anything as to what caused her to fall. * * * She could not walk at that time. The witness Lynch and myself assisted her to her home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-19\">Winifred Dwyer, her daughter, testified that after she had heard of her mother\u2019s injury she called at the house.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>\u201cI said, 'What happened to you?\u2019 She said, T fell.\u2019 Q. Did she tell you where? A. No, she didn\u2019t tell me where. Q. Haven\u2019t you at some time or other stated where? A. No, sir; a man came to my house about a couple of weeks ago. A man came to my house on the 5th of August, 1907. Q. And then didn\u2019t you state that your mother said that she fell on Hudson street? A. Yes, sir. By Mr. Cropsey: Did you so state? A. No, sir. By Mr. Collins: Q. But you said that she so stated, didn\u2019t you? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Dr. Wadhams, the ambulance surgeon, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">\u201cI did have a talk with the deceased as to how the accident occurred. Q. Were there other persons present at the time when you asked her? A. There were. Q. Who? A. I think there were two police officers and the patient\u2019s daughter. Q. Did the patient in their presence tell you what caused her injuries? (That was objected to under sections 834 and 836 of the Code, and sustained.) Q. Did she tell you that she tripped on a cobble stone at Hudson street and Houston street? (Excluded.) Q. Did she state to you in the presence of those persons what caused the accident? (Excluded.) Q. Were you her attending physician? (Excluded.) Q. In what capacity were you called in to attend, if at all, on this woman? (Excluded.) Q. At whose request did you call at this house? A. At the request of some one in authority at the hospital, but I could not say. Q. Was it in response to a call for an ambulance? A. It was. I don\u2019t think it possible for this woman to walk, in my opinion, in the condition in which I had found her. She had her leg all in splints and everything of that kind when I saw her. Even taking the splints off it was not possible for her to walk. I know the nature and extent of that woman\u2019s fracture.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The evidence of this witness of decedent\u2019s statements of where and how the accident occurred was competent, and it was error to exclude it. Griffiths v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 171 N. Y. 106, 63 N. E. 808; Green v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 171 N. Y. 201, 63 N. E. 958, 89 Am. St. Rep. 807; Benjamin v. Village of Tupper Lake, 110 App. Div. 426, 97 N. Y. Supp. 512; Travis v. Haan, 119 App. Div. 139, 103 N. Y. Supp. 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The court charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">\u201cBefore making a remark about the evidence, the court reminds you that there is no evidence in this case that there was any negligent condition of the highway existing at Hudson and Houston streets on the day of the accident, and that you are not at liberty to conclude in this case that there was any such defective condition at Hudson and Houston streets for which the defendant may be held liable in this case, and, if you believe that the accident happened at Hudson and Houston, streets, the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">So that the case was submitted solely upon the doctrine of nuisance for the maintenance by the city of an unprotected coal hole in the sidewalk in front of its own property, No. 258 West Houston street. I eliminate from consideration a large amount of evidence tending to show that this coal hole was covered with a flagstone, also that the evidence is extremely unsatisfactory and almost negligible that the flagstone was off at the time, or at any time reasonably proximate to the date of the injury. Looking solely for proof of the locus in quo of the accident, assuming the coal hole to have been unprotected, the only evidence, is that of Mrs. Daggett, who testified that she saw a woman whom she had never seen before, whose name she did not know, and whom she does not now know, go down in the hole on the morning of May 26th, that she and McCarty pulled her out, that she helped her to walk to the bakery shop on the corner of Varick street, and that there she left her; the woman then saying that she was all right. McCarty is not produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>On the other hand, the decedent had a compound fracture of both bones of her leg, which, according to the medical testimony, prevented her from walking. She is found sitting in front of a butcher shop at the corner of Hudson and Houston streets with her bone protruding. It was impossible for her in her condition to have walked that far from the alleged scene of the accident. Prom. Hudson and Houston she was carried by Lynch and Seitter to her home. She said to various witnesses that she had fallen in Hudson street. Her attending physician and two policemen who saw her two days after the accident so testified. Her daughter had said that she had fallen in Hudson street. It is clear that the woman that Mrs. Daggett says she saw fall in the coal hole is not identified as the decedent. The plaintiff has not sustained the cause of action set up in the complaint and submitted to the jury. The verdict was against the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
