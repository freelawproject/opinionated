The plaintiff was injured while a passenger on one of the defendant\u2019s cars. The complaint simply alleges that, through the negligence of the defendant, plaintiff was violently thrown and precipitated from the car. The specific act of negligence is not pointed out. On direct examination the plaintiff testified that when on Marcy avenue\u2014 ,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-8\">\"about half a block from Stockton street, I told the conductor to stop the car; that I wanted to get off at Stocktori street. He gave the bell to the motorman to stop the car, and the car was slowing up, and I came out on the back platform, and he went inside, and he gave two bells again in quick succession, and thrown me right off the car.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">On his direct examination he stated no cause for being thrown from the car except the ringing of the bells. On his cross-examination, in referring to the ringing of the two bells, he says, \u201cThat is what thrown me off\u2014the jerk\u201d\u2014whether of the bells or the car does not then clearly appear. -The witness Johnson, however, testified to enough to make the plaintiff\u2019s case. He says: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-10\">\u201cI heard two bells, and the car started up on a jerk, and the man got thrown off on the side of his face.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">The defendant\u2019s conductor says that the car stopped at Floyd street (which is the street before Stockton street), and that he did not give two bells after the car was in the center of the block; but from that point the plaintiff was on the step, and although he was cautioning him to wait until the car stopped, and had his hand on his shoulder,, as the car approached the near side of Stockton street, and while it was still in motion, he swung out, and the conductor lost his hold on him, and he fell. He says the car did not start up with a jerk. The motorman says that in the middle of the block he got one bell and began to slow down, the proper place to stop being on the far corner of Stockton street, and that he did not start up again. He came to a full stop at the far side of Stockton street, and then found out that the accident had already happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">The defendant requested the court to charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-13\">\"If the jury believe that the accident happened in the way as testified by defendant\u2019s witnesses, they must find for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">This was refused, and the defendant excepted. This was a proper request, because, if the accident happened in the way testified to by the defendant\u2019s witnesses, there was no possible inference of negligence on the part of the defendant to be drawn. The court had not covered the question in his main charge. He had generally told them that the plaintiff must show that the accident happened through the negligence of the defendant; but he had not in express terms told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>them that\" there was no negligence on the part of the defendant, unless it resulted from suddenly starting the car forward. The defendant\u2019s witnesses testified positively that it had not been done. The defect in this charge was, not alone that the court did not specifically say that no recovery could be had if the jury found the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence, but that the court did not charge them specifically as to the absence of the defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">\u2022 The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur, except HIRSCHBERG, P. J.,' who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
