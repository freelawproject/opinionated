Trial by jury was waived. Defendant\u2019s possession of the premises in question is admitted. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel offered in evidence a deed dated March 1, 1856, and recorded March 4, 1856, made by Frederick Grote and wife and Henry E. Baack and wife to Matilda Becker, purporting to convey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>said premises. He followed this with other deeds of conveyance in an unbroken chain until 1859. The last of these was made by Stille Manning to Charles L- Aubuchon. This deed was dated October 1, 1859, and was recorded on October 22d in the same year. Seasonable objection was taken to the admission of each of these deeds, and defendant excepted to the decision of the court overruling such objection. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel then offered in evidence the petition, proceedings, and decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court of New York county, filed November 6, 1908, in the matter of the application of James G. Coburn for the probate of the heirship of Charles L. Aubuchon, deceased. Defendant was not a party to these proceedings and does not appear to have had notice thereof. Defendant\u2019s counsel, making no objection to the regularity or sufficiency of the proceedings, objected to them as immaterial, irrelevant, and incompetent as against the defendant. The objection was overruled and an exception taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\">From this decree it appears that Charles L. Aubuchon died at Iron Mountain, St. Francis county, Mo., in the year 1866, and that he left as his only heirs at law two sons, Charles L- Aubuchon and William N. Aubuchon, each of whom resides in St. Louis. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel then' offered in evidence two deeds, one made by Charles L. Aubuchon and wife, dated July 31, 1905, and recorded August 25, 1905, and one made by William N. Aubuchon and wife, dated September 21, 1905, and recorded December 7th in the same- year. James G. Coburn was the grantee named in each of said deeds. The complaint alleged, and the answer admitted, that at the time of these conveyances the premises were in the actual possession of the defendant, who held, or claimed to hold, the same adversely. In accordance with the provisions of section 1501 of the Code of Civil Procedure this action was brought by .Coburn in the name of his grantors. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel then offered in evidence two judgment rolls in actions brought in the Supreme Court by Aaron Peck, Jr., against Charles- L. Aubuchon, to foreclose mortgages upon property situated in Kings county. From these it appears that at that time the said Charles L. Aubuchon was not a resident of the state of New York. It also appears from the judgment rolls and admissions made by defendant\u2019s counsel that service of the summons and complaint in each of said actions was made on him by publication; that there was a deficiency upon the sale for which judgment was entered; that executions were issued upon said judgment; and that the premises in question were sold thereunder. From the sheriff\u2019s deed offered in evidence it appears that these judgments were entered October 9, 1860, the executions issued November 15, 1860, and the premises sold to Charles A. Nicols, January 26, 1861. The sheriff\u2019s certificate of sale was assigned by various mesne assignments to Aaron Peck, who, on July 28, 1868, obtained a deed of said premises. It does not appear that the defendant claims under the said Peck or under any other person named in plaintiffs\u2019 chain of title. . Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel then offered evidence as to the value of the premises in question and rested. A motion by defendant to dismiss the complaint, upon the ground that plaintiffs had not proven their case, that they had not proven th,at they were ever in possession of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>property, or that they had legal title to the same, was denied. Defendant rested without introducing any evidence, and the court thereupon \u25a0directed judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, from which judgment this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">We think defendant\u2019s motion should have been granted. In an action of ejectment it is not enough to prove a paper title to the disputed premises unless that title is traced back either to the sovereign or to some one admitted or proved to have been a common source of the title claimed by both plaintiff and defendant. In other cases, in addition to the paper title, possession must be proved in some one through whom plaintiff claims. 15 Cyc. 39; Miller v. Long Island Railroad Co., 71 N. Y. 380; Greenleaf v. Brooklyn, Flatbush &amp; C. I. R. R. Co., 132 N. Y. 408, 30 N. E. 762; s. c. 141 N. Y. 395, 36 N. E. 393; Roberts v. Baumgarten, 110 N. Y. 380, 18 N. E. 96; N. Y. Central &amp; H. R. R. R. Co. v. Brennan, 12 App. Div. 103, 42 N. Y. Supp. 529. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel invokes the aid of section 368 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which relates to the statute of limitations. But the \u201clegal title\u201d there referred to, which in the first instance possession is presumed to follow, is something more than a paper title. It is such a title as, undisputed, would sustain an action of ejectment within the rule above stated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">\u201cWhere a party is under the necessity of proving title, it is not enough to ;simply produce a deed; he must show possession in the grantor, or possession accompanying the deed; without this, he proves no title. But when, as matter of law and fact, it is found or conceded that a party named has title, that is sufficient\u2014his possession is presumed\u2014and the occupation by any other person is presumed to be in subordination to the legal title, unless it appear that the premises have been held adversely to such legal title for twenty years \"before suit brought. Code, \u00a7 81.\u201d Stevens v. Hauser, 39 N. Y. 302.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The learned counsel also claims the benefit of section 2657 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that in proceedings for the probate of heirship the decree or the record thereof is \u201cpresumptive \u2022evidence of the facts so declared to be established thereby.\u201d But the basis of the surrogate\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain such a proceeding is that a person dies intestate \u201cseised in fee of real property within the state.\u201d Code Civ. Proc. \"\u00a7 2654. And the facts which the decree \u2022may establish presumptively are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">\u201cThe fact of the decedent\u2019s death; the place of his residence at the time \u2022of his death; his intestacy, either generally, or as to the real property in \u25a0question; the number of heirs entitled to inherit the property in question; the name, age, residence, and relationship to the decedent, of each; \"and the interest or share of each in the property.\u201d Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2656.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The Surrogate\u2019s Court does not pretend in these proceedings to adjudicate upon the question of the title to real property. In ejectment plaintiff must recover, if at all, upon the strength of his own title, .and not because of the weakness or want of title in defendant. Roberts v. Baumgarten, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ..granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
