Mr. Bushby and the defendant Dusenberry were the executors named in the will of Mrs. Choate. The plaintiff claims that he was retained by said executors as attorney to render services to them in and about the probating of said will, and in and about the administration of the estate of Mrs. Choate, and in and about matters connected therewith; that he performed all the terms and conditions to be performed under said contract of retainer, and at the special instance and request of the defendants rendered them services of the reasonable value of $4,000, which, although duly demanded, has not been paid. Upon the trial the plaintiff testified to his retainer, and to the services rendered, and to the value thereof. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, the record is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-16\">\u201cThe Court: . The court dismisses the complaint, on the ground that the cause of action is in Bushby &amp; Berkeley, and not in the plaintiff alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-17\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Counsel: I take an exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-18\">\u201cThe Court: The complaint is dismissed, th\u00e9 plaintiff excepts, and the exceptions are to be heard in the first instance at the Appellate Division. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-19\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Counsel: I except to your honor\u2019s dismissal, and I ask to go to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>the jury on the questions of fact presented by the plaintiff, as against both of the defendants and each of the defendants separately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-5\">\u201cMotion denied. Exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">We think this action of the learned trial court cannot be sustained. A prima facie case of employment of the plaintiff and services rendered by him under such employment had been made out. A question of fact was presented, which made the dismissal of the complaint, when that action was taken and upon the ground stated, improper. In Parker v. Day, 155 N. Y. 383, 49 N. E. 1046, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-7\">\u201cThere can be no doubt that an individual may employ his copartner to do work for him outside of and independent of the copartnership, and become personally liable therefor. The question is as to whether there was such an employment of the plaintiff in this case. In determining that question, the fact that the parties were copartners properly entered into the consideration of the trial court; but it was not conclusive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">So in this case one of the executors, at least, was not a partner of the plaintiff, and whatever the relations of Bushby to the estate, and however he might have been prevented from himself receiving compensation for legal services rendered to it, the plaintiff would not, as matter of law, be prohibited from accepting the retainer testified to and receiving proper pay for services rendered thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">The exceptions are sustained, and motion for a new trial granted, with costs to the plaintiff to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
