The judgment was entered upon motion of the defendants at the opening of the case, and decided upon the sole ground that the description in the memorandum was insufficient. The memorandum was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-19\">\u201cMoriches, March 17, 1906.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-20\">\u201cReceived from P. H. Morrison the sum of one hundred dollars, as deposit on sale of place at Moriches, on the north side of old county road, being about 25 acres, including buildings. The purchase price is $1,500, to be paid as follows: One hundred dollars on signing this agreement, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged. Ten hundred dollars to be paid on delivery of deed on October 1, 1906. Balance, $400, to remain on bond and mortgage at 5 per cent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-21\">\u201cAmelia Brenmohl.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-22\">\u201cJul. Wm. Brenmohl.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-23\">We may construe the words used as relating to realty owned by the subscribers at the time of their subscription. Hurley v. Brown, 98 Mass. 545, 96 Am. Dec. 671, cited in Miller v. Tuck, 95 App. Div. 137, 88 N. Y. Supp. 495; Scanlan v. Geddes, 112 Mass. 15. I think that parol evidence was admissible to enable the court to identify the specific realty covered by this memorandum. For the plaintiff might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>have shown that the said defendants owned only one place in or at Moriches, on the north side of the old county road, of about 25 acres, with- buildings thereon. In Mead v. Parker, 115 Mass. 415, 15 Am. Rep. 110, the court say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">\u201cIt is not a question of the sufficiency of the writing under the statute of frauds, so much as it is of the right to resort to parol evidence in aid of the writing, where an ambiguity exists in respect, to the property intended to be sold, or to which the contract relates. The most' specific and precise description of the property intended requires some parol proof to complete its identification. A more general description requires more. When all the circumstances of possession, ownership, situation of the parties, and \"of their relation to each other and to the property, as they were when the negotiations took place and the writing was made, are disclosed, if the meaning and application of the writing, read in the light of those circumstances, are certain and plain, the parties will be bound by it as a sufficient written contract or' memorandum of their \"agreement. That parol evidence is competent to furnish these means of interpreting and applying written agreements is settled by the uniform current of authorities. Baker v. Hathaway, 5 Allen [Mass.] 103; Farwell v. Mather, 10 Allen [Mass.] 322 [87 Am. Dec. 641]; Putnam v. Bond, 100 Mass. 58; Stoops v. Smith, 100 Mass. 63 [1 Am. Rep. 85, 97 Am. Dec. 76], and cases there cited; 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7\u00a7 286, 288.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The rule as to the admission of parol evidence that must obtain in this case is most elaborately discussed by Bartlett, J., writing for the court, in Miller v. Tuck, supra. See, too, Levin v. Dietz, 106 App. Div. 208, 94 N. Y. Supp. 419; Daniels v. Rogers, 108 App. Div. 338, 96 N. Y. Supp. 642; Wood on Statute of Frauds, 353; Scanlan v. Geddes, supra; Phillips v. Hooker, 1 Phil. Eq. (N. C.) 193; Owen v. Thomas, 3 M. &amp; K. 353; McMurray v. Spicer (L. R. 5 Eq. 527); Pomeroy\u2019s Specific Performance of Contracts, \u00a7 90, note 2. In Daniels v. Rogers, supra, the description was \u201cthe property known as the Star and Crescent Furnace, in Cherokee county, near Rusk, Tex.\u201d In Mead v. Parker, supra, the description was \u201ca house on Church street.\u201d In Phillips v. Hooker, supra, \u201cher house and lot north of Kinston.\u201d In Owen v. Thomas, supra, \u201cthe house in Newport.\u201d In McMurray v. Spicer, supra, \u201cthe mill property, including cottages in Esher village.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">A reading of the memorandum shows that the price is definitely stated, with the exception that the time of payment of the mortgage, a part only of the consideration, is not defined. I am inclined to the opinion that parol evidence would be admissible to show the period of the proposed mortgage. See Pomeroy\u2019s Specific Performance, \u00a7 93. But in any event a mortgage may be made without specification of the time of payment, whereupon the debt is payable on demand. Jones on Mortgages, \u00a7 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The judgment is reversed and a new trial is granted; costs to abide the final award of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
