McEvily by deed containing a covenant that the party of the second part, her heirs, grantees, and assigns, would not erect or permit to be erected on said lots on Fifty-Seventh street any building except first-class dwelling houses. The plaintiff by mesne conveyances is the owner in fee of the premises No. 249 East Fifty-Seventh street, 16 feet 8 inches in width by 100 feet 5 inches in depth; and the defendant by mesne conveyances is the owner in fee of the premises Nos. 233-241 East Fifty-Seventh street, 73 feet in width by 100 feet 5 inches in depth. The properties owned by both plaintiff and defendant are part of the property conveyed by Vanderpool to McEvily.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-18\">The defendant has filed plans in the tenement house and building departments of the city of New York for the erection of a six-story elevator apartment house upon his premises above described. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>proposed building is to contain six apartments on a floor, to be of superior construction, with telephone service, at a proposed rental of about $10 per room, and is to be erected at an estimated cost of $75,000. The front is to be of light brick and limestone. The plans show a handsome and attractive building. On the north side of Fifty-Seventh street, on this block, there is a bank building, twelve-common tenement houses, a throat and nose hospital, a caf\u00e9, one-vacant private dwelling house, a boarding house, and a sanitarium. The plaintiff\u2019s property is a three-story private dwelling house, the first two floors of which are used for business -purposes. On the south side of Fifty-Seventh street there is a schoolhouse and nine-common, ordinary, five-story tenement houses. The plaintiff demands judgment restraining the defendant from erecting or constructing upon his premises the said six-story elevator apartment house heretofore described.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">This court held in Holt v. Fleischman, 75 App. Div. 593, 78 N. Y.. Supp. 647, that the erection of an apartment house was not a violation of a covenant to erect a first-class dwelling -house. We think\" the proposed building, as shown by description and plans, does not violate the restrictive covenant relied upon, and that, if it did, the-character of the street has so changed that equity will not enforce the-covenant by injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">It follows, therefore, that judgment should be entered for the-defendant, denying the plaintiff\u2019s demand for a permanent injunction* with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
