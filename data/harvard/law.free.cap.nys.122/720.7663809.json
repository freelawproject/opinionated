In the special proceeding (Matter of Robinson, Deceased), in which the beneficiary seeks to compel the trustee to account, and which is before this court on appeal from an order granting a motion for an accounting, these persons are not parties, and in that proceeding there can.be no decree which would bind all tbe parties having or claiming an interest in the fund. These persons to whom it is alleged assignments have been made would each have a right to call the trustee to account, and it is proper that the accounting should be had in one action where they are all parties. As any party to the action can require that it be prosecuted, there seems to be no reason why the independent petition, which involves only the right of the petitioner and the questions between him and the trustee, should be proceeded with; but the accounting should be had in the action in which all persons interested in the fund are parties, and an order entered staying the special proceedings until final judgment is entered in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">The order appealed from should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
