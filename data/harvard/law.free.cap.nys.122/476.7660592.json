The defendant has offered to give a bond to pay the judgment if the judgment should be affirmed. Whether or not this case .is appealable without such a certificate is a question that should not be decided by this court, but is for the court to which the appeal is to be taken, and we express no opinion upon that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">We think, however, that questions of law are presented in this case which should be reviewed by the Court of Appeals; and the defendant having requested such a certificate, and entertaining the view, that there are questions of law involved in this case which ought to be reviewed by the Court of Appeals, we think the application should be granted upon the defendant\u2019s complying with the stipulation as to an undertaking on appeal which he suggested, without, however, intimating any opinion as to whether or not such a certificate in this case is necessary.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
