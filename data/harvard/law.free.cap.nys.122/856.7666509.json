The complaint must, therefore, be treated as if it had been demurred to, and the sole question to be considered is whether it sufficiently states a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">The complaint alleges the incorporation of the defendant; \"that on the 15th day of July, 1908, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, a boy 16 years old, was employed by the defendant as a day laborer in mining and taking clay from the defendant\u2019s clay bank; that the defendant had caused large quantities, of clay and earth to be excavated from the clay bed, and had thereby constructed and \"maintained a vertical wall or side about 50 feet high, which had near the top thereof an overhanging face of clay and earth, which had several fissures running through it, and was in danger of falling any moment; \u201cthat thereafter, and while the said sides or wall and face was in such dangerous condition, the defendant negligently required and directed plaintiff\u2019s intestate to work at the foot of said side or wall and directly under said overhanging face of clay and earth; that defendant was then and there informed of the dangerous condition of said wall, and requested to remove said overhanging face, but negligently omitted so to do, and assured plaintiff\u2019s intestate that it was safe for him to work thereunder; that thereupon plaintiff\u2019s intestate, having no knowledge of such dangerous and unsafe condition, and relying upon said assurance of the defendant, did enter said excavation and work at the foot of said wall, directly under said overhanging face of clay and earth, in accordance with defendant\u2019s direction aforesaid; that immediately * * * the said overhanging face of clay and earth gave way and fell upon plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and in consequence thereof he was so injured and mangled and crushed that he died a few minutes thereafter.\u201d The complaint also alleges that the death of the deceased-was caused by the negligence of the defendant, in that the defendant failed to provide a safe place to work, in constructing and maintaining said overhanging face of clay and earth, in assuring plaintiff\u2019s intestate that it was safe to work thereunder, and in omitting to inspect and examine the wall and the overhanging face. It also alleges that the decedent was without fault or negligence, and that on the 5th day of September, 1908, letters of administration upon his estate were duly issued and granted to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">All the allegations of fact being admitted, it stands conceded that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was put to work in a dangerous place, and that the defendant knew it was unsafe. I think this is enough to show that the defendant failed in his duty to the decedent, and if, as the complaint charges, the decedent was sent with the assurance that it was safe, and, ignorant of the danger, obeyed orders and met his death; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>it was error to hold as a matter of law that the deceased was negligent, or that he appreciated or assumed the risk of the accident which occurred. This case is not like Citrone v. O\u2019Rourke Eng. Co., 188 N. Y. 339, 80 N. E. 1092, 19 L. R. A. (N. S.) 340, Russell v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., 188 N. Y. 344, 81 N. E. 122, 19 L. R. A. (N. S.) 344, or Perry v. Rogers, 157 N. Y. 251, 51 N. E. 1021, cited by respondent\u2019s counsel. In each of these cases the servant was steadily making, or assisting in making, his own place in which to work. Here the servant had nothing to do with the preparation or creation of the overhanging wall or bank. He.took no part in the creation of this condition of danger. On the contrary, he began his work after the place had been .prepared by the master through other servants. * I also think' that the jury would have been justified in finding that the accident occurred from a cause which could have been foreseen and guarded against by the exercise of proper care and prudence on the part of the master. The fact that there were several fissures running through the overhanging bank, and that it was likely -to fall at unexpected times, imposed upon the defendant the duty of frequent inspection for the purpose of discovering appearances indicating immediate danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">The complaint not only sets forth facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action' at common law, but a cause of action under the employer\u2019s liability act (Consol. Laws, c. 31). That act extends the liability of the employer to defects in the condition of the ways, works, or machinery connected with or used in his business, and that a clay bank is to be regarded as \u201cworks,\u201d within the meaning of the act, was expressly held by us in Palin v. Cary Brick Co., 133 App. Div. 483, 117 N. Y. Supp. 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">It follows that the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur: COCHRANE, J., in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
