M. Simpson, for and on behalf of the Textile- Publishing Company, and the defendants, thereafter assigned, after part performance, to the plaintiff by the Textile Publishing Company, at the request of the defendants, and with their knowledge and approval; the plaintiff assuming certain indebtedness and performing the balance of that contract. (2) A further independent contract,, made as part of the consideration for such assignment, whereby the defendant agreed to pay plaintiff, in' return for securing the advantages of its business facilities, a further sum of 10 per cent, upon the price to be paid under the contract of February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>18, 1908, for. certain booklets and other matter. (3) A separate and independent contract, made at some unknown date, whereby the plaintiff furnished and delivered to the defendants, upon their order, certain printed matter and stationery at the agreed price of $868.19, and whereby certain advertising was to be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">It is nowhere alleged that the last two contracts were modifications of the original contract, or formed any part thereof, and the complaint furnishes no means by which it can be determined with certainty how the amount sued for is arrived at or apportioned between these three contracts. The defendants are entitled to know whether the plaintiff is relying upon the original contract, subsequently modified by mutual agreement, and, if such is plaintiff\u2019s contention, it should state so unequivocally. If, on the other hand, the plaintiff , is suing upon three separate causes of action, then they must be separately numbered and stated, and it must appear how much is sought to be recovered upon each of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The order appealed from must therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the application granted to the extent indicated, with $10 costs of motion. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
