It is well settled that the good will of a business is an asset of the estate in the hands of an executor, chargeable against him on his accounting. While its precise value may be difficult of ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>tainment in any way short of actual value, in this case the parties themselves have furnished by their agreement the rule by which that value can be determined. Under his original agreement with Tegner, the surviving partner was to pay, in case of the retirement or death of the senior partner (Vivanti), to him or to such person as he might by will or deed appoint, a sum equal to one-third of the annual profits of the-business, each year for 10 years, in payment for his interest in the good will of the firm of Vivanti Bros. When William Greenbaum was admitted to the firm, he bound himself to pay for the senior partner\u2019s-interest in good will the same sum in like annual payments to Vivanti, or in case of his death to his wife, and on her decease to a third person. After the death of Vivanti, when Greenbaum was sole surviving, partner, he made a written agreement with Vivanti\u2019s widow, whereby he* bound himself to pay for the rights of Vivanti in the good will of the-business, instead of the one-third originally provided, 12% per cent, of the net profits for the first year, beginning July 1, 1906, and 15 per cent, for every year thereafter until the period of 10 years had expired, or until the death of the widow. It appears that the latter\u2019s expectancy of life is more than the period limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">The appraiser arrived at the value of the good will by averaging the profits of the business for the four years preceding decedent\u2019s death, taking 15 per cent, of that amount, and multiplying it by 10, giving a total of $59,088.21. The learned surrogate fixed the value at the amount of Vivanti\u2019s share of the profits of the business for the year immediately preceding his death. For this computation there seems-to be no authority. The amount fixed by agreement of the parties must determine the value. But an error has been made in the computation for the percentage for the first year should be only 12% per cent, instead of 15 per cent., and what is to be determined is the value of the good will as of the time of decedent\u2019s death; that is, it would not in any event be $59,088.21, but the present value of such a sum payable in 10 annual installments.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">The order appealed from must therefore be reversed, without costs, and the matter remitted to the Surrogate\u2019s Court for further action in accordance with this determination. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
