After issue had been joined, the plaintiff obtained an order for the examination, of a witness residing at Chattanooga, Tenn., upon oral questions, and the appeal is from such order.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">I am of the opinion that the order appealed from should be reversed. The subject-matter concerning which it is desired to examine the witness is in no way connected with or material to the issues involved in the action. Such examination can only be for an ulterior purpose, and for that reason the motion should have been denied. A commission will not issue to take the testimony of a witness in advance of the trial, unless it is made to appear that such testimony is material to the issue to be tried. Wood v. Hoffman, 121 App. Div. 636, 106 N. Y. Supp. 308; Gavin v. N. Y. Construction Co., 122 App. Div. 643, 107 N. Y. Supp. 272; Ehrich v. Root, 122 App. Div. 719, 107 N. Y. Supp. 846; Oakes v. Star Co., 119 App. Div. 358, 104 N. Y. Supp. 244; Grant v. Greene, 118 App. Div. 850, 103 N. Y. Supp. 674; Potter v. Morning Journal Ass\u2019n, 49 App. Div. 242, 63 N. Y. Supp. 223. See, also, rule 82, Gen. Rules of Practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">The examination is desired for the purpose of showing the breach of a contract on the part of the firm of Kean, Van Cortlandt &amp; Co. and the corporation in question to furnish certain moneys to it, which failure it is claimed was the cause of or resulted in the bankruptcy of the corporation; but the failure of such firm to perform the contract,. if made, is in no way involved in the issues of this action, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>would evidence bearing on that subject be admissible at the trial. The court will not permit its process to be used in one action to enable a party to _ ascertain whether he may not have a cause of action or defense in a contemplated action.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The order, so far as appealed from, therefore, is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for the examination of the witness referred to denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
