The appellant would have us regard this appeal as from an order refusing to open its default. But the application for the order to show cause, that order, the avowed contention of counsel at the time of the application, and the order entered upon the motion, all indicate plainly that the remedy sought was vacation of the judgment. The judgment was entered in 1905, and but a few days intervened between the entry thereof and this application. The justice who presided in the court at the time the motion was made overlooked the motion, and did not decide it until December 31, 1909, when it was denied \u201cfor want of power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">If this decision had been made prior to September 1, 1907, there was authority for it (Diehl v. Steele, 49 Misc. Rep. 456, 97 N. Y. Supp. 1024), and the remedy of the defendant, as pointed out in that case, would have been found in section 311 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, c. -580). But on September 1, 1907, section 253 was amended (Laws 1907, c. 304), so that at the time this decision was made the court or a justice thereof, in a district in which a judgment is taken without the service of <em>k </em>summons, or the process required by law, could have vacated the judgment, and have afforded the further appropriate relief. For this amendment but affected the remedy, and was therefore applicable to the case at bar when the court came to decide it. Matter of Davis, 149 N. Y. 539, 44 N. E. 185; Southwick v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Southwick, 49 N. Y. 510; Ryan v. Waule, 63 N. Y. 57; Lazarus v. M. E. R. Co., 145 N. Y. 585, 40 N. E. 240; Peace v. Wilson, 186 N. Y. 403, 79 N. E. 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The order is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements,, and the motion is remitted to the Municipal Court for hearing upon the merits thereof. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
