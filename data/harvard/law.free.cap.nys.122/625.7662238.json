The action is for goods sold and delivered. The defense is a breach of warranty and rejection of the goods, which are now stored in Buffalo. The principal issue is as to the quality of the goods. Each side presents a long list of witnesses, whose evidence is claimed to be material\u2019and necessary, and each side claims that the cost of transporting its necessary witnesses from New York to Buffalo, or vice versa, will cost more than the whole amount involved in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-15\">The case, however, must be tried somewhere, and one party or the other must be subjected to this expense. There is no such preponderance of apparently necessary witnesses that the motion can be decided upon that ground alone. Under these circumstances, the fact that the contract was made in Buffalo, and that the goods whose quality is in dispute are_ stored in that city, indicates Erie county as the proper place of trial. Shaff v. Rosenberg, 116 App. Div. 366, 101 N. Y. Supp. 892; Denzer v. Grewen, 133 App. Div. 706, 118 N. Y. Supp. 230; Wallace v. Manning, 130 App. Div. 894, 114 N. Y. Supp. 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-16\">Order appealed from reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion to change place of trial to Erie county granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
