Under her complaint, as the court charged the jury, she could not recover against defendant unless she established that the vehicle in which she was riding was tipped over, and she was thrown therefrom solely by reason of an actual physical collision of defendant\u2019s automobile therewith, due to defendant\u2019s negligent management of his conveyance at the time. Plaintiff\u2019s proof satisfactorily establishes this fact. Both, she and her husband testify that, when they discovered defendant\u2019s automobile approaching in front of them, the horse with the buggy, in which they were riding, was turned to the right completely out of the beaten track of the highway, and, while it is true neither of them saw defendant\u2019s machine actually collide with the buggy, yet they both say they saw it coming directly toward the buggy and felt the shock of the actual impact, and the buggy was tipped over. The horse was then rearing and plunging, but it did not swerve, or attempt to turn around. The jury were well warranted in finding from this evidence that the automobile struck the buggy and tipped it over. Defendant denied that he collided with any vehicle, though he admits he did drive his automobile from Wellsville to Stannard\u2019s Corners that evening at about the time plaintiff was injured. He also says that he did not see any one whom he met having any trouble in controlling his horse or team. Plaintiff gave no proof that the buggy was injured by the collision; and the absence of such proof is, as appellant insists, important, because, if there was a collision of force sufficient to tip the buggy over, if would necessarily have broken-that part of the buggy with which the automobile collided., It can hardly be held that this follows as a necessary inference of fact. Defendant also gave proof by himself and another witness, who examined his automobile the morning after the accident, that there were no marks thereon, nor were the lamps on the front of the machine broken or injured. From this we are asked to infer that it was not possible that any collision had occurred. Plaintiff produced testimony on her part that defendant had, while driving his machine earlier the same day, collided with another vehicle. This fact is not directly denied by defendant. If this be true, it would seem that it is possible for an automobile to collide with another vehicle without imprinting visible \u25a0evidence of the fact on the machine itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">There was much talk of counsel and various efforts on the part of plaintiff in an attempt to prove previous accidents occasioned by defendant while driving his machine; but none of this testimony seems to have been admitted, except that in relation to the single occasion above referred to. At the request of defendant, the jury was charged that this testimony must be entirely disregarded upon the question of defendant\u2019s negligence. The evidence was competent for the single purpose for which it was received. The jury were sufficiently cautioned and instructed to disregard all testimony of general recklessness of defendant in the management of his machine and the remarks of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>counsel in reference thereto. All of this had previously been expressly stricken from the record by the court\u2019s order. If the somewhat heated discussion indulged in by counsel when this evidence was offered and its admissibility considered by the court may have been calculated to develop what has been described in Scott v. Barker, 129 App. Div. 241, 247, 113 N. Y. Supp. 695, 699, as \u201can inflated and exaggerated tropical atmosphere,\u201d the air was ultimately cleared and nothing remained to obscure the perception, or judgment, of the jury after the court had excluded, as he did, from their consideration the attempts of plaintiff\u2019s counsel to introduce objectionable evidence and everything that had been said in that connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, made ]upon the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a \u00a1cause of action, in that it fails to allege that the injury complained jof was caused solely by defendant\u2019s negligence, or that plaintiff\u2019s negligence was not a contributory cause thereof, is now urged upon our \u25a0 Attention as error. The complaint alleges the injury was caused by defendant\u2019s negligence. A separate and direct averment of the absence of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence is not required. As stated in Lee v. Troy Citizens\u2019 Gaslight Co., 98 N. Y. 115, 119, \u201csubstantially that allegation is always involved in the averment that the injury set out was occasioned by defendant\u2019s negligence. To prove that, it is necessary for the plaintiff to show, and the burden is upon him to es- / tablish, that his own negligence did not cause or contribute to the in- \\ jury.\u201d Bogardus v. Metropolitan Street Railway Co., 62 App. Div. 376, 70 N. Y. Supp. 1094.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The remaining ground upon which we are asked to reverse the judgment is that plaintiff was permitted over defendant\u2019s objection and exception to prove that she suffered pain by reason of her injury. There is no direct allegation in the complaint that she suffered pain, or that she became by reason of her injury sick, sore, and disabled, but she does allege that her ribs were broken, and that she was \u201cbruised and wounded.\u201d I think this was a sufficient allegation of her injury to permit her to make proof of the pain directly caused by the injury. \u201cWhen a plaintiff alleges that his person has been injured, and proves the allegation, the law implies damages, and-he may\" recover such as necessarily and immediately flow from the injury (which are called general damages) under a general allegation that damages were sustained.\u201d Gumb v. Twenty-Third Street Railway Co., 114 N. Y. 411, 21 N. E. 993. It would not seem to require argument that pain would result necessarily and immediately from having one\u2019s ribs broken and one\u2019s body otherwise grievously bruised and wounded; and pain is always considered a proper element to be considered in determining actual damages resulting from an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur, except I SPRING and WILLIAMS, JJ., who dissent upon the ground of inflammatory and improper remarks made by counsel for plaintiff upon I the trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
