The evidence upon which the contentions of the parties rest was conflicting. The questions of fact were submitted to the jury in a charge free from error, to which only one exception was taken, and that is without merit. The plaintiff had a verdict for $300. On a motion subsequently made by defendant the verdict was set aside upon the sole ground that in the opinion of the court it was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-19\">The only question before us is whether the trial court was justified in his belief that the verdict was excessive. The physician who at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>tended the plaintiff testified that the latter sustained a severe strain of the spine, a contusion over the spine, and one on the back of the head, with swelling and concussion of the brain; that the swelling was as large as his fist; that the top of the spine was bruised and discolored; that there was a cut on one ear, and bruises on the thighs and knees. The bruise on the right hip was six or seven inches long and discolored. The knee was contused, discolored, and swollen. There was a contusion over the ribs. He complained of and suffered great pain. The physician treated him for five weeks, making 15 calls at the house, and the plaintiff called at' the office for treatment from 10 to 15 times. The physician testified that his services were worth $50; that when he ceased treating plaintiff the pain in the back and spine had not abated. And the plaintiff testified that at the time of the trial \u2014seven months after the accident\u2014he suffered pain in his back; that for five weeks he was laid up and unable to work; and that for seven weeks he suffered intense pain in his back, head, shoulder, and side. The verdict for $300 is not excessive, and, there being nothing in the record to indicate that the jury acted from improper motives, from a mistaken view of the facts, or disregard of the law of the case, it must be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Order reversed, and the verdict of the jury reinstated, with costs. Ah concur, except BURR, J., who dissents upon the ground that the plaintiff should have been nonsuited.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
