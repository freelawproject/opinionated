There was a large room on the third floor, and it was in that room, or a smaller one, known as the \u201cpolishing room,\u201d in which the plaintiff had be\u00e9n employed for six or seven months. There was a freight elevator in the building, which the man operating it ran by a cable extending up about the center of the well. On the third floor there were two trapdoors, which were closed when the elevator was below them. As the elevator came up these trapdoors were lifted by it. At one time there had been a door on the third floor which closed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>when the elevator came down. This had not been in operation for a long time, and there was no guard or barrier in front of the open space, and no signals were given to advise one of the approach of the elevator. When these trapdoors were down, they had been used very frequently during all the time the plaintiff had been employed in the factory as a passageway from one end of the large room to the other; and those employed in the polishing room desiring to go to the other part of the large room, or returning therefrom, were quite apt to use these trapdoors for that purpose. This was done so generally that it was known by the officers and superintendent of the defendant. Even those in charge of the men were wont as a matter of convenience to pass over these doors. At the east of this elevator well there were doors provided for the employ\u00e9s to use; and it is the claim of the defendant that, having furnished an adequate place, it is not chargeable with negligence in this case because the plaintiff happened to use these trapdoors, instead of the proper place for him to go to and from his work. That would be so if the defendant had not acquiesced in the general and extensive use of these trapdoors by its employ\u00e9s.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The evidence is undisputed that no warning signals were given of the approach of this elevator at any time, and that no \u201cbarrier, guard, or door\u201d to exclude people from using these doors as a passageway was provided. The evidence shows that elevators of similar construction used in manufacturing establishments for the carriage of freight are equipped with warning signals or devices for the purpose of giving notice to employ\u00e9s and other people of its approach, so that the jury might have found that it was entirely practicable either to shut off the use of this passageway by guards or barriers, or a door, or else, if it was to be used, to equip the appliance with some sort of a warning signal. I think, therefore, that there was abundant evidence from which the jury might have found that the defendant failed in its duty to the plaintiff, inasmuch as it permitted him to use this space as a passageway while in the performance of the work he was assigned to do in the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">A- more serious question pertains to the plaintiff\u2019s freedom from contributory negligence. As already stated, he had been employed for six or seven months and had walked over these doors in common with others at work in the factory without molestation or hindrance. On the morning in question there was not much light in the factory. The elevator was not much used at that early hour. He testified that, as he started to cross the passageway, he stopped and listened, but did not hear. the approach of the elevator. He stepped upon the trapdoors, and while the cable, which operated the elevator, was before him, and which made more or less vibration in drawing up the slow moving elevator, it was not sufficient to attract his attention, or, at least, he did not observe it in the dim light. I think his failure to observe this cable is not of itself'sufficient to charge him with contributory negligence as matter of law. It is important to keep in mind that this action is under the employer\u2019s liability act, and, while he was charged with the duty of exercising \u201cdue diligence and care,\u201d yet by subdivision <em>3 </em>of that act it is provided th.at whether he \u201cunderstood .and assumed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>risk of such injury, or was guilty of contributory negligence\u201d by remaining at work \u201cwith knowledge of the risk of the injury, shall be \u2022one of fact.\u201d The construction which seems to have been given to this \u25a0section by the Court of Appeals is that, even if the evidence is undisputed either upon the question of assumption of risk, or that of contributory negligence, the case must be submitted to the jury. Clark v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 191 N. Y. 416, 420, 84 N. E. 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">It seems to me, irrespective of the strict rule which apparently the Court of Appeals seems inclined to adopt, there were facts and inferences in this case which, in any event, justify the submission of the \u25a0case to the jury; and I think even at common law this would be so. Kirby v. Montgomery Bros. &amp; Co., 197 N. Y. 27, 90 N. E. 52. As \u25a0already stated, when the elevator reached the trapdoors, it lifted them, \u2022and the plaintiff was squeezed between the door and the frame of the \u25a0elevator, and his right leg crushed and injured so that eventually it was .amputated.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The nonsuit was improper, and the judgment should be reversed and <em>\u25a0a. </em>new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant '.to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
