Henderson, </em>555 Fed.Appx. 851 (11th Cir.2014), holding that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) does not categorically bar a convicted felon from transferring lawfully obtained firearms to a third party \u201cunless [the transfer] would allow the felon to later control the [firearms], so that he could either use them or direct their use.\u201d <em>Henderson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 1780, 1783, 191 L.Ed.2d 874 (2015). We remand to the district court so that it may consider Mr. Henderson\u2019s request that the FBI transfer his firearms to his wife or a friend in accordance with the principles articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Henderson. See id. </em>at 1787 (\u201c[W]hen a court is satisfied that a felon will not retain control over his guns, \u00a7 922 does not apply, and the court has equitable power to accommodate the felon\u2019s request [for a transfer].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-13\">REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
