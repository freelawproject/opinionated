A writ of execution issued on March 3, 1975 and a discovery order was signed April 25, 1975 requiring defendant to appear and make discovery concerning his property and things, in action on May 22, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">On or about May 12, 1975 defendant\u2019s counsel, Joseph P. McManemin, received from his client the sum of $1,200 to be deposited in McManemin\u2019s trust account \u201cfor whatever purposes [defendant] would wish to use said amount.\u201d Thereafter McManemin talked with plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, Boris Seeber, as well as at least one other creditor, in an attempt to settle their claims. According to McManemin, he \u201cinformed him [Seeber] that said $1,200.00 could be used in many ways.\u201d He further stated that he was owed over $3,000 in attorney\u2019s fees by defendant, but that he would ho willing to forego immediate payment in the interest of a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">Under date of May 15, 1975 McManemin wrote Seeber that \u201cI have $1,200.00 in my Trust Account from Andrew Oberfrank subject to clearance of his cheek to me.\u201d He restated the terms of his settlement offer and advised that if Seeber was in a position to settle plaintiffs\u2019 claim, he was prepared to do so \u201cprovided the money isn\u2019t required elsewhere by Mr. Oberfrank before an agreement is reached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">On May 21, 1975, pursuant to Seeber\u2019s instructions, the Passaic County Sheriff levied on McManemin\u2019s trust account to the extent of $1,200. This controversy was thereafter framed by plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a payover order and defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>ant\u2019s crossmotion for relief from the levy and for an order allowing payment of the $1,200 to MeManemin in partial satisfaction of the fees for legal services owed to him by defendant. After hearing oral argument the trial judge granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion and denied the defendant\u2019s cross-motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">On this appeal defendant argues that the trial judge erred in failing to recognize McManemin\u2019s retaining lien upon the $1,200 in his trust account for professional services rendered. We find the contention unpersuasive. Whatever status such a claim would have as between attorney and client, it is not of such a nature as to be accorded priority over the claims of other creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\"> McManemin received the $1,200 in trust to be disbursed in accordance with the defendant\u2019s instructions. His role was little more than that of a depository, and there is no equitable justification for allowing this fund to be flourished in settlement negotiations under the shield of an attorney\u2019s lien. Hence, we find no basis for the imposition of an equitable lien which is sometimes raised <em>\u201cex aequo ei bono, </em>according to the dictates of equity and conscience.\u201d <em>In Re Loring, </em>62 <em>N. J. </em>336, 341 (1973); <em>Temple v. Clinton Trust Co., 1 N. J. </em>219, 226 (1948). The circumstances of this case fall more appropriately under the rule that an attorney\u2019s retaining lien will not attach to property of the client which comes into the attorney\u2019s possession \u201cfor a special purpose inconsistent with his claim to a lien.\u201d <em>Brauer v. Hotel </em>Associates, <em>Inc., </em>40 <em>N. J. </em>415, 420 (1963); <em>Ideal Tile Corp. v. N. T. Investment Co., </em>111 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>241 (Ch. 1932). In the latter case, on materially comparable facts, Vice-Chancellor Backes concluded that the receipt by an attorney of monies \u201cin trust\u201d constituted possession for a \u201cspecial purpose\u201d and therefore outside the reach of an attorney\u2019s lien. We consider that soundly reasoned statement of principle to be applicable herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Defendant also argues that his attorney is entitled to a lien over the fund upon the theory that he had created it or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>made it available to plaintiff. This contention is completely lacking in merit. <em>R. 2 </em>:11-3(e) (1) (E).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Finally, contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, we find nothing \u201cimproper\u201d or \u201cunethical\u201d in Seeber\u2019s conduct. Counsel\u2019s duty obligated him to secure his client\u2019s interests by all legal means. For him to have remained supine in the face of the information which had been placed before him would have constituted a breach of such duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
