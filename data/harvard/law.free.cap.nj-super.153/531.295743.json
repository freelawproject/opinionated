Pursuant to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, plaintiff\u2019s compensation carrier has been making payments to Gatlin\u2019s dependents. This has resulted in an increase in compensation premiums which plaintiff must pay to its insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Plaintiff contends that the increase in premiums was solely and proximately caused by defendants\u2019 negligence, breach of warranties and strict liability, and demanded judgment against them. No action against defendants was ever instituted by anyone on behalf of decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Each of the named defendants answered, claiming, among other things, that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and then moved to dismiss the complaint on that ground. The motions were granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The trial judge found that plaintiff\u2019s claim \u201carises out of the compensation proceedings,\u201d and thus was precluded by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34 :15-40 (f) as interpreted in <em>United States Cas. Co. v. Hercules Power Co., </em>4 <em>N. J. </em>157 (1950). He also concluded that plaintiff\u2019s suit would \u201cso clutter the field and so essentially destroy the concept of spreading the loss by way of insurance that I think it should probably be against public policy to allow it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-40 provides that \u201c[w]here a third person is liable to the employee or his dependents for an injury or death,\u201d the right to workers\u2019 compensation does not bar an action against the third person. The rights and liabilities of the employee or his dependents and the employer or his insurance carrier, as to compensation benefits due and amounts recovered from the third party, are specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Subsection (f) subrogates the right of action of the employee or his dependents to the employer or his insurance carrier, when the employee or his dependents fail to prosecute. It further provides that \u201csuch right of action shall be only for such right of action that the injured employee or his dependents would have had against the third person * * <em>United States Cas. Co. v. Hercules Power Co., supra, </em>held that this provision barred an employer\u2019s cause of action for breach of warranty against a third party to recover the amount of compensation paid. The insured employees in that case had instituted an action in tort against the defendant, the seller of a defective product, but they could not assert a count for breach of warranty under the law then in effect since they were not parties to the sale. It was held that the statute precluded an employer or his insurance carrier from obtaining reimbursement for workers\u2019 compensation \u201cby any other method or in any other right than specifically provided for therein, <em>i. e., </em>through the right of the injured <em>employee </em>or his dependents against the third party responsible for his injuries or death * * 4 <em>N. J. </em>at 166. However, the court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">Of course, an employer or Ms subrogee is free to maintain any primary cause of action which the employer may have directly in his own right against another, specifically against the seller of an article for the breach of a warranty of its fitness for a particular use, known to the seller, which breach proximately results, <em>inter alia, </em>in injury to or the death of the purchaser\u2019s employee. Nevertheless the damages recoverable for such breach may not include the compensation payments made pursuant to our Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, which statute provides the exclusive remedy for such recovery, [at 167]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">We do not regard the cause of action asserted here to be one which the court in <em>United States Cas. Co., </em>above, said an employer would be \u201cfree to maintain.\u201d It is not a primary cause of action which the employer has directly in its own right; rather it seeks damages directly related to the compensation payments made pursuant to the Workers\u2019 Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>pensation Act. While the employer is not directly suing to recover on its employee\u2019s rights, it is pursuing a cause of action arising out of its obligation established by law for the benefit of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
