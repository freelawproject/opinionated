Arizona, </em>384 <em>U. S. </em>436, 86 <em>S. Ct. </em>1602, 16 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 694 (1966). He was then asked if he understood the warnings, to which defendant answered he \u201cdid and wished to remain silent.\u201d Thereafter, the detective asked defendant where and with whom he was living. Defendant responded with the name of his girlfriend and her address. Under cross-examination at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>the <em>Miranda </em>hearing, the detective testified he wanted to know where defendant lived so he could continue his investigation'. He further testified that when he asked the question he intended to go to the address to look for and obtain specific items of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The detective went to the address given by defendant and seized articles for use as evidence. At the conclusion of the <em>Miranda </em>hearing the evidence thus obtained was suppressed. The trial judge ruled that, while generally questions as to name and address were proper for ministerial purposes such as booking or bail purposes without prior <em>Miranda </em>warnings, such questions violated defendant\u2019s constitutional rights in this case because it was the expressed intent of the detective to use the information thus obtained to continue his investigation. The evidence was suppressed because it was \u201cthe fruits of a violation of defendant\u2019s right to remain silent under the rule of the <em>Miranda </em>case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Routine questions asked during the booking process or for bail purposes are generally held to be ministerial in nature and outside the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>People v. Rivera, </em>26 <em>N. Y. </em>2d 304, 310 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 287, 258 <em>N. E. </em>2d 699 (Ct. App. 1970); <em>State v. Rassmussen, </em>92 <em>Idaho </em>731, 449 <em>P. </em>2d 837 (Sup. Ct. 1969); <em>United States v. LaVallee, </em>521 <em>F. </em>2d 1109 (2 Cir. 1975), <em>cert. </em>den. <em>Hines v. Bombard, </em>423 <em>U. S. </em>1090, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>884, 47 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 101 (1976); <em>Commonwealth v. Allen, </em>239 <em>Pa. Super. </em>83, 361 <em>A. </em>2d 393 (Super. Ct. 1976); <em>State v. Jordan, </em>506 <em>S. W. </em>2d 74 (Mo. Ct. App. 1974); <em>Clarke v. State, 3 Md. App. </em>447, 240 <em>A. </em>2d 291 (Ct. Spec. App. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The trial judge recognized this rule but held that, since the testimony of the detective indicated an intent to use the information obtained from such innocuous questions in order to continue his investigation, it was improper to ask them. He applied a subjective test and, in doing so, we conclude that he erred. The test to be applied in determining whether custodial interrogation has occurred is well stated by the California Supreme Court in <em>People v. Stewart, </em>62 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number><em>Cal. </em>2d 571, 43 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>201, 400 <em>P. </em>2d 97 (1965), aff\u2019d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U. S. </em>436, 86 <em>S. Ct. </em>1602, 16 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 694 (1966), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">The test which we have described does not propose a determination of the actual intent or subjective purpose of the police in undertaking the interrogations but a determination based upon the objective evidence. Whatever may be the subjective intent of the interrogators, we must, in order to determine if the police are carrying out \u2018a process of interrogations that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements\u2019 [citation omitted], analyze the total situation which envelops the questioning by considering such factors as the length of the interrogation, the place and time of the interrogation, the nature of the questions, the conduct of the police and all other relevant circumstances. [43 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>at 206, 400 <em>P. </em>2d at 102]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">This is substantially the test adopted and applied in New Jersey. In <em>State v. Barnes, </em>54 <em>N. J. </em>1 (1969), <em>cert. </em>den. 396 <em>U. S. </em>1029, 90 <em>S. Ct. </em>580, 24 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 525 (1970), the police stopped a car in which defendant was riding, arrested and searched her. They were looking for stolen checks and defendant had none on her person. During a cursory search of the car in which defendant was riding, the police saw checks on the flooT of the caT and asked, \u201cWhose stuff is this?\u201d Defendant responded that the cheeks were hers. The court held that the question and defendant\u2019s answer, given prior to <em>Miranda </em>warnings, was admissible. In holding that defendant had not been subjected to interrogation, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">What was comprehended by <em>Miranda, </em>was a process of \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d which the Supreme Court found to be inherently coercive. The single question asked in this case was not part of the investigation which led to the defendant\u2019s apprehension, nor was it one of a series of investigatory queries. Most important, it was not the type of question which centered blameworthiness on the defendant. She could have attributed possession to anyone, or no one, in answer to the question directed to her. After all, there were three other occupants in the car. [54 <em>N. J. </em>at 6.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The same rule was applied in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>106 <em>N. J. Super. </em>295 (App. Div. 1969), rev\u2019d, dissent adopted, 55 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>N. J. </em>331 (1970). See also, <em>Mills v. State, 28 Md. App. </em>300, 345 A. 2d 127 (1975), aff\u2019d 278 <em>Md. </em>262, 363 <em>A. </em>2d 491 (Ct. App. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The intent or purpose of the detective in asking the questions of a defendant may be material in making a determination as to whether the defendant has been subjected to custodial interrogation in violation of his constitutional rights, but is only one of the factors to be considered in analyzing the total situation surrounding the questioning. Such an issue is to be resolved by a consideration of all the circumstances involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We hold that, under the circumstances present here, the information sought by the detective as to defendant\u2019s address and the name of the person with whom he was living was ministerial in nature and outside the constitutional protection afforded against self-incrimination. It follows that it was error to suppress the evidence obtained in a search of the home where defendant was living as the \"fruits of an improper custodial interrogation,\u201d and the order doing so is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
