J. Super. </em>363 (Ch. Div. 1976), except as follows: We express no view as to whether the court correctly applied the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d test in invalidating this particular gender-based classification as unconstitutional. For even if a less rigorous standard is used, the classification is unconstitutionally discriminatory and the conclusion reached by the court below is correct. See <em>Califano v. Goldfarb, </em>430 <em>U. S. </em>199, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>1021, 51 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 270 (1977); <em>Kalina v. Railroad Retirement Bd., </em>541 <em>F. </em>2d 1204 (6 Cir. 1976), aff\u2019d by mem. op., 431 <em>U. S. </em>909, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>2164, 53 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 220 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">We note that the cases of <em>Silbowitz v. Sec't of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>397 <em>F. Supp. </em>862 (S. D. Fla. 1975), and <em>Jablon v. Sec\u2019t of Health, Ed. and Welfare, </em>399 <em>F. Supp. </em>118 (D. Md. 1975), cited by the court below, have been affirmed by memorandum opinions of the United States Supreme Court. 430 <em>U. S. </em>924, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>1539, 51 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 768 (1977). The appeal to the United States Supreme Court of the case of <em>Coffin v. Sec\u2019t of Health, Ed. and Welfare, </em>400 <em>F. Supp. </em>953 (D. C. 1975), also relied on below, was dismissed by that court. 430 <em>U. S. </em>924, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>1539, 51 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 789 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">We have also considered appellants\u2019 contention that the \u201cbenefits under the statute do not give greater benefits to a male and his widow than to a female [retired] employee.\u201d We have concluded that it plainly is without merit, even in the light of the proofs presented as to the comparison between the benefits that would be received by the \u201caverage\u201d female retired employee and the \u201caverage\u201d retired male employee and his widow. <em>Cf. Moss v. Sec\u2019t of Health, Ed. and Welfare, </em>408 <em>F. Supp. </em>403, 410 (D. C. M. D. Fla., 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
