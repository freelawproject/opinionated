S. C.,</author>\n<p id=\"Acc\">Temporarily Assigned. The State appeals, by leave granted, from an order entered prior to trial suppressing two marijuana plants seized without a warrant from the rear yard of defendants\u2019 home. Based upon that seizure defendants have been indicted for possession of marijuana. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>24:21-20a(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">The record before the trial court consisted of a brief account by the State of the circumstances of the seizure, which defendants stipulated they would be unable to dispute. The uncontroverted facts are that on July 20, 1976 the Hazlet Police Department received an anonymous call that marijuana plants were growing in a vegetable garden at 169 8th Street, West Keansburg. Two officers were dispatched to that address, where they saw a garden and determined that it should be further investigated by detectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">At about 11:15 the next morning Detectives Allen and Mulligan went to the address and observed the garden. Prom the roadway they were able to see \u201clarge green plants growing in the garden.\u201d In order to get a closer look Detective Allen went around the back and came through the property behind defendants\u2019 house. Prom that vantage point off defendants\u2019 property, the detective observed two plants growing at the rear of the property which, from past experience, he identified as marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>The detectives notified headquarters and additional officers were dispatched to the scene. The officers entered defendants\u2019 garden, further examined the plants and gathered them as evidence. The record indicates no attempt made at the time of the seizure to identify the owners or occupants of the premises, or to locate them for interrogation, arrest or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Tn the trial court the State, which had the burden to justify the warrantless seizure <em>(State v. Allen, </em>113 <em>N. J. Super. 245 </em>(App. Div. 1970)), advised that it was \u201crelying on the plain view doctrine\u201d as enunciated in <em>Harris v. United States, </em>390 <em>U. S. 234, </em>88 <em>S. Ct. </em>992, 19 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1067 (1968). Defendants principally relied on what they urged were limitations on the doctrine set forth in <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 <em>U. S. </em>443, 91 <em>S. Ct. </em>2022, 29 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 564 (1971), reh. den. 404 <em>U. S. </em>874, 92 <em>S. Ct. </em>26, 30 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 120 (1971). Following argument, and principally in reliance upon <em>Coolidge, </em>the trial judge suppressed the evidence upon findings that the observing of the plants by the police was not inadvertent and that no exigent circumstances excused ihe requirement of a warrant to seize.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">In this court the State again contends that the seizure was justified under <em>Harris, </em>which holds that \u201cobjects falling in the plain view of an officer who has a right to be in the position to have that view are subject to seizure and may be introduced in evidence.\u201d 390 <em>U. S. </em>at 236, 88 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 993, 19 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 1069. Defendants respond, as they did in the trial court, that under <em>Goolidge </em>the \u201cplain view\u201d exception requires both \u201cinadvertent\u201d discovery of evidence and \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d to justify a warrantless seizure and that neither appears here. In rebuttal the State contends that those requirements of <em>Goolidge </em>represent the views of only a plurality of the United States Supreme Court and are therefore not binding on this court and ought not to be followed. Further, the State argues that inadvertence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>exigent circumstances are both established by the stipulated facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Consideration of the scope and application of the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine here must proceed with the recognition that the term \u201cplain view\u201d is imprecise and has been used to describe a variety of circumstances having quite different legal implications. As Justice Stewart noted in <em>Coolidge,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">* * <em>* </em>it is important to keep in mind that, in the vast majority of cases, <em>any </em>evidence seized by the police will be in plain view, at least at the moment of seizure. The problem with the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine has been to identify the circumstances in which plain view has legal significance rather than being simply the normal concomitant of any search, legal or illegal. [403 <em>U. S. </em>at 465, 91 <em>S. C.t. </em>at 2037, 29 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 582]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">\u201cPlain view\u201d is sometimes used to describe situations in which items are exposed to public view in a public place or in an otherwise constitutionally unprotected location; their observation and seizure are authorized without a warrant. See, <em>e. g., State v. McKnight, 52 N. J. 35 </em>(1968). A second application of \u201cplain view\u201d is to situations in which officers have lawfully intruded into a constitutionally protected place where they observe the items in question; such \u201cplain view\u201d observation and subsequent seizure require no warrant, as where the initial lawful intrusion is by consent <em>(e. g., State v. Braeunig, </em>122 <em>N. J. Super. </em>319 (App. Div. 1973); <em>State v. Mark, </em>46 <em>N. J. </em>262 (1966)), to effect an arrest (e. <em>g., State v. Jordan, </em>115 <em>N. J. Super. </em>73 (App. Div. 1971), certif. den. 59 <em>N. J. </em>293 (1971)), or in hot pursuit <em>(e. g., State v. Canola, </em>135 <em>N. J. Super. </em>224 (App. Div. 1975), mod., 73 <em>N. J. </em>206 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">On the other hand, objects may come into \u201cplain view\u201d only after and as a result of an unlawful intrusion into a constitutionally protected zone; evidence of such observation and any warrantless seizure resulting must be suppressed. See, <em>e. g., State v. Rice, </em>115 <em>N. J. Super. </em>128 (App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Div. 1971); <em>State v. Allen, supra; State v. Baker, </em>112 <em>N. J. Super. </em>351 (App. Div. 1970); <em>United States v. Chadwick, </em>-- <em>U. </em>S.-, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>2476, 53 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 538 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Simply describing an object as being in \u201cplain view,\u201d then, is not sufficient to justify its warrantless seizure. The common strand in the eases cited is that a warrantless seizure may be made of items in \u201cplain view\u201d in a location where the officer has a right to be; but that the presence of the items cannot alone supply justification for a police officer\u2019s presence at that location. As Justice Stewart said in <em>Coolidge,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">* * * the doctrine serves to supplement the prior justification \u2014 whether it be a warrant for another object, hot pursuit, search incident to lawful arrest, or some other legitimate reason for being present unconnected with a search directed against the accused \u2014 and permits the warrantless seizure. 403 <em>U. S. </em>at 466, 91 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 2038, 29 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 583]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">This case presents yet a different kind of \u201cplain view.\u201d Here the marijuana plants were located in defendants\u2019 backyard but were observed from adjoining property, and the officers\u2019 intrusion onto defendants\u2019 property is sought to be justified solely on the basis of the antecedent observation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State urges in essence that whatever is lawfully observed without a warrant may be seized without a warrant, regardless of its location. We find that position to be without the support of reason or persuasive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\"> In the kind of \u201cplain view\u201d situation presented here the observation itself is not in issue, for a mere visual observation without physical intrusion generally does not constitute a \u201csearch\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. See <em>State v. Smith, </em>37 <em>N. J. </em>481 (1962); <em>United States v. Lee, </em>274 <em>U. S. </em>559, 47 <em>S. Ct. </em>746, 71 <em>L. Ed. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>1202 (1927); <em>United States v. McMillon, </em>350 <em>F. Supp. </em>593 (D.D.C. 1972). But the Fourth Amendment by its terms protects against both \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d; that protection \u201cis <em>prima facie </em>equatable with the obtaining of a valid search warrant and the mere existence of probable cause does not alone confer legality upon a warrantless search.\u201d <em>State v. Hannah, </em>125 <em>N. J. Super. </em>290, 294 (App. Div. 1973), certif. den. 64 <em>N. J. </em>499 (1974). A \u201cplain view\u201d observation made, as here, without intrusion can surely furnish probable cause for a seizure. That it does not alone justify a warrantless intrusion to seize was stated with simple clarity by Justice Stewart in <em>Coolidge:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\"><em>* </em>* * plain view <em>alone </em>is never enough to justify the warrantless seizure of evidence. This is simply a corollary of the familiar principle discussed above, that no amount of probable cause can justify a warrantless search or seizure absent \u201cexigent circumstances.\u201d Incontrovertible testimony of the senses that an incriminating object is on premises belonging to a criminal suspect may establish the fullest possible measure of probable cause. But even where the object is contraband this Court has repeatedly stated and enforced the basic rule that the police may not enter and make a warrant-less seizure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> [403 <em>U. S. </em>at 468, 91 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 2039, 29 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 584]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>A number of cases have applied those principles to facts similar to those presented here. In <em>United States v. Coplen, 5</em>41 <em>F. </em>2d 211 (9 Cir. 1976), <em>cert. </em>den. 429 <em>U. S. </em>1073, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>810, 50 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 791 (1977), officers made a warrantless seizure from a private airplane after making observations from outside of marijuana debris inside. The court found that the visual observation was not a \u201csearch,\u201d that the observation did not violate any reasonable expectation of privacy and that the viewing of the debris constituted adequate probable cause for the issuance of a warrant. But the court went on to hold that the warrantless seizure was not justified by that observation alone, and that the warrant requirement would be excused only if \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d existed; analyzing that question, the court found the circumstances, including particularly the mobility of the plane, were in fact \u201cexigent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In <em>Fixel v. Wainwright, </em>492 <em>F. </em>2d 480 (5 Cir. 1974), officers investigating defendant\u2019s suspected drug activities observed that, as persons came and left his home, defendant periodically went into his back yard to a small shaving kit. The officers entered the backyard without a warrant and seized the kit, which was found to 'Contain narcotics. The court suppressed the evidence, holding that although the observation together with the other circumstances constituted adequate probable cause, nevertheless</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">It is absolutely clear that [the officer] unlawfully encroached on a protected area when he actually entered the back yard, seized the black shaving kit and searched it. Regardless of how suspicious the agents were that the contraband was located on the premises, this fact alone does not justify a search of petitioner\u2019s premises in the absence of a search warrant, [at 483]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Similarly, in <em>United States v. </em>Resnick, 455 <em>F. </em>2d 1127 (5 Cir. 1972), mod. 459 <em>F. </em>2d 1390 (5 Cir. 1972), officers investigating a silver currency melting scheme made surveillance of a building from a distance of from 75 to 100 feet away, observing the reflection of a furnace. Further observations were made later that day and again the following day, when the officers entered the building and seized evidence without a warrant. The court suppressed the evidence, finding the officers\u2019 observations did not justify the warrantless seizure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\"><em>* </em>* * the scope of the Fourth Amendment is not determined by the subjective conclusion of the law enforcement officer. The interposition of magistrate between officer and citizen to see if there really was probable cause was readily available, and no emergency prevented resorting to him for normal judicial process. [455 <em>F. </em>2d at 1132]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In <em>McDonald v. United </em>States, 335 <em>U. S. </em>451, 69 <em>S. Ct. </em>191, 93 <em>L. Ed. </em>153 (1948), police officers suspected defendant of engaging in gambling activities and observed him over a period of several months. While outside the rooming house in which he lived they heard the sound of an adding machine, whereupon they entered the building, stood on a chair in a common hallway and looked through a transom, observing defendant engaged in a numbers operation. The police then entered the room without a warrant. The United States Supreme Court ordered the suppression of the evidence thus obtained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">We cannot be true to that constitutional requirement [of a warrant] and excuse the absence of a search warrant without a showing by those who seek exemption from the constitutional mandate that the exigencies of the situation made that course imperative. [335 <em>U. S. </em>at 456, 69 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 193, 93 <em>L. Ed. </em>at 158]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">In <em>Pendleton v. </em>Nelson, 404 <em>F. </em>2d 1074 (9 Cir. 1968), an. officer observed marijuana through a garage window and immediately seized it. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court determination sustaining the search, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>The seizure was not incident to Pendleton\u2019s arrest earlier that day and was not pursuant to a search warrant. The view of the narcotics through the window may have provided probable cause to obtain a search warrant but, since no exigent circumstances were shown to exist, such view did not authorize a seizure without such a warrant or consent, [at 1077]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">A further exemplar is <em>State v. Davis, </em>228 <em>N. W. </em>2d 67 (Iowa Sup. Ct. 1975), where the court reversed the admission into evidence of marijuana seized without a warrant following a viewing into defendant\u2019s apartment through a window. Distinguishing the facts from other kinds of \u201cplain view,\u201d the court described the case as involving \u201ca \u2018preintrusion\u2019 view of material in an area protected by an expectation of privacy from a vantage point where the viewer had a right to be.\u201d The court then quickly disposed of the contention that such a view permitted a warrantless seizure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">To argue such a view, in and of itself, allows a warrantless intrusion is to argue probable cause alone is sufficient to allow a warrantless search and seizure. [228 <em>N. W. </em>2d at 72]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The same result was reached in <em>Brown v. State, supra, </em>where, in ordering suppression of stolen goods seized without a warrant from defendant\u2019s apartment after an observation from a common hallway, the court summarized the different kinds of \u201cplain view\u201d cases in the following language;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">The chameleon-like quality of the phrase \u201cplain view\u201d stems from its loose employment to describe these visually similar but legally distinct situations. Although they share the common denominator of a non-searching, sighting of evidence in \u201copen view,\u201d the non-intrusion observation needs no further justification for a seizure; the pre-intrusion observation does need some additional legal predicate for the intrusion necessary to effect the seizure; and the post-intrusion \u2014 or truly \u201cPlain View\u201d \u2014 observation has already validly surmounted the intrusion hurdle. [292 <em>A. </em>2d at 774-775]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">See also, <em>Chapman v. United States, 365 U. S. </em>610, 81 <em>S. Ct. </em>776, 5 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 828 (1961); <em>Jones v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>357 <em>U. S. </em>493, 78 <em>S. Ct. </em>1253, 2 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1514 (1958): <em>Johnson v.

State, </em>88 <em>Nev. </em>508, 501 P. 2d 643 (Sup. Ct. 1972); <em>State v. Brown, </em>1 <em>Or. App. </em>322, 461 <em>P. </em>2d 836 (Ct. App. 1969); <em>cf. Commonwealth v. Adams, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The State has offered no authority directly in support of its contrary assertion that a pre-intrusion \u201cplain view\u201d observation justifies a warrantless intrusion and seizure. The reliance it places on <em>Harris v. United States, supra, </em>is misconceived. In <em>Harris </em>the item seized was in \u201cplain view\u201d in defendant\u2019s vehicle which the police lawfully entered following its impoundment; in the formulation of <em>Brown, sup~a, Harris </em>is a case in which the observation \u201chas already validly surmounted the intrusion hurdle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Although not relied upon by the State, we must, however, note <em>People v. Bradley, </em>1 <em>Cal. </em>3d 80, 81 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>457, 460 <em>P. </em>2d 129 (Sup. Ct. 1969), and <em>United States v. Wright, </em>146 <em>U. S. App. D. C. </em>126, 449 <em>F. </em>2d 1355 (D. C. Cir. 1971), <em>cert. </em>den. 405 <em>U. S. </em>947, 92 <em>S. Ct. </em>986, 30 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 817 (1972), both of which may be read to support the State\u2019s contention here. But in addition to the peculiar and perhaps distinguishing facts of those cases, we observe that subsequent California decisions do not;appear to give <em>Bradley, </em>a- 4-3 decision, any broad, reading. See <em>Lorenzana v. Superior Court of Los Angeles Cty., </em>9 <em>Cal. </em>3d 626, 108 Cal. <em>Rptr. </em>585, 511 <em>P. </em>2d 33 (Sup. Ct. 1973); <em>People v. Sneed, </em>33 <em>Cal. App. </em>3d 535, 108 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>146 (D. Ct. App. 1973). And the holding in- <em>Wright </em>was over the - strenuous dissent of Judges Wright and' Bazelon that \u201cno cOurt has ever so held\u201d; it was specifically rejected in <em>United States v. Pacheco-Ruiz, </em>549 <em>F. </em>2d 1204 (9 Cir. 1976). In any' event, reading them most favorably to the- State,--we - find both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number><em>Bradley </em>and <em>Wright </em>at variance with the principles and ease law we have discussed and therefore unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We hold, then, that a \u201cplain view\u201d observation made without intrusion into a constitutionally protected location does not itself justify a warrantless intrusion and seizure. Here the intrusion was into defendants\u2019 backyard, a place which has long been recognized as enjoying constitutional protection at least in the absence of any showing of some invitation or authorized access to the public. See, <em>e. g., United States v. Molkenbur, </em>430 <em>F. </em>2d 563 (8 Cir. 1970), <em>cert. </em>den. 400 <em>U. S. </em>952, 91 <em>S. Ct. </em>244, 27 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 258 (1970) ; <em>Hobson v. United States, </em>226 <em>F. </em>2d 890 (8 Cir. 1955). The State does not urge, nor does the record suggest, that defendants invited or permitted access to others into their backyard. Compare <em>People v. Mullins, </em>50 <em>Cal. App. </em>3d 61, 123 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>201 (D. Ct. App. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The State contends, however, that by permitting visual observation of the marijuana plants from outside the premises defendants implicitly abandoned any reasonable expectation of privacy from physical intrusion; they rely upon <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 <em>U. S. </em>347, 88 <em>S. Ct. </em>507, 19 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 576 (1967), which discusses Eourth Amendment protection in terms of \u201creasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d This contention, if adopted, would necessarily overrule the principle summarized in <em>Goolidge </em>that \u201cplain view alone is never enough to justify the warrantless seizure of evidence\u201d; for if \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d dissipates upon \u201cplain view,\u201d then every warrantless intrusion following a \u201cplain view\u201d observation is lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The clash between the concepts of \u201cplain view\u201d and \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d was noted in Comment, \u201cPrivacy in Search and Seizure Law,\u201d 25 <em>Hastings L. J. </em>575 (1974) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">Privacy was to be determined by subjective criteria, but plain view was still couched in terms of abstract criteria, namely, whether the place is open to surveillance by the public. As a result, there arose an inherent inconsistency in their legal definitions, for one could conceivably have a reasonable expectation of privacy yet still be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>legally spied upon based on plain view. This meant, in effect, that after the <em>Katz </em>decision there was an implicit contradiction between the legal concepts of privacy and plain view, [at 585 and 586]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">See also, <em>State v. Stanton, </em>7 <em>Or. App. </em>286, 490 <em>P. </em>2d 1274 (Ct. App. 1971); <em>People v. Sneed, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The case law has not resolved the inconsistency as the State would have us resolve it. The contrary result has in fact been reached explicitly or implicitly in all the post<em>Katz </em>eases, discussed above, in which a warrantless intrusion was found not justified by a pre-intrusion \u201cplain view\u201d observation. See particularly, <em>Fixel v. Wainwright </em>and <em>Wattenburg v. United States, </em>both <em>supra, </em>both of which involve warrantless intrusions into backyards; and <em>United States v. Coplen, supra, </em>where the court specifically found defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy from visual observation but remained protected from warrantless intrusion in the absence of exigent circumstances. We thus cannot regard the \u201clong line of cases\u201d referred to in <em>Coolidge </em>as overruled by the earlier <em>Katz </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The remaining question is whether \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d excuses the obtaining of a warrant here. The seized marijuana was planted and growing when it was observed; there is no suggestion that at any time during the police investigation defendants were at home, or that the police apprehended an imminent harvest of the plants; the police investigation, conducted over a two-day period, disclosed nothing which indicated any special urgency; and indeed the police did not act with any show of urgency up to the time of the seizure. In short, there are no facts whatsoever which would permit a conclusion that the State has sustained its heavy burden of proving exigent circumstances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>See <em>State v. Helton, </em>146 <em>N. J. Super. </em>98 (App. Div. 1975), aff\u2019d 72 <em>N. J. </em>169 (1977); compare <em>State v. McNair, </em>60 <em>N. J. </em>8 (1972). The State here proffers only that \u201ccontraband <em>per se </em>creates an exigency\u201d; that contention is directly in conflict with accepted principle. See <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, Chapman v. United States, Johnson v. United States, Fixel v. Wainwright, </em>all <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We therefore affirm the order of suppression entered below and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-9\">The State does not suggest that the police entered defendants\u2019 property to arrest or interrogate defendants, or for any purpose other than to seize the plants. Compare <em>State v. Griffin, </em>84 <em>N. J. Super. </em>508 (App. Div. 1964); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>552 <em>F. </em>2d 1296 (8 Cir. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Although the State urges that the plurality discussion of \u201cplain view\u201d in <em>Coolidge </em>is not binding and ought not be followed, our reading of the separate <em>Coolidge </em>opinions satisfies us that their differences are largely with Justice Stewart\u2019s requirement of \u201cinadvertent\u201d discovery, which he found necessary to avoid legitimizing an initial intrusion \u201cbottomed upon a warrant that fails to mention a particular object, though the police know its location and intend to seize it.\u201d 403 <em>U. S. </em>at 471, 91 S. <em>Ct. </em>at 2040, 29 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 586. See <em>Brown v. State, </em>15 <em>Md. App. </em>584, 292 <em>A. </em>2d 762 (Ct. Sp. App. 1972), at n. 39. But where the \u201cplain view\u201d is made without an intrusion at all, it is entirely irrelevant whether the police make their observation inadvertently or intentionally. See <em>Commonwealth v. Adams, </em>234 <em>Pa. Super. </em>475, 341 <em>A. </em>2d 206, 209 (Super. Ct. 1975). It is therefore unnecessary to decide whether we must or should accept the \u201cinadvertence\u201d requirement stated by the <em>Coolidge </em>plurality with respect to post-intrusion \u201cplain view\u201d situations. See Note, \u201cThe Supreme Court, 1970 Term,\u201d 85 <em>Harv. L. Rev. </em>3, 237 (1971). Whatever doubts might exist as to the \u201cinadvertence\u201d requirement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>Coolidge, </em>they do not bring into question what Justice Stewart called \u201ca long line of cases\u201d which \u201cmake it clear beyond doubt that the mere fact that the police have legitimately obtained a \u2018plain view\u2019 of a piece of incriminating evidence is not enough to justify a warrantless seizure.\u201d 403 <em>U.
