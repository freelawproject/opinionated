Plaintiff, the widow and administratrix of the estate, appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Decedent was an executive employee of Monsanto Company, earning some $50,000 a year. Pursuant to the Monsanto management incentive plan, he was recommended for a bonus in the amount of $13,000 for the performance year 1973 on December 12, 1973. He died on December 16, 1973. The recommendation was increased to $16,000 on December 20, 1973 and this increased amount was actually awarded on January 24, 1974. The entire sum was paid to plaintiff on February 12, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">Under the terms of the incentive plan, no bonus is awarded until after the close of the performance year; the 1973 performance year ended on December 31, 1973. Thus, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>every eligible participant who was recommended for a bonus in 1973 was awarded a bonus, decedent\u2019s award nevertheless was not actually made until January 1974, subsequent to his death, and under the terms of the plan the committee administering it retained the absolute discretion to grant or withhold the bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Exceptant has not shown that decedent had a vested right to the bonus at the time of his death. See <em>Mosow v. National Lock Co., </em>119 <em>Ill. App. </em>2d 232, 255 <em>N. E. </em>2d 500 (App. Ct. 1970); <em>Jones v. Vulcan Materials Co., </em>112 <em>Ga. App. </em>402, 145 <em>S. E. </em>2d 268 (Ct. App. 1965); <em>Parrish v. General Motors Corp., </em>137 <em>So. </em>2d 255 (Fla. D. Ct. App. 1962); Annotation, \u201cPromise by employer to pay bonus as creating valid and enforceable contract,\u201d 43 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 503 (1972), and Annotation, \u201cRights and liabilities as between employer and employee with respect to general bonus or profit sharing plan,\u201d 81 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d 1066 (1962),</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">There is no evidence in the record here that Monsanto awarded decedent a bonus each year for several years, and thus might have created an implied contract to pay the bonus in 1973. See <em>Simon v. Riblet Tramway Co., </em>8 <em>Wash. App. </em>289, 505 <em>P. </em>2d 1291 (Ct. App. 1973), <em>cert. </em>den. 414 <em>U. S. </em>975, 94 <em>S. Ct. </em>289, 38 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 218 (1973); <em>Thatcher v. Wasatch Chemical Co., </em>29 <em>Utah </em>2d 189, 507 <em>P. </em>2d 365 (Sup. Ct. 1973); Annotation, \u201cMaster and Servant: regular payment of bonus to employee, without express contract to do so, as raising implication of contract for bonus.\u201d 66 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d at 1075 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\"><em>Hainline v. General Motors Corp., </em>444 <em>F. </em>2d 1250 (6 Cir. 1971), and <em>Russell v. Princeton Laboratories, Inc., </em>50 <em>N. J. </em>30 (1967), upon which the trial judge relied, are clearly distinguishable. In <em>Mainline </em>the bonus in question had already been awarded but had not yet been distributed on the date plaintiff employee terminated his employment. It was, under those circumstances, held that plaintiff had a contractual right to the bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number><em>Russell v. Princeton Laboratories, Inc., </em>held that the plaintiff employee was entitled to his share of the employees\u2019 profit-sharing trust when, because unavoidable exposure to certain substances had been harmful to his health, his employment was terminated. The profit-sharing plan constituted deferred compensation, and there was no doubt that the plaintiff there had earned his share. Here, on the other hand, the bonus was not actually awarded until after decedent\u2019s death, and the committee administering the plan retained the discretion to make or withhold the award at least until the end of the calendar year.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">If decedent\u2019s employment had been terminated for some reason other than his death, or if the employer had refused to award the bonus, decedent\u2019s entitlement to the sum in question would depend upon the circumstances. While the committee administering the plan may not act arbitrarily, <em>Russell v. Princeton Laboratories, Inc., </em>and <em>Hainline v. General Motors Corp., </em>above, that fact does not compel the conclusion that the decedent here had a vested right to the bonus since the purpose of the management incentive plan was to reward an employee for outstanding work, and not to entitle him to a bonus as a matter of right. Decedent clearly had no vested right to the bonus and, accordingly, we find that it should not have been included in his estate subject to creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
