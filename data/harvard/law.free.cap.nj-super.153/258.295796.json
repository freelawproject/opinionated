A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A2V\">Defendant was indicted in four counts charging him with conspiracy <em>{N. J. S. A. </em>2A:98-1 and 2A:98-2) (count 1) ; misconduct in office <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A: 85-1 and 2A.-85-14) (count 2); solicitation of misconduct in office of Charles Dorman <em>{N. J. S. A. </em>2A:85-1) (count 3), and bribery of Dorman in violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A: 85-1 (count 4). After a jury trial he was found guilty on all counts with the exception of the conspiracy charge (count 1). He was sentenced to an aggregate term of 364 days in the county jail, all but four months of which was suspended. A total tine of $1,000 was also imposed, and he was placed on probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Defendant appeals on the following grounds: (1) \u201cthe statements made by * * * Earinella to * * * Greydanus and testified to by Greydanus as an exception to the hearsay rule under <em>[Evid. R. </em>63(9)] should not have been admitted in evidence since they violated the defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses as provided by the Sixth Amendment of the H. S. Constitution\u201d; (2) \u201cthe testimony of * * * Greydanus as to payment by him to the defendant of $500 should have been excluded by the trial court under <em>[Evid. R. </em>4] since the testimony clearly revealed that said payment was a gift\u201d; (3) \u201cthe taped conversation between * * * Scaletti <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>and * * * Gola on January 16, 1975, an alleged co-conspirator, should not have been admitted in evidence against the defendant since the declarations of Gola were not in furtherance of the conspiracy\u201d; (4) \u201cthe trial judge should have granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:18-2 on count two [misconduct in office] because the defendant was found not guilty of count one \u2014\u2022 conspiracy\u201d; and (5) \u201cjustice mandates a new trial as to counts two, three and four [misconduct in office, solicitation of misconduct in office and bribery] since a multitude of evidence was admitted in evidence under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule and the defendant was found not guilty of conspiracy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">We have reviewed the record in the light of applicable law and find that there is plainly no merit to any of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">It is established that evidence of hearsay statements made by co-conspirators pursuant to <em>Evid. R. </em>63(9) does not offend the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of the right to confront witnesses. <em>State v. Sherwin, </em>127 <em>N. J. Super. </em>370, 382-383 (App. Div.), certif. den. 65 <em>N. J. </em>569, <em>cert. </em>dism. sub nom. <em>Loughran v. New Jersey, </em>419 <em>U. S. </em>801, 95 <em>S. Ct. </em>9, 42 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 32 (1974); <em>State v. Seaman, </em>114 <em>N. J. Super. </em>19, 27-28 (App. Div.), certif. den. 58 <em>N. J. </em>594 (1971), <em>cert. </em>den. 404 <em>U. S. </em>1015, 92 <em>S. Ct. </em>674, 30 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>662 (1972); <em>State v. Boiardo, </em>111 <em>N. J. Super. </em>219, 229-230 (App. Div. 1970), certif. den. 57 <em>N. J. </em>130 (1970), <em>cert. </em>den. 401 <em>U. S. </em>948, 91 <em>S. Ct. </em>931, 28 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>231 (1971). Such evidence is clearly admissible as long as there is independent proof of the conspiracy and defendant\u2019s participation therein. <em>State v. Boiardo, supra, </em>111 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Such independent proof was provided by the testimony of defendant\u2019s fellow freeholder Dorman, who stated that defendant solicited his help in creating a voting bloc for the purposes of extorting money from those individuals and businesses seeking to do work for the county. Dorman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>testified to receiving money from defendant to solidify this pact, which he later returned to defendant. This showing of the likelihood of an illicit association was sufficient independent proof to permit the admission of hearsay statements of the other alleged co-conspirators against the defendant under <em>Evict. R. </em>63 (9). <em>State v. Sherwin, supra, </em>127 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The testimony of Greydanus, a victim of the extortion scheme, with respect to a payment by him to defendant of $500 was properly before the jury. Contrary to defendant\u2019s claim, the testimony that this was a gift was not uncontradicted. Greydanus\u2019 testimony regarding a statement made to him by Farinella, an alleged co-conspirator, clearly raised an inference that the $500 may not have been a gift at all. A fact issue was thus created for the jury\u2019s determination. The evidence was properly placed before it in that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\"> We are satisfied that the taped conversation between Gola, one of the alleged co-conspirators, and another victim of the extortion scheme, Scaletti, was properly admitted under <em>Evid. R. </em>63(9) as in furtherance of the conspiracy. It reasonably may be inferred therefrom that the conspiracy was to continue beyond the date of that conversation. See <em>State v. Farinella, </em>150 <em>N. J. Super. </em>61, 67 (App. Div. 1977). In any event, there was ample other evidence of the conspiracy which would justify the admission of this conversation as being in furtherance thereof. Moreover, both the victim and the alleged co-conspirator were available to defendant for cross-examination as to that conversation, since both of them testified at the trial. <em>Cf. United States v. Rodriguez, </em>509 <em>F. </em>2d 1342 (5 Cir. 1975); <em>Clemons v. United States, </em>133 <em>U. S. App. D. C. </em>27, 39-40, 408 <em>F. </em>2d 1230, 1242-1243 (D. C. Cir. 1968), <em>cert. </em>den. 394 <em>U. S. </em>964, 89 <em>S. Ct. </em>1318, 22 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 567 (1969). Defendant was in no wise prejudiced by reason of the admission thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Defendant claims that a post-trial judgment of acquittal should have been granted on the misconduct in office charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>(count 2). He contends that the jury\u2019s determination of innocence as to the conspiracy offense .(count 1) is inconsistent with its guilty finding as to misconduct in office, since the count charging such misconduct in office was framed in terms of defendant\u2019s action in concert with the same alleged co-conspirators named in the conspiracy count. Hence, it is argued a not guilty verdict as to the conspiracy mandated as well a determination of not guilty as to the misconduct in office charge. This claim is without substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"> The crime of conspiracy is a separate offense from the substantive crime that was the object of such conspiracy and that was charged as a separate count in the indictment. The acquittal on the conspiracy charge (count 1) does not require a reversal of the misconduct in office conviction (count 2). Consistency in the verdicts on both counts of the indictment is not necessary. See <em>State v. Roller, </em>29 <em>N. J. </em>339, 348-350 (1959); <em>State v. Lawrence, </em>142 <em>N. J. Super. </em>208, 215-216 (App. Div. 1976); <em>State v. Still, </em>112 <em>N. J. Super. </em>368, 373 (App. Div. 1970), certif. den. 57 <em>N. J. </em>600 (1971)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Viewing the evidence in its entirety, and giving the State the benefit of all the favorable inferences which could reasonably be drawn therefrom, a jury could fairly find that defendant\u2019s guilt on the misconduct in office count was established beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal of that charge was properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>denied. <em>R. </em>3:18-2; <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N. J. </em>454, 458-459 (1967); <em>State v. Rodriquez, </em>141 <em>N. J. Super. </em>7 (App. Div.), certif. den. 71 <em>N. J. </em>495 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">There is likewise no basis for defendant\u2019s claims that the alleged co-conspirators\u2019 hearsay testimony admitted pursuant to <em>Evid. R. </em>63(9) prejudicially tainted the jury\u2019s determination with regard to the substantive charges in the indictment. The trial judge charged the jury that such testimony was to be considered only if it found a conspiracy had been established by independent proof in the ease. Since the jury concluded that the State had failed to prove defendant guilty of conspiracy, it presumably did not consider such hearsay testimony for purposes of deciding defendant\u2019s guilt as to the three substantive charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Moreover, a careful examination of the proofs persuades us that there was ample credible evidence \u2014 entirely apart from the hearsay statements of such co-conspirators \u2014 to support the jury verdicts of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on the substantive offenses charged in counts 2, 3 and 4. The misconduct in office charge (count 2), the solicitation of misconduct in office of Charles Dorman (count 3) and the bribery of Charles Dorman (count 4) were all supported by Dorman\u2019s own testimony, which the jury reasonably could believe. Additionally, the misconduct in office charge (count 2) was also supported by the jury\u2019s not unreasonable apparent refusal to credit the testimony given by both Greydanus and defendant on the stand that the $500 payment from Greydanus to defendant was in fact a gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Thus, we are fully satisfied that the admission of the alleged co-conspirators\u2019 hearsay statements did not taint or prejudicially affect the jury\u2019s verdicts on the substantive charges; and that the verdicts did not constitute a miscarriage of justice under the law. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial properly was denied. <em>R. </em>2:10-1; <em>State v. Sims, </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>359, 373-374 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">We note that the misconduct in office charge (count 2) alleges that it was committed while defendant acted \u201cin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>concert\" with the two other freeholders, Gola and Earinella. As already indicated, the conspiracy charge also involved the same persons and the jury acquitted defendant of that' charge. We need not speculate as to the reasons that prompted such acquittal. There was adequate independent proof of the likelihood of defendant\u2019s illicit association and plan with these men, in connection with the misconduct in office charge, to justify the admission into evidence, and consideration by the jury, of their hearsay statements with respect to that substantive offense \u2014 and this, irrespective of the jury\u2019s acquittal on the conspiracy charge and even if there had been no separate conspiracy count. See <em>State v. Louf, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>173, 176-178 (1973); <em>State v. Sherwin, supra, </em>127 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 383; <em>State v. Seaman, supra, </em>111 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">In any event,- in view of our conclusion that the allaged co-conspirators\u2019 hearsay statements did not taint the verdicts as to any of the three substantive counts, we need not decide whether, under the circumstances of this case, the jury nevertheless properly could have considered these statements, in connection with the other proofs, on all of the substantive offenses, once the court had ruled in favor of their admissibility under <em>Evid. R. </em>63(9). See and compare <em>State v. Louf, supra; State v. Boiardo, supra, </em>111 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 235-236. See also <em>United States v. Rodrigues, </em>491 <em>F. </em>2d 663, 666 ,(3 Cir. 1974); <em>United States v. Ragland, </em>375 <em>F. </em>2d 471, 478-479 (3 Cir. 1967), <em>cert. </em>den. 390 <em>U. S. </em>925, 88 <em>S. Ct. </em>860, 19 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 987 (1968); <em>State v. Farinella, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Actually, he was given a sentence of 364 days on count 2, misconduct in office; he was to serve 4 months and the balance of the term was suspended; he was placed on 1 year\u2019s probation and a $500 fine was imposed. On count 3, solicitation of misconduct in office, a suspended sentence for a term of 364 days to the county jail and a $500 fine were imposed. On count 4 involving bribery, a suspended sentence of 364 days to the county jail was imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on cases such as <em>State v. Cormier, </em>46 <em>N. J. </em>494 (1966), is misplaced. <em>Cormier </em>involved two separate trials on separate indictments. The first trial resulted in an acquittal of a conspiracy to obtain loans from banks through false statements. Defendant was thereafter separately tried for the offense of obtaining such loans and was found guilty. During that trial the evidence was substantially the same as that introduced in the first trial. Under these circumstances, the Supreme Court invoked the doctrine of collateral estoppel and reversed the second conviction. Here, there was no severance of the conspiracy and substantive counts. <em>Cormier </em>does not apply where there is a single trial of multiple counts of the same indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b288-6\">We note additionally that the jury here found guilt on the substantive misconduct in office offense (count 2) in which concerted action was charged. This implicit determination of planned action may also support the use by it of such co-conspirators\u2019 hearsay statements as to the other substantive counts (counts 3 and 4).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
