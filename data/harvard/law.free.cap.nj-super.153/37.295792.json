Plaintiff was employed by defendant for <em>27 </em>years in its Allied Churgin and Sadkin Laboratories Dental Division (Allied) as a salesman. His territory consisted primarily of Essex and Union Counties and the accounts serviced by him represented annual sales of more than $800,000, or almost <em>25% </em>of Allied\u2019s gross sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">On October <em>25, </em>1973 defendant circulated to all of its employees a policy statement covering \u201cthe subjects of conflicts of interest, gifts, gratuities, confidential information, trade secrets and inventions.\u201d Employees were requested to sign and return a letter of acknowledgment. Included in the policy statement was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">The Company has developed and continues to develop and use commercially valuable proprietary technical and nontechnical information which is vital to the success of the Company\u2019s business. Employees are employed by the Company in a capacity in which they may become acquainted with such information and may in fact contribute thereto either by inventions, discoveries, designs, improvements or otherwise. In order to guard the legitimate interest of the Company, it is necessary for the Company to protect certain of the information either by patents or by holding such information secret or confidential.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">Therefore, in consideration of and as part of the terms of employment of the Employee by the Company, it is the Company\u2019s policy to require each of its employees to comply with the following policies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\"><em>* </em>* <em>* </em>* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">For a period of twelve months following the termination of an Employee\u2019s employment with the Company, he shall not directly or indirectly solicit any customer of the Company for whom he performed services while employed by the Company or which he solicited on behalf of the Company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">A letter acknowledging receipt of tbe statement and the understanding \u201cthat the obligations which arise thereunder shall continue after the expiration of [his] employment with the Company\u201d was signed by plaintiff on May 9, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Plaintiff was discharged February 11, 1977 and, on June 14, 1977, filed a verified complaint in which he sought, among other things,</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">(1) a judgment declaring the policy statement void and unenforceable;</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">(2) an injunction against any further action by defendant predicated upon the policy statement, and</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">(3) a restraint against defendant\u2019s interference with plaintiff\u2019s business relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Plaintiff, by way of order to show cause supported by affidavits, sought' a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the restrictive covenant pending final hearing. Following a hearing on the return day of the order to show cause the trial judge, in an opinion reported at 151 <em>N. J. Super. </em>344 (Ch. Div. 1977), held \u201cas a matter of law that the instant restrictive covenant prohibiting post-employment solicitation of customers is void and unenforceable for want of consideration\u201d and entered a permanent injunction against its enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">An employee\u2019s restrictive covenant against post-employment competition ancillary to a contract of employment will be given effect if the covenant \u201cis reasonable under all the circumstances of the particular case\u201d and it will generally be found to be reasonable if it \u201csimply protects the legitimate interest of the employer, imposes no undue hardship on the employee and is not injurious to the public.\u201d <em>Whitmyer Bros., Inc. v. Doyle, </em>58 <em>N. J. </em>25 (1975) ; <em>Solari Industries, Inc. v. Malady, </em>55 <em>N. J. </em>571, 585 (1970) ; A. <em>Hollander &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Imperial Fur Blending Corp., </em>2 <em>N. J. </em>235, 248-49 (1949) ; <em>Karlin v. Weinberg, </em>148 <em>N. J. Super. </em>243 (App. Div. 1977); <em>Ideal Laundry Co. v. Gugliemone, </em>107 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>108 (E. &amp; A. 1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\"> The enforcement of such restrictive covenants does not depend upon the existence of a written contract of employment for such contracts need not be in writing but may be evidenced by conduct rather than words, <em>Gomez v. Federal Stevedoring Co., Inc., </em>5 <em>N. J. Super. </em>100, 103 (App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Div. 1949); <em>Savarese v. Pyrene Mfg. Co., </em>9 <em>N. J. </em>595 (1952), and where, as here, no definite term is indicated, the contract is deemed to be at will and subject to termination with or without cause. <em>Jorgensen v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 25 N. J. </em>541, 554 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Here, since defendant seeks the benefit of the restrictive covenant in the counties of Essex and Union only and for a period of one year from February 11, 1977, plaintiff concedes it is-not unreasonable in either the space or time components thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Defendant also concedes that an employer has no legitimate interest in preventing competition as such and that where mere customer lists (dentists, here) may be readily ascertained from public sources, such lists may not be protected by valid restrictive covenants. Defendant contends, \u25a0however, that throughout plaintiff\u2019s 27-year employment he was engaged in calling on basically the same customers and was required to file reports concerning these calls and the relationship existing between defendant and the customers. Plaintiff was paid to develop a \u201cclose customer relationship\u201d which, defendant argues, is a legitimate interest for the protection of a restrictive covenant, citing <em>Whitmyer Bros., Inc. v. Doyle, supra </em>58 <em>N. J. </em>at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"A9W\">We need not pass upon that question, for the specific issue presented by this appeal, as stated by the judge, is \u201cwhether continued employment constitutes consideration sufficient to support an employee\u2019s restrictive covenant not to engage in post-employment solicitation of customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The validity and enforceability of such covenants, as with any covenant, rest in part upon the existence of good and sufficient consideration. <em>A. Hollander &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Imperial Fur Blending Corp., supra </em>2 <em>N. J. </em>at 249; <em>Ideal Laundry Co. v. Gugliemone, supra </em>107 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>at 110; <em>Sarco Company of New Jersey v. Gulliver, </em>3 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>641, 649, 129 <em>A. </em>399 (Ch. 1925), aff\u2019d o. b. 99 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>432 (E. &amp; A. 1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The existence of sufficient consideration to support a post-employment restraint may be found in either the original contract of employment or in a post-employment contract, where the supporting consideration is at least, in part, the continuation of employment. <em>Sarco Company of New Jersey v. Gulliver, supra </em>at 649; <em>R. L. Guttridge, Inc. v. Wean, </em>8 <em>N. J. Super. </em>450, 453 (Ch. 1950); <em>Credit Rating Service, Inc. v. Charlesworth, </em>126 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>360, 362 (Ch. 1939); <em>McCombs v. McClelland, </em>223 <em>Or. </em>475, 354 <em>P. </em>2d 311 (1960) ; <em>Boessler v. Burwell, </em>119 <em>Conn. </em>289, 176 <em>A. </em>126 (S. Ct. Err. (1934)); Annotation, \u201cNon-Competition Clauses,\u201d 51 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 825, 835 (1973); Blake, \u201cEmployee Agreements Not to Compete,\u201d 73 <em>Harv. L. Rev. </em>625, n. 1 (1960); <em>cf. Credit Bureau Management Co. v. Huie, </em>254 <em>F. Supp. </em>547 (E. D. Ark. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\"> A verbalized threat of immediate discharge in the event the employee does not sign a proposed restrictive covenant is not necessary to constitute the consideration required to support a post-employment contract. Such a consequence can be inferred from conduct. Here the request for the restrictive covenant, first made in October 1973 and repeated in May 1974, indicates that the employer was insisting upon its execution. The continuation of plaintiffs employment for approximately three years after he signed the letter which acknowledges the covenant also provides consideration for the restrictive covenant. <em>Farm Bureau Service Co. of Maynard v. Kohls, </em>203 <em>N. W. </em>2d 209 (Iowa Sup. Ct. 1972) ; <em>Daughtry v. Capital Gas Co., Inc., </em>285 <em>Ala. </em>89, 229 <em>So. </em>2d 480 (Sup. Ct. 1969), reffg den. Jan. 8, 1970; <em>Thomas v. Coastal Industrial Svcs., Inc., </em>214 <em>Ga. </em>832, 108 <em>S. E. </em>2d 328 (Sup. Ct. 1959); <em>Roessler v. Burwell, </em>119 <em>Conn. </em>289, 176 A. 126 (Sup. Ct. Err. 1934); <em>Bettinger v. North Fort Worth Ice Co., </em>278 <em>S. W. </em>466 (Tex. Civ. App. 1925); <em>cf. Credit Rating Service v.

Misc. </em>at 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>We conclude that the trial judge erred in holding, as a matter of law, that there was a lack of consideration to support the restrictive covenant and, accordingly, vacate the permanent injunction and remand the matter for further proceedings on the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
