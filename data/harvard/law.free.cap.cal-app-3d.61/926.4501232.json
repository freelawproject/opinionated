J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJR\">Petitioners, certain Los Angeles County employees and their union, appeal from judgments in favor of the County of Los Angeles and various County officials (defendant County), after the trial court denied petitions for writ of mandate. This appeal involves two actions filed separately but consolidated for hearing and on appeal, apparently because the parties agree that the issues in both cases are the same.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">Petitioners are County tractor operators and their union, and the union on behalf of County nursing employees. <em>(Ante, </em>fn. 1.) Their basic grievance is that the job classifications of both groups of employees were downrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>\n<em>The Tractor Operators</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">Sometime before July 21, 1971, the Los Angeles County Director of Personnel conducted studies of the utility tractor operator (UTO) positions and recommended to the Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission that the positions be reclassified, chiefly to the lower position of light tractor operator (LTO). On July Si, 1971, the civil service commission approved the recommended reclassifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">On August 19, 1971, all 28 UTOs were notified by letter that the study resulted in 21 men \u201cbeing reclassified to a new position of Light Tractor Operator effective October 1, 1971.\u201d The letter explained that only six of the remaining UTO positions were funded and those six positions would be filled by \u201cthe 6 senior qualified Utility Tractor Operators in the Department.\u201d Those employees who elected to accept the reduction from UTO to LTO would \u201chave their salaries frozen October 1, 1971.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The letter further informed the tractor operators that they \u201cmust\u201d indicate whether they would accept the reduction and that the choice would not preclude them \u201cfrom requesting a review by the Director of Personnel.\u201d They had to submit their \u201cdecision ... by Friday, August 27, 1971.\u201d Requests for review had to be \u201cmade in writing\u201d within 30 days of receipt of the notification.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Apparently all of the affected tractor operator employees accepted the reduction in rank. None of them requested review by the director of personnel. Rather, an action for injunctive relief was filed on September 30, 1971 <em>(ante, </em>fn. 1). Relief was denied in November 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">\n<em>The Nurses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">Sometime before April 23, 1973, the director of personnel conducted a study of the classification of nursing employee positions and recommended to the civil service commission that certain of those positions be reclassified. The commission held hearings on April 23 and 30, 1973, and approved the reclassification on May 23, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">The affected employees were notified by letter about the reclassification, which was to be effective August 1, 1973. They were informed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>they would be required to decide whether to accept the reduction by August 1 and that they could request the director of personnel to review the findings. The letter described the review and appeals procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Over 200 nursing employees affected by the reclassification sought review of the classification under civil service commission rules. At the time this action was heard, the review had not yet been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">\n<em>The County Rules</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Rule 6 of the Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission rules provides generally for classification of all positions within the county civil service system. Rule 6.01 sets forth the standards for job classification. Rule 6.03(d) provides that when the director of personnel \u201chas completed his classification findings he shall report and certify to the Commission that his findings were based on specifications established by the Commission . .. .\u201d If the commission does not approve of changes, it may refer them back to the director of personnel or set them for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Rule 6.02(b) also contains a provision for commission hearings at the request of interested parties before commission approval of the director\u2019s report and findings. The UTOs had failed to request such a hearing before the July 21, 1971 reclassification. The nurses apparently did request a hearing, since, as noted, one was held on April 23 and 30, 1973, at which hearing they appeared and expressed their views.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Rule 6.04 provides for two-stage administrative \u201creviews and appeals\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">\u201cAny employee . . . affected by any classification action may request the Director of Personnel to review such action. Such request for review ... shall be made in writing within 30 days of notification of such action. . . . After notification of the results of such review by the Director of Personnel the employee . . . may appeal therefrom to the Commission. Such appeal shall be made not later than ten business days after date of notification of results of review and shall be made in accordance with Rule 5.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">\n<em>Petitioners\u2019 Allegations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">Petitioners alleged, first, that the commission has unlawfully delegated the task of reclassification to the director of personnel, and, second that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>it has failed to implement section 34(10) of article IX of the Los Angeles County Charter which, they claim, confers on county employees who are laid off or reduced without fault an - absolute right to be reinstated to their former positions within one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">The County denied any illegality and affirmatively alleged that petitioners were barred from judicial review because they had not exhausted their administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The trial court made findings of fact and conclusions of law. It concluded that neither the tractor operators nor the nurses had exhausted their administrative remedies, but also ruled on the merits of petitioners\u2019 legal assertions and found that the commission had not unlawfully delegated its duties under the charter, and that the commission had adopted rules consistent with the duty imposed oh them by the County charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">None of the tractor operators sought administrative review of the reclassification. Some of the nursing employees did, but filed legal action before the review was complete. All contend that there is no adequate administrative remedy afforded to any employee who has been reclassified.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Petitioners recognize the rule that \u201ca party must exhaust his administrative remedies prior to seeking relief in the courts. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Martino </em>v. <em>Concord Community Hosp. Dist., </em>233 Cal.App.2d 51, 56 [43 Cal.Rptr. 255].) They rely on the exception: \u201cHowever, this rule has no application in a situation where an administrative remedy is unavailable or inadequate. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">Petitioners claim the administrative remedy is inadequate for several reasons. First, they point out that the tractor operators were notified of the reclassification on August 19, and required to seek administrative review by about September 18, although, in fact, no one of the tractor operators would know until September 27 whether they were, in fact, affected by the reclassification.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">It is true that the letter to the tractor operators informed them that if any operator did \u201cnot accept the classification findings,\u201d the request for review by the director of personnel \u201cmust be made in writing . . . within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>30 days of your receipt of this notification.\u201d At worst, this requirement meant that, because six operators would not be adversely affected by the reclassification, any protest would become moot. The operators were informed that a willingness to accept a reduction would not \u201cpreclude\u201d them from \u201crequesting a review,\u201d and, thus, would not have been harmed by any protest that turned out to be unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Moreover, the original action for injunctive relief was filed on behalf of all the tractor operators, indicating that at least part of the disagreement was with the reclassification of <em>any </em>tractor operator. To the extent that the tractor operators opposed the reclassification, there would have been nothing futile in requesting a hearing on that issue within the time limits required by the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Petitioners, essentially asserting their claim on the merits, contend that the administrative remedy is inadequate because the director of personnel does not submit to the commission a \u201creport of facts as to why certain classification actions have been taken\u201d and the \u201cemployee, therefore, is left with <em>nothing </em>upon which to base an appeal initially to the Director of Personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Petitioners\u2019 argument is based on a curious misreading of the holding in <em>Schecter </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>258 Cal.App.2d 391 [65 Cal.Rptr. 739]. There the court nullified a refusal of the board of supervisors to implement a reclassification by the commission which was not concurred in by its staff. The board\u2019s refusal was, apparently, based on the patently erroneous. theory that the commission\u2019s only function was a ritual rubberstamping of the staff\u2019s decisions. Although after <em>Schecter </em>the commission amended its rules on reclassification to differentiate more clearly between the staff\u2019s function and that of the commission, petitioner claims that it is still rubberstamping the staff\u2019s recommendations in making its initial determinations to reclassify.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">Just why this should make administrative review useless is not explained. Even if a particular finding by the director is erroneously rubberstamped by the commission, one of the purposes of the review and appeal procedure set forth in rule 6.04 is to give the commission a chance to mend its ways by doing its job properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">In any event, the record does not support the assertion that somehow since <em>Schecter, </em>the commission has abandoned its independence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>judgment and come to share the Board\u2019s erroneous view that its functions are ceremonial. Assuming that staff recommendations on reclassifications that are not opposed by affected employees under rule 6.02(b) are routinely approved, nothing indicates that these recommendations do not follow the commission\u2019s guidelines. Surely the commission may assume that its directives have been followed, particularly where no objection to the staff findings is voiced. We know from this very record that when the nurses did object, the commission held two days of hearings at which they aired their grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">Petitioners\u2019 second reason for not seeking administrative review is even weaker. They argue that because the first-stage review by the director under rule 6.04(a) might result in a change without action by the commission, the review procedure is an unauthorized delegation of the commission\u2019s discretion. Even if it is a legitimate argument that an affected employee need not seek administrative relief because, if granted, it would be tainted, the argument does not explain petitioners\u2019 failure to appeal to the commission itself, as was their privilege under rule 6.04(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Finally, petitioners\u2019 reliance on <em>Endler </em>v. <em>Schutzbank, </em>68 Cal.2d 162 [65 Cal.Rptr. 297, 436 P.2d 297], is misplaced. There the hearing offered by the commission was \u201c \u2018an informal hearing\u2019 \u201d which was \u201c \u2018not undertaken pursuant to any . . . statutory authority, . . . not to be in accordance with administrative procedures . . .\u2019 \u201d and would have been held \u201c \u2018without prejudice to the rights of the parties ....\u2019\u201d (68 Cal.2d at p. 167.) In those circumstances, the court held that the exhaustion of remedies doctrine does not apply where a \u201cmanifestly defective\u201d hearing is proposed. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Petitioners cannot and do not contend that the review and appeal provided by commission rules is \u201cmanifestly defective\u201d in the sense used in Endler.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n                   Rather, they point out that the nursing positions were reclassified effective July 13, 1973; that 225 nurses requested review and that, as of January 15, 1974, only 2 of those requests for review had been acted on by the director and appealed to the civil service commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>That the director of personnel and the commission have not processed 225 requests for review filed at about the same time within 7 months, is, without more, not grounds to assert that the administrative remedy is inadequate. Petitioners make no showing that other administrative boards work with greater dispatch under comparable circumstances. Moreover, the record does not indicate to what extent the delays are attributable to the nurses or the petitioning union or the pendency of this very litigation in which petitioners assert\u2014for reasons other than delay\u2014that the administrative review can be bypassed.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Finally, assuming that the nursing employees sought administrative review in good faith, it is not clear why, legal entitlement aside, each employee needs a separate hearing on matters which petitioners otherwise claim affect all such employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">In brief, petitioners have provided no justification for failing to exhaust the administrative remedies provided by the rules of the Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">We are, therefore, quite convinced that as far as petitioners\u2019 grievances against their reclassifications are concerned, the failure to exhaust administrative remedies forecloses them from .arguing the merits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Reasonable minds can, however, differ on whether the commission\u2019s alleged failure to implement section 34(10) of article IX of the County charter could have been attacked by the administrative remedies provided in the commission\u2019s rules. We therefore discuss that issue on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">Section 34 of article IX of the charter provides that the commission shall make rules \u201c. . . (10) . . . for reinstatement within one year of persons who without fault or delinquency on their part are separated from the service or reduced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>The commission has implemented section 34(10) in a variety of ways. Rules 6.05(b), 18.01, 18.02, 20.08, and 20.09, all quoted below,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> are a more than adequate implementation of the mandate of the charter. Petitioners\u2019 disagreement rests simply on their interpretation of section 34(10) as compelling the re-employment of employees who are laid off or reduced: In their view, section 34(10), in effect, mandates a one-year moratorium on over-employment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If that interpretation of the charter is correct, it would be self-executing and no implementation necessary.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>We agree with the county counsel that petitioners\u2019 interpretation of section 34(10) is \u201cabsurd.\u201d Reasonably interpreted, the section means that if an employee is separated or reduced without fault and there is an opening for which he is qualified within one year, he should have an opportunity to regain his former position. The rules quoted in footnote 7, <em>ante, </em>more than implement that interpretation in that they extend the period to two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Ashby, J., and Hastings, 1, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b852-13\"> Petitioners in 2d Civil No. 46996 are tractor operators employed by the County and SEIU Local 660, AFL-CIO. In September 1971 they filed a complaint for an injunction, challenging a job reclassification rule that would reduce in rank some but not all of the Operators. After being denied an injunction, their action lay dormant until December 1973, when they moved for a writ of mandate on behalf of those operators who were in fact reduced in rank. Petitioner in 2d Civil No. 45778 is SEIU Local 660, on behalf of County nursing employees, who were reduced in rank based on a reclassification of their jobs. That petition for writ of mandate was filed several days after the tractor operators moved for a writ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b853-11\"> The County\u2019s rules provide for a so-called \u201cY rate,\u201d under which an employee whose position is reclassified to a lower level continues \u201cto receive the same salary received immediately prior to the reclassification or salary schedule reduction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Aix\"> Rule 5 sets forth the procedure for hearings before the commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b857-7\"> Such an assertion would be frivolous in face of the meticulous procedures set forth in section 5, rules 5.01 through 5.16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b858-9\"> Civil service commission rules permit class action appeals if requested by \u201ctwo or more\u201d appealing persons.

If our discussion on the adequacy of administrative review appears to dispose of the merits as well, so be it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b859-4\"> Rule 6.05(b) reads as follows: \u201c(b) Whenever a position is reclassified from one class to a lower class the incumbent may elect to retain the position in the lower class. If.the incumbent declines to retain the position in the lower class, a layoff list shall be created and the position filled by demotion in lieu of layoff in accordance with the provisions of Rule 20. Any person demoted involuntarily to fill a position reclassified downward shall be placed on a re-employment list in accordance with the provisions of Rule 20.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Rule 18.01 reads as follows: <em>\u201cReinstatement After Separation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">\u201cAfter approval by the Director of Personnel, any person who has been separated' from County service, without fault or delinquency, may be reinstated by the appointing power within one year from the date of such separation, to any position he had held on an eligible basis prior to such separation or to any other position to which his transfer or reassignment from that position would be authorized by these Rules.

Lists from different departments or at different times for the same class of position shall be combined into a single list.

The court merely held that a civil service commission interpretation of section 141 which continued the salary level of employees in an outdated classification, did not violate section 151 of the charter which required \u201clike compensation for like service . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>at p. 523.) It seems clear that <em>Forstner </em>merely upheld the San Francisco commission\u2019s interpretation of section 141 of the charter to provide relief similar to the Los Angeles \u201cY rate\u201d of pay (See fin. 2, <em>ante) </em>which petitioners are receiving. In any event, <em>Forstner </em>certainly does not hold that the Los Angeles Charter provision which concerns itself with layoffs as well as reductions, must be interpreted as petitioners contend.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
