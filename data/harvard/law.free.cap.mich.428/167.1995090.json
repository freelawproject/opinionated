The principal issue is usually posed in terms of who must bear the \"burden of proof\u2019 in establishing the validity (or invalidity) of an arbitration agreement signed pursuant to the Medical Malpractice Arbitration Act, MCL 600.5040 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 27A.5040 <em>et seq. </em>(MMAA).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-14\">Because the Legislature in fashioning the mmaa took pains to declare that an arbitration agreement which conforms to the statute\u2019s requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>\"shall be presumed valid,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we believe the underlying question may be recast as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">What is the evidentiary effect of this statutory presumption upon the respective burdens of the parties in a suit for malpractice where jurisdiction is challenged on the ground that claims involved must be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the mmaa?</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">We hold that the burden of establishing the existence of an arbitration agreement that conforms to the strict requirements of the statute rests with the party seeking to enforce the agreement. Once prima facie evidence of such an agreement has been presented, the statutory presumption of validity accrues, and the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut the presumption then shifts to the party seeking to avoid the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">We are also asked to decide in <em>McKinstry </em>whether the parent of an unborn child can bind the child, after birth, to arbitrate disputes which arise out of the prenatal care and delivery of the child. We answer the question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">We begin our analysis with a review of the facts and procedural background of the two cases involved in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">\n<em>McKINSTRY v VALLEY OBSTETRICS-GYNECOLOGY CLINIC, PC</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">On October 17, 1978, plaintiff Kathleen (Mrs. Thomas) McKinstry was admitted to Saginaw General Hospital by employees of Valley Obstetrics-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Gynecology Clinic, P.C. She was suffering from a pregnancy complication, the symptoms of which included high blood pressure, headaches, dizziness, and the appearance of spots before her eyes. Upon admission to the hospital, Mrs. McKinstry signed two arbitration agreements, one in her name, and one in the name of \"Baby or Babies McKinstry.\u201d During her hospital stay, Mrs. McKinstry gave birth to a daughter, Amanda, who suffered a shoulder and arm injury known as Erb\u2019s Palsy. After she and Amanda were discharged from the hospital, Mrs. McKinstry did not revoke either of the arbitration agreements within the sixty-day period provided for by the agreements and MCL 600.5042(3); MSA 27A.5042(3). Plaintiff Thomas McKinstry was not a party to the agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">On February 27, 1980, plaintiffs Kathleen Mc-Kinstry, Thomas McKinstry, and Kathleen McKinstry as next friend of Amanda McKinstry, a minor, filed a complaint in Saginaw Circuit Court against Valley Obstetrics-Gynecology Clinic, P.C., and Saginaw General Hospital, seeking damages arising out of the alleged negligent delivery of Amanda McKinstry. Motions by the defendants for accelerated judgment on the basis of the two arbitration agreements were granted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the case for trial, holding that the mmaa was unconstitutional because the statutory agreement form failed to advise patients adequately as to how the arbitration panel would be selected. See <em>McKinstry v Valley Obstetrics-Gynecology Clinic, PC, </em>120 Mich App 479; 327 NW2d 507 (1982), vacated and remanded 419 Mich 873 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The Court vacated that judgment in light of <em>Morris v Metriyakool, </em>418 Mich 423; 344 NW2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>736 (1984), and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of other issues raised by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The Court of Appeals then remanded the case to the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether defendant hospital had complied with the statutory mandates of the mmaa when offering the arbitration agreements to Mrs. McKinstry.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Such a hearing was held, and the trial court found that the signed arbitration agreements were valid on their faces and that plaintiffs had failed in their burden to avoid the agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">This case was then returned to the Court of Appeals, and that Court upheld the trial court\u2019s grant of accelerated judgment for defendants. <em>McKinstry v Valley Obstetrics-Gynecology Clinic, PC (After Remand), </em>146 Mich App 307; 380 NW2d 93 (1985). Upon application, leave was granted to appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">\n<em>GUERTIN v MARRELLA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">The plaintiff Robert Guertin underwent corrective foot surgery in December, 1979, at Hutzel Hospital \u2014 Warren Division. In April, 1983, plaintiff filed the instant suit against defendants Basil Marrella, D.P.M., Thomas Bauder, D.P.M., and Hutzel Hospital \u2014 Warren Division because of his dissatisfaction with the surgical results. The defendants moved for accelerated judgment or, in the alternative, for an order compelling arbitration on the basis of a December 12, 1979, arbitration agreement signed by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">An evidentiary hearing was held to determine the validity of the arbitration agreement. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>outset, the trial court ruled that the agreement must be presumed valid since it conformed to the statutory requirements. Later, the trial court found that the plaintiff had failed to present sufficient evidence that the agreement had been the product of fraud or misrepresentation and ordered arbitration. Plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the trial court had improperly placed upon plaintiff the burden of proving the invalidity of the arbitration agreement. <em>Guertin v Marrella, </em>149 Mich App 420; 385 NW2d 805 (1986). The case was remanded for further proceedings because the Court of Appeals could not say \"that, had the burden been properly placed with the defendant, the ruling of the trial court would have been the same.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Defendants then applied for, and this Court granted, leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Sections 5041 and 5042 of the mmaa provide that a \"health care provider\u201d may, and a \"hospital\u201d must, offer to arbitrate disputes arising from the provision of health care. In order to be enforceable under the mmaa, the offer must be made in compliance with the following statutory conditions:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">(1) The offer to arbitrate must be in writing;</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">(2) The offer, if accepted by the patient, must, for sixty days, be revocable in writing;</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">(3) The agreement must state, above the signature line in twelve-point boldface type: \"This agreement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>ARBITRATE IS NOT A PREREQUISITE TO HEALTH CARE OR TREATMENT AND MAY BE REVOKED WITHIN 60 DAYS AFTER EXECUTION BY NOTIFICATION IN WRITING\u201d TO_;</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">(4) The patient must be given a booklet detailing the specific provisions of the arbitration agreement;</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">(5) The patient must be given a copy of the arbitration agreement; and</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">(6) The offer to arbitrate must not precede the provision of emergency medical care. MCL 600.5041, 600.5042; MSA 27A.5041, 27A.5042.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">As already noted, the Legislature took care to provide that an agreement to arbitrate which conforms to the statute\u2019s requirements \"shall be presumed valid.\u201d MCL 600.5041(7), 600.5042(8); MSA 27A.6041(7), 27A.5042(8).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Plaintiffs in the cases before us argue that enforcement of such an arbitration agreement would deprive them of constitutional rights to a jury trial and court access, and thus maintain that the burden should rest upon the defendants to show a valid contract. Plaintiffs cite <em>Moore v Fragatos, </em>116 Mich App 179; 321 NW2d 781 (1982), in which a panel of the Court of Appeals viewed the arbitration agreement as a waiver of a constitutional right and reasoned that existence of such a waiver is never presumed, but requires an affirmative showing that the waiver was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. The <em>Moore </em>Court placed the burden on the defendant to demonstrate by such an affirmative showing that the plaintiff had waived his rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>In response, defendants contend that arbitration is a matter of contract and that one who signs a written agreement is presumed to understand it. Under the act, an agreement which conforms to statutory requirements is presumed to be valid, MCL 600.5041(7), 600.5042(8); MSA 27A.5041(7), 27A.5042(8). Defendants therefore argue that the burden of proving the invalidity of the arbitration agreement rests with plaintiffs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Prior analysis has accorded little weight to the evidentiary aspects of this issue. The essence of the matter at hand, however, involves an assessment of the evidentiary effect of this statutory presumption upon the respective burdens otherwise borne by the parties. We thus momentarily bypass constitutional and policy concerns which have preoccupied courts before us and revisit basic evidence principles regarding presumptions and the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The term \"burden of proof\" encompasses two separate meanings. 9 Wigmore, Evidence (Chad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>bourn rev), \u00a7 2483 <em>et seq., </em>pp 276 ff.; McCormick, Evidence (3d ed), \u00a7 336, p 946. One of these meanings is the burden of persuasion or the risk of nonpersuasion. The other is the burden of going forward or the risk of nonproduction. <em>Kar v Ho</em>gan, 399 Mich 529; 251 NW2d 77 (1976). As explained by Professor McCormick:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">The burden of producing evidence on an issue means the liability to an adverse ruling (generally a finding or directed verdict) if evidence on the issue has not been produced. It is usually cast first upon the party who has pleaded the existence of the fact, but as we shall see, the burden may shift to the adversary when the pleader has discharged his initial duty. The burden of producing evidence is a critical mechanism in a jury trial, as it empowers the judge to decide the case without jury consideration when a party fails to sustain the burden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">The burden of persuasion becomes a crucial factor only if the parties have sustained their burdens of producing evidence and only when all of the evidence has been introduced. It does not shift from party to party during the course of the trial simply because it need not be allocated until it is time for a decision. When the time for a decision comes, the jury, if there is one, must be instructed how to decide the issue if their minds are left in doubt. The jury must be told that if the party having the burden of persuasion has failed to satisfy that burden, the issue is to be decided against him. If there is no jury and the judge finds himself in doubt, he too must decide the issue against the party having the burden of persuasion. [McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 336, p 947.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The immediate effect of a presumption is to shift the burden of going forward with the evidence related to the presumed fact. Rule 301 of the Michigan Rules of Evidence provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>In all civil actions and proceedings not otherwise provided for by statute or by these rules, a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption, but does not shift to such party the burden of proof in the sense of the risk of nonpersuasion, which remains throughout the trial upon the party on whom it was originally cast.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Thus, the function of a presumption is to place the burden of producing evidence on the opposing party:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">It is a procedural device which allows a person relying on the presumption to avoid a directed verdict, and it permits that person a directed verdict if the opposing party fails to introduce evidence rebutting the presumption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">Almost all presumptions are made up of permissible inferences. Thus, while the presumption may be overcome by evidence introduced, the inference itself remains and may provide evidence sufficient to persuade the trier of fact even though the rebutting evidence is introduced. But always it is the inference and not the presumption that must be weighed against the rebutting evidence. <em>[Widmayer v </em>Leonard, 422 Mich 280, 289; 373 NW2d 538 (1985).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">In the context of the present circumstances, the defendant hospital or health care provider, as the party who has pleaded the existence of the operative facts (validity of the arbitration agreement), bears the initial burden of going forward with evidence establishing that the arbitration agreement was executed in strict compliance with the mmaa. We hold that the statutory presumption of validity accrues once the defendant offers evidence that</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>(1) A written arbitration agreement complying with the provisions of the mmaa has been signed by the person receiving health care or treatment or his legal representative;</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">(2) The arbitration agreement provides that the offer to arbitrate, if accepted by the patient, must be revocable in writing for sixty days;</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">(3) The arbitration agreement states, above the signature line in twelve-point boldface type: \"This agreement to arbitrate is not a prerequisite to health care or treatment and may be REVOKED WITHIN 60 days after execution by notification in writing to</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">(4) The patient has been given a booklet detailing the specific provisions of the arbitration agreement;</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">(5) The patient has been given a copy of the arbitration agreement; and</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">(6) The offer to arbitrate did not precede the provision of emergency care.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">If the trial court determines that the arbitration agreement itself complies with the provisions of the mmaa, and that other independent evidence demonstrates that the patient has been given a copy of both the agreement and the booklet in a nonemergency setting, then the agreement to arbitrate must be presumed valid. Once a showing is made which gives rise to the presumption, it will stand unless rebutted by evidence that either demonstrates noncompliance with the statutory requirements set forth above or establishes one or more defenses, such as coercion, mistake, duress, or fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">Evidence which a defendant might present to sustain his ultimate burden of persuasion could include proof of habit or routine utilized by the hospital in admitting its patients. We recognize, especially in a hospital setting, that it would be unrealistic to expect specific recall on the part of hospital admitting personnel in each individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>case. Thousands of patients are admitted to hospitals each year, and, in most instances, there is nothing out of the ordinary about any given admission which makes it subject to special recollection. Thus, evidence of the habit of a person or of the routine practice of an organization is relevant to establish that the conduct of the person or organization on a particular occasion was in conformity with the habit or routine practice. MRE 406.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Any other rule would make it virtually impossible for a defendant hospital or health care provider to prove compliance with the requirements of the MMAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">In order to give evidentiary force to the statutory presumption, as well as meaning and purpose to the mmaa, we disagree with the holding of <em>Moore v Fragatos, supra, </em>to the extent that it places the burden on the defendant to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the plaintiff knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to court access.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">We do not infuse constitutional concerns equivalent to those in a criminal proceeding into a civil litigant\u2019s contractual choice-of-forum decision. A party\u2019s voluntary decision to arbitrate neither involves the complete relinquishment of a constitutional right nor raises the specter of procedural due process violations such as those presented in <em>Fuentes v Shevin, </em>407 US 67; 92 S Ct 1983; 32 L Ed 2d 556 (1972). See <em>Arkoosh v Dean Witter &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>Co, Inc, </em>415 F Supp 535, 544 (D Neb, 1976), aff'd 571 F2d 437 (CA 8, 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We further note that a person\u2019s decision to arbitrate a medical malpractice dispute and the consequential waiver of a jury trial in a civil case is not tantamount to deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right. The Constitution of the United States does not confer a federal constitutional right to trial by jury in state court civil cases. US Const, Am VII; <em>Curtis v Loether, </em>415 US 189; 94 S Ct 1005; 39 L Ed 2d 260 (1974). Moreover, the Michigan Constitution provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">The right of trial by jury shall remain, <em>but shall be waived in all civil cases unless demanded by one of the parties in the manner prescribed by law. </em>[Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 14. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The right to a jury trial in a civil action is therefore permissive, not absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The mmaa incorporates various safeguards to ensure the fairness of the arbitration process. The statute requires that a patient be given a copy of the agreement to read and sign. A patient\u2019s signature evidences that he has read the agreement, which in turn recites that he has been given an information booklet that further explains the arbitration system. As an additional safeguard, the patient has a statutorily mandated sixty-day \"cooling off\" period within which he may unilaterally rescind the agreement to arbitrate. A statement in twelve-point boldface type emphasizes that a patient need not agree to arbitrate, and the prohibition against offering the agreement at the time a patient is undergoing emergency treatment contributes to an informed decision. Medical treatment cannot be withheld merely because a patient elects not to sign the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>The statutory presumption provided for by the mmaa is wholly consistent with common-law principles of contract law which hold that the burden of proving nonarbitrability is assigned to the party seeking to avoid such an agreement and not to the party seeking to enforce such an agreement. See <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons v Livingston, </em>376 US 543, 546-547; 84 S Ct 909; 11 L Ed 2d 898 (1964); <em>Acme Cut Stone Co v New Center Development Corp, </em>281 Mich 32; 274 NW 700 (1937); <em>Kaleva-Norman-Dickson School Dist No 6 v KND Teachers\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>393 Mich 583, 587; 227 NW2d 500 (1975). Michigan law further presumes that one who signs a written agreement knows the nature of the instrument so executed and understands its contents. See, generally, <em>Ensign v Dunn, </em>181 Mich 456; 148 NW 343 (1914); <em>Meade v Brown, </em>218 Mich 556; 188 NW 514 (1922); <em>Int\u2019l Transportation Ass\u2019n v Bylenga, </em>254 Mich 236, 239; 236 NW 771 (1931). The purpose of this rule is well recognized \u2014 to preserve the integrity and stability of written instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The mmaa and its concomitant contractual waiver of the right to court access and jury trial reflect the Legislature\u2019s response to a perceived medical malpractice crisis in Michigan. Arbitration has long been recognized as a viable alternative to the litigation process. <em>Detroit v Jackson, </em>1 Doug 106 (1843); <em>Chicago &amp; M L S R Co v Hughes, </em>28 Mich 186 (1873); <em>Shapiro v Patrons\u2019 Mutual Fire Ins Co of Michigan, </em>219 Mich 581, 586; 189 NW 202 (1922); <em>Detroit v Kutsche &amp; Co, </em>309 Mich 700; 16 NW2d 128 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">If it had been the intent of the Legislature to do no more than establish a presumption which accrued only after the defendant fulfilled the burden of demonstrating a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver, then the presumption would serve little or no purpose. The practical effect of placing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>such a burden on the health care provider would be to severely undermine the objectives of the mmaa. As discussed earlier, it could not be expected that most hospital employees would have independent recollection of the details surrounding the admission of individual patients. The statutory presumption, in our view, is not only an evidentiary rule of procedural convenience, but it also is one which is grounded in reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In <em>Johnson v Secretary of State, </em>406 Mich 420, 432; 280 NW2d 9 (1979), we recognized the power of the Legislature , to allocate the evidentiary burdens of the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">The burden of producing evidence is not invariably allocated to the pleader of the fact to be proved. That burden may be otherwise allocated by the Legislature or judicial decision based, among other f\u00e1ctors, on an estimate of the probabilities, fairness and special policy considerations, and similar concerns may justify the creation, judicially or by law, of a presumption to aid the party who has the burden of production.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">We now apply these principles to the cases at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">In <em>Guertin, </em>plaintiff averred that he never received an informational booklet explaining the arbitration agreement and that at the time he signed the arbitration agreement it was simply presented for signature without explanation. The form and content of the arbitration agreement conformed to statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Although plaintiff specifically recalled not getting a copy of the booklet, he could not remember the date of his admission, how old he was on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>date of admission, who admitted him or even the sex of the individual who admitted him, or very much else about his admission. He could not recall anything being said to him when he was handed the arbitration agreement except: \"[S]ign on the dotted line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Plaintiff testified that it was his common practice to read materials provided to him and, further, that he was a high school graduate able to read and write.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Admitting clerk Victoria Gorney was involved in the admission of approximately 2,500 patients per year to the hospital and was unable to specifically recall the admission of plaintiff. But she did testify that it was her normal procedure relative to admission to supply each patient with an arbitration brochure. Mrs. Gorney testified that she followed the above procedure with every patient she admitted and she could recall no exception that occurred in December, 1979. It also appears that Mrs. Gorney informed patients to the effect that even if they signed the agreement and did not \"renege\u201d within sixty days, they could still \"sue the hospital\u201d in a court of law and still have the right to a jury, \"if the arbitration agreement [sic, award] was in [their] favor . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Plaintiff argues that the agreement to arbitrate should be declared invalid because the standard explanation given by Mrs. Gorney to admittees was misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">The testimony of these two witnesses, plaintiff Guertin and Mrs. Gorney, formed the basis for the trial court\u2019s decision. It concluded that plaintiff had received the required information booklet on the basis of Mrs. Gorney\u2019s testimony concerning her habit and routine practices in the normal course of business. The trial court found the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>tiff, due to his selective memory, not to be a credible witness. Its conclusion was that the plaintiff had the ability and opportunity to read the arbitration agreement, but simply chose not to do so. Thus, the trial court found that plaintiff had not gone forward with sufficient evidence to establish the invalidity of the arbitration agreement which conformed to the mmaa.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court on the basis that it had erred by allocating the burden of proof to the plaintiff. <em>Guertin, supra, </em>p 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">We are disturbed by the explanation which Mrs. Gorney routinely gave to patients upon their admission to the hospital. Her explanation was inaccurate and misleading. However, there is no evidence which suggests that plaintiff signed the agreement in reliance on her representation. To establish either fraudulent or an innocent misrepresentation, a party must demonstrate that he acted in reliance upon the alleged misrepresentation. <em>Hi-way Motor Co v Int\u2019l Harvester Co, </em>398 Mich 330, 336; 247 NW2d 813 (1976); <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty v Black, </em>412 Mich 99, 117-118; 313 NW2d 77 (1981). <em>Eaton Corp v Magnavox Co, </em>581 F Supp 1514, 1535 (ED Mich, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Here, the evidence does not demonstrate that the admitting clerk\u2019s representations were even a contributing influence upon plaintiff\u2019s decision to sign the agreement. In an affidavit submitted in support of his \"Response to Motion for Accelerated Judgment,\u201d plaintiff swore: \"That at the time he signed the arbitration agreement it was simply presented for signature without any explanation.\u201d This is consistent with plaintiff\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing, where he could recall nothing said to him other than to \"sign on the dotted line.\u201d Plaintiff gave several reasons for signing the docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>ment, none of which related to Mrs. Gorney\u2019s explanation of the arbitration process.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">In a case such as this, where a key element is the believability of the witnesses, \"regard shall be given to the special opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses who appeared before it.\u201d MCR 2.613(C). We conclude that the trial court did not clearly err in evaluating the evidence before it and in placing the burden of going forward with evidence to invalidate a conforming arbitration agreement upon the plaintiff. We are not left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake was committed by the trial court. <em>Tuttle v Dep\u2019t of State Highways, </em>397 Mich 44; 243 NW2d 244 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">For the reasons stated, we conclude that the judgment of the trial court should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Mrs. McKinstry went to Saginaw General Hospital for a routine stress test ordered by her doctor. She went through admitting and was taken to the labor section where the stress test was performed. Shortly thereafter, she was advised by a physician that she was going to be admitted because she was spilling proteins into her urine and her blood pressure was elevated. Mrs. McKinstry was placed in a patient room and sometime later a hospital representative brought some papers to her room.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The form and content of the arbitration agreements signed by Mrs. McKinstry were in complete conformity with the mmaa statutory requirements. During the evidentiary hearing, Mrs. McKinstry conceded that her signature was on the arbitration agreements signed on October 17, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Mrs. McKinstry, a high school graduate, was no stranger to arbitration agreements. She previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>had executed arbitration agreements on September 26, 1978, and October 10, 1978, only a few weeks prior to the admission in question. Nonetheless, she claimed that on this hospitalization, and this one hospitalization only, she did not receive the brochure from Saginaw General Hospital and did not understand or remember signing the arbitration agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The admitting clerk for defendant hospital, Ms. Federspiel, could not recall the admission of Mrs. McKinstry six and one-half years before. She testified that the normal admitting procedure included offering the arbitration agreement with an explanation of its contents, and advising each patient who signed the agreement that he would have sixty days during which to change his mind. She also testified that each patient was provided with a copy of the booklet and the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Plaintiffs contend that Mrs. McKinstry was treated in an emergency situation. Mrs. McKinstry indicated that she was afraid and upset when first admitted, concerned over the welfare of her unborn child. She testified, however, that other than being upset she was \"in [her] faculties\u201d and was not physically ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">We conclude that the trial court and the Court of Appeals properly allocated the burdens of the parties. We do not find clear error in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendants complied with the mmaa, that the arbitration agreements were valid on their faces, and that the plaintiffs failed in their burden to go forward with sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of validity. Mrs. McKinstry was in sufficient physical and mental condition to sign the valid arbitration agreements and did so in a nonemergency setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Given the defendants\u2019 prima facie showing of compliance with the mmaa, and the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>failure to rebut the presumption, the validity of the arbitration agreements was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In <em>McKinstry, </em>we are also asked to decide whether a plaintiff mother could bind her child to arbitration where she signed the agreement to arbitrate while her child was in \u00fatero.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Under \u00a7 5046(2) of the mmaa, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">A minor child shall be bound by a written agreement to arbitrate disputes, controversies, or issues upon the execution of an agreement on his behalf by a parent or legal guardian. The minor child may not subsequently disaffirm the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Mrs. McKinstry not only signed an arbitration agreement involving her medical treatment, but she also signed such an agreement on behalf of the child, Amanda, who was not born at the time the agreement was signed. Mrs. McKinstry argued unsuccessfully in the Court of Appeals that Amanda could not be bound by the alleged arbitration agreement because a fetus in \u00fatero is not a minor child within the meaning of the statute. She also contended that if \u00a7 5046(2) of the mmaa were construed so as to include a fetus in \u00fatero under the definition of a minor child, the constitutional right to court access and jury trial would be taken away from the fetus in \u00fatero.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">In construing a statute, we primarily seek to determine and give effect to the legislative intent. <em>Nash v DAIIE, </em>120 Mich App 568, 571; 327 NW2d 521 (1982), lv den 417 Mich 1088 (1983). As stated in 73 Am Jur 2d, Statutes, \u00a7 145, p 351:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">In the interpretation of statutes, the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>will is the all-important or controlling factor. Indeed, it is frequently stated in effect that the intention of the legislature constitutes the law. Accordingly, the primary rule of construction of statutes is to ascertain and declare the intention of the legislature, and to carry such intention into effect to the fullest degree. A construction adopted should not be such as to nullify, destroy, or defeat the intention of the legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Section 5046(2) of the arbitration statute is aimed at allowing parents to bind their children, all of their children, to arbitration rather than permitting a child subsequently to avoid arbitration at the age of majority. In view of this legislative purpose, the minor child born after parental consent to arbitration cannot be distinguished from that of a minor child who was born prior to parental consent. We believe that the Legislature did not intend to create such a distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The logic of our position is borne out by the fact that neither a fetus in \u00fatero nor a minor child has the capacity to contract for medical care on his own behalf and can only do so through a parent or guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The Court has, in other contexts, recognized that the rights of a viable unborn child are similar to those of a minor child. In <em>LaBlue v Specker, </em>358 Mich 558; 100 NW2d 445 (1960), the Court recognized the right of an afterborn child to bring a dramshop action for damages as a result of the death of her putative father. In <em>Womack v Buchhorn, </em>384 Mich 718; 187 NW2d 218 (1971), it was held that an action will lie at common law, by a person prenatally injured and hence born injured, for negligence. The status of the fetus in \u00fatero was further delineated in <em>O\u2019Neill v Morse, </em>385 Mich 130; 188 NW2d 785 (1971), where the Court held that a viable infant <em>en ventre sa mere </em>(in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>mother\u2019s womb) at the time of the injury which caused death was a person within the meaning of the wrongful death statute, and that the administrator of the infant\u2019s estate could maintain an action for damages under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The <em>Womack </em>and <em>O\u2019Neill </em>decisions establish that under Michigan common law a fetus in \u00fatero is a person for purposes of tort law if the fetus is alive subsequent to the alleged injury or if the fetus was viable at the time of alleged injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Thus, the status of a fetus in \u00fatero under Michigan common law regarding tort actions is consistent with our conclusion that a fetus in \u00fatero should be ' considered a minor child within the language of \u00a7 5046(2) if the fetus is born alive, subsequent to the claimed injury, or if the fetus was viable at the time of the alleged injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 5046(2) is a departure from the common-law rule that a parent has no authority to waive, release, or compromise claims by or against a child. <em>Schofield v Spilker, </em>37 Mich App 33; 194 NW2d 549 (1971); <em>Reliance Ins Co v Haney, </em>54 Mich App 237; 220 NW2d 728 (1974); 67A CJS, Parent and Child, \u00a7 114, pp 469-470. However, the common law can be modified or abrogated by statute. <em>Bean v McFarland, </em>280 Mich 19; 273 NW 332 (1937); <em>O\u2019Brien v Hazelet &amp; Erdal, </em>410 Mich 1; 299 NW2d 336 (1980). Thus, a child can be bound by a parent\u2019s act when a statute grants that authority to a parent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Reliance Ins Co, supra, </em>p 242; <em>Wilson v Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, </em>141 Cal App 3d 891; 190 Cal Rptr 649 (1983). We believe that \u00a7 5046(2) of the mm a a changes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>common law to permit a parent to bind a child to an arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In the case before us, we therefore conclude that plaintiff Amanda McKinstry was bound by the valid arbitration agreement signed by her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Accordingly, in <em>McKinstry, </em>we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">In <em>Guertin, </em>we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the order of the trial court granting accelerated judgment for defendants.</p>\n<judges id=\"b415-9\">Riley, C.J., and Levin, Brickley, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Griffin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-12\"> MCL 600.5041(7), 600.5042(8); MSA 27A.5041(7), 27A.5042(8) state: \"An agreement to arbitrate which includes the provisions of this section shall be presumed valid.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-13\"> The requirements set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 5041 and 5042 are not identical.

The Medical Malpractice Arbitration Act, MCL 600.5040 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 27A.5040 <em>et seq., </em>entails the waiver of that fundamental right. In the area of civil law, courts must indulge every reasonable presumption against the waiver of a fundamental right, <em>Aetna Ins Co v Kennedy, </em>301 US 389, 393; 57 S Ct 809; 81 L Ed 1177 (1937), and there can be no presumption that a party acquiesces to the loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>of a fundamental right. <em>Ohio Bell Telephone Co v Ohio Public Utilities Comm, </em>301 US 292, 307; 57 S Ct 724; 81 L Ed 1093 (1937). Accordingly, the burden of proving the waiver of the right to court access is on the party asserting the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">MCL 600.5041(7); MSA 27A.5041(7) and MCL 600.5042(8); MSA 27A.5042(8) state that an \"agreement to arbitrate which includes the provisions of this section shall be presumed valid.\u201d This language does not provide a presumption that the waiver contained therein is knowing and voluntary. The majority has, in essence, construed the \"presumption\u201d to be rebuttable. Thus, once the defendant has offered evidence to establish that the arbitration agreement itself complies with the provisions of the arbitration act, it has made out a prima facie case. The presumption then casts the burden of proof to the plaintiff. However, when classifying the presumption as rebuttable, once the plaintiff puts at issue his contention that the alleged waiver of his constitutional rights was unknowing, involuntary, or unintelligent, the presumption would disappear, and the burden of proof would remain with the defendants to affirmatively show the contrary. See <em>Krisher v Duff, </em>331 Mich 699, 705; 50 NW2d 332 (1951); <em>Klat v Chrysler Corp, </em>285 Mich 241, 247; 280 NW 747 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The question then becomes what quantum of evidence is necessary for defendants to sustain their burden. For the defendants to rely on rote testimony of habit and custom is clearly not enough. The true beneficiary of the mmaa is the health care provider. However, with the benefit should come the burden of producing clear, positive, and credible evidence that the statutory \"safeguards to ensure the fairness of the arbitration process\u201d have been strictly followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">It is health care providers who should be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>most motivated to conform to the requirements of the act, because they benefit from it. It is health care providers who have the personnel who can be trained in very simple, non-time-consuming procedures in order to record and keep relevant evidence. The burden should be placed on the party which can best meet it. That party, in all cases involving health care providers and patients, would be the health care provider. It is a small burden, in exchange for all the benefits they acquire from the agreement, to be obligated to simply and inexpensively memorialize the fact of each individual patient\u2019s knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">There are numerous ways a hospital or physician can provide more than rote habit or custom evidence to support their burden of showing a knowing, intelligent, and involuntary waiver within the execution of an arbitration agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For example, a slight modification of the arbitration form to allow a space for the patients to initial the following seems to be the least burdensome: (1) that the patient has been given a booklet detailing the specific provisions of the arbitration agreement at the time of affixing the initials, (2) that the patient was given a copy of the agreement at the time of affixing the initials, (3) that the offer to arbitrate did not precede emergency medical care, and (4) that the patient has been informed that the offer, if accepted, can be revoked within sixty days if revoked in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Under the majority\u2019s holding, all that is needed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>to obtain the benefit of the statutory presumption of validity is the patient\u2019s signature and an employee trained to produce testimony indicative of habit and custom, irrespective of whether the \"usual\u201d procedure was followed in the patient\u2019s particular case. This is insufficient. If the words of the trial judge in the instant case are used as an indicator, trial judges agree that testimony of custom and habit or standard procedures are insufficient methods of proving compliance with the act to meet an initial burden or to rebut the evidence presented by the plaintiff. During the admitting clerk\u2019s testimony in this case, wherein she testified on the basis of her usual procedure, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">I am more interested [in] what she did, if she can remember what [sic] this patient, not what she ordinarily does. This is what I have got to decide on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">While hospital employees simply say that they <em>always </em>offer the arbitration agreement in a manner consistent with the statute, the patient has the impossible burden of proving the arbitration agreement was not properly offered to him. Placing the burden on the plaintiff to show the <em>invalidity </em>of the agreement forces the plaintiff to prove a nullity, which is one of the most difficult things to do in the field of evidence. Yet, at a time, usually during admission to the hospital, when the plaintiff is likely to be apprehensive, scared, in pain, and least likely to absorb the importance of the documents he may be signing, the majority would have the plaintiff be responsible for gathering evidence to show that the statutory requirements were <em>not </em>complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">I am also concerned about the testimony of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>hospital employee (the admitting clerk) in this case. <em>Ante, </em>pp 186-187. A review of the hospital employee\u2019s explanation of the arbitration information that she routinely gave to patients should have enlightened the majority as to how \"routinely\u201d patients have the potential to be misled or misinformed. Relying upon the clerk\u2019s testimony does not, in my mind, meet the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Perhaps safeguards could be adopted that would effectuate the policy of the Legislature. The patient should know what is being signed and what the result of that signature will mean. If accomplished, the result would facilitate proofs and diminish the likelihood of evidentiary hearings, which would save time for the court and the parties. The majority does not provide safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">I therefore dissent from the majority\u2019s failure to place the burden of proof of clear, positive, and credible evidence on the health care provider and hospital.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\"> Suggestions made to the court include: (1) providing the patient with an audio tape to listen to, along with the agreement and booklet; (2) taped vocal acceptance on the part of the patient; (3) having an employee whose job is to explain the agreement to the patient and to have that employee personally witness the signature of the patient, and (4) providing the patient with the agreement and booklet before he comes to the hospital for admittance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b419-7\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AE\">(dissenting).
