These consolidated cases require us to decide the following questions: (1) whether the state is a \"person\u201d for purposes of a damage suit under 42 USC 1983; (2) whether a state official, sued in an official capacity, is a \"person\u201d for purposes of a damage suit under 42 USC 1983; (3) whether there is an \"intentional tort\u201d exception to governmental immunity; and (4) whether a plaintiff may sue the state for damages for violations of the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">A majority of the Justices are of the opinion that:</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">1) The state is not a \"person\u201d for purposes of a damage suit under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">2) A state official, when sued in an official capacity, is not a \"person\u201d for purposes of a damage suit under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">3) The allegation of false imprisonment in <em>Smith </em>does not avoid governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">4) There is no \"intentional tort\u201d exception to governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">5) Where it is alleged that the state, by virtue of custom or policy, has violated a right conferred by the Michigan Constitution, governmental immunity is not available in a state court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">6) A claim for damages against the state arising from violation by the state of the Michigan Constitution may be recognized in appropriate cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">7) In <em>Will, </em>the plaintiff failed to preserve for appeal any claim for damages for violations of the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-14\">In <em>Smith, </em>we reverse those portions of the Court of Appeals judgment that reinstated the plaintiff\u2019s false imprisonment claim and affirmed the denial of summary judgment on the plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim.

We affirm the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Appeals affirmance of the denial of summary judgment as to the plaintiffs Michigan constitutional claims, and direct the Court of Claims, on remand, to determine whether a violation of the Michigan Constitution by virtue of a governmental custom or policy has been alleged; whether such a violation occurred; and, if it occurred, whether it is one for which a damage remedy is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In <em>Will, </em>we reverse that portion of the Court of Appeals judgment that remanded this case to the Court of Claims for further proceedings regarding the liability of the Director of State Police, and we remand to the Court of Claims for entry of judgment in favor of the defendant Director of State Police.

We would find that the state and its officials, sued in their official capacities, are not persons under 42 USC 1983, that there is no intentional-tort exception under the governmental immunity act, and that there is no implicit right to sue the state for damages on the basis of viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>tions of art 2, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 16 of the 1908 Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">I. PACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">A. WILL <em>vDEP\u2019t OF CIVIL SERVICE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The plaintiff had been in the employ of the State of Michigan since 1969 when the following facts occurred, as set forth by the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">In the latter half of 1973, plaintiff sought opportunities to advance to data systems analyst 11, and one of these opportunities arose with the state police. Although plaintiff was ranked number two on the promotional register and the number one candidate withdrew, plaintiff was not hired by the state police that summer. He subsequently obtained a data systems analyst 11 position with the Highway Department in November, 1973.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-8\">Unbeknownst to plaintiff, when the defendant department ran a security check on plaintiff, information about plaintiff\u2019s student activist brother, Charles, was released. Charles\u2019 file contained the notation, \"Subject\u2019s brother Ray Eugene dob 2-27-44 made application for employment with msp. Personnel advised 8-9-73.\u201d Plaintiff did not learn of this until 1977, when legislation providing for maintenance of the so-called \"red squad\u201d files, 1950 (Ex Sess) PA 38, 39, and 40, was declared unconstitutional and Charles obtained his file and showed it to his brother, plaintiff. <em>[Will v Dep\u2019t of Civil Service, </em>145 Mich App 214, 217-218; 377 NW2d 826 (1985).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">Upon learning that information regarding his brother\u2019s political activities may have influenced the decision to not promote him, Will, in 1977, filed a grievance with the Civil Service Commission. It was denied as untimely. In January, 1978, in a three-count complaint, he commenced suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>against various state defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the Ingham Circuit Court. Count i alleged that the csc\u2019s refusal to hear plaintiffs grievance denied him due process of law in violation of the United States and Michigan Constitutions; count ii alleged various violations of the United States and Michigan Constitutions as grounds for asserting a claim pursuant to 42 USC 1983; and count m alleged that defendants\u2019 determination of plaintiffs qualification for promotion, on the basis of his brother\u2019s political activities rather than on merit, \"denied Plaintiff\u2019s right to due process of law and rights created under Const 1963, Art XI, Section 5,\u201d entitling him to damages. The state defendants did not answer plaintiffs complaint, but instead moved to remand the case to the esc for a grievance hearing. In June of 1978, the motion was granted. The court retained jurisdiction to review any appeal from the decision of the esc.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">In November, 1978, while awaiting action on his grievance before the esc, plaintiff filed suit in the Michigan Court of Claims. His complaint consisted of two counts, essentially identical to counts ii (\u00a7 1983 claim) and m (Michigan constitutional claim) of his circuit court complaint. In response, state defendants on December 5, 1978, moved for summary judgment on count i (\u00a7 1983 claim) and accelerated judgment on count ii (Michigan constitutional claim) of plaintiffs Court of Claims complaint. On May 7, 1979, the Court of Claims granted the state defendants\u2019 motion for accelerated judgment on count ii because of the pending administrative proceedings, but denied defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>claim \"[b]ecause there [was] a question of fact.\u201d The Court of Claims also granted plaintiffs motion to consolidate the Court of Claims and circuit court cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">In the meantime, a fourth-step grievance hearing was conducted on plaintifPs charges. In June of 1980, the Civil Service Commission hearing officer found that the state had violated both Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5 (the civil service provision) and Civil Service Rule 1.2 in making its decision regarding Mr. Will\u2019s promotion on the basis of \"partisan considerations.\u201d The esc affirmed the decision in January of 1981. Neither the state defendants nor the plaintiff appealed the esc decision in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Nearly two years later, in November of 1982, Judge Thomas L. Brown rendered a decision on plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claim for both the Ingham Circuit Court and the Court of Claims. First, he decided that the csc\u2019s decision provided sufficient grounds for finding that defendants had violated plaintiffs <em>federal </em>civil rights, under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">The violation of state law by a state official of itself is insufficient to state a violation of a federal right. . . . Under [\u00a7 1983], liability is imposed on any \"person\u201d who deprives another person\u2019s federally protected rights. Such rights have been construed by the courts to include the protection of life, liberty and property under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. It is Plaintiffs position that the Due Process Clause protects his property right as a public employee to fair treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-9\">Plaintiff argues that the State having established a system of merit, [under Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5] the denial of plaintiffs promotion based on Plaintiffs brother\u2019s political persuasion violates due process. The Court agrees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Second, Judge Brown determined that the real party in interest was the State of Michigan, and that the Michigan Department of State Police and its director, sued in his official capacity, were persons for purposes of suit under \u00a7 1983. The civil service defendants were dismissed. Finally, after considerable discussion of federal constitutional immunity under the Eleventh Amendment, the circuit court held that the state had consented to be sued in the Court of Claims by virtue of the Court of Claims Act, MCL 600.6401 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 27A.6401 <em>et seq., </em>but could not be sued in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Seeking to have the court\u2019s decision include a finding that defendants\u2019 actions also violated the state constitution, on March 17, 1983, plaintiff unsuccessfully moved to clarify the court\u2019s November, 1982, decision to include state constitutional grounds as a basis for its decision. On October 25, 1983, the court, on the basis of its November, 1982, opinion, awarded plaintiff money damages against the State Police and its director. The remaining State Police defendants then appealed the Court of Claims judgments in the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">In July, 1985, the Court of Appeals entered a decision only addressing the plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims. The Court disallowed suit against the state, concluding that \u00a7 1983 did not include states as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>persons. As for the plaintiffs claims against the Director of State Police, the Court remanded the case for a determination of his potential liability, given the possibility of immunity from suit for \u00a7 1983 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The state defendants then applied to this Court for leave to appeal the Court of Appeals judgment dealing with the issue of the State Police director\u2019s potential liability. Plaintiff cross-appealed, and, on September 25, 1985, this Court granted leave to appeal to resolve, inter alia, a Court of Appeals conflict on the question whether the state is a person for purposes of suit under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">\n<em>B. SMITH v STATE OF MICHIGAN</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">On February 4, 1925, the Probate Court for Mecosta County committed Minnie Smith to the state mental hospital at Traverse City. She was admitted on February 10 and two days later gave birth to her son, Jack, the plaintiff. Ms. Smith died following that birth. In June of 1925, Jack Smith was transferred to the State Public School in Coldwater, a state orphanage, pursuant to a May 15, 1925, commitment order issued by the Grand Traverse County Probate Court. The superintendent of the state school believed Jack Smith to be feeble-minded and sought to transfer him and two other infants to the Michigan Home and Training School (mhts) in Lapeer, an institution for the retarded. In November of 1926, Jack was transferred to the mhts pursuant to an order issued by the Director of the Welfare Department, who supervised both the Michigan Home and the State Public School. No court order was entered authorizing Jack Smith\u2019s commitment to the Michigan Home in Lapeer.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">In October of 1937, the Grand Traverse County Probate Court officially committed Jack Smith to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>the Michigan Home and Training School, where he had resided for the previous eleven years. The Michigan Home in Lapeer remained Jack Smith\u2019s home until 1964. In June of that year, Mr. Smith was transferred, allegedly pursuant to court order, to the Traverse City State Hospital, the place of his birth. He was released from the state hospital nine years later in May of 1973, and lived in foster care homes until his death in February of 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In February, 1979, Mr. Smith filed suit in the Michigan Court of Claims. His complaint contained four counts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\">Count i alleged false imprisonment due to his improper commitment to mhts; Count n alleged negligent, reckless, intentional breaches of defendants\u2019 duty to care for, treat, and educate plaintiff; Count hi alleged that his due process and equal protection rights under the Michigan Constitution had been violated; Count iv sought damages under 42 USC 1983 for violation of his federal constitutional rights. <em>[Smith v Michigan, </em>122 Mich App 340, 342; 333 NW2d 50 (1983).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">In response, state defendants moved for summary or accelerated judgment. In a January, 1981, opinion, the Court of Claims determined, first, that plaintiff suffered from a continuing mental infirmity, thus tolling the applicable statute of limitations and making his action timely.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to count i (false imprisonment) and count ii (negligent care), holding that the state enjoyed immunity from suit on both Counts. Third, the court denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss count m (Michigan constitutional claims). Finally, as to count iv, the court disagreed with defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>dants\u2019 contention that \u00a7 1983 did not include states as persons and so denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Therefore, of plaintiffs original four counts, only two remained: the \u00a7 1983 and the Michigan constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Plaintiff then sought leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals. Defendants sought leave to cross-appeal. In June of 1981, the Court of Appeals granted leave. Approximately a year and a half later, the Court issued its opinion, ruling on all four of plaintiffs original claims in the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">On plaintiffs first count, the Court of Appeals reinstated plaintiffs claim of false imprisonment. As to count ii, the Court agreed with the Court of Claims dismissal, stating that governmental immunity shielded state defendants from liability for negligence. The Court of Claims judgment on counts m and iv was affirmed. As to plaintiffs Michigan constitutional claim for damages (count hi), the Court basically reiterated the Court of Claims finding that governmental immunity did not apply to constitutional claims. Finally, as to count iv (the \u00a7 1983 claim), the Court concluded that for the purpose of \u00a7 1983, the state was indeed a person.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-8\">One of the main purposes behind \u00a7 1983 was to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although many disagree about the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s effect and purpose, all agree that it was passed to ensure the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 was designed to eliminate the black codes. As such, we conclude that Congress must have intended that states be included as \"persons.\u201d <em>[Smith, supra </em>at 352.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">In response to the Court of Appeals decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>state defendants sought leave to appeal in this Court the false imprisonment, \u00a7 1983, and state constitutional claims. The plaintiff cross-appealed the dismissal of his negligent-care claim. In September of 1984, this Court granted defendants leave to appeal in order to resolve the conflict in the Court of Appeals whether the state is a person under \u00a7 1983, but denied plaintiff leave to cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">II. IS THE STATE A PERSON?</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The central issue presented to this Court in both <em>Smith </em>and <em>Will </em>is whether an individual may sue the state for damages pursuant to \u00a7 1983 or, more specifically, whether the word \"person,\u201d in \u00a7 1983, includes states. Section 1983 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. For the purposes of this section, any Act of Congress applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia shall be considered to be a statute of the District of Columbia. [42 USC 1983.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">A brief history of \u00a7 1983 is beneficial as background for an analysis of that statutory section.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">On March 23, 1871, President Ulysses S. Grant delivered a message to Congress requesting its immediate attention to legislation aimed at curbing the lawlessness then rampant in the Southern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>states. In a brief message to Congress, President Grant stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">A condition of affairs now exists in some States of the Union rendering life and property insecure .... That the power to correct these evils is beyond the control of State authorities I do not doubt; that the power of the Executive of the United States, acting within the limits of existing laws, is sufficient for present emergencies is not clear. Therefore, I urgently recommend such legislation as in the judgment of Congress shall effectually secure life, liberty, and property, and the enforcement of law in all parts of the United States. [Cong Globe, 42nd Cong, 1st Sess, 244 (1871).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Congress moved quickly on the President\u2019s request. In April of that same year, it passed the Civil Rights Act of 1871, also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act. Although the act generated much controversy and debate, \u00a7 1, now codified at 42 USC 1983,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-7\">caused the least concern, as it only added civil remedies to the criminal penalties established by the 1866 Civil Rights Act. [Note, <em>Developments in the law: Section 1983 and federalism, </em>90 Harv L R 1133, 1155 (1977).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">In fact, \u00a7 1 of the act created no new substantive rights. Enacted to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, it merely \"provided] a remedy for the violation of rights created elsewhere.\u201d <em>Day v Wayne Co Bd of Auditors, </em>749 F2d 1199, 1202 (CA 6, 1984). See, also, <em>Chapman v Houston Welfare Rights Organization, </em>441 US 600, 616-618; 99 S Ct 1905; 60 L Ed 2d 508 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">As originally enacted, \u00a7 1 of the act conferred jurisdiction on federal district and circuit courts to hear claims such as may be brought pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>\u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Congress recognized the failure of the state courts to adequately protect federal rights and so specifically created a right to sue in federal court for violation of those rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-5\">To the Reconstruction Congress, the need for some form of federal intervention was clear. It was equally clear, however, that Congress had neither the means nor the authority to exert any direct control, on a day-to-day basis, over the actions of state officials. The solution chosen was to involve the federal judiciary. At the time this Act was adopted, it must be remembered, there existed no general federal-question jurisdiction in the lower federal courts. Rather, \"Congress relied on the state courts to vindicate essential rights arising under the Constitution and federal laws.\u201d . . . With the growing awareness that this reliance had been misplaced, however, Congress recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>nized the need for original federal court jurisdiction as a means to provide at least indirect federal control over the unconstitutional actions of state officials. <em>[District of Columbia v Carter, </em>409 US 418, 427-428; 93 S Ct 602; 34 L Ed 2d 613 (1973), reh den 410 US 959 (1973).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Therefore, faced with the unwillingness or inability of state courts to vindicate federally guaranteed rights, Congress enacted \u00a7 1983 and created a federal avenue of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Although the cases before us occur in state court, the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution, which bars suit by a citizen against a state in a federal court, is the backdrop to the development and, to some extent, the confusion in the case law on the meaning of \"person\u201d in \u00a7 1983. This Eleventh Amendment issue arises when a \u00a7 1983 action is brought in federal, rather than state court; however, as will be seen, the United States Supreme Court eventually merged the question of the effect of Eleventh Amendment immunity on suit against a state in a federal court with the question whether the term \"person\u201d includes a state in a \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">The Eleventh Amendment is the product of a controversy created by an early United States Supreme Court decision, <em>Chisholm v Georgia, </em>2 US (2 Dall) 419; 1 L Ed 440 (1793). <em>Chisholm </em>involved a suit brought by a citizen of South Carolina against the State of Georgia to collect a debt incurred by the state during the Revolutionary War. The Supreme Court interpreted the clause in US Const, art III, \u00a7 2, extending the judicial power of the United States \"to Controversies . . . between a State and Citizens of another state . . .\u201d to allow a private citizen to sue another state before the United States Supreme Court. This decision created such contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>versy that the Eleventh Amendment was proposed and ratified by 1798. The language of the amendment had the technical effect only of reversing the holding of the <em>Chisholm </em>decision by barring those suits brought by citizens of one state against another state.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State. [US Const, Am XI.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">But in <em>Hans v Louisiana, </em>134 US 1; 10 S Ct 504; 33 L Ed 842 (1890), the Court gave an expansive interpretation to the amendment. <em>Hans </em>involved a suit by a citizen of Louisiana against his own state. The Court applied the Eleventh Amendment, holding that its prohibition extended to suits against one\u2019s own state as well as against other states.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The United States Supreme Court began its struggle with the issue of a state\u2019s immunity in federal court in several cases dealing with federal statutes other than \u00a7 1983. See <em>Parden v Terminal Railway of Alabama State Docks Dep\u2019t, </em>377 US 184; 84 S Ct 1207; 12 L Ed 2d 233 (1964), reh den 377 US 1010 (1964), and <em>Employees v Missouri </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><em>Dep\u2019t of Public Health &amp; Welfare, </em>411 US 279; 93 S Ct 1614; 36 L Ed 2d 251 (1973). In <em>Parden, </em>a suit in federal court under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act against Alabama\u2019s state-owned railroad, the Court gave a somewhat confusing analysis of the question of Congress\u2019 power to subject states to suit. The Court held that Congress could subject a state to suit, despite its claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity, because the states, in ratifying the constitution, had surrendered a portion of their sovereignty to the national government.

Though a \u00a7 1983 action may be instituted by public aid recipients such as respondent, a federal court\u2019s remedial power, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, is necessarily limited to prospective injunctive relief, <em>Ex parte </em>Young, [209 US 123; 28 S Ct 441; 52 L Ed 714 (1908)], and may not include a retroactive award which requires the payment of funds from the state treasury, <em>Ford Motor Co v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>[323 US 459; 65 S Ct 347; 89 L Ed 389 (1945)]. <em>[Edelman, supra </em>at 675-677.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-7\"><em>Fitzpatrick v Bitzer, </em>427 US 445; 96 S Ct 2666; 49 L Ed 2d 614 (1976), added yet another aspect to the analysis of Eleventh Amendment doctrine\u2014 the relationship between Congress\u2019 enforcement power pursuant to \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and the concept of state sovereignty embodied in the Eleventh Amendment. <em>Fitzpatrick </em>involved suit in federal court against the State of Connecticut by a class of male employees alleging sex discrimination pursuant to title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Petitioner employees sought both prospective injunctive relief and a retroactive monetary award. The Court held that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar the collection in federal court of retroactive benefits to petitioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>when Congress acted to enforce the \"substantive guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The Court recognized that a special relationship existed between Congress\u2019 enforcement powers pursuant to \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and a state\u2019s sovereignty embodied in the earlier-adopted Eleventh Amendment, and the Court concluded that the enabling provisions of \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment limited the scope of the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">But we think that the Eleventh Amendment, and the principle of state sovereignty which it embodies . . . are necessarily limited by the enforcement provisions of \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. In that section Congress is expressly granted authority to enforce \"by appropriate legislation\u201d the substantive provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, which themselves embody significant limitations on state authority. When Congress acts pursuant to \u00a7 5, not only is it exercising legislative authority that is plenary within the terms of the constitutional grant, it is exercising that authority under one section of a constitutional Amendment whose other sections by their own terms embody limitations on state authority. We think that Congress may, in determining what is \"appropriate legislation\u201d for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, provide for private suits against States or state officials which are constitutionally impermissible in other contexts. See <em>Edelman v Jordan, </em>415 US 651 (1974); <em>Ford Motor Co v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>323 US 459 (1945). <em>[Fitzpatrick, supra </em>at 456.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Therefore, without ever explicitly addressing the state\u2019s consent to suit, the Court allowed retroactive relief against the state on the basis of congressional abrogation of the state\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity.

The employees brought suit pursuant to \u00a7 1983, seeking both injunctive relief and back pay for periods of forced leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The Court\u2019s analysis basically consisted of a reexamination of the congressional debates surrounding the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1871. The Court rejected the <em>Monroe </em>Court\u2019s conclusion that congressional failure to adopt the first conference revision of the Sherman amendment<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> indicated congressional intent to exclude municipalities from the scope of the term \"person\u201d in \u00a7 1983. The <em>Monell </em>Court concluded:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>[T]he constitutional objections raised against the Sherman amendment \u2014 on which our holding in <em>Monroe </em>was based . . . \u2014 would not have prohibited congressional creation of a civil remedy against state municipal corporations that infringed federal rights. <em>[Monell, supra </em>at 669.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The Court reached this conclusion by determining that Congress objected to the Sherman amendment because it created new obligations for municipalities, <em>not </em>because it imposed civil liability for the violation of obligations already imposed. Unlike the imposition of financial liability on municipalities, creation of new obligations by the federal government interfered with the state\u2019s power to govern itself.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">[M]unicipalities as instrumentalities through which States executed their policies could be equally disabled from carrying out state policies if they were also obligated to carry out federally imposed duties. . . . Thus, there was ample support for [the] view that the Sherman amendment, by putting municipalities to the Hobson\u2019s choice of keeping the peace or paying civil damages, attempted to impose obligations on municipalities by indirection that could not be imposed directly, thereby threatening to \"destroy the government of the States.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 678-679.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Moreover, imposition of liability on municipalities did not interfere with the notion of state sovereignty because the federal government, in protecting federal constitutional rights in this manner, did not need to engage the states in any \"positive\u201d action.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">After concluding that congressional failure to adopt the first conference version of the Sherman amendment did not mean that Congress meant to shield municipalities from financial liability, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Court turned to the question whether the term \"person\u201d in \u00a7 1983 included municipalities. The Court noted the remedial nature of the Civil Rights Act of 1871.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">\"This act is remedial, and in aid of the preservation of human liberty and human rights. All statutes and constitutional provisions authorizing such statutes are liberally and beneficently construed.\u201d <em>[Monell, supra </em>at 684.]</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The Court viewed such snippets from the legislative history as indicative of Congress\u2019 intent to give the term \"person\u201d in \u00a7 1983 a broad interpretation. Consequently, the Court saw no reason not to extend the Dictionary Act\u2019s definition of person to the statutory language of \u00a7 1 of the Ku Klux Klan Act. Congress had passed the Dictionary Act a few months prior to enacting the Ku Klux Klan Act. The Dictionary Act stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-8\">\"the word 'person\u2019 may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate . . . .\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 688.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">Since the phrase \"bodies politic and corporate\u201d applied to municipal corporations in 1871, and since the legislative history indicated Congress desired a liberal construction of \u00a7 1 of the Ku Klux Klan Act, the Court concluded that the term \"person\u201d in \u00a7 1983 included municipalities. The Court, however, expressly limited its holding to local government units \"not considered part of the State for Eleventh Amendment purposes.\u201d <em>Monell, supra </em>at 690, n 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\"><em>Hutto v Finney, </em>437 US 678; 98 S Ct 2565; 57 L Ed 2d 522 (1978), reh den 439 US 1122 (1979), raised two further issues of interest to the development of Eleventh Amendment doctrine and \u00a7 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>case law. First, the Court seemed to soften the strict standard for congressional abrogation of the Eleventh Amendment enunciated in its earlier decision in <em>Edelman. </em>Second, Justice Brennan, in concurrence, raised, but did not answer, the question whether the Court\u2019s earlier decisions in <em>Fitzpatrick </em>and <em>Monell </em>left states open to suit for damages pursuant to \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\"><em>Hutto </em>involved a challenge to conditions in the Arkansas penal system. The federal district court found that conditions in the state prisons constituted cruel and unusual punishment and entered a number of corrective remedial orders. The Commissioner of Corrections and the Arkansas Board of Corrections, challenged an award of attorney fees payable from Department of Correction funds. The commissioner and board argued that a federal court could not, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, award attorney fees payable from state funds. The Supreme Court, however, found the Eleventh Amendment no bar to an award of fees pursuant to the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 USC 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Reiterating the reasoning of its <em>Fitzpatrick </em>decision, the Court held that Congress has \"plenary power\u201d to lift the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity when acting to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. In enacting \u00a7 1988 Congress exercised that power and abrogated the states\u2019 immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">The Court then examined whether Congress intended to subject states to the fee award provisions of \u00a7 1988. Although the \"express language\u201d of the act did not authorize awards against the states, the legislative history specifically addressed the question of awarding attorney fees against state governments. This failure to satisfy what Justice Powell labeled a \"clear statement\u201d rule, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>however, did not prevent the Court from awarding fees to the prevailing party.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-4\">The Attorney General argue[d] that the statute itself must expressly abrogate the States\u2019 immunity from retroactive liability .... Even if we were not dealing with an item such as costs, this reliance would be misplaced. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-5\">The present Act . . . ha[d] a history focusing directly on the question of state liability; Congress considered and firmly rejected the suggestion that States should be immune from fee awards. . . . [Moreover], the claims asserted in <em>Employees </em>and in <em>Edelman v Jordan . . </em>. were based on a statute rooted in Congress\u2019 Art I power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-6\">. . In this case, as in <em>Fitzpatrick v Bitzer </em>. . ., the claim is based on a statute enacted to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . Applying the standard appropriate in a case brought to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, we have no doubt that the Act is clear enough to authorize the award of attorney\u2019s fees payable by the State. <em>[Hutto, supra </em>at 698-699, n 31.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Perhaps of greater interest, however, was the discussion between Justice Brennan, in his concurrence, and Justice Powell, in his partial concurrence and partial dissent, of the eifect of the Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Fitzpatrick </em>and <em>Monell </em>on the states\u2019 liability for damages pursuant to \u00a7 1983. Justice Powell argued that the Eleventh Amendment barred any award of attorney fees against a state absent \"an express statutory waiver\u201d of immunity in the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Justice Brennan took issue with Justice Powell\u2019s claim that \u00a7 1988 did not authorize fee awards against the states. Although concurring in the Court\u2019s opinion, Justice Brennan issued a separate opinion to address arguments put forth by Justice Powell.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>\"Mr. Justice Powell takes the view . . . that unless 42 USC \u00a7 1983 also authorizes damages awards against the States, the requirements of the Eleventh Amendment are not met. Citing <em>Edelman v Jordan, </em>415 US 651 (1974), he concludes that \u00a7 1983 does not authorize damages awards against the State and, accordingly, that \u00a7 1988 does not either. There are a number of difficulties with this syllogism, but the most striking is its reliance on <em>Edelman v Jordan </em>.... <em>[Hutto, supra </em>at 700.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Justice Brennan questioned the continued vitality of Edelman\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 1983 did not abrogate the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity, expressing the view that the issue whether \u00a7 1983 included states as persons was \"an open question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AMOk\">Justice Brennan, as well as numerous state and lower federal court judges, claimed the Court finally answered this question in <em>Quern v Jordan, supra. Quern </em>was actually a sequel to the Court\u2019s earlier decision in <em>Edelman. Quern </em>involved the question whether the Eleventh Amendment precluded a federal court from ordering state officials to mail explanatory notices to plaintiff class members advising them of procedures available to secure a determination of their entitlement to past welfare benefits. The Supreme Court held that it did not, viewing the notice as ancillary to prospective relief already ordered by the lower federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The Court never explicitly addressed the question whether the term \"person\u201d in \u00a7 1983 included states. But, in his concurring opinion, Justice Brennan argued that the majority had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-7\">reachfed] out to decide an issue unnecessary to its holding . . . concluding], in what [was] patently dicta, that a State [was] not a \"person\u201d for pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>poses of 42 USC \u00a7 1983 .... <em>[Quern, supra </em>at 350 (Brennan, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Unfortunately, the ambiguity of the Court\u2019s decision only further complicated the already confused body of case law dealing with \u00a7 1983 claims against the state to the extent that all parties in this suit attempt to bend it to their point of view.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The majority in <em>Quern </em>focused on the issue of congressional intent to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment. The Court began its analysis by reaffirming its holding in <em>Edelman, </em>the continued vitality of which Justice Brennan questioned in his concurrence in both <em>Hutto </em>and <em>Quern. </em>In doing so, the Court adopted the reasoning of Justice Powell in his concurring opinion in <em>Hutto </em>to refute Justice Brennan\u2019s claim that the Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Fitzpatrick </em>and <em>Monell </em>undermined the premise of its opinion in <em>Edelman, </em>that \u00a7 1983 did not abrogate the historic immunity of the states from suit in federal court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-6\">Mr. Justice Brennan\u2019s opinion concurring in the judgment states that <em>\"Edelman v Jordan . . . </em>had held that \u00a7 1983 did not override state immunity, for the reason, as the Court later stated in <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>that '[t]he Civil Rights Act of 1871 . . . had been held in <em>Monroe v Pape </em>... to exclude cities and other municipal corporations from its ambit; that being the case, it could not have been intended to include States as parties defendant.\u2019 \u201d... Since <em>Monell </em>overruled Monroe\u2019s holding that cities and other municipal corporations are not \"persons\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983, Mr. Justice Brennan\u2019s opinion argues that the \"premise\u201d of <em>Edelman </em>has been \"undercut.\u201d . . . The fallacy of this line of reasoning was aptly demonstrated last. Term by Mr. Justice Powell in his concurring opinion in <em>Hutto, </em>where he stated: \"The language in question from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>Fitzpatrick </em>was not essential to the Court\u2019s holding in that case. Moreover, this position ignores the fact that <em>Edelman </em>rests squarely on the Eleventh Amendment immunity, without adverting in terms to the treatment of the legislative history in <em>Monroe v Pape </em>In fact <em>Monroe v Pape </em>is not even cited in <em>Edelman. [Quern, supra </em>at 339, n 7.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Therefore, finding nothing in Eleventh Amendment case law subsequent to <em>Edelman </em>that undermined either its holding or re\u00e1soning, the Court rejected Justice Brennan\u2019s contentions that <em>Edelman </em>was, in essence, no longer good law.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The Court in <em>Quern </em>went on to address Justice Brennan\u2019s concerns about the validity of the <em>Edelman </em>holding that \u00a7 1983 did not abrogate -the historic immunity of the states from suit in federal court. Justice Brennan argued that the history of the Fourteenth Amendment, which worked a great transformation on the nation\u2019s federalist system, the Dictionary Act\u2019s reference to \"bodies politic\u201d in its definition of \"person,\u201d and the language and legislative history of \u00a7 1983 supported his argument that the term \"person\u201d in \u00a7 1983 encompassed states. The Court acknowledged these arguments, but framed its response in terms of the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-8\">[U]nlike our Brother Brennan, we simply are unwilling to believe, on the basis of such slender \"evidence,\u201d that Congress intended by the general language of \u00a7 1983 to override the traditional sovereign immunity of the States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-9\">[N]either logic, the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, nor the legislative history of the 1871 Act compels, or even warrants, a leap from this proposition to the conclusion that Congress intended by the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>language of the Act to overturn the constitutionally guaranteed immunity of the several States. In <em>Tenney v Brandhove, </em>341 US 367 [71 S Ct 783; 95 L Ed 1019] (1951), the Court rejected a similar attempt to interpret the word \"person\u201d in \u00a7 1983 as a withdrawal of the historic immunity of state legislators. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">[G]iven the importance of the States\u2019 traditional sovereign immunity, if in fact the Members of the 42d Congress believed that \u00a7 1 of- the 1871 Act overrode that immunity, surely there would have been lengthy debate on this point and it would have been paraded out by the opponents of the Act along with the other evils that they thought would result from the Act. Instead, \u00a7 1 passed with only limited debate and not one Member of Congress mentioned the Eleventh Amendment or the direct financial consequences to the States of enacting \u00a7 1. We can only conclude that this silence on the matter is itself a significant indication of the legislative intent of \u00a7 1. <em>[Quern, supra </em>at 341-343.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Moreover, the Court reiterated the fact that it consistently required a clearer manifestation of congressional intent to abrogate the states\u2019 historic immunity than demonstrated by Justice Brennan. While equivocating on the question whether Congress had to <em>expressly </em>abrogate the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Court concluded that neither the language nor the legislative his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>tory of \u00a7 1983 indicated an intent on the part of Congress to lift the states\u2019 historic immunity from suit in federal court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">[Section] 1983 [did] not explicitly and by clear language indicate on its face an intent to sweep away the immunity of the States; nor [did] it have a history which focuse[d] directly on the question of state liability and which sht\u00edwjed] that Congress considered and firmly decided to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States. Nor [did] our reaffirmance of <em>Edelman </em>render \u00a7 1983 meaningless insofar as states [were] concerned. See <em>Ex parte Young, </em>209 US 123 (1908). <em>[Quern, supra </em>at 345.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Therefore, absent any evidence indicating congressional intent to lift the states\u2019 immunity, the Court in <em>Quern </em>reaffirmed its holding in <em>Edelman </em>that \u00a7 1983 did not abrogate the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\"><em>Quern </em>remains an ambiguous decision. Justice Brennan\u2019s analysis appeared to merge the issues of \"person\u201d and immunity, arguing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-8\">[i]f a State were a \"person\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1983 ... its immunity under the Eleventh Amendment would be abrogated by the statute. <em>[Quern, supra </em>at 350-351.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">The majority, on the other hand, found the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>dence offered by Justice Brennan to support a conclusion that \u00a7 1983 encompassed states as persons too slender to warrant a conclusion that Congress intended to abrogate the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity. So while the majority spoke in terms of abrogation of immunity, Justice Brennan claimed the Court actually decided the issue whether the state was a person for purposes of suit pursuant to \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Obviously, <em>Quern </em>has definitively answered the Eleventh Amendment question as to the intention of Congress in adopting \u00a7 1983, but it left without a definite answer the question whether it intended the term \"person\u201d to include states for purposes of \u00a7 1983 actions in state courts in which the Eleventh Amendment would not apply.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, <em>Quern </em>further complicated the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">unfortunate marriage of section 1983 doctrine [and] eleventh amendment doctrine .... [Eisenberg, <em>Section 1983: Doctrinal foundations and an empirical </em>study, 67 Cornell L R 482, 518 (1982).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The Court\u2019s ambiguous decision in <em>Quern, </em>coupled with its less than consistent decisions on Eleventh Amendment immunity, has left the commentators and the state and lower federal courts speculating whether <em>Quern </em>did, in fact, resolve the \"person\u201d issue. In fact, a number of commentators equivocate on the question, noting the different interpretations accorded <em>Quern.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-7\">In <em>Quern v Jordan, </em>the Court subsequently may have held generally that states are not suable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>persons under \u00a7 1983. However, because <em>Quern </em>involved a <em>federal court </em>action, it is also possible to read <em>Quern </em>more narrowly as an Eleventh Amendment case.

Nonetheless, we do think a direct answer to the \"person\u201d question is discernible and much needed to resolve the conflicting Court of Appeals views before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">An historical analysis of the reasons why Congress enacted the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 provides some support for the idea that Congress\u2019 failure to abrogate the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity indicated it never intended to subject states to suit as persons pursuant to \u00a7 1983. Section 1 of the Ku Klux Klan Act, the precursor of \u00a7 1983, specifically conferred jurisdiction on the lower federal courts to hear claims on the basis of deprivations of federal rights. In fact, in 1871, the lower federal courts did not yet have federal question jurisdiction. Congress granted jurisdiction to the federal courts, much to the outrage of many congressmen, in order to afford state citizens a forum to rectify violations of federal rights not adequately redressed by state courts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">\"I stand here this day to affirm that [the courts of my home state of Ohio] will give fair and impartial redress to any man whose rights under the Constitution have been violated by anyone whomsoever.

In states where sovereign immunity has been legislatively or judicially abrogated, \u00a7 1983 plaintiffs could take their claims against the state into state court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">This statement, however, completely fails to take account of the historical circumstances surrounding the enactment of \u00a7 1983. Congress specifically conferred jurisdiction on the federal courts because the state judicial system had failed in the enforcement of federal constitutional rights. To argue that aggrieved plaintiffs could seek relief in state courts is to ignore the historical motivation behind enactment of \u00a7 1983. Congress was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-8\">\"driven by existing facts to provide for the several states in the South what they [were] unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>fully provide for themselves; <em>i.e., </em>the full and complete administration of justice in the courts.\u201d <em>[Mitchum v Foster, </em>407 US 225, 241; 92 S Ct 2151; 32 L Ed 2d 705 (1972), citing Cong Globe, 42nd Cong, 1st Sess, 653 (1871) (comments of Senator Osborn).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Furthermore, as fully quoted above, <em>ante, </em>p 554, President Grant said that \"the power to correct these evils is beyond the control of State authorities I do not doubt\u201d; and the United States Supreme Court in <em>District of Columbia v Carter, supra </em>at 427, said \"[t]he solution chosen was to involve the federal judiciary. . . .

We find it unlikely, however, that Congress would have intended to enact a statute creating a remedy for violation of civil rights, while at the same time precluding private individuals from bringing actions under the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ute against states in federal court but permitting such actions against states in state courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">[I]t is our opinion based on <em>Quern </em>and decisions of other states that the term \"persons\u201d in \u00a7 1983 was not intended to include states and state agencies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Moreover, the circumstances surrounding passage of \u00a7 1983 further support our conclusion that, in enacting \u00a7 1983, Congress did not intend to subject states to suit as persons. To begin with, \u00a7 1 of the Ku Klux Klan Act, now \u00a7 1983, occasioned very little debate, suggesting that the provisions of that section were considered fairly noncontroversial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-7\">Debate on the [Ku Klux Klan Act] was extensive. Over one hundred members of both houses presented speeches, most of them opposing passage. Only twenty-eight speakers, less than one-third of those addressing the Act, mentioned section 1. Of those, about half opposed the section; four who opposed the bill in general nonetheless approved of section 1. [Zagrans, <em>supra </em>at 549-550.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Lifting the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity and exposing them to suits for damages, however, was a controversial proposition in 1871. In fact, the absence of debate on a proposition as controversial as directly interfering with state treasuries is indeed \"amazing.\u201d See Nowak, <em>The scope of congressional power to create causes of action against state governments and the history of the Eleventh and Fourteenth Amendments, </em>75 Colum L R 1413, 1467, n 257 (1975).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-9\">In none of the debates was it argued that state governments would be hurt because the section imposed financial liability upon them for viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>tions of the amendment, and at no point in the debates did the proponents of the bill mention that such a provision was contained therein. [Nowak, <em>supra </em>at 1465-1466.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Thus, the limited debate on \u00a7 1 indicates that, in enacting \u00a7 1983, Congress did not intend to abrogate the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity and expose the states to suit for damages pursuant to \u00a7 1983. See also <em>Quern, supra </em>at 355, n 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">In addition, the Dictionary Act, enacted two months prior to the Ku Klux Klan Act, does not preclude the conclusion that Congress did not intend \u00a7 1983 to include states as persons. The Dictionary Act, providing a few general rules of statutory construction, stated that the word \"person\u201d could apply to \"bodies politic and corporate.\u201d But the Dictionary Act was enacted five years <em>after </em>the model for \u00a7 1 of the Ku Klux Klan Act, \u00a7 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-7\">While [the Dictionary Act] was enacted two months before the enactment of the 1871 Civil Rights Act, it came more than five years <em>after </em>passage of \u00a7 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat 27, which served as the model for the language of \u00a7 1 of the 1871 Act.

Therefore, on the states-as-persons issue, we would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Will, </em>and reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">III. ARE STATE OFFICIALS PERSONS?</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">We next consider the status and liability of the Director of State Police as a party, in light of our holding that the state and its departments are not proper parties to a \u00a7 1983 lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">In his brief to this Court, plaintiff does not claim that he sued the director in his personal capacity. In fact, in framing his second issue \u2014 whether \u00a7 1983 included the state and its agencies and officials as persons, Will states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-9\">The State of Michigan, its department of state police, and its officers acting in their <em>official capacities </em>are \"persons\u201d under 42 USC 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">He further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-11\">There is no question that a lawsuit against the Director of State Police would be proper under 42 USC 1983. Individuals are definitely \"persons\u201d for purposes of 42 USC 1983 even where they are also officials of the government. ... In this case Plaintiff sued the Director of the State Police, as well as his department. Since the Court of Claims can render a judgment in an action \"ex delicto\u201d against the State based on the acts of the Director of the State Police <em>acting in his official capacity, </em>it is logical to conclude that this same official ought to bind the State when sued for official actions accomplished in violation of 42 USC 1983. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">Moreover, the early pleadings in the <em>Will </em>case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>indicate that Mr. Will sued the Director of State Police in his official capacity. Neither Mr. Will\u2019s complaint in the Ingham Circuit Court nor in the Court of Claims named the Director of the Michigan State Police personally. All references to the director related only to the office of the Director of State Police. In fact, the Director of State Police is mentioned in only one count, the Michigan constitutional claim, in both the Ingham Circuit Court and Court of Claims complaints. Neither reference, however, names the director personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The state in its brief in this Court, aptly points out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-6\">[t]he action was not brought against the Director by name, it was brought against the Director by official title only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">It is apparent that Mr. Will brought suit for damages under \u00a7 1983 against the Director of the Michigan State Police in his official capacity. Nothing in the record suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">We deal then only with the question whether a state official being sued in an official capacity for retroactive relief is a person for purposes of \u00a7 1983. We would answer in the negative, substantially on the basis of the same analysis employed in part ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\"><em>Ex parte Young, supra, </em>helped to lay the groundwork for the Supreme Court\u2019s development of the concept of official- versus personal-capacity suits. In <em>Young, </em>the Court carved out an exception to the Eleventh Amendment\u2019s prohibition against suing a state in federal court. The Court found the Eleventh Amendment to be no bar to an official-capacity suit for injunctive relief against the Attorney General of Minnesota, Edward Young. Though not identified as an official-capacity suit by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the Court, the form of relief sought, an injunction, indicated the nature of the action. After all,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-4\">[i]f directed against officials in their individual capacity, injunctions would be useless . . . because the purpose of such relief is to change unconstitutional official acts or practices. [Nahmod, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6.04, p 343, n 48.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Despite the obvious effect on the state, the Court claimed that the injunction operated only against the person of Mr. Young. By \"stripping away\u201d the official or representative character of the state attorney general, the Court created the legal fiction that the plaintiffs in Young actually sought relief against Mr. Young, not against the state itself.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-7\">If the act which the state Attorney General seeks to enforce be a violation of the Federal Constitution, the officer in proceeding under such enactment comes into conflict with the superior authority of that Constitution, and he is in that case stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct. <em>[Young, supra </em>at 159-160.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">But in <em>Ford Motor Co v Indiana Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>323 US 459; 65 S Ct 347; 89 L Ed 389 (1945), the Supreme Court found the Eleventh Amendment to be a bar to the recovery of monetary damages from state officials sued in their official capacities. The Court viewed such relief as operating against the state itself, despite the fact that individual state officials were sued.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-9\">[W]hen the action is in essence one for the recovery of money from the state, the state is the real, substantial party in interest and is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>invoke its sovereign immunity from suit <em>even though individual officials are nominal defendants. [Ford Motor, supra </em>at 464. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The Supreme Court, therefore, found that the Eleventh Amendment did not preclude official-capacity suits for injunctive relief because such suits \"stripped\u201d an official of his \"official or representative character,\u201d thus exposing only the <em>individual </em>occupying the office to liability. But the Eleventh Amendment <em>did </em>bar official-capacity suits for monetary relief because such actions were, in effect, suits against the state itself, despite the presence of individual officials as nominal defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">In <em>Edelman, supra, </em>the Court sought to clarify its earlier holdings in <em>Ex parte Young </em>and <em>Ford Motor, </em>analyzing a lower federal court\u2019s order of relief in light of those two decisions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-7\">[T]he relief awarded in <em>Ex parte Young </em>was prospective only; the Attorney General of Minnesota was enjoined to conform his future conduct of that office to the requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-8\">But the retroactive portion of the District Court\u2019s order here, which requires the payment of a very substantial amount of money which that court held should have been paid, but was not, stands on quite a different footing. These funds will obviously not be paid out of the pocket of petitioner Edelman. Addressing himself to a similar situation in <em>Rothstein v Wyman, </em>467 F2d 226 (CA 2, 1972), cert den 411 US 921 (1973), Judge McGowan observed for the court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-9\">\"It is one thing to tell the Commissioner of Social Services that he must comply with the federal standards for the future if the state is to have the benefit of federal funds in the programs he administers. It is quite another thing to order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>the Commissioner to use state funds to make reparation for the past. The latter would appear to us to fall afoul of the Eleventh Amendment if that basic constitutional provision is to be conceived of as having any present force. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-6\">We agree with Judge McGowan\u2019s observations. The funds to satisfy the award in this case must inevitably come from the general revenues of the State of Illinois, and thus the award resembles far more closely the monetary award against the State itself, <em>Ford Motor Co v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, supra, </em>than it does the prospective injunctive relief awarded in <em>Ex parte Young. [Edelman, supra </em>at 664-665.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The Court therefore rejected any distinction between equitable and monetary relief as the line separating permissible versus prohibited relief in official-capacity suits in a federal court. Instead, the Court looked to the prospective versus retroactive nature of the relief sought.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-8\">As in most areas of the law, the difference between the type of relief barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that permitted under <em>Ex parte Young </em>will not in many instances be that between day and night. The injunction issued in <em>Ex parte Young </em>was not totally without effect on the State\u2019s revenues, since the state law which the Attorney General was enjoined from enforcing provided substantial monetary penalties against railroads which did not conform to its provisions. Later cases from this Court have authorized equitable relief which has probably had greater impact on state treasuries than did that awarded in <em>Ex parte Young. . . . </em>But the fiscal consequences to state treasuries in these cases were the necessary result of compliance with decrees which by their terms were prospective in nature. State officials, in order to shape their official conduct to the mandate of the Court\u2019s decrees, would more likely have to spend money from the state treasury than if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>had been left free to pursue their previous course of conduct. Such an ancillary effect on the state treasury is a permissible and often an inevitable consequence of the principle announced in <em>Ex parte Young, supra. [Edelman, supra </em>at 667-668. Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Finally, <em>Alabama v Pugh, </em>438 US 781; 98 S Ct 3057; 57 L Ed 2d 1114 (1978), made clear that the Court\u2019s distinctions between prospective and retroactive relief only applied to suits against state officials in their official capacities. In <em>Pugh, </em>the Court held that issuance of a mandatory injunction against the State of Alabama ran afoul of the Eleventh Amendment. Since the Eleventh Amendment prohibited suit against the state in federal court, any form of relief sought against the state as a <em>named </em>defendant was barred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-6\">Unless a State has waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity or Congress has overridden it, ... a State cannot be sued directly in its own name regardless of the relief sought. <em>Alabama v Pugh . . . . </em>Thus, implementation of state policy or custom may be reached in federal court only because official-capacity actions for prospective relief are not treated as actions against the State. See <em>Ex parte Young </em>.... <em>[Kentucky v Graham, </em>473 US 159, 167, n 14; 105 S Ct 3099; 87 L Ed 2d 114 (1985). Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">In conclusion, an individual may not sue a state as a named defendant in a federal court either for prospective or retroactive relief. A party may institute suit in federal court against a state official in his official capacity for prospective relief, on the basis of a violation of federal law, but the Eleventh Amendment would bar any action seeking retroactive relief. But, see, <em>Pennhurst State School </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>&amp; Hosp v Halderman, </em>465 US 89; 104 S Ct 900; 79 L Ed 2d 67 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">By the same Eleventh Amendment rationale that led us to conclude that a state is not a person and not liable regardless of the forum, we conclude that a state official sued in an official capacity for retroactive relief is not a person under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The case law supports this extension of the distinction between official- and personal-capacity actions to suits in which the Eleventh Amendment does not apply. In <em>Brandon v </em>Holt, 469 US 464; 105 S Ct 873; 83 L Ed 2d 878 (1985), the Supreme Court addressed the liability for damages under \u00a7 1983 of a municipal police director sued in his official capacity. In dicta, the Court noted that before <em>Monell, </em>its decision in <em>Monroe </em>precluded suit against a municipal official in his official capacity because <em>Monroe </em>did not recognize municipalities as persons for purposes of suit under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-6\">In <em>Monroe v Pape, </em>. . . the Court held that a city was not \"a person\u201d within the meaning of 42 USC \u00a7 1983. That construction of \u00a7 1983 protected municipalities from liability in cases <em>of this kind </em>until June 6, 1978, when we decided <em>Monell v New York City Dep\u2019t of Social Services </em>.... The complaint in this case was filed on February 22, 1978, before <em>Monroe v Pape </em>was overruled; this explains why the city of Memphis was not named as a defendant in this case. The timing of the complaint may also explain why petitioners did not expressly allege at the outset of the litigation that they were suing Chapman in his official capacity as Director of Police of the Memphis Police Department. <em>[Brandon, supra </em>at 469. Citations omitted, emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">See, also, Nahmod, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6.04, pp 343-344.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">The Court of Appeals decision in <em>Will, </em>however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>confused the differences between official- and personal-capacity suits. At first, while discussing the Court of Claims jurisdiction over \u00a7 1983 damage actions against state officials, the Court noted that Mr. Will sued the Director of State Police in his <em>official </em>capacity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-5\">[I]t must be noted that plaintiff did not sue the state officials in their individual capacities, so a suit against them in federal court for damages would be barred by the Eleventh Amendment because the state would be the party in fact. <em>[Will, supra </em>at 220-221. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The Court then concluded that the state was not a person for purposes of \u00a7 1983, but at the same time remanded to the trial court the question of the state director\u2019s possible immunity from liability for \u00a7 1983 damage actions. Since the state and, therefore, the director, sued in his official capacity, is not a person under \u00a7 1983, Mr. Will\u2019s suit seeking retroactive relief from the state director must fail, and the question of immunity in any form is then irrelevant. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Kentucky v Graham, supra </em>at 166,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">[an official-capacity suit] is <em>not </em>a suit against the official personally, for the real party in interest is the entity. Thus, while an award of damages against an official in his personal capacity can be executed only against the official\u2019s personal assets, a plaintiff seeking to recover on a damages judgment in an official-capacity suit must look to the government entity itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">In conclusion, we would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Will </em>allowing suit against the Director of State Police and remanding to the trial court the question of the state director\u2019s immunity from liability for \u00a7 1983 damage actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>IV. DOES SMITH\u2019S \"FALSE IMPRISONMENT\u201d ESCAPE GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITY?</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">We next deal with the issue raised in <em>Smith </em>as to whether an intentional tort, such as false imprisonment,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is an exception to governmental immunity either because it is not included within the meaning of the word \"tort\u201d in \u00a7 7 of the governmental immunity act, MCL 691.1401 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.996(101) <em>et seq., </em>or because it is not an exercise of a \"governmental function\u201d under \u00a7 7 of that act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 7 of the governmental immunity act provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\">Except as in this act otherwise provided, all governmental agencies shall be immune from tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>liability in all cases wherein the government agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. Except as otherwise provided herein, this act shall not be construed as modifying or restricting the immunity of the state from tort liability as it existed heretofore, which immunity is affirmed. [MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107).][<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">A plaintiff must plead facts in his complaint in avoidance of immunity, indicating that the alleged tort falls outside the protection afforded by sovereign or governmental immunity. See <em>Ross v Consumers Power (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567, 621, n 34; 363 NW2d 641 (1984); <em>Galli v Kirkeby, </em>398 Mich 527, 532, 540-541; 248 NW2d 149 (1976); <em>McCann v Michigan, </em>398 Mich 65, 77; 247 NW2d 521 (1976) (opinion of Ryan, J.).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-6\">This may be accomplished by stating a claim which fits within one of the statutory exceptions or pleading facts which demonstrate that the tort occurred during the exercise or discharge of a nongovernmental or proprietary function. <em>[Ross, supra </em>at 621, n 34.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Mr. Smith\u2019s claim of false imprisonment, however, does not fit within one of the statutory exceptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>to the governmental immunity act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, the facts of his complaint must demonstrate that the state defendants\u2019 actions in falsely imprisoning him did not involve the exercise or discharge of a governmental function unless, of course, there is a specific exemption for an intentional tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The Court of Claims in granting summary judgment for defendant recognized no such exception for an intentional tort, finding that an act \"may be an exercise or discharge of a governmental function even though it amounts to an intentional tort.\u201d That court further held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-7\">[T]he Court is of the opinion the alleged confinement is protected by governmental immunity. The care, treatment, and custody of Plaintiff, whether as a ward of the state at a state orphanage or mental facility, were governmental functions. The mhts transfer and confinement of Plaintiff in furtherance of his care and treatment were \"sufficiently related\u201d to the custodial function of the orphanage or mental facility to be in the exercise or discharge of these governmental functions. . . . There exists no allegation that Plaintiff\u2019s confinement resulted from a malicious or improper motive completely unrelated to the treatment and care of Plaintiff. See <em>McCann, supra. </em>Nor does the intentional tort alleged reach the assaultive level of obviously unlawful conduct found in <em>Kriger </em>[v <em>South Oakland Co Mutual Aid Pact, </em>399 Mich 835; 250 NW2d 67 (1977), rev\u2019g 49 Mich App 7 (1973)] or <em>Lockaby </em>[v <em>Wayne Co, </em>406 Mich 65; 276 NW2d 1 (1979)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">The Court of Appeals, however, reversed, remanding the false imprisonment claim to the parties for reformulation of their pleadings consistent with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>test that <em>unjusti\u00f1ed </em>intentional acts did not constitute the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">Thus, whenever a plaintiff in a complaint alleges an intentional tort, a defendant may answer arguing that the allegation should be dismissed due to governmental immunity because the action was justified under the particular facts of the case. If the plaintiff does not contest these facts, the allegation would subsequently be dismissed. However, if the plaintiff does contest the facts underlying the justification, the case would proceed to trial. <em>[Smith, supra </em>at 346.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">We agree with the reasoning of the Court of Claims; no intentional tort exception exists, and an act \"may be [the] exercise or discharge of a governmental function even though it results in an intentional tort.\u201d As will be seen, a majority of this Court has never expressly recognized an intentional tort exception to the governmental immunity act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But, in several cases involving intentional torts, the Court has allowed suit to proceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>against the state or local agency despite the presence of governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">In <em>McCann v Michigan, supra, </em>the plaintiff, a newspaper publisher, instituted suit against the State of Michigan, its Department of Mental Health, and the Traverse City State Hospital, alleging that hospital officials and employees wilfully and maliciously engaged in a campaign to destroy plaintiff\u2019s newspaper business. Plaintiff McCann filed suit for damages against the state in the Court of Claims, alleging various intentional torts, including interference with existing and future economic relations, libel, slander, and defamation. The Court of Claims, however, granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the basis of governmental immunity, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. This Court, though issuing four separate opinions, reversed and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals, unanimously agreeing that the activities involved did not constitute the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. However, not one member of the Court rested a decision on an explicit \"intentional tort\u201d exception to the governmental immunity act. Chief Justice Kavanagh and Justice Levin concluded that the governmental immunity act did not apply because the day-to-day operation of a hospital did not constitute a governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Justice Williams found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-6\">defendant state agency\u2019s employees were clearly engaged in <em>ultra vires </em>activity and were not, therefore, involved \"in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d <em>[McCann, supra </em>at 73-74.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Justice Ryan, using the pre-Ross \"common good of all\u201d test for determining a governmental function, concluded that Mr. McCann\u2019s complaint al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>leged facts which, if proved, justified the conclusion that the activities of the state and its agencies did not constitute a governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Finally, Justices Fitzgerald, Coleman, and Lindemer summarily concluded that the complained-of activity did not involve the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. These three justices, however, would have remanded the case to the Court of Claims for an entry of dismissal. They concluded that although a court could impose vicarious liability on an employer for the intentional torts of its employees, the facts of the <em>Mc-Cann </em>case would not support an imputation of liability to the state or its agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Approximately one month later, this Court decided another intentional tort case, <em>Galli v Kirkeby, supra. Galli </em>involved an action instituted against Arthur Kirkeby, an elementary school principal, Olin Adams, Supervisor of the Warren school system, and the Board of Education of the Warren Consolidated Schools by the parents of a student sexually assaulted on numerous occasions by Kirkeby. Summary judgment was denied, the Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal, and this Court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Although three opinions were issued, again no justice found that proof of an intentional tort, in and of itself, removed a state or local agency\u2019s immunity under the governmental immunity act. Chief Justice Kavanagh and Justices Levin and Fitzgerald concluded that the day-to-day operation of a school did not constitute the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Justices Williams and Ryan argued that the appeal involved questions both of direct liability against the school board for its negligence in screening and supervising personnel and of vicari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>ous liability for its employee\u2019s assaults upon a student. By examining the specific activity alleged against the governmental defendant, Justices Williams and Ryan concluded that the trial court erred in refusing to grant the school board\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of the board\u2019s negligence because the board\u2019s actions in screening and supervising its personnel involved the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. But they agreed with the denial of summary judgment as to the board\u2019s vicarious liability for the intentional tort because such activity clearly did not constitute a governmental function.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-6\">[T]he test of whether a governmental agency can claim immunity under the statute is whether the specific activity alleged against the governmental defendant falls within \"the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-7\">We first address the question of whether the school board is immune from suit for its own negligence in allegedly failing to exercise due care in the hiring and supervision of Mr. Kirkeby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-8\">. . . [W]e find that the screening, hiring and supervision of school district personnel by the board in the course of its educational function was an act \"in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-9\">We next consider whether the school board is immune from suit with respect to the alleged tortious activity of its employee. No one will seriously argue that the intentional homosexual assault of a school principal upon a student falls within \"the exercise of a governmental function.\u201d We hold it does not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-10\">The intentional homosexual assault of a school principal upon a school boy even on school time and on school property is not the same thing as negligent tunneling in road construction as in <em>Thomas </em>[v <em>Dep\u2019t of State Highways, </em>398 Mich 1; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>247 NW2d 530 (1976)]. Rather the facts of this case are clearly analogous in principle to the facts in <em>McCann.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">In both this case and <em>McCann </em>a governmental agency is involved whose normal operation is \"the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d However, in both cases an employee of the governmental agency engages intentionally in allegedly tortious action that bears no arguable relationship to the agency\u2019s function. <em>[Galli, supra </em>at 536-538.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Finally, Justices Coleman and Lindemer dissented from the result, concluding that the trial court erred in denying defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the basis of the governmental immunity act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">The school board and Mr. Adams at all times were acting within the exercise of their duties. The applicable statute grants immunity to school districts from tort liability in <em>all </em>cases in which it is acting within its governmental function with certain exceptions, none of which apply to these facts. We must not confuse Mr. Kirkeby\u2019s personal liability with that of the others. In clear language, the Legislature has spoken. If it finds it better public policy to exclude governmental units from immunity in cases where employees act outside of their scope of employment and commit personal offenses, the Legislature should act accordingly. <em>[Galli, supra </em>at 545.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">But, in <em>Lockaby v Wayne Co, </em>406 Mich 65; 276 NW2d 1 (1979), three members of the Court interpreted <em>McCann, supra, </em>as recognizing an intentional tort exception to the governmental immunity act, claiming such a tort could never constitute a governmental function. The case involved a suit instituted against the Wayne County Sheriff, the Administrator of the Wayne County jail, and various city and county governmental agencies by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>James Lockaby, who suffered injuries rendering him a quadriplegic while incarcerated in the Wayne County jail and hospitalized at Detroit General Hospital. Mr. Lockaby eventually filed a five-count amended complaint in the Wayne Circuit Court, the dismissal of which formed the basis for his appeal. Only count i of that complaint, alleging \"intentional infliction of injury,\u201d which was dismissed on the grounds of governmental immunity, is of interest here.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">The Court unanimously agreed to reinstate Mr. Lockaby\u2019s claim of intentional infliction of injury, although once again it failed to reach a consensus on the reasons for doing so. Justice Levin, in an opinion joined by Justices Kavanagh and Fitzgerald, concluded that plaintiff\u2019s claim of intentional injury survived dismissal on the basis of the governmental immunity act because an intentional tort did not constitute the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-5\">Lockaby also claims that he was intentionally injured by agents of the county. While the county is constitutionally immune from \"responsibility]\u201d for the sheriff\u2019s \"acts\u201d that immunity does not extend to the acts of others in its employ. In <em>McCann v Michigan, </em>398 Mich 65; 247 NW2d 521 (1976), in separate opinions, a majority of the Court agreed that an intentional tort was not in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function; the cause was remanded, as it is here, for further proceedings. <em>[Lockaby, supra </em>at 77.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Justice Coleman also agreed to reinstatement of plaintiff\u2019s count i, basically referring to Justice Williams\u2019 separate opinion for her reasons for doing so.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-7\">[Plaintiff\u2019s] allegations state a claim in avoid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>anee of governmental immunity against the named defendants. Liberally construed and viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, they make out a possible case of intentionally tortious acts committed by agents of the defendants, thus potentially not within \"the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d <em>[Lockaby, supra </em>at 78.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Justice Williams concurred in the result reached in Justice Levin\u2019s opinion, but clarified his understanding of the Court\u2019s decision in <em>McCann, supra. </em>Justice Williams did not interpret <em>McCann </em>as establishing the proposition that governmental agencies that commit intentional torts <em>never </em>enjoy the protection of the governmental immunity act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-6\">As in Count i, I concur in the result advanced in Justice Levin\u2019s opinion but I would add a caveat. Count i is captioned \"Intentional Infliction of Injury.\u201d The opinion, citing <em>McCann v Michigan, </em>398 Mich 65; 247 NW2d 521 (1976), states that \"a majority of the Court agreed that an intentional tort was not in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d The statement is not incorrect as explaining the ultimate holding under the facts of <em>McCann, </em>but I do not read <em>McCann </em>as authority for the broad proposition that intended conduct which harms another is never protected by governmental immunity. A tort is a civil wrong and conduct which is wrong within one setting can be permissible within another. For example, a police officer may not intentionally strike a citizen peacefully walking down the street, but his duty may require the police officer to intentionally strike another citizen to prevent him from murdering a third peaceful citizen. Further, <em>McCann </em>clearly sets limits that the conduct must be without and not within the scope of the exercise and discharge of a governmental function. As stated in my sole opinion in <em>McCann, </em>it is the <em>ultra vires </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>activities of public employees which are not protected by the doctrine of governmental immunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-5\">While Count i is not well pleaded with respect to <em>McCann, </em>because I find that <em>ultra vires </em>conduct may be possibly proven, within the inartful language, I concur with Justice Levin that it was erroneously dismissed. <em>[Lockaby, supra </em>at 82-83.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Finally, Justice Moody, although voting to reinstate plaintiffs claim for intentional infliction of injury, did not discuss the relevance of the governmental immunity act.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">It would appear from the foregoing that no member of this Court has directly said that there is an intentional tort exception to governmental immunity, as such, although three members in <em>Lockaby </em>said an intentional tort could never involve the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. It would also appear, on reexamination, that contrary to the view of three justices in <em>Lockaby, </em>a majority of the Court in <em>McCann </em>did not agree \"that an intentional tort was not in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Avp\">Similarly, the Court of Appeals, in <em>Smith, supra, </em>did not establish a blanket intentional tort exception to the governmental immunity act. Instead, the Court developed a test that turned on whether the governmental agency\u2019s intentionally tortious activities were <em>justi\u00f1ed </em>under the circumstances of the case. The Court sought a middle ground, attempting to integrate the two basic positions in <em>Lockaby </em>\u2014 Justice Levin\u2019s exception for all intentional torts with Justice Williams\u2019 conclusion that only intentional torts that are ultra vires remove a governmental agency\u2019s immunity from liability.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-8\">Three justices on the Supreme Court have stated that the government is not immune from an intentional tort. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>On the other hand, three other justices have held that an intentional tort allegation takes the parties outside governmental immunity only if the intentional tort is <em>ultra vires. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-5\">Despite this apparent conflict, we believe that the two views can be reconciled. If a police officer lawfully arrests an individual, he may use reasonable force if that individual resists. . . . Both sides would agree that the police officer is immune by governmental immunity from any suit alleging an intentional tort. However, both sides would also agree that the police officer is not immune if he uses force if the arrestee did not resist or if the officer used unreasonable force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-6\">Underlying Justice Levin\u2019s opinion (in <em>Lockaby) </em>is the argument that the state is never in the business of committing intentional torts. Justice Williams\u2019 opinion clearly states a concern that the state not be liable where a public employee is required to commit an intentional tort to carry out his duty to the public. Both views recognize the reasons for governmental immunity and define immunity within its own perception of what the state\u2019s duty may entail. Both concerns may be met in a test which grants governmental immunity where the employee\u2019s actions were <em>justified </em>under the case\u2019s circumstances. Thus, a police officer\u2019s \"assault\u201d on a person attempting murder is justified by the overriding necessity of protecting the potential victim. The officer\u2019s duties include this protection and sometimes require extraordinary measures. An attendant at a state mental hospital may be justified in \"assaulting\u201d a patient where the patient threatens the safety of himself or others but would not be justified in assaulting the same patient where the patient is merely recalcitrant in dressing. Justice Levin\u2019s concern that the state not be privileged in abusive behavior does not apply where the circumstances require such extraordinary actions and so justify taking the measures. Likewise, Justice Williams\u2019 concern that the state not be punished for acting where it must is also met. <em>[Smith, supra </em>at 345-346.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>In order to now decide whether to recognize any form of intentional tort exception to the governmental immunity act, this Court must first determine whether the Legislature intended the term \"tort liability\u201d in \u00a7 7 of the act to exclude intentional torts. We conclude that nothing on the face of the statute indicates an intent to create such an exception.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-6\">[T]he immunity from tort liability provided by \u00a7 7 is expressed in the broadest possible language \u2014it extends immunity to all governmental agencies for <em>all tort liability </em>whenever they are engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. This broad grant of immunity, when coupled with the four narrowly drawn statutory exceptions, suggests that the Legislature intended that the term \"governmental function\u201d be interpreted in a broad manner. <em>[Ross, supra </em>at 618. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Moreover, as the state defendants aptly note, the Michigan Legislature\u2019s response to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Maki v East Tawas, </em>385 Mich 151; 188 NW2d 593 (1971), indicates that the Legislature intended the immunity conferred by the governmental immunity act to extend to intentionally tortious, as well as negligent, activity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-8\">The history of the governmental immunities [sic] act indicates that the Legislature clearly envisioned that intentional torts would be within the ambit of the immunity conferred by the act. In <em>Maki, </em>. . . this Court examined the governmental immunity act as it then existed. At that time, the operative section of the act, MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) provided immunity from <em>tort </em>liability. The title of the act, however, referred to immunity from <em>negligence </em>liability. The Court held that the act was unconstitutional as then written because the body of the act, in providing immunity from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>tort liability, was much broader than the immunity from negligence liability referred to in the title of the act, thus violating Const 1963, art <em>4, </em>\u00a7 24. In the course of its opinion, the Court made the following observation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-5\">\". . . It is apparent from even a cursory examination of any legal encyclopedia or dictionary that an action based on 'negligence\u2019 is a species of a generic action based in torts. As the trial judge pointed out, the headings in <em>Prosser on Torts </em>refer to actions based on nuisance, direct trespass, assault and battery, false arrest, deceit, defamation, abuse or [sic] process, malicious prosecution and economic duress \u2014 all of which are tort actions apart from negligence and all of which might be brought against a governmental body.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-6\">The types of actions mentioned in the statement of the Court are what are commonly referred to as intentional torts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-7\">Following the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Maki, </em>the Legislature amended the act, not by changing the language of MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) to say \"negligence,\u201d but rather by amending the title of the act by eliminating the reference to \"negligence.\u201d Therefore, the act, as amended, was intended by the Legislature to cover intentional torts and not to apply solely to negligence actions.[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">We agree and restate, it is hoped in clearer fashion than heretofore, that the Legislature did not intend to exclude intentional torts when committed by governmental agencies in the course of a governmental function. It only remains then to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>decide if an intentional tort can arise out of the exercise of a governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">It is obvious, from the review of our struggles with the intentional tort issue and the Court of Appeals attempt in this case to reconcile our efforts, that a clearer standard is needed to decide this issue, as well as to assist the bench and bar. Our previous multiopinion decisions have shown the difficulty of that task. In the <em>McCann, Galli, </em>and <em>Lockaby </em>trilogy, the Court was not so much divided with regard to the answer to the intentional tort question as it was fractionalized with regard to how to pose the question. The analyses behind this trilogy centered on three aspects of the problem. In each case, there were at least two justices who viewed the governmental mission out of which the activity in question arose as being a nongovernmental function, thereby ending their inquiry. This was part of the then-uncertain state of the law as to the meaning of governmental function. In <em>Galli, </em>there was discussion by several justices who found the governmental units vicariously liable, even though they were not directly liable, because the employees\u2019 <em>tortious acts </em>did not amount to a governmental function.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Finally, there was present in each case discussion by some justices as to what level of activity to examine in determining the governmental function question, i.e., the general activity of the unit of government and its programs or the specific conduct that was underway when the alleged tort occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Fortunately, since we last visited the intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>tort issue, we have clarified and resolved the first two aspects of the problem. In <em>Ross, </em>we more clearly set forth a criterion for determining what constitutes a governmental function.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We also, in <em>Ross, </em>definitively established the parameters for vicarious liability.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> What we have not yet definitively decided is at what level of activity \u2014 governmental mission, general activity, or the alleged tortious conduct \u2014 to apply the governmental function test. Only this determination will make it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>possible to decide if an intentional tort can arise out of an exercise of a governmental function.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Plaintiff argues that this Court should focus on the specific <em>conduct </em>of the state or its officers, agents, or employees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\">In short, Plaintiff in this case was transferred on the strength of an administrative order while the statutes on the books clearly required a court adjudication and order. The one issuing the order should have known he had no authority to do so, and the ones who physically transferred Plaintiff to the mental institution acted in reliance on an order that was void on its face. It would be a perversion of the English language to say that this transfer, in clear violation of law, was \"authorized by law.\u201d Because the transfer was not authorized by law, it was <em>ultra vires. </em>And because it was <em>ultra </em>vires, Defendants are not protected by governmental immunity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">State defendants, on the other hand, focus on the general <em>activity </em>engaged in by the state or its officers, agents, or employees at the time the tort occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-8\">In the present case, the activity complained of in Count i of plaintiffs complaint was his confinement by the defendants in state mental institutions. The confinement of individuals in state institutions for the mentally disabled was, during the time of plaintiff\u2019s confinement, expressly authorized under the provisions of 1923 PA 151, the predecessor to the present Mental Health Code. Section 1 of that act (formerly MCL 330.11 [MSA 14.801]) provided that the Department of Mental Health and its predecessor agencies shall maintain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>certain institutions, including a state home and training school to be located at Lapeer, Michigan \"for the humane, scientific, educational and economical treatment\u201d of mentally handicapped persons, and a hospital at Traverse City, Michigan, for the \"humane, scientific and economical treatment of mentally ill persons. . . .\u201d The remaining sections of 1923 PA 151 went on to define in more detail the standards for commitment and care of individuals in state institutions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-5\">There was, therefore, express legislative authorization for the defendants to operate institutions for the mentally disabled and to confine individuals in those institutions. That being the case, the operation of those institutions, including confining people therein, was a governmental function, and the immunity conferred by MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) clearly applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-6\"><em>Ross </em>indicates that state defendants have the better argument. First, this Court defined governmental function in that case as \"an activity\u201d authorized by law. Second, in discussing a governmental agency\u2019s vicarious liability, the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-7\">Where the individual tortfeasor is acting on behalf of an employer, the focus should be on the <em>activity </em>which the individual was engaged in at the time the tort was committed. <em>[Id. </em>at 625. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">Third, although not dispositive, the Court\u2019s discussion of individual immunity later in the <em>Ross </em>opinion indicates that we defined governmental function in terms of the <em>general activity, </em>as opposed to the specific <em>conduct, </em>involved at the time the alleged tort occurred. In distinguishing individual immunity, where governmental function was not a criterion, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Therefore, to determine the existence and scope of the individual\u2019s immunity from tort liability in a particular situation, the <em>specific acts complained of, rather than the general nature of the activity, </em>must be examined. <em>[Id. </em>at 635. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Moreover, in applying the principles enunciated in <em>Ross </em>to the nine cases then before it, the Court focused on the activity, not the specific conduct, of the governmental defendants at the time the alleged torts occurred. See, e.g., <em>id. </em>at 638, 640-643, 645-647 <em>(Willis v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, Siener v Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>and <em>Rocco v Dep\u2019t of Mental Health).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Finally, in <em>Ross, </em>immediately after expounding our theory of vicarious liability, we cited <em>Sherbutte v Marine City, </em>374 Mich 48, 50; 130 NW2d 920 (1964), asserting that a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\">city cannot be held vicariously liable for torts of its police officers committed during the course of an arrest because the officers were engaged in police activity, which is a governmental function entitled to immunity. <em>[Ross, supra </em>at 625.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Therefore, in <em>Ross, </em>we focused on the <em>general activity, </em>not the <em>specific conduct, </em>involved at the time the alleged tort occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">Moreover, the opinion of the federal district court in <em>Smith v Yono, </em>613 F Supp 50, 53-54 (ED Mich, 1985), provides further support for the general activity standard. In <em>Smith, </em>in a suit against municipal defendants and individual police officers for torts committed during the course of an arrest, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-9\">Plaintiff resists summary judgment in favor of the municipal defendants arguing that the <em>conduct </em>of the individual police officers was nongovernmen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>tal. Plaintiffs argument on this point is that the conduct of the officers in using excessive force during the arrest was nongovernmental and beyond the scope of immunity protection. This argument must fail, however, as a clear reading of the <em>Ross </em>opinion militates against such an analysis. In <em>Ross, </em>the Michigan Supreme Court focused upon the <em>activity </em>being engaged in at the time the tort was committed to determine the existence of a governmental function. \"However, <em>if the activity </em>in which the tortfeasor was engaged at the time the tort was committed constituted the exercise or discharge of a governmental function (i.e., the activity was expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law), the agency is immune pursuant to \u00a7 7 of the Governmental Immunity Act.\u201d <em>Ross v Consumers Power, </em>420 Mich at 625; 363 NW2d 641 (emphasis supplied). Here, the activity being engaged in by the officers at the time the alleged torts were committed was the arrest of the plaintiff. Thus, as defendants were engaged in police activity at the time the tort was committed, the municipalities are protected by governmental immunity. As such, state law claims against the municipal defendants should be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">See also <em>Beasley v East Detroit Police Dep\u2019t, </em>626 F Supp 1251 (ED Mich, 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">We think that to use anything other than the general activity standard would all but subvert the broad governmental immunity intended by the Legislature. As those justices in <em>Lockaby </em>indicated when they looked only to the tortious act, it would be difficult to envision a tortious act that is a governmental function. The Court of Appeals definition in <em>Smith </em>of a \"justified act\u201d as the criterion, runs into the same difficulty. Not only is it difficult to envision a justified act as tortious or a tortious act that is justified, but under that standard, a court would be focusing on the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>of the conduct, rather than the function from which it arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">On the other hand, a governmental body could intentionally embark on a tortious course of conduct which would abrogate the immunity of its activity, not because it is tortious, but because it is presumably unauthorized by law and, accordingly, not a governmental function. And, of course, a governmental body could be embarked on an activity not authorized by law that is not in and of itself tortious. If, in the course of carrying out such an activity, a tort was committed, even unintentionally, it would not be immune, because the general activity is not a governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">In more specific terms, if in <em>Smith </em>it was the intent<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> of the defendant mental health department to confine plaintiff, knowing a court order could not be obtained, in order to accomplish illegally what it could not accomplish legally, the activity would be ultra vires and, therefore, a nongovernmental function and immunity would be lost. But if, in bypassing the legislatively prescribed procedure for plaintiff\u2019s commitment, it was not the intent of the defendant to confine someone who could not properly be confined, but rather the confinement was occasioned by time constraints or a desire to cut costs, it would still be within its governmental purpose, even if it resulted in someone being confined who would not have been confined had the correct procedure been followed. In the first instance, the purpose was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>accomplish the commitment of one who was not intended to be committed under the governmental plan, whereas, in the second instance, the purpose was to be about the business of the agency, although there was an intent to cut corners.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The element of intent, then, is utilized under this standard not to distinguish the nature of the tort, but to distinguish a governmental function from a nongovernmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">We conclude this inquiry by finding that intentional torts are immune if committed within the scope of a governmental function; however, the intentional use or misuse of a badge of governmental authority for a purpose unauthorized by law is not the exercise of a governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">In the case before us, Smith did allege the intentional failure to utilize the proper procedures, but he did not allege it was for a nongovernmental purpose. Plaintiff also alleged that it was for the purpose of confining him, but he did not and presumably could not allege that it was not within the scope of the defendant\u2019s authority to confine him under proper circumstances. He did not allege that the defendants were pursuing a nongovernmental purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">On this issue, the decision of the Court of Ap- . peals should be reversed and the judgment of the Court of Claims granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, reinstated.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>V. MAY PLAINTIFFS RECOVER DAMAGES FOR CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS?</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Finally, we consider whether an implicit right to sue for damages for violations of either the federal or state constitution exists. Both plaintiffs, as well as the amicus curiae, raise this issue, although all three expound different theories of recovery. Since neither Mr. Will\u2019s nor amicus curiae\u2019s argument is properly before us, we only address the substantive merits of Mr. Smith\u2019s claim for damages against the state on the basis of Michigan\u2019s 1908 Constitution. We decline to infer any right to sue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>the state for damages on the basis of violations of art 2, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 16 of the 1908 Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">In <em>Bivens v Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, </em>403 US 388; 91 S Ct 1999; 29 L Ed 2d 619 (1971), on remand 456 F2d 1339 (CA 2, 1972), in a 5-1-3 decision, the Supreme Court, for the first time, found an implied right to sue federal officials in federal court for damages on the basis of violations of the federal constitution. The case involved a suit for damages instituted by Webster Bivens against federal narcotics officers on the basis of alleged violations of Mr. Bivens\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights. The federal district court dismissed the case on the ground that Mr. Bivens failed to state a cause of action, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding that Mr. Bivens could recover monetary damages for any injuries resulting from the violation of his Fourth Amendment rights by federal narcotics officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The Court asserted that a damages remedy for injuries resulting from a violation of the Fourth Amendment by federal officials was not an especially \"surprising proposition.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-7\">Historically, damages have been regarded as the ordinary remedy for an invasion of personal interests in liberty. ... Of course, the Fourth Amendment does not in so many words provide for its enforcement by an award of money damages for the consequences of its violation. But \"it is . . . well settled that where legal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a general right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may use any available remedy to make good the wrong done.\u201d <em>[Bivens, supra </em>at 395-396. Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">The Court saw no reason to not conclude that Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Bivens\u2019 complaint stated a cause of action under the Fourth Amendment for which he could recover monetary damage. Even though Congress had not acted to provide such a remedy, the <em>Bivens </em>case did not involve \"special factors counselling hesitation,\u201d such as questions of federal fiscal policy, requiring greater caution on the part of the Court in inferring a private cause of action. Moreover, Congress had not explicitly prohibited private damage suits against federal officials for violations of the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, the Court concluded that Mr. Bivens could sue for and recover monetary damages for injuries sustained as a result of federal officials\u2019 violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">In his concurring opinion, Justice Harlan agreed with the Court\u2019s decision to allow Mr. Bivens\u2019 recovery of monetary damages for the violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. Although Bivens made out a claim for damages, Justice Harlan noted that the appropriateness off money damages for other constitutionally protected interests might \"well vary with the nature of the personal interest asserted.\u201d <em>Bivens, supra </em>at 408-409, n 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">But three members of the Court, Chief Justice Burger and Justices Black and Blackmun, dissented. Although authoring separate opinions, all dissented on similar grounds: the Court should leave to Congress the creation of private causes of action under the constitution.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">There can be no doubt that Congress could create a federal cause of action for damages for an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Although Congress has created such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>a federal cause of action against <em>state </em>officials acting under color of state law [(\u00a7 1983)], it has never created such a cause of action against federal officials. If it wanted to do so, Congress could, of course, create a remedy against federal officials who violate the Fourth Amendment in the performance of their duties. But the point of this case and the fatal weakness in the Court\u2019s judgment is that neither Congress nor the State of New York has enacted legislation creating such a right of action.[<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>] [Bivens, <em>supra </em>at 427-428 (Black, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Therefore, Justice Black viewed either the Congress or the state legislatures as the appropriate fora for resolving the complex policy questions involved in deciding whether to create a private cause of action for damages under the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">In <em>Davis v Passman, </em>442 US 228; 99 S Ct 2264; 60 L Ed 2d 846 (1979), in a 5 to 4 decision, the Supreme Court extended the rationale of <em>Bivens, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>recognizing an implicit right to sue federal officials for damages for violations of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. The case involved a lawsuit instituted by Shirley Davis against her employer, United States Congressman Otto E. Passman, for damages on the basis of sexual discrimination in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, concluded that no cause of action under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment could be inferred to exist on the basis of the criteria established in <em>Cort v Ash, </em>422 US 66; 95 S Ct 2080; 45 L Ed 2d 26 (1975), for determining whether to infer a cause of action under a federal statute.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals decision, holding that Ms. Davis had a cause of action under the Fifth Amendment and could recover money damages for any injuries resulting from the violation of her Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">In its opinion, the Court distinguished between the concepts of \"cause of action\u201d and \"relief\u2019 awarded.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-5\"><em>[CJause of action </em>is a question of whether a particular plaintiff is a member of the class of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>litigants that may, as a matter of law, appropriately invoke the power of the court; and <em>relief </em>is a question of the various remedies a federal court may make available. [Davis, <em>supra </em>at 240, n 18.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The Court first concluded that Ms. Davis had a cause of action under the Fifth Amendment. The Court asserted that the Court of Appeals erred in basing its analysis of a constitutional cause of action on the factors enunciated in <em>Cort v Ash </em>for determining whether to infer a cause of action under a federal <em>statute. </em>The Supreme Court noted that such a statutory inquiry differed fundamentally from an inquiry into whether to infer a cause of action under the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">But though the Court recognized that Ms. Davis had a cause of action under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, it still needed to address the propriety of awarding money damages. The Court provided four reasons for endorsing the notion of monetary awards for injuries resulting from violations of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause. First, absent an award of damages, Ms. Davis\u2019 injury would go unredressed. Since her case did not present complicated questions of valuation or causation, a court could easily determine an appropriate amount of damages to remedy the violation of her federal constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Second, unless the Speech and Debate Clause protected Congressman Passman\u2019s actions, the Court concluded that no \"special factors counsel-ling hesitation\u201d precluded an award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Third, no congressional enactment prohibited persons in Ms. Davis\u2019 position from recovering monetary awards for the violation of their rights under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause. Absent explicit congressional language precluding persons in Ms. Davis\u2019 position from instituting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>private damage suits in federal court, the Court concluded that Ms. Davis could pursue monetary relief for Congressman Passman\u2019s unconstitutional federal employment discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Fourth, the Court did not seem exceedingly concerned that recognition of an implicit right to sue for damages pursuant to the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause would deluge the federal courts with claims.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> But even recognizing the possibility of such a problem, the Court concluded that this did not warrant automatic preclusion of a damages remedy. In short, the Court saw no reason to not allow recovery of damages in a federal court suit for violations of Ms. Davis\u2019 rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Then in <em>Carlson v Green, </em>446 US 14; 100 S Ct 1468; 64 L Ed 2d 15 (1980), in a 5-2-2 decision, the Supreme Court recognized an implicit right to sue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>for damages under the Eighth Amendment, despite the presence of a statutory cause of action under the Federal Tort Claims Act (ptca), 28 USC 2671. In <em>Carlson, </em>the mother of Joseph Jones instituted suit against federal prison officials claiming that their inattention to, and inadequate treatment of, Mr. Jones\u2019 asthma condition caused his death, thus violating his Eighth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The Court began its analysis with a recapitulation of the principles enunciated in <em>Bivens, supra.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-6\"><em>Bivens </em>established that the victims of a constitutional violation by a federal agent have a right to recover damages against the official in federal court despite the absence of any statute conferring such a right. Such a cause of action may be defeated in a particular case, however, in two situations. The first is when defendants demonstrate \"special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.\u201d . . . The second is when defendants show that Congress has provided an alternative remedy which it explicitly declared to be a substitute for recovery directly under the Constitution and viewed as equally effective. <em>[Carlson, supra </em>at 18-19.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">But, no special factors, such as the Court\u2019s reluctance to intrude upon activities accorded constitutional status, indicated that the Court should move with caution in recognizing an implicit right to sue for damages under the Eighth Amendment. After all, the federal officials involved did not enjoy the protection of constitutional provisions such as the Speech and Debate Clause as alleged in <em>Davis, supra. </em>Moreover, the qualified immunity accorded such officials in <em>Butz v Economou, </em>438 US 478; 98 S Ct 2894; 57 L Ed 2d 895 (1978), on remand 466 F Supp 1351 (SD NY, 1979), provided sufficient pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>tection to prevent officials from feeling inhibited in the discharge of their duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">In addition, although Ms. Green could sue for damages for her son\u2019s death pursuant to the ftca, nothing in the statutory language or the legislative history of the act indicated an intent on the part of Congress to make the ftca an exclusive remedy. The Court focused its inquiry on whether Congress intended the ftca to replace, rather than complement, a <em>Bivens </em>remedy. The Court concluded that Congress intended the ftca and <em>Bivens </em>to serve as \"parallel, complementary causes of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Moreover, the Court noted four additional factors, suggesting that a <em>Bivens </em>action was a more effective remedy than a suit pursuant to the ftca. The Court found that these factors further supported its conclusion that Congress did not intend to limit persons like Ms. Green to relief under the ftca. First, since a <em>Bivens </em>action operated against individual federal officials and not the federal government as an entity, it effectively deterred tortious activity. After all, the threat of individual liability provided a greater incentive to individual officials to act responsibly. Second, while the ftca prohibited an award of punitive damages, the case law suggested that an aggrieved plaintiff could recover punitive damages in a <em>Bivens </em>action. Third, in a <em>Bivens </em>action, an aggrieved plaintiff could request a trial by jury, but could not do so when suing under the ftca. Finally, under the ftca, liability of the United States turned on the laws of th\u00e9 <em>state </em>in which the tortious activity occurred.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The <em>Bivens </em>action labored under no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>such restriction. As a result, recognition of a <em>Bivens </em>action for Eighth Amendment violations actually promoted a more uniform system of liability for federal officials. Therefore, the Court concluded that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-5\">ftca [was] not a sufficient protector of the citizens\u2019 constitutional rights, and without a clear congressional mandate [the Court could not] hold that Congress relegated [Ms. Green] exclusively to the ftca remedy. <em>[Carlson, supra </em>at 23.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">In a lengthy critique of the <em>Bivens </em>decision, Justice Rehnquist dissented from the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Carlson. </em>He argued that the constitution did not confer on the judiciary the power to create private damage remedies under specific constitutional provisions and prohibitions; only the legislature possessed that authority.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-7\">[I]t is obvious that when Congress has wished to authorize federal courts to grant damages relief, it has known how to do so and has done so expressly. For example, in 42 USC \u00a7 1983 Congress explicitly provided for federal courts to award damages against state officials who violate an individual\u2019s constitutional rights. With respect to federal officials, however, it has never provided for these types <em>of </em>damages awards. Rather, it chose a different route in 1974 by eliminating the immunity of federal officials under the ftca. <em>[Carlson, supra </em>at 40-41.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>See n 24. Therefore, according to Justice Rehnquist, absent congressional authorization, the courts could not award monetary relief to plaintiffs aggrieved by violations of their federal constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">But in two cases, decided in 1983, <em>Chappell v Wallace, </em>462 US 296; 103 S Ct 2362; 76 L Ed 2d 586 (1983), and <em>Bush v Lucas, </em>462 US 367; 103 S Ct 2404; 76 L Ed 2d 648 (1983), the Supreme Court apparently curtailed the scope of its earlier opinions in <em>Bivens, Davis, </em>and <em>Carlson.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-5\">In these two newest cases, <em>Chappell v Wallace </em>and <em>Bush v Lucas, </em>the Supreme Court substantially raised the barriers to federal court recognition of certain causes of action for money damages arising directly under the Constitution. The Court did so without acknowledging that this was the purpose or effect of its line of reasoning, and without proffering any cogent explanation or justification for this change in the law. [Steinman, <em>Backing off </em>Bivens <em>and the rami\u00f1cations of this retreat for the vindication of First Amendment rights, </em>83 Mich L R 269 (1984).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-6\"><em>Chappell </em>involved Navy enlisted men who instituted a suit for damages against certain of their commanding officers for alleged racial discrimination in violation of rights guaranteed under the federal constitution. The Court rested its decision not to create a <em>Bivens-style </em>remedy on the presence of two \"special factors counselling hesitation.\u201d First, the Court called attention to the unique relationship between a soldier and his commanding officer and the distinctive demands of military discipline. Second, the Court took note of US Const, art I, \u00a7 8, explicitly granting Congress plenary authority over the military, and Congress\u2019 exercise of that authority in establishing a \"com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>prehensive internal system of justice to regulate military life.\u201d The Court concluded that, taken together, these two factors made it \"inappropriate to provide enlisted military personnel a <em>Bivenstype </em>remedy against their superior officers.\u201d <em>Chappell, supra </em>at 302, 304 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">But the Court\u2019s discussion of the second factor counselling hesitation indicated a retreat from the broad remedial scope of its earlier opinions in <em>Bivens, Davis, </em>and <em>Carlson. </em>See Steinman, <em>supra </em>at 285-291; see also Note, <em>Two approaches to determine whether an implied cause of action under the constitution is necessary: The changing scope of the </em>Bivens <em>action, </em>19 Ga L R 683 (1985) (hereinafter cited as <em>Two </em>approaches). To begin with, the Court noted that Congress provided aggrieved military personnel with relief alternative to a <em>Bivens</em>style remedy. But, in examining the congressional remedies provided, the Court failed to apply <em>Carl</em>son\u2019s test of an equally effective alternative remedy explicitly created by Congress as a substitute for <em>Bivens </em>relief. Moreover, in both <em>Bivens </em>and <em>Carlson, </em>the Court indicated that the provision of an \"equally effective alternative remedy\u201d and \"special factors counselling hesitation\u201d served as two distinct reasons for not creating a Bivens-style remedy. In <em>Chappell, </em>the Court used the existence of alternative remedies as a special factor counsel-ling hesitation, thus blurring the distinction between the two.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">Although it is unclear what special factors counsel hesitation, it should at least be clear that the existence of a legislative remedial scheme is not one such factor \u2014 for the existence of such legislation is the subject of the one other situation expressly postulated as defeating the implication of a <em>Bivens </em>remedy. In <em>Carlson, </em>the Court had specified just what sort of congressional action would defeat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>a <em>Bivens </em>claim. Not any relevant legislation, would do, only legislation providing a cause of action that is explicitly declared to be a substitute for, and in Congress\u2019 view is as effective as, a <em>Bivens </em>remedy. In <em>Chappell, </em>the Court retreated from the promise of <em>Bivens </em>and its progeny by failing to require of Congress what it had repeatedly indicated it would require before a <em>Bivens </em>claim would be defeated on the basis of congressional action. The Court utterly failed to acknowledge or defend this retreat. [Steinman, <em>supra </em>at 290.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Thus, without acknowledging it, the Court, in <em>Chappell, </em>made the inference of a <em>Bivensstjle </em>remedy more difficult. See <em>Two approaches, supra </em>at 685-686.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">The Court continued this \"trend\u201d in <em>Bush. </em>In <em>Bush, </em>a nasa aerospace engineer sued the director of the space center at which he was employed for damages on the basis of alleged violations of his First Amendment rights. Despite the fact that Congress provided a \"less than complete remedy\u201d for the wrong suffered, the Court declined to create a Bivens-style remedy for Mr. Bush.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">The Court seemed to give special deference to Congress\u2019 ability to balance the policy considerations relevant to a determination of whether to create a remedy for a harm suffered. The Court noted that Congress had carefully balanced the conflicting policy considerations in creating an elaborate and comprehensive set of remedies for those persons in the federal civil service like Mr. Bush. The Court found that the question whether to augment a remedial scheme carefully constructed by Congress did not turn merely on a determination that existing remedies failed to provide complete relief. Instead, the Court asserted that the decision to create a Bivens-style remedy in these circumstances hinged on a careful eval\u00faa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>tion of the relevant policy considerations. In the end, the Court deferred to Congress\u2019 superior expertise,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-4\">convinced that Congress [was] in a better position to decide whether or not the public interest would be served by creating [a Bivens-style remedy in this case]. <em>[Bush, supra </em>at 390.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">As in <em>Chappell, </em>the Court in <em>Bush </em>apparently retreated from the broad remedial stance taken in the earlier <em>Bivens, Davis, </em>and <em>Carlson </em>cases. To begin with, the Court once again failed to examine the civil service remedial scheme in <em>Bush </em>in light of <em>Carlson\u2019s </em>test of an \"equally effective alternative remedy.\u201d Moreover, the Court seemed to avoid the question whether it should create a right to sue for damages, by claiming that Congress possessed superior expertise in balancing the policy considerations relevant to the decision whether to create a Bivens-style remedy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-6\"><em>Bush </em>is troublesome because the Court seems to have abdicated its responsibility to decide whether a remedy should be implied [sic] from the first amendment under the circumstances presented. It said that that decision should be made in light of a broad range of policy considerations and any special factors counselling hesitation. But in the very course of deciding <em>whether </em>Congress\u2019 role in federal personnel matters constituted such a \"special factor,\u201d the Court seemed, unconsciously, to shift its attention to whether a damage remedy should exist. It decided that Congress was better able than a court to decide that question. If so here, why not always, given Congress\u2019 ubiquitous ability to inform itself through fact-finding procedures not available to the courts? What has become of the once clearly discernible message of the Constitution that the judiciary should be the primary means through which constitutional rights are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>enforced? In its ostensibly \"conservative\u201d desire to defer to Congress on all remedial matters, the Court abdicated its responsibility. [Steinman, <em>supra </em>at 295-296. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Thus, both <em>Chappell </em>and <em>Bush </em>signal a retrenchment from the broad remedial scope evident in the Court\u2019s earlier <em>Bivens, Davis, </em>and <em>Carlson </em>opinions. Both <em>Chappell </em>and <em>Bush </em>suggest greater caution and increased willingness on the part of the Court to defer to Congress on the question whether to create damages remedies for violations of the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">\n<em>A. SMITH</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Plaintiff Smith argues that we should create a Bivens-style remedy for violations by state entities of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of Michigan\u2019s 1908 Constitution.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Although Mr. Smith preserved this issue for appeal, we decline to recognize such a remedy for the violation of these provisions of the 1908 Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Mr. Smith claims that state defendants violated his constitutional rights under both state constitutions spanning his nearly fifty-year confinement, including but not limited to art 2, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 16 of the 1908 Constitution. Article 2, \u00a7 1 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-10\">All political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for their equal benefit, security and protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">Article 2, \u00a7 16 provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-12\">No person shall be compelled in any criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">We deal here only with plaintiffs claims for damages on the basis of violations of Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 16.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Plaintiff avers in his complaint the violation of constitutional rights including, <em>but not limited to, </em>art 2, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 16. But he provides this Court with no indication of what other rights the state violated, besides his right to equal protection and due process of the law, which art 2, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 16, respectively, guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Since plaintiff specifically pled the violation of art 2, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 16 of the 1908 Constitution, we only address the question whether to infer a right to sue for damages from these two state constitutional provisions. See n 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Plaintiff argues that Michigan has long recognized the propriety of awarding damages for a violation of the Taking Clause of the state constitution. Although he acknowledges that the Taking Clause, Const 1963, art 10, \u00a7 2; Const 1908, art 13, \u00a7\u00a7 1-5, expressly provides for damages, plaintiff argues that the logic of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bivens </em>warrants recognition of an implicit right to recover damages for the violation of state constitutional rights by state agencies. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">First, neither the United States Supreme Court nor the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has expressly recognized a right to recover damages for constitutional violations by <em>state agencies. </em>In <em>Bivens, Davis, </em>and <em>Carlson, </em>the Supreme Court recognized an implicit cause of action for violations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>the federal constitution by <em>federal officials, </em>not federal or state governmental agencies. In addition, although the Sixth Circuit has recognized a Bivens-style remedy for violations by federal officials of a plaintiffs First Amendment rights, <em>Yiamouyiannis v Chemical Abstracts Service, </em>521 F2d 1392 (CA 6, 1975), later app 578 F2d 164 (CA 6, 1978), cert den 439 US 983 (1978), and Fifth Amendment rights, <em>Hall v United States, </em>704 F2d 246 (CA 6, 1983), cert den 464 US 1002 (1983), the Court of Appeals has never expressly extended the logic of the <em>Bivens </em>line of cases to allow the recovery of damages from <em>state agencies </em>for violations of a plaintiffs constitutional rights.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Moreover, the Supreme Court has never extended the reasoning of <em>Bivens </em>to violations of the Fourteenth Amendment, and, as Justice Harlan noted in his concurrence in <em>Bivens, </em>the appropriateness of money damages for other types of constitutionally protected interests might \"well vary with the nature of the personal interest asserted.\u201d We note that the rights asserted by plaintiff are very similar to those protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-7\">[After all,] [t]his Court has held numerous times that the Michigan Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7 1, secures the same right of equal protection as does its counterpart in the Constitution of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>States. <em>Gauthier v Campbell, Wyant &amp; Cannon Foundry Co, </em>360 Mich 510, 514 [104 NW2d 182 (1960)] and cases therein cited. <em>[Fox v Employment Security Comm, 379 </em>Mich 579, 588; 153 NW2d 644 (1967).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">See also <em>Baldwin v North Shore Estates Ass\u2019n, </em>384 Mich 42, 50-51; 179 NW2d 398 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of whether to recognize a Bivens-style remedy for violations of the Fourteenth Amendment proves persuasive in our disposition of whether to recognize a right to recover damages for violations of Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7 1. The question whether to recognize a <em>Bivens</em>style remedy for violations of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal constitution confronted the Supreme Court in <em>Mt Healthy Bd of Ed v Doyle, </em>429 US 274; 97 S Ct 568; 50 L Ed 2d 471 (1977). Although presented with this issue in <em>Mt Healthy, </em>a <em>pre-Monell </em>decision, the Court left unanswered the question whether to infer a right to sue for damages for violations of the Fourteenth Amendment by a municipal school board.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-7\">The question of whether the Board\u2019s arguments [that the federal court lacked jurisdiction of Mr. Doyle\u2019s claim pursuant to 28 USC 1331 because the board was not a \"person\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1983] should prevail, or whether as respondent urged in oral argument, we should, by analogy to our decision in <em>Bivens . . </em>. imply [sic] a cause of action directly from the Fourteenth Amendment which would not be subject to the limitations contained in \u00a7 1983, is one which has never been decided by this Court. Counsel for respondent at oral argument suggested that it is an extremely important question and one which should not be decided on this record. We agree with respondent. <em>[Mt Healthy, supra </em>at 278. Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Therefore, the Supreme Court\u2019s hesitation to rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>ognize a <em>Bivens-style </em>remedy for violations of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal constitution suggests caution in recognizing such a novel theory of recovery in our jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Second, allowing suits for damages against state agencies for violations of the state constitution does not further the goal of deterrence underlying a <em>Bivens-style </em>action. In <em>Carlson, supra, </em>the Supreme Court noted that a <em>Bivens </em>remedy not only compensated victims, but also acted as a deterrent to unconstitutional activity by federal officials. See <em>ante, </em>p 620. However, making governmental bodies, as opposed to individual officials, liable for damages for constitutional violations lessens the deterrent effect of a Bivens-style remedy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-7\">Shifting liability to the government, or some unit thereof, might well increase the chances of actual recovery by a plaintiff who won a judgment, as the United States is much less likely to be judgment-proof than is an individual. But it is by no means certain that the goal of deterring violations of constitutional rights would be better served by such a shift. The notion that deterrence would be promoted by the shift to government liability is counterintuitive. See, e.g., <em>Carlson v Green, </em>446 US 14, 21 (1980). Moreover, many factors other than a government unit\u2019s vulnerability to money judgments for the unconstitutional activities of its agents affect how well the unit will train its personnel to respect the constitutional rights of its own members and of the public it serves. See, e.g., P. Schuck, [Suing Government (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1983)], at 105-08. And there are influences on individual agents other than the values inculcated by the agencies that employ them. Nor is it certain that vigorous decisionmaking, of a desirable sort, would be enhanced by a shift of liability to the government. A government agency\u2019s self-protective tendencies could cause it to inculcate a cautiousness that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>would be worse than the individually evolved self-protective tendencies which concern Schuck. New or different sanctions available against individual officials could keep them timid. Even if decision-making were to be invigorated by a shift to government liability, that might well occur only at the cost of increased and increasingly serious violations of constitutional rights. Still another factor is that the shift to government liability would frustrate whatever desire victims have for personalized retribution. [Steinman, <em>supra </em>at 280-281, n 69.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Third, the <em>Bivens </em>line of cases indicates a balance between the competing values of fully compensating victims for violations of their constitutional rights and deferring to the policymaking expertise of the legislative branch. The Supreme Court\u2019s most recent decisions in <em>Chappell </em>and <em>Bush, </em>however, indicate a shift towards greater deference to the Legislature\u2019s ability to balance conflicting policy considerations. See <em>Two approaches, supra </em>at 686. Moreover, the Court has apparently abandoned its stringent \"equally effective alternative remedy\u201d test from <em>Carlson, </em>allowing courts to consider the existence of alternative remedies as \"special factors counselling hesitation.\u201d See <em>ante, </em>p 623. In essence, the Court has made the recognition of Bivens-style remedies more difficult while showing greater deference to the policymaking expertise of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Finally, the unusual factual circumstances of this case suggest consideration of the \"special factors counselling hesitation\u201d factor. To begin with, although the 1908 Constitution no longer exists, plaintiff wants us to create, in essence, a special remedy effectively applicable only to the facts of his case. Moreover, those sections of the 1963 Constitution, comparable to the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>the 1908 Constitution under which plaintiff sued, indicate that we should defer to the Legislature the question whether to create a damages remedy for violations of a plaintiffs rights to due process or equal protection. For example, the Equal Protection Clause of the 1963 Constitution (art 1, \u00a7 2) leaves its implementation to the Legislature.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-6\">[Under art 1, \u00a7 2] the legislature is empowered to create and define the \"civil rights\u201d that it feels are deserving of protection. The nature and scope of these rights, <em>and the remedies available </em>for their violation, are left to legislative judgment. [Cramton, <em>The powers of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, </em>63 Mich L R 5, 13 (1964). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Thus, the Equal Protection Clause of the 1963 Constitution requires the Legislature to create the rights and remedies available under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Thus, for this Court to accept the plaintiff\u2019s invitation to adopt and even extend the <em>Bivens </em>rationale, for one person on the basis of a constitution no longer in existence, would not be prudent. We decline to create such a novel remedy as the right to sue the state for damages for violations of the state constitution. We defer to the Legislature\u2019s unique capacity to weigh the competing policy considerations implicated in creating such a damages remedy.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Therefore, we would reverse the Court of Appeals affirmance of the Court of Claims denial of defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs Michigan constitutional claim._</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>\n<em>B. WILL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Next, Mr. Will argues that we should award him damages for the violation, by the Department of State Police, of the following rights under the Michigan Constitution: (1) the right to promotion based on merit, art 11, \u00a7 5; (2) the right to the equal protection of the laws, art 1, \u00a7 2; and (3) the right to due process of law, art 1, \u00a7 17. Mr. Will, however, bases his theory of recovery not on an analogy to the <em>Bivens </em>line of cases, but on the existence of a \"cumulative judicial remedy\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> to recover compensation for civil rights violations. We do not consider the merits of Mr. Will\u2019s argument, however, because he failed to preserve his claim for appeal. Thus, his Michigan constitutional claim is not properly before us.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">In order to understand the lack of preservation, a brief recapitulation of the procedural history is necessary. Plaintiffs January, 1978, complaint in Ingham Circuit Court consisted of the following three counts: (1) count i, alleging, inter alia, denial of due process of law as a result of the Civil Service Commission denying plaintiff a grievance hearing, (2) count ii, asserting a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1983, and (3) count hi, asserting a claim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>damages on the basis of alleged violations of the Michigan Constitution. In June of 1978, the Ingham Circuit Court remanded Mr. Will\u2019s case to the esc for a fourth-step grievance hearing. The circuit court retained jurisdiction to hear any appeals from the administrative hearing decision. Then, in November of 1978, plaintiff filed a complaint in the Court of Claims. That complaint consisted of the following two counts: (1) count i, asserting a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1983 (count ii in the Ingham Circuit Court), and (2) count ii, asserting a claim for damages pursuant to the Michigan Constitution (count iii in the Ingham Circuit Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">In an opinion dated May 7, 1979, the Court of Claims dismissed plaintiff\u2019s Michigan constitutional claim, stating that plaintiff had not exhausted his administrative remedies and that plaintiff could appeal in the Ingham Circuit Court at the conclusion of the administrative proceedings; that dismissal was not appealed. Therefore, when the Court of Claims, in the same opinion, granted plaintiff\u2019s motion to consolidate the Ingham Circuit Court and Court of Claims actions, only plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims were consolidated. In June of 1980, the grievance hearing officer ruled in plaintiff\u2019s favor, finding a violation of Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5, and the esc affirmed the decision. Since plaintiff never appealed this decision in the Ingham Circuit Court, and neither appealed the Court of Claims dismissal of his Michigan constitutional claim nor sought reinstatement of that claim, his claim for relief on the basis of the Michigan Constitution expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">As state defendants aptly note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-6\">Mr. Will argues that the Court of Claims and the Court of Appeals should have found that the state was liable for violations of Const 1963, art 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 2 and 17, and art 11, \u00a7 5. Mr. Will made these allegations in his original Court of Claims Count n that was dismissed on July 10, 1979. Mr. Will never once moved under GCR 1963, 118.3 to amend to conform to the \"proofs.\u201d Nor did Mr. Will ever seek to have the Court of Claims reinstate his original Count ii. Nor did Mr. Will ever seek leave to appeal the dismissal of his original Count n in the Court of Claims. Nor did Mr. Will ever appeal by right the dismissal of his original Count ii in the Court of Claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-5\">Mr. Will argues that because he made an argument to the Circuit Court in relation to Circuit Court Count in concerning an alleged deprivation of rights under the Michigan Constitution, the Circuit Court argument automatically applied to Count ii of the Court of Claims Complaint that had been dismissed two years earlier, and for which Mr. Will never made any motion to reinstate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-6\">Mr. Will never appealed the Final Judgment of the Circuit Court to the Court of Appeals, and Circuit Court matters are not before this Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Both the Court of Claims opinion of May 7, 1979, and the subsequent order of July 11, 1979, informed plaintiff that the Court had dismissed his claim on the basis of the Michigan Constitution and that any appeal lay with the circuit court at the conclusion of the administrative proceedings then pending.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-8\">Plaintiff has not yet exhausted his administrative remedies. A grievance proceeding has been ordered and is in the process of being organized. At the conclusion of the administrative proceedings, plaintiff may appeal to the Circuit Court of Ingham County. An action at this time in the Court of Claims is improper and accelerated judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>ment as to Count n [Michigan constitutional claim] is hereby granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Obviously, when the Court in the same May 7, 1979, opinion granted plaintiffs motion to consolidate the Circuit Court and Court of Claims actions, the understanding was that only the plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claims remained for consolidation. A subsequent opinion of the Court of Claims made clear this understanding.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">In conclusion, we find that Will failed to preserve his constitutional claim for appeal.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">First, we would hold that the term \"person\u201d under \u00a7 1983 does not include states. Thus, we would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Will, </em>and reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Second, we would hold that a state official, sued in his official capacity for retroactive relief, is not a person for purposes of suit under \u00a7 1983. Thus, we would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Will </em>on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Third, we would hold that no intentional tort exception to the governmental immunity act exists, and that an intentional tort arising out of a governmental function is immune. Thus, we would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Smith </em>and reinstate the Court of Claims grant of defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Finally, we would find that there is no implicit right to sue the state for damages on the basis of violations of Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 16. Thus, in <em>Smith, </em>we would reverse the Court of Appeals affirmance of the Court of Claims denial of defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<judges id=\"b859-9\">Riley, C.J., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-6\"> Mr. Will sued the Department of Civil Service, the State Personnel Director, the Department of State Police, and the Director of State Police.

Whenever a governmental agency engages in an activity which is not expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law (i.e., an <em>ultra vires </em>activity), it is not engaging in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.

The agency is vicariously liable in these situations because it is in effect furthering its own interests or performing activities for which liability has been statutorily imposed. However, if the activity in which the tortfeasor was engaged at the time the tort was committed constituted the exercise or discharge of a governmental function (i.e., the activity was expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law), the agency is immune pursuant to \u00a7 7 of the governmental immunity act.

He lived in foster care homes from 1973 until his death in February, 1984, during the pendency of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Count m of plaintiffs Court of Claims complaint alleges that Jack Smith was not retarded at birth, but that he became retarded as a result of his improper or illegal institutionalization as a young child. Plaintiffs amended complaint also alleges an equal protection violation under the 1908 Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">The defendant moved for summary judgment on the basis that the state is immune from liability for plaintiffs injuries. The Court of Claims found governmental immunity inapplicable to the constitutional tort allegations of count in. We agree and would remand count iii to the Court of Claims for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-9\">Except as otherwise provided in this act, all governmental agencies shall be immune from tort liability in all cases wherein the government agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. Except as otherwise provided in this act, this act shall not be construed as modifying or restricting the immunity of the state from tort liability as it existed before July 1, 1965, which immunity is affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">The plaintiff argues that this statute does not immunize the state from liability for its unconstitutional acts; the defendant counters that plaintiff has merely alleged torts, not constitutional viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>tions, and that MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) clearly covers tortious behavior. Defendant fails to argue that, assuming a constitutional violation has been alleged, statutory immunity bars recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Assuming the plaintiff proves an unconstitutional act by the state which is otherwise appropriate for a damage remedy, the question which confronts this Court is whether sovereign or governmental immunity shields the state from liability for damages for its alleged acts which violate our state constitution. We would hold that neither common-law sovereign immunity nor the governmental immunity found in MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) bars recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">In our constitutional form of government, the sovereign power is in the people, and \"[a] Constitution is made for the people and by the people.\u201d <em>Michigan Farm Bureau v Secretary of State, </em>379 Mich 387, 391; 151 NW2d 797 (1967) (quoting Cooley, Constitutional Limitations [6th ed], p 81). The Michigan Constitution is a limitation on the plenary power of government, and its provisions are paramount. See, generally, <em>Dearborn Twp v Dearborn Twp Clerk, </em>334 Mich 673, 688; 55 NW2d 201 (1952). It is so basic as to require no citation that the constitution is the fundamental law to which all other laws must conform. All state public officers, legislative, executive, and judicial, are required by Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 1, to swear or affirm to support that same document.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>In light of the preeminence of the constitution, statutes which conflict with it must fall. A basic rule of constitutional interpretation is that \"wherever possible an interpretation that does not create constitutional invalidity is preferred to one that does.\u201d <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390, 406; 185 NW2d 9 (1971). Thus, interpretations which avoid confrontations between statutes and the constitution are generally favored.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) does not, by its terms, declare immunity for unconstitutional acts by the state. The idea that our Legislature would indirectly seek to \"approve\u201d acts by the state which violate the state constitution by cloaking such behavior with statutory immunity is too farfetched to infer from the language of MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107). We would not ascribe such a result to our Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Neither does common-law sovereign immunity immunize the state from liability for its alleged unconstitutional acts. This Court abrogated common-law sovereign immunity in <em>Pittman v City of Taylor, </em>398 Mich 41; 247 NW2d 512 (1976). Even absent such general abrogation, however, we would decline to apply sovereign immunity to violations by the state of our state constitution. The curious doctrine of sovereign immunity in America, subject to great criticism over the years, see, generally, Jafle, <em>Suits against governments and officers: Sovereign immunity, </em>77 Harv L R 1 (1963), should, as a matter of public policy, lose its vitality when faced with unconstitutional acts of the state. The primacy of the state constitution would perforce eclipse the vitality of a claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>common-law sovereign immunity in a state court action for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Tort claims against government can, however, be premised on two separate theories: direct liability from the agency\u2019s own acts, or vicarious liability for the acts of its employees, officers, and agents. See <em>Ross v Consumers Power (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567, 621-625; 363 NW2d 641 (1984). In <em>Ross, </em>p 624, we noted that <em>\"[rjespondeat superior </em>liability generally can be imposed only where the individual tortfeasor acted during the course of his or her employment and within the scope of his or her authority.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For \"constitutional torts,\u201d liability should only be imposed on the state in cases where a state \"custom or policy\u201d mandated the official or the employee\u2019s actions. <em>Ross </em>held that the general effect of statutory immunity was to ban vicarious governmental liability for the acts of agents, officers, and employees. Those policy reasons which restrain us from reading MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) to immunize the state for its direct violations of the constitution do not also require imposing vicarious liability for acts of state officers, employees, or agents which violate the state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The state\u2019s liability should be limited to those cases in which the state\u2019s liability would, but for the Eleventh Amendment, render it liable under the 42 USC 1983 standard for local governments articulated in <em>Monell v New York City Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>436 US 658; 98 S Ct 2018; 56 L Ed 2d 611 (1978). Liability should be imposed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>state only where the action of a state agent \"implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body\u2019s officers . . . [or] governmental 'custom\u2019 even though such a custom has not received formal approval through the body\u2019s official decisionmaking channels.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 690-691. Thus, statutory immunity would continue to bar suit for cases in which the only possible liability of the state is based upon respondeat superior. Cf. <em>id., </em>691-694.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">A limitation of the state\u2019s liability to situations in which the injury occurs as the result of a custom or policy of the state is dictated by prudential concerns. First, the public policy concerns which militate a remedy are greatest when the state has such \"primary governmental liability.\u201d Compare Note, <em>Rethinking sovereign immunity after </em>Bivens, 57 NYU L R 597, 637 (1982) (advocating abolition of the sovereign immunity of the United States for constitutional torts). This standard avoids the spectre of multitudinous lawsuits against the state for the unauthorized tortious acts of employees. Such a cause of action also is \"more manageable: causation is more easily proven and the locus of liability is more readily ascertained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It also serves the objective of deterring future similar unconstitutional acts while still providing compensation for the injured party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">In a case involving an alleged unconstitutional act by the state government, neither sovereign nor statutory immunity should bar liability. The injury arises from violation of a constitutionally protected right by the government, a right engendered by \"the basic law which created and seeks to control that government.\u201d Dellinger, <em>Of rights and remedies: The constitution as a sword, </em>85 Harv L R 1532, 1557 (1972). The primacy of the constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>tion must eclipse the power of immunity to countenance constitutional violations by the state without concomitant liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Therefore, we would remand this case to the Court of Claims<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for determination of whether an act which violates the state constitution by virtue of a governmental custom or policy has been alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">The question, subsidiary to this appeal, which next arises is whether a damage remedy exists for violations of individual rights protected by the Michigan Constitution. No general statute provides such a remedy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Can such a remedy be inferred directly from protections found in the Michigan Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">No lawyer is unaware of the damage remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>implicit in <em>Bivens v Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, </em>403 US 388; 91 S Ct 1999; 29 L Ed 2d 619 (1971), for violations by federal officers of rights protected by the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Bivens, </em>the United States Supreme Court recognized a cause of action for damages against individual federal officers arising directly from the Fourth Amendment, rather than from legislation. In a brief opinion, the Court noted that money damages are \"the ordinary remedy for an invasion of personal interests in liberty,\u201d <em>id., </em>p 395, that the case involved \"no special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress,\u201d <em>id., </em>p 396, and that \" '[t]he very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>p 397, quoting <em>Marbury v Madison, </em>5 US (1 Cranch) 137, 163; 2 L Ed 60 (1803).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">After <em>Bivens, </em>the United States Supreme Court has inferred damage remedies directly from other provisions of the United States Constitution. See <em>Davis v Passman, </em>442 US 228; 99 S Ct 2264; 60 L Ed 2d 846 (1979) (Fifth Amendment equal protection cause of action for gender-based discrimination), and <em>Carlson v Green, </em>446 US 14; 100 S Ct 1468; 64 L Ed 2d 15 (1980) (Eighth Amendment cause of action). Lower federal courts have also inferred damage remedies under the First and Sixth Amendments. See, generally, Anno: <em>Implication of private right of action from provision of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number><em>United States Constitution </em>\u2014 Federal <em>cases, </em>64 L Ed 2d 872 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">In state courts, the <em>Bivens-type </em>judicially inferred damage cause of action for violations of state constitutions has received a varied response. See, generally, Friesen, <em>Recovering damages for state bills of rights claims, </em>63 Tex L R 1269 (1985). Several state courts have recognized damage remedies inferred from state constitutional provisions. See <em>Widgeon v Eastern Shore Hosp Center, </em>300 Md 520; 479 A2d 921 (1984) (improper seizure and due process); <em>Schreiner v McKenzie Tank Lines, </em>408 So 2d 711 (Fla App, 1982), approved by 432 So 2d 567 (Fla, 1983) (employment discrimination); <em>Gay Law Students Ass\u2019n v Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co, </em>24 Cal 3d 458; 156 Cal Rptr 14; 595 P2d 592 (1979) (Equal Protection Clause); <em>Walinski v Morrison &amp; Morrison, </em>60 Ill App 3d 616; 18 Ill Dec 89; 377 NE2d 242 (1978) (employment discrimination); <em>Strauss v New Jersey, </em>131 NJ Super 571; 330 A2d 646 (1974) (due process violation). Several other state courts have commented favorably upon inferred constitutional damage remedies, albeit in dicta. See, e.g., <em>Phillips v Youth Development Program, </em>390 Mass 652, 657-658; 459 NE2d 453 (1983) (\"a person whose constitutional rights have been interfered with may be entitled to judicial relief even in the absence of a statute providing a procedural vehicle for obtaining relief\u2019). Other states have avoided the issue by finding a statutory cause of action. See, e.g., <em>State v Haley, </em>687 P2d 305, 317-318 (Alas, 1984). Some courts have rejected the remedy primarily, one suspects, because of the doctrines of sovereign or governmental immunity, rather than because of a rejection of the <em>Bivens </em>analysis. See <em>Figueroa v Hawaii, </em>61 Hawaii 369, 382; 604 P2d 1198 (1979) (\"we are not free to abolish the State\u2019s sovereign immunity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>the State remains immune from a <em>Bivens-type </em>claim\u201d); <em>Rockhouse Mtn Property Owners Ass\u2019n v Town of Conway, </em>127 NH 593; 503 A2d 1385 (1986) (governmental immunity a factor in denying damage remedy for alleged violations of state due process and equal protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">We would recognize the propriety of an inferred damage remedy arising directly from violations of the Michigan Constitution in certain cases. As the <em>Bivens </em>Court recognized, there are circumstances in which a constitutional right can only be vindicated by a damage remedy and where the right itself calls out for such a remedy. On the other hand, there are circumstances in which a damage remedy would not be appropriate. The absence of any other remedy would, as in <em>Bivens, </em>heighten the urgency of the question. Justice Harlan, concurring in <em>Bivens, </em>states that \"[t]he question then, is, as I see it, whether compensatory relief is 'necessary\u2019 or 'appropriate\u2019 to the vindication of the interest asserted.\u201d 403 US 407. In answering this question in the positive, Justice Harlan commented, \"[f]or people in <em>Bivens\u2019 </em>shoes, it is damages or nothing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 410. Where a statute provides a remedy, the stark picture of a constitutional provision violated without remedy is not presented. While a Bivens-type action may still be inferred, see <em>Carlson v Green, supra </em>(federal tort claims remedy no bar to <em>Bivens </em>action), the existence of a legislative scheme may constitute \"special factors counselling hesitation,\u201d <em>Bivens, supra, </em>p 396, which militate against a judicially inferred damage remedy. See, e.g., <em>Bush v Lucas, </em>462 US 367; 103 S Ct 2404; 76 L Ed 2d 648 (1983) (no Bivens-type damage remedy for federal civil servant alleging First Amendment violations by employer; Congress enacted comprehensive civil service statutes and is in the best position to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>the relevant public policy issues); <em>Chappell v Wallace, </em>462 US 296, 304; 103 S Ct 2362; 76 L Ed 2d 586 (1983) (no <em>Bivens </em>remedy for Navy enlistees claiming racial discrimination by superior officers; the unique disciplinary structure of military life and congressional exercise of plenary authority over the military are special factors counselling hesitation).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Whether a damage remedy should be inferred in this case cannot properly be decided on this record. We would remand the case to the trial court for further development below. In light of the complexity of the question, however, the following observations may be helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">The first step in recognizing a damage remedy for injury consequent to a violation of our Michigan Constitution is, obviously, to establish the constitutional violation itself. Plaintiffs complaint, count hi, item 29, alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-9\">[A] violation of Jack Smith\u2019s constitutional rights as set out in the various State Constitutions, including without limitation Art [2], Section 16, of the Michigan Constitution of 1908, in that he was deprived of a meaningful life, deprived of his liberty, and deprived of property elements of his life without due process of law.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">Plaintiffs amended complaint, item 29a, alleges \"a violation of Jack Smith\u2019s constitutional right to equal protection under 1908 Mich Const, Art [2], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Section l.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Plaintiffs specific claims thus rest upon equal protection and due process violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Federal courts have struggled with the question what constitutes a violation of due process for purposes of 42 USC 1983. See, generally, Win-borne, ed, Civil Actions Against State Government: Its Divisions, Agencies and Officers (McGraw-Hill, 1982), \u00a7 10.27. The federal Due Process Clause<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> includes three basic components: procedural due process,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> substantive due process,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and incorporation of specific Bill of Rights protections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-6\">[The Due Process] Clause is the source of three different kinds of constitutional protection. First, it incorporates specific protections defined in the Bill of Rights. Thus, the State, as well as the Federal Government, must comply with the commands in the First and Eighth Amendments; so, too, the State must respect the guarantees in the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. Second, it contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>a substantive component, sometimes referred to as \"substantive due process,\u201d which bars certain arbi-. trary government actions \"regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\u201d Third, it is a guarantee of fair procedure, sometimes referred to as \"procedural due process\u201d: the State may not execute, imprison, or fine a defendant without giving him a fair trial, nor may it take property without providing appropriate procedural safeguards. <em>[Daniels v Williams, </em>474 US 327, \u2014; 106 S Ct 662; 88 L Ed 2d 662, 672 (1986) (Stevens, J., concurring). Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">In <em>Daniels v Williams, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the negligence of state officials does not constitute a violation of either procedural or substantive due process: \"We conclude that the Due Process Clause is simply not implicated by a <em>negligent </em>act of an official causing unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty or property.\u201d 88 L Ed 2d 666. See also <em>Davidson v Cannon, </em>474 US 344; 106 S Ct 668; 88 L Ed 2d 677 (1986) (official\u2019s negligence is not a violation of procedural due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s complaint does not specify whether procedural due process or substantive due process claims are at issue. Neither have the parties fully briefed or argued the question whether a constitutional violation actually occurred in this case. Therefore, it is only appropriate to leave this thorny issue for later factual development and legal argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">The second step in considering an inferred damage remedy for a violation of the Michigan Constitution is to consider the text, history, and previous interpretations of the specific provision for guidance on the propriety of a judicially inferred damage remedy. The provision itself may commit creation of a remedy to the Legislature rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>the courts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Again, the application of this factor to the instant case must be left for development in future proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Finally, various other factors, dependent upon the specific facts and circumstances of a given case, may militate against a judicially inferred damage remedy for violation of a specific constitutional provision. For example, the federal courts have refused a damage remedy in the face of Congress\u2019 exercise of its special authority over the military, see <em>Chappell v Wallace, supra, </em>and its special role in personnel management vis-\u00e1-vis federal employees, <em>Bush v Lucas, supra. </em>Other concerns, such as the degree of specificity of the constitutional protection, should also be considered. For example, there was no question in <em>Bivens, supra, </em>that the defendants had violated the warrant requirements of the Fourth Amendment. These search and seizure protections are, however, relatively clear-cut in comparison to the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. See Monaghan, The Supreme Court, 1974 term forward: <em>Constitutional common law, </em>89 Harv L R 1, 44-45 (1975) (substantive guarantees of due process and equal protection are troubling in their indeterminate character). The clarity of the constitutional protection and violation in a given case should be a factor in determining the propriety of a judicially imposed damage remedy. Another factor important in federal cases has been the availability of another remedy. In <em>Bivens, supra, </em>the lack of any alternative remedy was certainly a matter of concern to the United States Supreme Court. On the other hand, the presence of an alternate remedy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number><em>Chappell v Wallace, supra, </em>was a factor weighing against a damage remedy for constitutional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">We would hold that neither statutory nor common-law governmental immunity bars a suit in a state court alleging violation by the state of a right protected by our Michigan Constitution. Furthermore, we would acknowledge the possible propriety of a Bivens-type damage remedy for violation of a right protected by our state constitution. Because the record in the instant case, <em>Smith v Dep\u2019t of Public Health, </em>is inadequate for determining whether a violation of the Michigan Constitution occurred by virtue of a governmental custom or policy, and, if such a violation occurred, whether it is one for which a damage remedy is proper, we would remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b874-8\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-9\"> This opinion deals solely with allegations of violations of the state constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b862-7\"> Art 11, \u00a7 1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-8\">All officers, legislative, executive and judicial, before entering upon the duties of their respective offices, shall take and subscribe the following oath or affirmation: I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the constitution of this state, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of_according to the best of my ability.

In <em>Ross, </em>of course, the question of constitutional torts was not present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b866-8\"> This holding would apply only to actions in our state courts. No intent to judicially abrogate the state\u2019s immunity under the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution from suit in federal court is thereby expressed or implied. As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Pennhurst State School &amp; Hosp v Halderman, </em>465 US 89, 99-100; 104 S Ct 900; 79 L Ed 2d 67 (1984), \"[T]he Court consistently has held that a State\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity in its own courts is not a waiver of the Eleventh Amendment immunity in the federal courts.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 99, n 9. Thus, waiving immunity to suit in our state courts for violations of our state constitution by the state would not subject the state to suit in federal court for such violations. See, generally, Althouse, <em>How to build a separate sphere: Federal courts and state power, </em>100 Harv L R 1485 (1987) (federal courts\u2019 jurisdictional doctrine should respect state autonomy to develop law and procedure so long as federal goals are adequately implemented). Federal cases have held that state statutes conferring exclusive jurisdiction on specific courts over specific claims against the state do not also waive the state\u2019s immunity from similar suits in federal court. See, e.g., <em>McDonald v Illinois, </em>557 F2d 596, 600-601 (CA 7, 1977), and <em>Richins v Industrial Construction, Inc, </em>502 F2d 1051 (CA 10, 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b866-10\"> In Massachusetts, the Civil Rights Act of 1979 provides a remedy for violations of state constitutional rights.

Viewed in the light of its legislative history and its remedial purpose, \u00a7 1983 is the appropriate mechanism for securing federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>constitutional rights which the state allegedly has violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Section 1983 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-6\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">In a \u00a7 1983 case, there are two essential elements. First, the act complained of must have been done by a person acting under color of state law, and, second, this act must have deprived the plaintiff of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the constitution or laws of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">The use of the word \"person\u201d in \u00a7 1983 is a term of art. Whether the word \"person\u201d was meant by the 42nd Congress to include a state has been the source of conflicting opinions in the United States Supreme Court, the federal and state courts, and among the commentators.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">As the lead opinion correctly states, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Quern v Jordan, </em>440 US <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>332; 99 S Ct 1139; 59 L Ed 2d 358 (1979), never explicitly addressed the issue whether the term \"person\u201d in \u00a7 1983 included states. The focus of the majority in <em>Quern </em>was whether Congress, in enacting \u00a7 1983, intended to abrogate the immunity of the states from suit in <em>federal </em>court. In the opinion, the majority was primarily concerned with the scope of the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity from suits which would impose a liability which must be paid from public funds in the state treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">However, Justice Brennan argued in his opinion, concurring in the judgment in <em>Quern </em>that \u00a7 1983 was enacted for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \"That Amendment,\u201d Justice Brennan stated, \"exemplifies the 'vast transformation\u2019 worked on the structure of federalism in this Nation by the Civil War.\u201d <em>Quern, </em>354.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">The prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment \" 'are directed to the States .... They have reference to actions of the political body denominated a State, by whatever instruments or in whatever modes that action may be taken.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>355. Justice Brennan, after reviewing the history of the Fourteenth Amendment, the language and legislative history of \u00a7 1983, and the language of the Dictionary Act, which defined \"person\u201d by referring to \"bodies politic,\u201d concluded that the term \"person\u201d in \u00a7 1983 encompassed states. We agree. We find Justice Brennan\u2019s interpretation of the intent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>the 42nd Congress to include the states as \"persons\u201d in \u00a7 1983 actions to be persuasive. It serves no purpose to further review that history here.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Section 1983 suits are routinely decided in the courts of this state when the defendant is a \"person\u201d and is other than the State of Michigan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we are duty-bound to enforce the provisions of the United States Constitution as well as valid federal laws. The defendants argue that not only is a state not a person within the meaning of \u00a7 1983, but that the state has immunity from being sued directly under the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the state, as sovereign, cannot be sued unless the sovereign has consented to suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">The doctrine is based on English law and rests on the theory that \"the king can do no wrong.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the jurisprudence of medieval England has little relevance to America in the twentieth century. The rule of sovereign immunity is a comm on - law rule and is not of constitutional dimension. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>The rule has been repeatedly invoked in Michigan<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to hold the state immune from all suits except to the extent that it consented to be sued in its courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The courts of this state have frequently applied the doctrine of sovereign immunity without distinguishing between constitutional and nonconstitutional courses of action. Yet this distinction is of crucial import in this case. The plaintiffs here alleged conduct by the state which infringed rights which are fundamental under the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Yet the lead opinion would hold that the plaintiffs have no remedy for these alleged acts and that therefore the state and its officials are answerable to no one for the alleged damage caused by their conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">We find this result deeply disturbing. Certainly this Court has the obligation to protect the fundamental constitutional rights of its citizens and \u00a7 1983 provides the mechanism by which citizens can gain redress against the government for alleged unconstitutional conduct by the state. As one commentator observed: \"It is a magnificent historical irony that America, a republic whose independence was declared in a document indicting the sovereign for treasonous acts, should adopt without serious examination the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is even more ironic that under state law, citizens who allege nonconstitutional tortious injuries may sue governmental agencies, both state and local, for their conduct,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> yet there is no rem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>edy for plaintiffs in this case. Neither sovereign immunity nor statutory immunity should bar relief when the state allegedly has violated the constitutional rights of its citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">In view of the holding on this issue, we do not reach the remaining issues raised in these cases. While we do not address the other issues, we do find that an allegation of an intentional tort is not barred by the governmental immunity statute because such an activity does not constitute a governmental function. <em>Lockaby v </em>Wayne <em>Co, </em>406 Mich 65, 77; 276 NW2d 1 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">In sum, because the common-law doctrine of sovereign immunity is inapplicable to bar suits against a state for alleged infringement of fundamental constitutional rights, we would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Will, </em>and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">We are in dissent in <em>Will, </em>but Justice Boyle with Justice Cavanagh concurring would, in ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>cord with the Court of Appeals, remand in <em>Smith </em>to the Court of Claims for further proceedings. We join in remand. We would not, however, limit the remand in <em>Smith </em>to a determination of whether the alleged constitutional violation occurred by \"virtue of a governmental custom or policy\u201d or whether a \"damage remedy is proper,\u201d and do not agree that those limitations should be imposed on a remedy for constitutional violation. We nevertheless join in remand in <em>Smith </em>for further proceedings to determine, as stated in Justice Boyle\u2019s opinion, \"whether a violation of the Michigan Constitution occurred by virtue of a governmental custom or policy, and, if such a violation occurred, whether it is one for which a damage remedy is proper.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b880-5\">Levin, J., concurred with Archer, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b880-6\">Griffin, J., took no part in the decision of these cases.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-10\"> See, e.g., <em>Della Grotta v Rhode Island, </em>781 F2d 343 (CA 1, 1986) (a state is a \"person\u201d within \u00a7 1983 such that, where it has voluntarily waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity to suit in federal court, it may be held liable in the same respect as municipalities and local units of government); <em>Stanton v Godfrey, </em>415 NE2d 103 (Ind App, 1981) (the Department of Public Welfare is a person under \u00a7 1983 and is a proper defendant); <em>Weisbord v Michigan State Univ, </em>495 F Supp 1347 (WD Mich, 1980) (a state university, its board of trustees, and president were \"persons\u201d within the meaning of this section); and <em>Uberoi v Univ of Colorado, </em>713 P2d 894 (Colo, 1986) (a state university is a \"person\u201d under \u00a7 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b876-8\"> The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-9\">No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b877-8\"><em> Dudley v Genesee Co Sheriff, </em>50 Mich App 678; 213 NW2d 805 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b877-9\"><em> </em>This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.
