The Court of Appeals affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence in an unpublished per curiam opinion. At the request of Circuit Judge William Caprathe, the trial judge in this case, the opinion was later published. 148 Mich App 758; 384 NW2d 783 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal on June 24, 1986, as to whether a defendant must be resentenced when the sentencing judge relies on the defendant\u2019s assertion of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">We would hold that while a sentencing court cannot, in whole or in part, base its sentence on a defendant\u2019s refusal to admit guilt, <em>People v Yennior, </em>399 Mich 892; 282 NW2d 920 (1977), evidence of a lack of remorse can be considered in determining an individual\u2019s potential for rehabilitation. Here, the trial court made clear when stating its reasons for exceeding the sentencing guidelines that defendant\u2019s assertion of innocence was not the reason for imposing the harsh sentence. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining the defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">PACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Defendant, age fifty-seven, was charged with one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a seven-year-old girl. The defendant, who had no prior convictions, testified at trial, maintaining that the criminal act had not occurred. Following a five-day trial, the defendant was convicted of the charged offense and sentenced to forty to sixty years in prison. The minimum sentence recommended by the Supreme Court Sentencing Guidelines indicates thirty-six to seventy-two months (three to six years). Relying on <em>Yennior, supra, </em>the defendant then appealed to the Court of Appeals, claiming that the sentencing judge improperly considered defendant\u2019s denial of guilt in setting his sentence, as suggested by the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-8\">Although you deny the offense, Mr. Wesley, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>jury found you guilty of the offense. There were three witnesses that testified that you did it. One of the problems here that I see, as far as any kind of rehabilitation is concerned, is that you do not feel you have a problem in this area and, therefore, any kind of rehabilitation or counseling would have to be on some sort of a forced effort. Because, if you don\u2019t believe you have a problem, which is your position, and you have a right to take that position, the hope of recovery or rehabilitation, however one wants to put it, diminishes, in my opinion, and makes the situation a difficult situation. If you believe you don\u2019t need counseling, then it has a negative impact on any counseling that\u2019s required by the Court. Also, that in \u2014 is a situation which leads the Court to believe that any kind of rehabilitation would have to take place in prison. Not only because of the less likelihood of rehabilitation taking place, but also the fact that it would be the threat to the safety of society, more particular in this case, the safety of children, if you\u2019re out in some sort of a program on the outside being forced to have this kind of counseling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The defendant argues that his sentence should be vacated and the cause remanded for resentencing by a different judge because the trial court erred in considering defendant\u2019s refusal to admit guilt. The defendant specifically requests that we follow our decision in <em>People v Yennior, supra, </em>where we held that a court cannot base a sentence, even in part, on a defendant\u2019s refusal to admit guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">We note initially that sentencing is a matter of judicial discretion, and, absent abuse of that discretion to the extent that the sentence shocks the conscience of the appellate court, a trial court\u2019s sentencing decision will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>People v Coles, </em>417 Mich 523; 339 NW2d 440 (1983). A trial court\u2019s decision as to the proper sentence must be based upon the particular cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>cumstances of each case and dependant upon material facts. Such factors include: (1) the potential for the reformation of the offender, (2) the protection of society, (3) the discipline of the wrongdoer, and (4) the deterrence of others from committing like offenses. <em>People v Snow, </em>386 Mich 586, 592; 194 NW2d 314 (1972); <em>Coles, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">While this Court has never specifically addressed the issue, in determining whether sentencing was improperly influenced by defendant\u2019s failure to admit guilt, the Court of Appeals has focused upon three factors: (1) the defendant\u2019s maintenance of innocence after conviction, (2) the judge\u2019s attempt to get the defendant to admit guilt, and (3) the appearance that had the defendant affirmatively admitted guilt, his sentence would not have been so severe. See, e.g., <em>People v Gray, </em>66 Mich App 101; 238 NW2d 540 (1975); <em>People v Grable, </em>57 Mich App 184; 225 NW2d 724 (1974); <em>People v Fleming, </em>142 Mich App 119, 127; 369 NW2d 499 (1985). Under the Court of Appeals analysis, if there is an indication of the three factors, then the sentence was likely to have been improperly influenced by the defendant\u2019s persistence in his innocence. If, however, the record shows that the court did no more than address the factor of remorsefulness as it bore upon defendant\u2019s rehabilitation, then the court\u2019s reference to a defendant\u2019s persistent claim of innocence will not amount to error requiring reversal. See, e.g., <em>People v Gray, supra; People v Stubbs, </em>99 Mich App 643; 298 NW2d 612 (1980); <em>People v Camon, </em>110 Mich App 474; 313 NW2d 322 (1981), lv den 414 Mich 859 (1982); <em>People v Pottruff, </em>116 Mich App 367; 323 NW2d 402 (1982), lv den 414 Mich 924 (1982); <em>People v Ross, </em>145 Mich App 483; 378 NW2d 517 (1985). Using similar analyses, other jurisdictions have made the distinction between a court\u2019s consideration of a defendant\u2019s failure to admit guilt and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>consideration of a defendant\u2019s lack of remorse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We would approve of the Court of Appeals analysis and would adopt its conclusion that a defendant\u2019s lack of remorse may be considered by a court in imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">It is permissible to infer a defendant\u2019s lack of remorse from statements contained in presentence reports. MCL 771.14; MSA 28.1144; <em>People v Lee, </em>391 Mich 618; 218 NW2d 655 (1974); <em>People v Carter, </em>128 Mich App 541, 550; 341 NW2d 128 (1983). As noted by Maine\u2019s Justice Caroline D. Glassman,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-6\">The sort of information collected in presentence reports provides a far more finely brushed portrait of the man than do a few hours or days at trial. <em>[State v Farnham, </em>479 A2d 887, 896 (Me, 1984).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">The propriety of a sentencing court\u2019s consideration of a defendant\u2019s remorsefulness at sentencing is also evidenced by the statutory requirement that the court be provided with reports on the \"antecedents, character, and circumstances\u201d of a defendant before sentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">The defendant\u2019s attitude as it reflects his reha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>bilitative potential is a factor by which courts of review determine whether sentencing was improperly influenced by a failure to admit guilt following conviction. See, e.g., <em>Gray, supra; Stubbs, supra; Camon; Pottruff; Ross, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">In the case at bar, the sentencing judge made an extensive record, stating the criteria which he had considered before determining sentence. The court repeatedly alluded to the defendant\u2019s failure to acknowledge his sexual \"problem.\u201d As stated by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-7\">Although you deny the offense, Mr. Wesley, a jury found you guilty of the offense. There were three witnesses that testified that you did it. <em>One of the problems here that I see, as far as any kind of rehabilitation is concerned, is that you do not feel you have a problem in this area and, therefore, any kind of rehabilitation or counseling would have to be on some sort of a forced effort. Because, if you don\u2019t believe you have a problem, which is your position, and you have a right to take that position, the hope of recovery or rehabilitation, however one wants to put it, diminishes, in my opinion, and makes the situation a difficult situation. If you believe you don\u2019t need counseling, then it has a negative impact on any counseling that\u2019s required by the Court. </em>Also, that in \u2014 is a situation which leads the Court to believe that any kind of rehabilitation would have to take place in prison. Not only because of the less likelihood of rehabilitation taking place, but also the fact that it would be the threat to the safety of society, more particular in this case, the safety of children, if you\u2019re out in some sort of a program on the outside being forced to have this kind of counseling. [Emphasis added.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>The emphasized language, particularly the three references to the defendant\u2019s failure to recognize that he has a problem, manifests the trial judge\u2019s concern with the defendant\u2019s failure to appreciate the detrimental effect of his sexual actions, as opposed to his failure to admit guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">The present case is unlike <em>Grable, supra, </em>where the sentencing court erroneously considered the defendant\u2019s failure to admit guilt. Here, the sentencing judge neither asked defendant to admit his guilt nor offered him a lesser sentence if he did. While rewarding a defendant for a posttrial admission of guilt would violate the defendant\u2019s right to appeal, the implication of better treatment on sentencing found in <em>Grable </em>and its progeny, if he admitted his guilt, was not present here. The court never indicated in any manner that an admission of guilt would reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. If there had been such an indication, then the sentence would have been improperly influenced by the defendant\u2019s claim of innocence. Instead, the court focused on the history and character of the defendant as evidenced from the presentence report in determining his potential for rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">The defendant had an opportunity to challenge the presentence information, and the judge\u2019s conclusion based thereon, either contemporaneously or upon filing a motion to correct error. No objection was ever made.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">The court found the defendant\u2019s undenied past sexual conduct with his daughters and the victim\u2019s sister to be relevant to its evaluation of the defendant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation. In addition to the defendant\u2019s sexual misconduct, Judge Caprathe indicated in his sentencing other factors that were causing him to go outside the sentencing guidelines. He repeated those factors, none of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>which contained any reference to a failure to admit guilt on the part of the defendant. This is evidenced by the judge\u2019s following remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-4\">Have to take into consideration here the family of the child and actually of the children, because the same occurrences have been alleged with respect to a sister of the child. Both of the children are in counseling. And the particular victim in this case in which you were convicted, a seven year old victim, already having to have psychiatric counseling, there\u2019s no way to tell what effect this is gonna have on her life. How she\u2019ll \u2014 ever be able to have a normal relationship with another boy. What will her parents tell her when she begins to date? And what will be explained to her with respect to the normal sexual activities of consenting adults. And how will she be able to differentiate those matters? And what will happen to her when she\u2019s older and is confronted with her own children? These are all question marks which, in my opinion, enhance the seriousness of such a crime and are a message to me and to society that these kinds of offenses cannot be tolerated. And if they\u2019re gonna continue to take place, then they should be dealt with harshly by the courts and by the system, so that people contemplating them, if there is any way to deter those individuals, that at least the sentencing procedure would be one aspect of a deterrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-5\">In this case, the insertion of the defendant\u2019s penis in the victim\u2019s mouth; <em>the sexual contact with the daughter of the individual himself; the same thing happening with another victim at other times, the sister of the victim; the fact that he has had sexual contact with his own daughters; that he threatened his son with a shotgun; the fact that his son indicates that he\u2019s got a problem with drinking and his own contrary denial with respect to that; admitting that he does drink wine everyday but not on a[n] excessive basis, </em>merely a \u2014 I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>believe it was four ounces or some amount that would likely not be in excess; those are all factors, except for the first one that I mentioned \u2014 the first one I mentioned was insertion of the penis in the mouth, that factor is taken into consideration in the guidelines \u2014 but those other factors that I\u2019ve mentioned, <em>and I\u2019ll repeat \u2019em so that it\u2019s clear that these are the reasons for my variance from the guidelines. The sexual contact with his own daughters; the sexual contact with the same victim at other times; the sexual contact with the victim\u2019s sister; the threatening of his son with a shotgun in his past; and the fact that he has more of a drinking problem than he is willing to admit and denies that, </em>both in the past and present \u2014 and I\u2019m only talking about a past drinking problem; there\u2019s no way for me to know currently whether he has one or not. But from his admission in the previous history it would appear that there\u2019s \u2014 possibly that it\u2019s there. Those are the factors that I believe the guidelines do not take into consideration and allow points for, and would require the Court to go beyond the guidelines as they are set forth. And for all of those reasons, then, the Court believes that I must exceed the guidelines, which would have a six year minimum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-6\">Therefore, it\u2019ll be the sentence of the Court that the dev \u2014 defendant be sentenced to the custody of the Department of Corrections for a maximum period of 60 years, which is set by the Court, and a minimum period of 40 years, which is also set by the Court. <em>And that the Department of Corrections make available to him the possibility of therapy for sexual crimes against children and that the Court recommends to both Mr. Wesley and to the prison system that this counseling take place. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">After reviewing the full comments made by the sentencing judge, as well as the authorities cited above, we would find that the trial court did not seek an admission of guilt with the implied prom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>ise of a reduced sentence if the defendant admitted guilt, and that defendant\u2019s sentence was not improperly influenced by his failure to admit guilt as to the crime at issue. We believe that the court was merely addressing the factor of remorsefulness as it bore upon defendant\u2019s rehabilitation. Imposition of the enhanced sentence did not constitute an invalid attempt to punish defendant for exercising his constitutional right to maintain his innocence as the court expressly disavowed any such improper motivation and as the trial court could properly consider evidence in the presentence report of prior behavior.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Accordingly, we would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b941-6\">Griffin, J., concurred with Archer, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-9\"> See, e.g., <em>Poteet v Fauver, </em>517 F2d 393 (CA 3, 1975); <em>Herbert v Maryland, </em>31 Md App 48; 354 A2d 449 (1976); <em>People v Moffett, </em>55 Ill App 3d 939, 941-942; 13 Ill Dec 647; 371 NE2d 364 (1977); <em>People v Mosley, </em>87 Ill App 3d 903; 42 Ill Dec 766; 409 NE2d 381 (1980); <em>People v Costello, </em>95 Ill App 3d 680, 687-689; 51 Ill Dec 178; 420 NE2d 592 (1981); <em>People v Rodriquez, </em>100 Ill App 3d 244, 249-251; 55 Ill Dec 440; 426 NE2d 586 (1981); <em>People v Albanese, </em>102 Ill 2d 54, 80-81; 79 Ill Dec 608; 464 NE2d 206 (1984); <em>People v Danis, </em>129 Ill App 3d 664, 668-670; 84 Ill Dec 798; 472 NE2d 1194 (1984); <em>State v Farnham, </em>479 A2d 887 (Me, 1984); <em>Schiro v State, </em>479 NE2d 556 (Ind, 1985); <em>Mahla v State, </em>496 NE2d 568, 575 (Ind, 1986); <em>Guenther v State, </em>495 NE2d 788 (Ind, 1986), aff'd in part and vacated in part 501 NE2d 1071 (Ind, 1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b936-10\"> MCL 771.14; MSA 28.1144 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-11\">Before sentencing any person charged with a felony, and, if directed by court, in any other case in which any person is charged with a misdemeanor within the jurisdiction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>court, the probation officer shall inquire into the antecedents, character, and circumstances of the person, and shall report in writing to the court.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b941-8\"> Contrary to Justice Brickley\u2019s opinion, we believe that use of the three-pronged test discussed at <em>ante, </em>pp 713-714 enunciates a practical distinction between consideration of a lack of remorse and a failure to admit guilt. In the instant case, we find the trial judge\u2019s concerns with regard to the defendant\u2019s failure to appreciate the detrimental effect of his sexual actions to be akin to consideration of \"a defendant\u2019s callousness or indifference to the plight of the victim, <em>even if he continues to maintain his innocence,\u201d </em>which Justice Brickley acknowledges is an appropriate consideration.

The lead opinion deems the former to be an improper sentencing consideration, while approving a court\u2019s consideration of the latter. Such a distinction is, however, illusory, since the finding that the defendant in this case was unremorseful rested solely on his continued assertions of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">When sentencing the defendant, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-6\"><em>Although you deny the offense, Mr. Wesley, a jury found you guilty of the offense. </em>There were three witnesses that testified that you did it. One of the problems here that I see as far as any kind of rehabilitation is concerned, is that you do not feel you have a problem in this area and, therefore, any kind of rehabilitation or counseling would have to be on some sort of a forced effort. Because, <em>if you don\u2019t believe you have a problem, </em>which is your position, and you have a right to take that position, the hope of recovery or rehabilitation, however one wants to put it, diminishes, in my opinion, and makes the situation a difficult situation. If you believe you don\u2019t need counseling, then it has a negative impact on any counseling that\u2019s required by the court. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">This excerpt makes clear that the sentencing judge viewed defendant\u2019s failure to admit guilt as the basis for the finding of a lack of remorse and, thus, a low likelihood of rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">The lead opinion quotes with approval the rule from <em>People v Yennior, </em>399 Mich 892; 282 NW2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>920 (1977), that \"[a] court cannot base its sentence even in part on a defendant\u2019s refusal to admit guilt.\u201d However, the continued validity of this well-established principle is, in light of the instant decision, unclear, since, after citing <em>Yennior, </em>the lead opinion goes on to ignore it. For example, it distinguishes \"defendant\u2019s failure to appreciate the detrimental effect of his sexual actions, as opposed to his failure to admit guilt.\u201d <em>{Ante, </em>716.) However, it fails to explain how a defendant who denies that the alleged sexual actions ever took place can \"appreciate\u201d their detrimental effect. The lead opinion thus merely declares that a distinction exists between consideration of remorse and consideration of continued declarations of innocence, without explaining the distinction or how appellate courts should discern it in the future.,</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">The lead opinion would adopt a test to determine whether a sentencing judge relied on a defendant\u2019s failure to admit guilt, <em>ante, </em>713:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-6\">While this Court has never specifically addressed the issue, in determining whether sentencing was improperly influenced by defendant\u2019s failure to admit guilt, the Court of Appeals has focused upon three factors: (1) the defendant\u2019s maintenance of innocence after conviction, (2) the judge\u2019s attempt to get the defendant to admit guilt, and (3) the appearance that had the defendant affirmatively admitted guilt, his sentence would not have been so severe. See, e.g., <em>People v Gray, </em>66 Mich App 101; 238 NW2d 540 (1975); <em>People v Grable, </em>57 Mich App 184; 225 NW2d 724 (1974); <em>People v Fleming, </em>142 Mich App 119, 127; 369 NW2d 499 (1985). Under the Court of Appeals analysis, if there is an indication of the three factors, then the sentence was likely to have been improperly influenced by the defendant\u2019s persistence in his innocence. If, however, the record shows that the court did no more than address the factor of remorseful<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>ness as it bore upon defendant\u2019s rehabilitation, then the court\u2019s reference to a defendant\u2019s persistent claim of innocence will not amount to error requiring reversal. See, e.g., <em>People v Gray, supra; People v Stubbs, </em>99 Mich App 643; 298 NW2d 612 (1980); <em>People v Camon, </em>110 Mich App 474; 313 NW2d 322 (1981), lv den 414 Mich 859 (1982); <em>People v Pottruff, </em>116 Mich App 367; 323 NW2d 402 (1982), lv den 414 Mich 924 (1982); <em>People v Ross, </em>145 Mich App 483; 378 NW2d 517 (1985).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">There are a number of troubling aspects to this excerpt. First and foremost, this Court has indeed \"addressed the issue\u201d of the propriety of a sentencing court\u2019s consideration of a defendant\u2019s failure to admit guilt. While our decision in <em>Yennior </em>was peremptory, it, as quoted <em>supra, </em>addressed the issue in no uncertain terms. In addition, by reversing the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Yennior, </em>this Court looked beyond the first two factors of the three-part test defined by the lead opinion today, since in that case the defendant, having made no comment at sentencing concerning his guilt or innocence, did not affirmatively \"maintain his innocence\u201d (as required by the first factor), and the Court of Appeals, in the decision we reversed, explicitly held that the sentence was proper because at sentencing \"the court made no attempt to elicit an admission of guilt from defendant\u201d (as required by the second factor) 72 Mich App 35, 43; 248 NW2d 680 (1976).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Had this Court in <em>Yennior </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>agreed that the first two factors urged for adoption by the lead opinion today were controlling, there would have been no need to reverse in that case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">The effect of the lead opinion\u2019s position would be that sentencing judges may not impose a higher sentence on the basis of a defendant\u2019s continued refusal to admit his guilt, but may do so by finding a lack of remorse solely on the basis of that refusal. If a manageable distinction exists in such a scheme, it eludes me. The lead opinion\u2019s view merely provides a talismanic phrase by which the principles of <em>Yennior </em>may be circumvented.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">I also find unconvincing the lead opinion\u2019s citation of MCL 771.14; MSA 28.1144. It is axiomatic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>that judges will look generally to a defendant\u2019s antecedents, character, and circumstances. The question in this case is whether a <em>particular </em>factor may be considered. In previous cases it has been determined that certain factors may not be considered, although part of a defendant\u2019s antecedents, e.g., convictions obtained in violation of the right to counsel, <em>People v Moore, </em>391 Mich 426; 216 NW2d 770 (1974); polygraph information, <em>People v Towns, </em>69 Mich App 475; 245 NW2d 97 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">The lead opinion\u2019s reliance on the presentencing report is also unpersuasive. First, the mere presence of an improper sentencing consideration in the presentence report does not convert it into a properly considered factor. More important, however, is the fact that the presentence report contains no reference to defendant\u2019s lack of remorse. Of course, if the trial court did not rely on defendant\u2019s lack of remorse in determining sentence, as Chief Justice Riley and I contend, we need not decide if it is a proper consideration. However, if it was relied upon, reference to proper considerations, e.g., the information in the presentence report which was also relied upon, will not cure the impropriety. <em>Yennior </em>states that \"[a] court cannot base, its sentence <em>even in part </em>on a defendant\u2019s refusal to admit guilt.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">This element of the lead opinion is confusing. It seems to view the trial court\u2019s reliance on other grounds for the length of the sentence as a distinction between a failure to admit guilt and a failure to show remorse. This mode of analysis can also be discerned early in the opinion where it is correctly noted that \"the trial court made clear when stating its reasons for exceeding the sentencing guidelines that defendant\u2019s assertion of innocence was not the reason for imposing the harsh sentence.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>711.) The lead opinion fails to note, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>ever, that a review of the trial court\u2019s remarks makes it equally clear that it also did not rely upon defendant\u2019s lack of remorse. The lead opinion, therefore, argues that the reference to defendant\u2019s lack of remorse is not improper since it was not relied upon. If it is genuinely believed that the challenged remarks of the sentencing judge were not relied upon, then it should be concluded that the propriety of those remarks need not be considered. However, once the propriety of the remarks is reached, reliance must be presumed, and the lead opinion must, as it has failed to do, enunciate a practical distinction between a reference to a lack of remorse and a reference to a failure to admit guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">I would, of course, allow a sentencing judge to consider those factors which fall within the rubric of remorselessness, but which exist apart from a defendant\u2019s continued assertions of innocence. For example, where a defendant admits his guilt, it is proper for the sentencing judge to consider a lack of remorse. Similarly, where a defendant admits certain facts which, while insufficient to convict, indicate wrongful action, the judge may consider defendant\u2019s lack of remorse regarding the admitted facts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It would also seem appropriate to consider a defendant\u2019s callousness or indifference to the plight of the victim, even if he continues to maintain his innocence. However, nothing in the record in this case indicates that defendant\u2019s lack of remorse was anything other than a refusal to admit guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">In the hopefully rare situation where a defendant has been wrongly convicted, the decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>this case would compound the injustice visited upon such a defendant by further punishing him for his assertions of innocence. As stated in the Court of Appeals <em>Yennior </em>dissent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-6\">[Ijnducing an assertedly innocent defendant to admit guilt and pressuring, albeit indirectly, a defendant to express remorse for a crime whose perpetration he denies are but two sides of the same coin. [72 Mich App 47.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Finally, the decision urged by the lead opinion would raise a new and even more difficult question, i.e., if a defendant \"shows remorse\u201d after conviction in order to obtain a shorter sentence and later wins a retrial, may his statements at sentencing be admitted as evidence against him at his new trial? If so, defendants would, at allocution, find themselves with a Hobson\u2019s choice: to refuse to admit guilt would result in a longer sentence, but to admit guilt would destroy any hope of acquittal upon retrial. By ignoring <em>Yennior, </em>the lead opinion invites such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">For all the above reasons, I disagree with the analysis of the lead opinion. However, since the trial judge stated with specificity his reasons for departing from the guidelines and the \"lack of remorse\u201d consideration was not among them, I concur in the result.</p>\n<judges id=\"b948-9\">Levin, J., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b941-10\"> Although Judge Caprathe began his remarks at sentencing by noting defendant\u2019s lack of remorse, his full explanation of the reasons for the sentence imposed demonstrates that this observation was not taken into account. The judge twice listed \"the reasons for my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>variance from the guidelines\u201d and at neither time was defendant\u2019s lack of remorse included.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b944-6\"> It is also worth noting that the second factor looks only to a sentencing judge\u2019s attempt to elicit an admission of guilt from a defendant, but the result of this opinion is that all defendants will be under pressure to admit guilt just as if the trial judge personally applied the pressure. As Judge Riley stated in her dissent in <em>Yennior </em>in the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-7\">Whether the pressure to admit guilt and show remorse flows directly from a judge\u2019s badgering questions or obliquely from the subtle inducement of the present decision, the evil is the same. <em>[Id. </em>at 46.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>In addition, this factor begs the question, as it assumes rather than explains the existence of a workable distinction between a lack of remorse and a continued refusal to admit guilt, since it does not bar judicial pressure to \u201cshow remorse.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b945-10\"> The third factor defined by the lead opinion is also inadequate to decide the instant case since it merely states the holding of our decision in <em>Yennior, </em>i.e., that a sentence must be reversed where its length was in part based upon the defendant\u2019s failure to admit guilt. The question <em>now </em>before us is whether that situation can be distinguished from the situation where it appears that had the defendant affirmatively <em>shown remorse </em>his sentence would not have been so severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">The remarks of the sentencing judge in <em>Yennior </em>indicate that this is an impossible task:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-12\">\"It is rather difficult for the court to relate to one in your position, Mr. Yennior, where you still deny that you committed the crime of which you have been convicted. The court doesn\u2019t hold that against you. One of the things the court always seeks in determining disposition in criminal matters is the attitude of the accused with respect to whether they admit \u2014 how readily they admit they have done wrong. I can\u2019t talk to you about that because you don\u2019t admit it. That\u2019s your prerogative. I don\u2019t hold that against you, I just want to explain it, it makes it difficult.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 43.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">Not only did the trial judge explicitly state that he was not relying on defendant\u2019s failure to admit guilt (enough according to today\u2019s lead opinion to uphold the sentence), but his remarks make clear that remorse means \"the attitude of the accused with respect to whether [and] how readily they admit they have done wrong.\u201d Thus, there is no tenable distinction between remorse and an admission of guilt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b947-6\"> Such was, in fact, the situation in two of the cases cited by the lead opinion as examples of cases in which the Court of Appeals has been able to distinguish a refusal to admit guilt from a lack of remorse. <em>People v Ross, </em>145 Mich App 483; 378 NW2d 517 (1985); <em>People v Stubbs, </em>99 Mich App 643; 298 NW2d 612 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b948-10\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AA8d\">(concurring). I concur in affirmance for the reason that, as stated by my Brother Archer, the trial court made clear that the defendant\u2019s assertion of innocence was not a factor which affected the length of the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">I concur separately to share my Brother Brick<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>ley\u2019s observation that the distinction between a defendant\u2019s continued refusal to admit guilt and a lack of remorse is largely illusory. The separate opinions issued in this case attest to the difficulty presented in attempting to differentiate between them. I would not attempt to do so because reality and common sense require the sentencing judge to act upon the basis of the central presumption that the defendant <em>is </em>guilty. Following a plea of guilty or a trial, a convicted defendant stands before the sentencing judge no longer clothed with the presumption of innocence. While a defendant is certainly free to continue to assert innocence, a sentencing judge should not be required to tip-toe through the metaphysical distinctions required to separate that continued assertion from a lack of remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\">To discharge the awesome responsibility of sentencing a defendant to a substantial loss of liberty, a sentencing judge surely must begin with an honest belief that the defendant is in fact guilty. Given the acceptance of defendant\u2019s guilt as a premise, the sentencing judge\u2019s perception of the defendant\u2019s truthfulness (lack of credibility) or lack of remorse (refusal to acknowledge guilt) is, to a certain degree, predetermined. The logic is sophistic which would require that this perception merely be unstated on the record.</p>\n<judges id=\"b949-5\">Boyle, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b949-6\">Riley, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARP9\">(concurring). I am in agreement with the lead opinion that, in exceeding the sentencing guidelines, the trial court did not rely upon the defendant\u2019s \"assertion of innocence\u201d or lack of remorse for the offense of which he was convicted. Rather, as indicated in the lead opinion, the trial court relied upon the information contained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>presentence report and the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the use of that information for imposing the admittedly harsh sentence in this case. In light of the above, it is unnecessary to decide whether the lack of remorse, inferred from the defendant\u2019s refusal to admit guilt of the crime of which he was convicted, may properly have been relied upon to increase the defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">The defendant\u2019s proclivity toward rehabilitation was an appropriate factor to be considered by the sentencing court. Whether the defendant\u2019s failure to express remorse while refusing to admit guilt of the offense of which he was convicted may properly be viewed as a factor negating his potential for reformation is a question that need not be decided in the case at bar. I would hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in relying upon the information in the presentence report to increase the defendant\u2019s sentence on the basis of his potential for rehabilitation. Thus, I concur in the decision to affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
