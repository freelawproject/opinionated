Stevenson, </em>126 F.3d 662, 664 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Rivera first contends that his sentence should be vacated' because his state felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance, which resulted in an increased sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), was an element of the offense that should have been charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Rivera acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review in light of the decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>120 S.Ct. at 2362; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 1214, 149 L.Ed.2d 126 (2001). Rivera\u2019s argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Rivera also challenges the characterization of his prior Texas conviction for cocaine possession as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d offense and the concomitant sixteen-level increase in his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), contending that his sentence should be reduced by the rule-of-lenity. Rivera\u2019s constitutional claim that the rule-of-lenity is applicable is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Romero-Cruz, </em>201 F.3d 374, 377 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1135, 120 S.Ct. 2017, 146 L.Ed.2d 965 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">In <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 692-93, 694 (5th Cir.1997), we held that a state conviction is an \u201caggravated felony\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) if \u201c(1) the offense was punishable under the Controlled Substances Act and (2) it was a felony\u201d under applicable state law. <em>Id. </em>at 694. Rivera has not explicitly disputed that, as a matter of statutory construction, his challenge to the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) increase is foreclosed by <em>Hinojosa-Lopez. See United States v. Garcia Abrego, </em>141 F.3d 142, 151 n. 1 (5th Cir.1998) (\u201cin the absence of any intervening Supreme Court or en banc circuit authority that conflicts\u201d with the panel decision in question, this court is bound by the panel decision). He contends, however, that under the \u201cconstitutional rule-of-lenity,\u201d his objection to the increase presents an issue of first impression. This contention is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">The rule-of-lenity fosters the constitutional due-process principle \u201cthat no individual be forced to speculate, at peril of indictment, whether his conduct is prohibited.\u201d <em>Dunn v. United States, </em>442 U.S. 100, 112, 99 S.Ct. 2190, 60 L.Ed.2d 743 (1979). \u201cThe rule of lenity ... applies only when, after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction, [a court is] left with an ambiguous statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Shabani, </em>513 U.S. 10, 17, 115 S.Ct. 382, 130 L.Ed.2d 225 (1994) (emphasis added). It applies \u201conly if after a review of all applicable sources of legislative intent the statute remains truly am biguous.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>966 F.2d 936, 944 (5th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also Albernaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 342, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981) (\u201cThe rule comes into operation at the end of the process of construing what Congress has expressed, not at the beginning as an overriding consideration of being lenient to wrongdoers.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). The rule-of-lenity is a rule of statutory construction, <em>see Bifulco v. United States, </em>447 U.S. 381, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980); <em>United States v. Brito, </em>136 F.3d 397, 408 (5th Cir.1998), rather than a separate constitutional framework for raising claims. We have already expressed our interpretation of the term \u201caggravated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>felony\u201d in our decision in <em>Hinojosa-Lopez. See Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d at 693-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-2\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
