We answer that question in the negative. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">This appeal arises out of the following factual background. On November 17, 1999, twenty-eight year old Bryant Wiseman died while he was incarcerated at the Gamer correctional institution (Gamer). The decedent was mentally ill, and at the time of his death, he had been diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. On December 10, 2002, the plaintiff, Elaine Wiseman, as administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate, filed a twelve count complaint against the defendants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging that the department of correction\u2019s physicians, nurses and other medical workers failed to provide adequate and proper medical care, supervision and medication to the decedent, allowed his mental illness to go untreated or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>inadequately treated, and permitted the decedent to become paranoid and aggressive under circumstances that they knew would lead to a violent confrontation with other inmates and correction staff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 10, 2002, the defendants filed an amended motion to dismiss, claiming, inter alia, that the ninth,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> tenth<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and eleventh<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>counts of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint were improper because the patients\u2019 bill of rights does not apply to correctional institutions. Those three counts were all based upon the plaintiffs claim that \u201c[t]he facilities of the Connecticut [department of [correction, including the Gamer [cjorrectional [institution, and the University of Connecticut [h]eaith [c] enter are \u2018[facilities\u2019 within the meaning of ... \u00a7 17a-540 (a).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>On February 27, 2003, the trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, noting that the term \u201cother facility,\u201d as that term is used in the patients\u2019 bill of rights,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was \u201cbroad enough to include the facilities of the [department of [correction. This is clear on its face.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On March 11,2003, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration or articulation in light of this court\u2019s subsequent opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577, 816 A.2d 562 (2003), which \u201crestated] the process by which we interpret statutes . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court denied the defendants\u2019 request for reconsideration, yet provided an articulation of its decision in light of <em>Courchesne. </em>More specifically, the trial court found that even under the purposive approach to statutory interpretation set forth in <em>Courchesne, </em>\u201cthe legislative history is not sufficiently persuasive to overcome the plain language of the statute.\u201d The defendants appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court. Prior to argument before the Appellate Court, Chief Justice Sullivan granted the defendants\u2019 petition for certification to appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>On appeal, the defendants claim, that the trial court improperly: (1) concluded that a correctional institution is a \u201cfacility\u201d subject to the provisions of the patients\u2019 bill of rights; (2) disregarded the well settled tenet of statutory interpretation that a statutory scheme is to be considered as a whole; (3) disregarded No. 97-016 of the Opinions of the Connecticut Attorney General, which concluded that the patients\u2019 bill of rights did not apply to correctional institutions; and (4) disregarded this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>213 Conn. 548, 569 A.2d 518 (1990), which thoroughly reviewed the history of the patients\u2019 bill of rights. In response, the plaintiff claims that: (1) the legislative history of the patients\u2019 bill of rights contains no \u201c \u2018strong\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018persuasive\u2019 \u201d support to overcome the plain language of the statute, as required by <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 537; (2) the application of the patients\u2019 bill of rights to correctional institutions does not present an insurmountable conflict with regard to other statutes concerning the rights of prisoners; (3) No. 97-016 of the Opinions of the Connecticut Attorney General is irrelevant to the issue presented in this appeal; and (4) the defendants\u2019 interpretation of the patients\u2019 bill of rights (a) conflicts with the plain language of the statute, as well as the decisions of this court and other state and federal courts, (b) poses severe practical difficulties and inconsistent standards for psychiatrists and other mental health workers, and (c) violates the public policy of this state. We agree with the defendants. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. The defendants\u2019 claims involve the meaning of the term \u201cfacility\u201d as that term is used in our patients\u2019 bill of rights. \u201cIssues of statutory construction raise questions of law, over which we exercise plenary review.\u201d <em>Celentano </em>v. <em>Oaks Condominium Assn., </em>265 Conn. 579, 588, 830 A.2d 164 (2003). \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>267 Conn. 336, 343, 838 A.2d 170 (2004).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, \u201c[b]ecause the patients\u2019 bill of rights is remedial in nature, its provisions should be liberally construed in favor of the class sought to be benefited.\u201d <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the defendants\u2019 claims. \u201cAs with all issues of statutory interpretation, we look first to the language of the statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>263 Conn. 22, 28-29, 818 A.2d 37 (2003). A \u201c \u2018[facility\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>subject to the provisions of the patients\u2019 bill of rights is defined as \u201cany inpatient or outpatient hospital, clinic, or <em>other facility </em>for the diagnosis, observation or treatment of persons with psychiatric disabilities . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 17a-540 (a). In ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, the trial court determined that the term \u201c \u2018other facility\u2019 is broad enough to include the facilities of the [department of correction. This is clear on its face.\u201d We disagree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">As an initial matter, we note that the trial court improperly circumscribed its analysis to an interpretation of the term \u201cother facility\u201d in the abstract, rather than properly analyzing that term within the context of the statute in which it is contained. A statute is enacted as a whole and must be read as a whole rather than as separate parts or sections. <em>Badolato </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>250 Conn. 753, 760, 738 A.2d 618 (1999). Further, \u201c[w]ordsin a statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning . . . unless the context indicates that a different meaning was intended.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gelinas </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>225 Conn. 575, 584, 626 A.2d 259 (1993). While the term \u201cother facility\u201d might be very broad in the abstract, within the context of \u00a7 17a-540 (a), the legislature narrowed its meaning by modifying it with the words <em>\u2018for </em>the diagnosis, observation or treatment of persons with psychiatric disabilities . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The word \u201cfor\u201d requires that any \u201cother facility\u201d subject to the patients\u2019 bill of rights must be one <em>for which </em>the main purpose is \u201cdiagnosis, observation or treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, in order to qualify as a \u201cfacility\u201d subject to the provisions of the patients\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>bill of rights, a correctional institute must not be just any \u201cother facility,\u201d but rather must be any \u201cother facility <em>for the diagnosis, observation or treatment of persons with psychiatric disabilities . . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 17a-540 (a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> When viewed in this proper context, we are not persuaded that the meaning of \u201cother facility for the diagnosis, observation or treatment of persons with psychiatric disabilities,\u201d as used by the patients\u2019 bill of rights in \u00a7 17a-540 (a), plainly encompasses facilities operated by the department of correction, namely, correctional institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The dictionary references the entry for \u201ccorrectional institution\u201d to the entry for \u201cprison,\u201d which is defined as \u201c [a] state or federal facility of confinement for convicted criminals, especially] felons.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999); see also Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993) (defining \u201cprison\u201d as, inter alia, \u201ca place of confinement\u201d). Furthermore, \u201ccorrection,\u201d the root of the word \u201ccorrectional,\u201d is defined as \u201cthe treatment and rehabilitation of offenders through a program involving penal custody, parole, and probation . . . .\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993). We are aware that correctional institutions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>do provide an increasing amount of psychiatric services to inmates. Indeed, the correctional facility in which the decedent was housed, Gamer, which is a level 4 high-security facility, contains a mental health unit that \u201coperates an intensive mental health program for inmates who are assessed with serious mental health concerns.\u201d Nevertheless, these services are incidental to the tme purpose of correctional institutions generally, and Gamer specifically\u2014the confinement of individuals convicted of felonies. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>253 Conn. 210, 234 n.17, 751 A.2d 800 (2000) (noting that court could properly take judicial notice of fact that Gamer qualified as \u201ccorrectional institution\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Faust, </em>237 Conn. 454, 471, 678 A.2d 910 (1996) (concluding that trial court\u2019s instruction to jury that it need not consider whether Gamer was correctional institution, if it found that \u201c[the incident] occurred at Gamer,\u201d constituted harmless error beyond reasonable doubt). In comparison, this court has recognized that \u201c[t]he thrust of [the task force findings behind the creation of the patients\u2019 bill of rights] is that \u2018the <em>primary function [behind] any psychiatric facility </em>is to diagnose, treat and to restore mentally disturbed persons to an optimal level of functioning . . . .\u2019\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 565. Accordingly, we conclude, contrary to the finding of the trial court, that the term <em>\" other facility </em>for the diagnosis, observation or treatment of persons with psychiatric disabilities\u201d contained in \u00a7 17a-540 (a) does not plainly and unambiguously encompass correctional institutions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">This conclusion is buttressed when the term \u201cother facility\u201d is interpreted alongside the two other terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>used in \u00a7 17a-540 (a) to define \u201c \u2018[facility,\u2019 \u201d namely, \u201chospital\u201d and \u201cclinic.\u201d See footnote 6 of this opinion. This court has consistently stated that \u201cstatutes must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Segal </em>v. <em>Segal, </em>264 Conn. 498, 507, 823 A.2d 1208 (2003); and that \u201c[w]e consider the statute as a whole with a view toward reconciling its parts in order to obtain a sensible and rational overall interpretation.\u201d <em>Sweetman </em>v. <em>State Elections Enforcement Commission, </em>249 Conn. 296, 307, 732 A.2d 144 (1999). Neither hospitals nor clinics are ordinarily considered to be synonymous with prisons or correctional institutions. See footnote 11 of this opinion. To the contrary, a hospital is commonly defined as \u201can institution where the sick or injured are given medical or surgical care . . . .\u201d Meniam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Similarly, a clinic is commonly understood to mean \u201ca facility (as of a hospital) for diagnosis and treatment of outpatients . . . .\u201d Id. These definitions stand in stark contrast to the commonly understood definition of correctional institution, which focuses squarely on confinement. Therefore, interpreting the term \u201cother facility\u201d alongside \u201chospital\u201d and \u201cclinic\u201d further persuades us that the term \u201cother facility\u201d does not encompass correctional institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>When construing \u00a7 17a-540 (a), \u201c[w]e are [also] guided by the principle that the legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law .... [T]his tenet of statutory construction . . . requires us to read statutes together when they relate to the same subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hatt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>263 Conn. 279, 310, 819 A.2d 260 (2003). \u201cAccordingly, [i]n determining the meaning of a statute . . . we look not only at the provision at issue, but also to the broader statutory scheme to ensure the coherency of our construction. <em>Schiano </em>v. <em>Bliss Exterminating Co., </em>260 Conn. 21, 42, 792 A.2d 835 (2002).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hatt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>supra, 310. The defendants claim that numerous provisions of the patients\u2019 bill of rights are incompatible with the statutes and regulations that govern the operation of correctional institutions. Therefore, the defendants contend, the legislature could not have intended for the patients\u2019 bill of rights to apply to correctional institutions. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The patients\u2019 bill of rights provides that \u201c[n]o patient may be placed involuntarily in seclusion or a mechanical restraint unless necessary because there is <em>imminent physical danger to the patient or others and a physician so orders. </em>A written memorandum of such order, and the reasons therefor, shall be placed in the patient\u2019s permanent clinical record within twenty-four horns.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 17a-544 (a). In comparison, department of correction administrative directive 6.5, \u00a7 4 (B), provides that \u201cstaff may immediately use force and/or apply restraints when an inmate\u2019s behavior constitutes an immediate threat to self, others, property or to the safety and security of the institution.\u201d See also id., \u00a7 8 (detailing procedures for authorized use of restraints). As administrative directive 6.5 illustrates, it simply is not always possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>within a correctional institution to wait for a physician\u2019s order before restraining an inmate. Indeed, the very nature of a correctional institute often <em>requires </em>individuals to be restrained in some manner or to be placed in seclusion under immediate and unexpected circumstances.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Count ten of the plaintiffs complaint alleges that the defendants violated the patients\u2019 bill of rights by failing to provide the decedent with a specialized treatment plan. More specifically, the plaintiff claims that the patients\u2019 bill of rights requires that each patient be treated in accordance with a special treatment plan that includes \u201c(1) reasonable notice to the patient of his impending discharge, (2) active participation by the patient in planning for his discharge and (3) planning for appropriate aftercare to the patient upon his discharge.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-542. This statute is in direct contradiction to other statutes that govern the movement of individuals in the custody of the department of correction,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> whether from a hospital for psychiatric disability to a correctional institution, or between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>correctional institutions. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 17a-515 (\u201cif the court revokes the order of commitment, the person shall be returned to any institution administered by the [department of [c]orrection <em>as the [c]ommissioner of [cjorrection shall </em>designate\u201d [emphasis added]); General Statutes \u00a7 18-86 (\u201c[t]he commissioner may transfer any inmate of any of the institutions or facilities of the department to any other such institution or facility . . . when it appears <em>to the commissioner </em>that the best interests of the inmate or the other inmates will be served by such action\u201d [emphasis added]). Neither of these statutes allow for inmate participation in the planning or execution of a transfer. Therefore, the rights granted to patients under the patients\u2019 bill of rights to assist with planning for discharge from the hospital for psychiatric disorders simply do not apply when the person being discharged is a convicted felon subject to an additional period of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">This contradiction between the rights provided by the patients\u2019 bill of rights and those expressly denied to inmates by other statutes and regulations is not limited to the previous two examples. Compare General Statutes \u00a7 17a-541 (no patient shall be deprived of any personal, property or civil rights, including right to vote, unless first having been declared incapable)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> with Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 9-46 (a) (\u201c[a] person shall forfeit such person\u2019s right to become an elector and such person\u2019s privileges as an elector upon conviction of a felony and committal to the custody of the [c]ommissioner of [correction for confinement\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 17a-546 (a) (stating that every patient shall be permitted to communicate by sealed mail and make and receive telephone calls except in limited instances) with <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>238 Conn. 692, 728, 680 A.2d 262 (1996) (rejecting challenge to department of correction regulations<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> governing monitoring of inmates\u2019 nonprivi-leged mail and telephone calls because monitoring was needed to \u201cfurther the substantial governmental interests in security, order and rehabilitation\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 17a-547 (a) and (d) (\u201c[e]very patient <em>shall be permitted </em>to receive visitors at regular visiting hours\u201d except if \u201cthe head of the hospital determines that it is <em>medically harmful </em>for the patient to receive visitors\u201d [emphasis added]) with department of correction administrative directive 10.6, \u00a7 1 (\u201cThe [department shall provide for visits to inmates in accordance with sound corr ectional practices. Except as required by law visitation shall be considered a privilege and no inmate shall have entitlement to a visit.\u201d) and <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>66 Conn. App. 868, 869, 786 A.2d 450 (2001) (\u201c[t]he habeas court properly concluded that the petitioner does not have a liberty interest in access to visitors\u201d); and General Statutes \u00a7 17a-548 (a) (\u201cAny patient shall be permitted to wear his or her own clothes; to keep and use personal possessions, including toilet articles . . . [and] to have access to individual storage space for such possessions .... <em>These rights shall be denied only if [an authorized party] determines that it is medically harmful </em>to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>patient to exercise such rights.\u201d [Emphasis added.]) with department of correction administrative directive 6.10, \u00a7 1 (\u201c[a]n inmate may possess only that property authorized for retention upon admission to the facility, issued while in custody ... or approved at the facility\u201d). This comparison makes clear that the rights provided by the patients\u2019 bill of rights conflict with many of the statutes and regulations that govern individuals in the custody of the department of correction. Acceptance of the plaintiffs claim, therefore, would result in a situation where \u201cprisoners undergoing mental health care in prison would be entitled, by . . . their mere status as mental health patients, to a whole panoply of rights and privileges not afforded to ordinary prisoners not receiving mental health treatment. . . . The legislature could not have intended such a disparity between those prisoners receiving mental health care and those who were not.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (Citations omitted.) <em>Baugh </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>56 N.C. App. 180, 183, 287 S.E.2d 412, appeal dismissed, 305 N.C. 759, 292 S.E.2d 574 (1982).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Furthermore, the legislature explicitly provided in \u00a7 17a-547 (f) that \u201c[n]o restriction of any patient\u2019s rights to send and receive mail, make and receive telephone calls, or receive visitors shall be made in any manner, or for any reasons, other than prescribed in section 17a-546 and this section.\u201d As noted previously in this opinion, when interpreting statutes we presume that the legislature intended to create a harmonious and continuous body of law. <em>Hatt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 310. Accordingly, we simply cannot conclude that the legislature, having given the commissioner of correction significant power to regulate the conduct of individuals in the custody of the department of correction; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 17a-515; nevertheless intended for \u00a7 17a-547(f) to preclude the commissioner of correction from exercising that power except in the limited situations set forth in subsection (f). Put another way, the sheer volume of discrepancies between the patients\u2019 bill of lights and the statutes and regulations governing correctional institutions, and the degree of discrepancy involved, persuades us that the term \u201cother facility\u201d does not encompass correctional institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">This conclusion gains additional support when the provisions of the patients\u2019 bill of rights are interpreted in the context of the entire statutory scheme of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>state. \u201cIt is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the intent of the legislature is to be found not in an isolated phrase or sentence but, rather, from the statutory scheme as a whole.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>235 Conn. 206, 226, 663 A.2d 1026 (1995); see also <em>Thames Talent, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>265 Conn. 127, 135, 827 A.2d 659 (2003) (in ascertaining statutory meaning, we look to, inter alia, statute\u2019s relationship to other legislation); <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 557, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002) (statutes relating to same subject matter are construed so as to create rational, coherent and consistent body of law). General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-513 through 17a-520 address when and how an individual in the custody of the department of correction may be transferred from a correctional institute to a hospital for psychiatric disabilities. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 17a-513 provides that \u201cany person who is in the custody of the [c]ommissioner of [c]orrection\u201d may, pursuant to the procedures set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 17a-506, petition for voluntary admission to a <em>\u201chospitalfor psychiatric </em>disabilities.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) In addition, \u00a7 17a-513 provides that, in the absence of a formal commitment proceeding, the individual \u201cshall be returned <em>to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number><em>any institution </em>administered by the [department of [c] orrection\u201d upon the completion of his voluntary stay. (Emphasis added.) The legislature\u2019s explicit differentiation between \u201chospital[s]\u201d and correctional \u201cinstitutions\u201d is emphasized by General Statutes \u00a7 17a-512, which defines \u201c \u2018hospital,\u2019 \u201d as it is used in, inter alia, \u00a7 17a-513, as \u201ca hospital for psychiatric disabilities or a mental hospital or institution administered by the [d] epartment of [mjental [h]ealth and [a]ddiction [s]er-vices.\u201d See footnote 15 of this opinion. This distinction further persuades us that a correctional institution is not an \u201cother facility\u201d subject to the patients\u2019 bill of rights under \u00a7 17a-540 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Moreover, the legislature\u2019s very enactment of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-513 through 17a-520 strongly suggests a legislative expectation that inmates with psychiatric disabilities would be better served in a hospital for psychiatric disabilities, rather than in a correctional institution. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 17a-513 (allowing inmate to petition for voluntary admittance to <em>hospital for psychiatric disability </em>pursuant to provisions of \u00a7 17a-506); General Statutes \u00a7 17a-514 (permitting emergency confinement <em>in hospital for psychiatric disabilities </em>of inmates of correctional institutions); General Statutes \u00a7 17a-515 (extending notice and hearing requirements to inmates committed under \u00a7\u00a7 17a-513 and 17a-514; noting that \u201cif the court revokes the order of commitment, the person shall be returned to <em>any institution </em>administered by the [department of [correction\u201d [emphasis added]); General Statutes \u00a7 17a-516 (any inmate that was committed to <em>hospital for psychiatric disabilities, </em>and subsequently discharged pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-510, shall be returned to <em>any institution </em>administered by department of correction).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">The patients\u2019 bill of rights was enacted in 1971, and it represents \u201cthe breadth of the legislative concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>for the fair treatment of mental patients.\u201d <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 556. Sections 17a-513 through 17a-515, however, which address inmates being admitted to a hospital for psychiatric disorders either voluntarily, in an emergency, or through formal commitment procedures, were enacted in 1976. The legislature is always presumed to be aware of all existing statutes and the effect that its action or nonaction will have on any of them. <em>Hatt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 310. Therefore, if a correctional institution was an \u201cother facility\u201d already subject to the provisions of the patients\u2019 bill of rights, the passage of \u00a7\u00a7 17a-513 through 17a-515 would have been superfluous. Put another way, there would be no need to enact statutes addressing the transfer of an inmate from a correctional institution to a hospital for psychiatric disorders if a correctional institution was an \u201cother facility for the diagnosis, observation or treatment of persons with psychiatric disabilities\u201d under \u00a7 17a-540 (a).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Lastly, any doubt we may have about the proper interpretation of the term \u201cother facility\u201d is dispelled by our review of the relevant legislative history. More specifically, we find nothing in the legislative history of the patients\u2019 bill of rights that contradicts our interpretation of \u201cother facility,\u201d or that suggests that the legislature intended for the rights provided therein to apply to correctional institutions. Indeed, our review of sources <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>such as legislative hearings<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and committee testimony<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> reveals that there was never any mention of the applicability of the patients\u2019 bill of rights to the department of correction, or to any correctional institution. See also <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 559-62 (reviewing \u201chistory attending the enactment of the patients\u2019 bill of rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">In September, 1997, moreover, the commissioner of correction requested an opinion from the attorney gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>eral regarding whether General Statutes \u00a7 17a-543 includes the department of correction and whether the term \u201c \u2018[facility,\u2019 \u201d as defined by \u00a7 17a-540 (a), includes correctional facilities. In response to the commissioner of correction\u2019s request, the attorney general rendered an opinion stating: \u201cA review of the statutes contained in the patients\u2019 bill of rights and an examination of the relevant legislative history and caselaw, makes it clear that these statutes were not intended to govern the care of inmates in prison mental health units.\u201d Opinions, Conn. Atty. Gen. No. 97-016 (September 26,1997). After reviewing the same statutory provisions analyzed previously in this opinion, the attorney general noted that \u201c[t]he focus of the legislature clearly was mental health hospitals, not correctional facilities. The specific exception [set forth in \u00a7 17a-548]<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> for individuals in Whiting [Forensic Division of the Connecticut Valley Hospital (Whiting)],<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> without any mention of inmates in mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>health units of [department of [correction facilities, makes sense only if it is concluded that the patients\u2019 bill of rights does not apply to correctional facilities.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">\u201cAlthough an opinion of the attorney general is not binding on a court, it is entitled to careful consideration and is generally regarded as highly persuasive.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>250 Conn. 536, 545, 738 A.2d 604 (1999); <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>208 Conn. 709, 720, 546 A.2d 830 (1988).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Despite being entitled to \u201ccareful consideration,\u201d the trial court improperly failed to give attorney general opinion No. 97-016 any consideration. This impropriety is magnified by the legislature\u2019s amendment of the patients\u2019 bill of rights subsequent to the issuance of attorney general opinion No. 97-016. More specifically, although the legislature has amended the patients\u2019 bill of rights on three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>separate occasions since 1997,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> none of those amendments sought to address the inteipretation set forth in attorney general opinion No. 97-016. See <em>Berkley </em>v. <em>Gavin, </em>253 Conn. 761, 776-77 n.11, 756 A.2d 248 (2000) (noting that presumption of legislative awareness of administrative interpretation of statute is based upon actual published opinion or ruling, and subsequent legislative amendment of that statute); <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Dorsey, </em>164 Conn. 247, 253, 320 A.2d 820, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1043, 94 S. Ct. 548, 38 L. Ed. 2d 335 (1973) (legislature\u2019s failure to amend indicative of legislative intent). In the present case, the attorney general issued a written opinion in response to the commissioner of correction\u2019s request, and the legislature failed to make any changes to the patients\u2019 bill of rights in response to that opinion, despite making several unrelated changes. Although certainly not dispositive of the issue before us, the legislature\u2019s failure to amend the patients\u2019 bill of rights can be construed as evidence of legislative acquiescence to the conclusion set forth in attorney general opinion No. 97-016.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Furthermore, as noted by the attorney general, \u00a7 17a-548 (a) provides patients with the right to possess, inter alia, clothing, money and other personal possessions. See footnote 26 of this opinion. Within \u00a7 17a-548 (a), the legislature also provided that patients, <em>\u201cexcept for patients hospitalized in Whiting Forensic Division </em>. . . [shall be permitted] to be present during any search of his personal possessions . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) We agree with the attorney general\u2019s conclusion that, by providing an exception for Whiting, and not providing a similar exception for correctional institu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>tions, the legislature expressed its understanding that the patients\u2019 bill of rights did not apply to correctional institutions operated by the department of correction.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Put another way, because the legislature included an exception for the maximum security facility<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> under the control of the department of mental health and addiction services,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> but not for any of the correctional institutes operated by the department of correction, which have similar safety and security considerations as Whiting, and some of which provide psychiatric care services, the legislature could not have intended for the patients\u2019 bill of rights to apply to correctional institutions.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find attorney general opinion No. 97-016 to be further \u201c \u2018highly persuasive\u2019 \u201d evidence that the provisions of the patients\u2019 bill of rights do not apply to correctional institutions. <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The plaintiff and several amici curiae<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> further contend that the defendants\u2019 interpretation of the patients\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>bill of rights conflicts with prior decisions of this court, as well as other state and federal courts. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Although unmentioned by the plaintiff in this section of her brief, we begin our analysis of prior cases addressing the patients\u2019 bill of rights by reviewing <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 548. In <em>Mahoney, </em>this court was called upon to address, inter alia, the certified question of whether \u201cthe enactment of General Statutes \u00a7 17-206k [an earlier version of \u00a7 17a-550]<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> waive [d] the sovereign immunity of the state with respect to violations of [the patients\u2019 bill of rights] . . . .\u201d Id., 551 n.6. Before addressing the certified question, we initially had to address whether \u201cthe substantive provisions of the patients\u2019 bill of rights encompass state mental health facilities as well as private institutions . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 558. Answering that question in the affirmative, we turned to the main issue before us and concluded that, based on the language of the patients\u2019 bill of rights, the purposes behind its enactment and our thorough review of its legislative history, \u201cthe legislature intended in enacting [\u00a7 17a-550] to abrogate the state\u2019s sovereign immunity.\u201d Id., 562. Therefore, although <em>Mahoney </em>establishes that the state may be liable in a direct cause of action for a violation of the patients\u2019 bill of rights at a \u201cstate mental health facility] id., 558; it fails to address the question of whether the patients\u2019 bill of rights also encompasses state correctional institutions. Indeed, if <em>Mahoney </em>offers any persuasive value to the present case, it is in favor of the defendants\u2019 interpretation. Specifically, <em>in Mahoney this </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>court extensively reviewed the legislative history for the patients\u2019 bill of rights, and noted that, in 1969, the state board of mental health appointed a task force to review the administrative and professional programs of Fairfield Hills Hospital, a state mental health facility. Id., 560. The report, issued on May 15, 1970, recommended, among other things, that \u201cthe legislature enact a patient\u2019s bill of rights to resolve problems that \u2018may be generic to all the [s]tate <em>hospitals </em>in Connecticut.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 561. In 1971, the legislature followed the advice of the task force, and enacted our patients\u2019 bill of rights, now codified at \u00a7\u00a7 17a-540 through 17a-550. After reviewing both the task force report and the patients\u2019 bill of rights, we noted in <em>Maho-ney </em>that \u201c[t]he substantive provisions of the patients\u2019 bill of rights bear a close relationship to the findings of the [t]ask [f]orce.\u201d Id., 561 n.19. Accordingly, given the task force\u2019s focus on \u201cstate hospitals,\u201d and the lack of any mention of the department of correction or correctional institutions in the legislative history reviewed in <em>Mahoney, </em>we construe it as favoring the defendants\u2019 interpretation in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Turning to the cases actually cited by the plaintiff, the plaintiff first claims that acceptance of the defendants\u2019 interpretation would force this court to \u201coverrule its recent decision in <em>Phoebe G. </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>[252 Conn. 68, 743 A.2d 606 (2000)] . . . .\u201d We disagree with the plaintiffs characterization of the relevance of <em>Phoebe G. </em>to the present case. In <em>Phoebe G., </em>the plaintiff appealed, through her next friend, from the trial court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Id., 70. In her complaint, the plaintiff sought both monetary and injunctive relief. Id. On appeal, the only two issues before this court were: \u201c(1) whether the Superior Court has subject matter jurisdiction over a complaint brought pursuant to the patients\u2019 bill of rights or whether the Probate Court has exclusive jurisdiction; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>and (2) if the Superior Court has jurisdiction, whether a next friend has standing to bring an action on behalf of a conserved person rather than her conservators.\u201d Id., 71. Although not before the court, we nonetheless noted in a footnote that the plaintiffs claim for injunc-tive relief against the commissioner of mental health and addiction services may have been moot because she was now a resident of the private Bidwell nursing home in Manchester. Id., 70 n.2. Therefore, on remand, the trial court needed \u201cto determine whether the plaintiffs residential status continues to afford her protection under the patients\u2019 bill of rights . . . .\u201d Id. More specifically, we stated that \u201c [i]f the trial court on remand determines that the plaintiffs present residential placement qualifies as a private facility for the treatment of persons with psychiatric disabilities, she can continue to make claims under the patients\u2019 bill of rights.\u201d Id. We were not deciding whether a private nursing home was a \u201cfacility for the treatment of persons with psychiatric disabilities\u201d; id.; but rather were merely identifying an issue that needed to be addressed on remand. Accordingly, we disagree that our opinion in <em>Phoebe G. </em>conflicts with our conclusion in the present case that a correctional institution is not a facility subject to the patients\u2019 bill of rights. The remaining cases cited by the plaintiff are similarly unpersuasive.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>The Connecticut Civil Liberties Union, as amicus curiae, cites the additional case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>233 Conn. 44, 65 A.2d 947 (1995), on appeal after remand, 235 Conn. 671, 669 A.2d 573 (1996), for the proposition that the patients\u2019 bill of rights has been judicially determined to apply to the rights of psychiatrically disabled prisoners. We disagree. In <em>Garcia, </em>the defendant was found incapable to stand trial pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d, and was committed to the custody of the commissioner of mental health for a period of three months for inpatient treatment in order to restore competency. Id., 53. The defendant appealed to this court from an order of the trial court permitting Whiting to treat him with antipsychotic medication in order to attempt to restore him to competency to stand trial. Id., 49-50. More specifically, the defendant claimed on appeal that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s order violated his rights under the federal and state constitutions because the trial court did not properly balance his liberty interest in being free from unwanted medication against the state\u2019s interest in determining his guilt or innocence.\u201d Id., 50-51. Ultimately, we concluded that, under certain circumstances, a defendant in a criminal case may be medicated against his will in order to restore him to competency, and we articulated a new standard for determining whether compelled medication is appropriate in a given case. Id., 51. <em>Garcia </em>is, therefore, distinguishable from this present case in several respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">To begin with, the defendant\u2019s appeal in <em>Garcia </em>was not based upon the patients\u2019 bill of rights, but rather the federal and state constitutions. Indeed, prior to addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s appeal, we first determined that the defendant had standing to bring an interlocutory appeal because he was claiming a \u201cliberty interest, protected by the due process clause of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>constitution . . . [and, therefore, the] defendant\u2019s claimed right ... is not a contingent right created by statute and subject to the discretion of the trial court, but is, rather, a vested right of constitutional dimension.\u201d Id., 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">In attempting to establish a violation of his constitutional rights, the defendant claimed that the patients\u2019 bill of rights and our case law \u201carguably [define] the personal interest to refuse antipsychotic medication more expansively than simply a significant liberty interest.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 77. We disagreed, and concluded that the defendant\u2019s claim arising under state law was not any broader than his claim arising as a matter of federal substantive due process. Id. Thus, although the patients\u2019 bill of rights helped inform our analysis of the defendant\u2019s constitutional claims, our opinion in <em>Garcia </em>does not represent, as characterized by the amicus, a judicial determination that it applies to psychiatrically disabled prisoners.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">In addition, the defendant in <em>Garcia </em>was not a convicted felon, but rather was an individual in the custody of the commissioner of mental health after being found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>incompetent to stand trial for his alleged criminal behavior. Id., 46-47. After being found incompetent, the defendant was placed in Whiting, which is operated by the department of mental health and addiction services,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and not a correctional institution operated by the department of correction. Id., 48-49. Accordingly, our conclusion in <em>Garcia </em>was limited to a finding that <em>\u201cunder certain circumstances, a defendant in a criminal case </em>may be medicated against his will in order to restore him to competency . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 51. Simply put, the issue of whether the patients\u2019 bill of rights applies to <em>convicted felons </em>confined to a <em>correctional institution </em>was not before this court in <em>Garcia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The plaintiff also claims that the defendants\u2019 interpretation of the patients\u2019 bill of rights is improper because: (1) it would be confusing and pose extreme practical difficulties to require mental health practitioners to abide by the patients\u2019 bill of rights generally, yet not when inside a correctional institution; and (2) it is wrong as a matter of public policy. Both of these arguments essentially ask this court to ignore the language and structure of the patients\u2019 bill of rights, its relation to other statutes, and the relevant legislative history, and conclude that this state would be better served with a patients\u2019 bill of rights that applies to correctional institutions providing mental health services. \u201cFor the reasons that we already have articulated, however, we are not persuaded that [the patients\u2019 bill of rights] is susceptible to the interpretation urged by the plaintiff. The determination of whether reasons of public policy exist to expand the reach of [the patients\u2019 bill of rights] to encompass [correctional institutions] is for the legislature, not this court, to make.\u201d <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>267 Conn. 524, 538, 839 A.2d 1250 (2004); see also <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 65, 480 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>A.2d 425 (1984) (\u201cAlthough we are sensitive to what the plaintiff is endeavoring to accomplish, the result which she asks us to reach would require this [c]ourt to legislate. This we cannot do.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to grant the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the ninth, tenth and eleventh counts of the plaintiffs complaint, and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\"> The defendants named in the complaint were: John J.
