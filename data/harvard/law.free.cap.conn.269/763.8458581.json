Specifically, the city claims that the board improperly concluded that \u00a7\u00a7 7-433c and 31-306 (a) (2) (A) do not require the fund to reimburse the city. The city further contends, in the alternative, that \u00a7\u00a7 7-433c and 31-306 (a) (2) (A) violate the federal and state constitutions because they deprive municipal employers of a protected property interest without due process of law. We reject the city\u2019s claims and, accordingly, we affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The plaintiffs husband, Axel Bergeson, while employed as a police officer by the city, suffered a fatal heart attack on June 17, 1995. On November 9,1995, the plaintiff was awarded survivor\u2019s benefits under \u00a7 7-433c by the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the second district (commissioner). Since that time, the city has paid the plaintiffs benefits, including COLAs pursuant to \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A), on a without-prejudice basis. On February 6, 2002, the commissioner ordered the fund to reimburse the city for the COLA payments. Specifically, the commissioner concluded that the plain language of \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A) \u201cis clear that the [f]und shall reimburse the [city] for any [COLAs] paid as a result of deaths occurring between July 1, 1993 and October 1, 1997.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The fund subsequently appealed to the board, which reversed the decision of the commissioner. Specifically, the board concluded that benefits under \u00a7 7-433c are not benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>therefore, are not subject to the reimbursement provision of \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A). In so concluding, the board relied on <em>McNulty </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>37 Conn. App. 835, 845, 657 A.2d 1126 (1995), in which the Appellate Court concluded that an earlier revision of \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A) did not require the fund to reimburse municipal employers for COLAs paid in connection with \u00a7 7-433c benefits. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The city first claims that, under \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A), it is entitled to reimbursement from the fund for COLA payments made in connection with a claim for benefits under \u00a7 7-433c. The fund claims, in response, that it is not required to reimburse municipal employers for COLAs paid in connection with \u00a7 7-433c benefits, which are intended as a \u201cspecial bonus\u201d to paid police officers and firefighters and, accordingly, are not workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the purposes of the reimbursement provision in \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A). We agree with the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">We note, at the outset, that our resolution of this issue revolves around the interrelationship of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which is codified in chapter 568 of title 31 of the General Statutes, and \u00a7 7-433c, which commonly is known as the Heart and Hypertension Act. Therefore, we begin our analysis with a brief overview of that statutory framework. \u201cThe Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was enacted to provide compensation for any injury arising out of and in the course of employment, without regard to fault, by imposing a form of strict liability on the employer. . . . Heart disease and hypertension are just some of the many ailments compensa-ble under the act. ... In order to recover under chapter 568, however, [t]he employee has the burden of proving that the injury claimed arose out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>employment and occurred in the course of the employment. . . . Section 7-433c, on the other hand, was enacted to provide <em>special compensation </em>to qualifying [police officers] and fire [fighters] who die or become disabled as a result of hypertension or heart disease. ... It requires the employer to pay compensation to those officers who have successfully passed a physical examination which failed to reveal any evidence of hypertension or heart disease and who subsequently die or are disabled as a result of such conditions whether or not the disease resulted from the employee\u2019s occupation or . . . occurred in the line and scope of his employment. ... An employee may, if the facts so warrant, elect to proceed under either chapter 568 or \u00a7 7-433c.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Collins </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>210 Conn. 423, 425-27, 555 A.2d 981 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">\u201cAs a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers\u2019 compensation appeals. ... It is well established that [although not disposi-tive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and [the] board. ... A state agency is not entitled, however, to special deference when its determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny. . . . Whe[n] ... [a workers\u2019 compensation] appeal involves an issue of statutory construction that has not yet been subjected to judicial scrutiny, this court has plenary power to review the administrative decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kuehl </em>v. <em>Z-Loda Systems Engineering, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 525, 532, 829 A.2d 818 (2003). Because this appeal raises an issue of statutory construction that is of first impression for this court, our review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">We begin with our well established principles of statutory interpretation in analyzing the city\u2019s claim. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>legislature recently has enacted No. 03-154, \u00a7 1, of the 2003 Public Acts, which provides: \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d In the present case, the relevant statutory text and the relationship of that text to other statutes do not reveal a meaning that is plain and unambiguous. Accordingly, our analysis is not limited and we look to other factors relevant to the inquiry into the meaning of \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A), including its legislative history and the circumstances surrounding its enactment and its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Of particular relevance in the present case is the principle that \u201c[pjayment of an award from a special fund such as the second injury . . . fund, which was established, inter alia, to assist in the payment of compensation awarded to handicapped and disadvantaged workers . . . should be made only in accordance with express statutory authority ... in order to protect that special fund and prevent unwarranted diversions of it from the specific purpose for which it was created.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Civardi </em>v. Norwich, 231 Conn. 287, 294, 649 A.2d 523 (1994); see also <em>Badolato </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>250 Conn. 753, 762, 738 A.2d 618 (1999). With these principles in mind, we turn to the merits of the city\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">As with any issue of statutory construction, we begin with the pertinent statutory language. Section 31-306 (a) (2) (A) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe employer or its insurer shall be reimbursed by the Second Injury Fund, as provided in section 31-354, for adjustments, including lump-sum payments, <em>payable under this sub-paragraph for deaths from compensable injuries </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>occurring on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1,1997, upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">We previously have stated that \u201cbenefits awarded to an employee pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c are <em>payable . . . </em>under the Workers\u2019] Compensation Act . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>King </em>v. <em>Sultar, </em>253 Conn. 429, 439, 754 A.2d 782 (2000); see <em>Carriero </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>243 Conn. 747, 759, 707 A.2d 706 (1998). This observation does not end our inquiry, however, because the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act expressly authorizes reimbursement from the fund for COLAs that are \u201cpayable . . . for deaths from <em>com-pensable injuries </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A). Accordingly, before we can apply \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A) as written, we must determine what is meant by the phrase \u201ccompensable injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (4), which defines the term \u201ccompensation\u201d for purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Compensation\u2019 means benefits or payments <em>mandated by the provisions of this chapter </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The term \u201cinjury\u201d is defined by \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A), which provides: \u201c \u2018Personal injury\u2019 or \u2018injury\u2019 includes, in addition to accidental injury which may be definitely located as to the time when and the place where the accident occurred, an injury to an employee which is causally connected with his employment and is the direct result of repetitive trauma or repetitive acts incident to such employment, and occupational disease.\u201d Therefore, it is apparent that the term \u201ccompensable injuries,\u201d as used in \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A), would apply only to injuries that are causally related to the employee\u2019s job, and to occupational disease. As we previously have stated, however, the benefits paid by a municipal employer pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c are not \u201cbenefits required by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>\u2018workers\u2019] compensation law\u2019 or \u2018occupational disease law\u2019 of this state.\u201d <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>178 Conn. 664, 673, 425 A.2d 131 (1979). Although an award of benefits under \u00a7 7-433c <em>\u201cis </em>a workers\u2019] compensation award in the sense that its benefits are payable and proceduraily administered under the Workers\u2019] Compensation Act . . . [it] is <em>not </em>a workfers\u2019] compensation award because it requires no proof of eligibility or liability under the Work[ers\u2019] Compensation Act.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carriero </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 759-60, quoting <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Local 1073, </em>1 Conn. App. 58, 65-66, 467 A.2d 1258 (1983), cert. dismissed, 192 Conn. 803, 471 A.2d 244 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">We next turn to other factors relevant to our inquiry into the meaning of \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A), including the legislative history of the statute, the circumstances surrounding its enactment and its purpose. Until 1993, the dependents of deceased employees were entitled to COLAs for deaths arising from compensable injuries sustained on or after October 1,1977. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A). Effective July 1,1993, the legislature amended the statute to eliminate COLAs for dependents of deceased employees injured on or after that date. Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228, \u00a7 \u00a7 15, 32. Thereafter, the legislature reversed course, effective October 1, 1997, amending \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A) to reinstate COLAs for dependents of deceased employees injured on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1997. See Public Acts 1997, No. 97-205, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 6; see also Substitute Senate Bill No. 976, 1997 Sess., \u00a7 3 (entitled in part \u201cAn Act Restoring Workers\u2019 Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustments for Widows, Widowers, Orphans and Totally Disabled Workers\u201d). In addition, the legislature amended \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A) to provide that employers and insurers are entitled to reimbursement from the fund for COLAs paid for deaths from injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>occurring on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1997. See Public Act 97-205, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The circumstances surrounding the 1997 amendments to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act were reviewed extensively in <em>Hasselt </em>v. <em>Lufthansa German Airlines, </em>262 Conn. 416, 815 A.2d 94 (2003), in which we stated: \u201cThe bill reinstating COLAs effective October 1, 1997, as initially raised in the labor and public employees committee, differed in several respects from the bill ultimately enacted. See Raised Bill No. 6627, 1997 Sess., \u00a7 2. The raised bill contained no requirement that the employee receive a retroactive lump sum payment for COLAs accrued prior to October 1, 1997. See id. It did provide, however, that [t]he cost of the adjustments shall be paid by the employer or his insurance carrier who shall be reimbursed therefor from the [fund] .... Id., \u00a7 2 (b). At the committee hearings, Robert Kehmna, president of the Insurance Association of Connecticut, testified as to concerns that the bill as drafted would impose a liability on insurance carriers for which they had not contracted. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Public Employees, Pt. 1,1997 Sess., pp. 58-65. Kehmna explained that the insurance carriers had negotiated and collected premiums based on then-statutory obligations as of the year of injuiy, and that they could not renegotiate contracts for pre-1997 injuries to account for COLAs payable perhaps ten or twenty years into the future, which were not mandated during the 1993-1997 period.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., pp. 61-62. In response to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Kehmna\u2019s testimony, several committee members indicated that they would take the insurance carriers\u2019 concerns into account.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See id., pp. 62, 65, remarks of Senator Edith G. Prague and Representative Christopher G. Donovan.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">\u201cThe bill, as subsequently amended and introduced to the legislature, required employers to pay employees a retroactive lump-sum payment upon qualification for COLAs and required the fund to reimburse employers or insurers for adjustments, including lump-sum payments . . . . See Substitute Senate Bill No. 976, 1997 Sess., \u00a7 [3], The analysis of the amended bill by the office of legislative research explained in relevant part that Senate Amendment A, which became part of the bill requires lump sum payments for retroactive COLAs for . . . totally and permanently disabled workers injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>between July 1, 1993 and September 30, 1997; [and] . . . requires the [fund] to reimburse employers and insurers for the retroactive adjustments <em>as well as for future COLAs for eligible claimants injured between those dates </em>.... Office of Legislative Research Amended Bill Analysis, p. 199; see also id., p. 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">\u201cIn debates on the amended bill in the House of Representatives, legislators stated that the fiscal impact of the bill primarily would affect the fund, not the insurance carriers. See 40 H.R. Proc., Pt. 14, 1997 Sess., p. 5180, remarks of Representative Donovan; id., pp. 5196-97, remarks of Representative James A. O\u2019Rourke III.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Representative Dominic Mazzoccoli asked for clarification on the bill, stating that he was under the impression that the legislature was in the process of phasing out the . . . fund. Id., p. 5187. Representative Donovan explained: I guess by law we are phasing it out by not taking new cases. There are still a number of individuals who are on the . . . fund and we continue the liability of those individuals. Id., pp. 5187-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">\u201cRepresentative O\u2019Rourke subsequently addressed the concern about the fiscal impact on the fund, stating: [A]s far as the impact which has been raised on the . . . fund, it is extremely important that we take this step today. Because every year that we wait to restor[e] [COLAs], that means more and more workers will ultimately have their COLAs paid by the . . . fund. And two years ago we took the step in this chamber to close [the] fund to future liabilities. Id., p. 5197.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hassell v. Lufthansa German Airlines, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 427-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>Our review of this legislative history reveals that the legislature, in amending \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A), intended that the primary economic impact of that provision would be on the fund, and not on employers or their insurers. It also is apparent, however, that the legislature was concerned with keeping the impact on the fund to a minimum. Therefore, because the legislative history of \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A) contains no reference to \u00a7 7-433c, we now address that provision in our effort to determine whether it falls within the class of benefits that the legislature had intended to be paid for by the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Section 7-433c (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNotwithstanding any provision of chapter 568 or any other general statute, charter, special act or ordinance to the contrary, in the event a uniformed member of a paid municipal fire department or a regular member of a paid municipal police department who successfully passed a physical examination on entry into such service, which examination failed to <em>reveal </em>any evidence of hypertension or heart disease, suffers either off duty or on duty any condition or impairment of health caused by hypertension or heart disease resulting in his death or his temporary or permanent, total or partial disability, he or his dependents, as the case may be, shall receive from his municipal employer compensation and medical care in the same amount and the same manner as that provided under chapter 568 if such death or disability was caused by a personal injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment and was suffered in the line of duty and within the scope of his employment .... The benefits provided by this section shall be in lieu of any other benefits which such policeman or fireman or his dependents may be entitled to receive from his municipal employer under the provisions of chapter 568 . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>The circumstances surrounding the enactment of \u00a7 7-433c are well known.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>King </em>v. <em>Sultar, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 440-41. This court previously has stated that \u00a7 7-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>433c \u201csimply [provides] special compensation, or even an outright bonus, to qualifying [police officers] and fire [fighters], [and] serves a proper public purpose . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 178 Conn. 668-69. \u201c[T]he outright bonus provided by the statute is that the claimant is not required to prove that the heart disease is causally connected to this employment, which he would ordinarily have to establish in order to receive benefits pursuant to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. . . . Thus, although [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] is used ... as a <em>procedural avenue </em>for administration of the benefits under \u00a7 7-433c ... an award under \u00a7 7-433c is not a workers\u2019 compensation award.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; interna! quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carriero </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 754-55. Therefore, although this court has recognized that the type and amount of benefits available pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c are the same as those under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act; see, e.g., <em>Felia </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>214 Conn. 181, 190-92, 571 A.2d 89 (1990); <em>Maciejewski </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>194 Conn. 139, 142, 480 A.2d 519 (1984); the <em>liability </em>for payment of those benefits is not. <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">In <em>Plainville, </em>this court concluded that \u201c\u00a7 7-433c is neither a \u2018work[ers\u2019] compensation law\u2019 nor \u2018occupational disease law\u2019 within the meaning of the policy provisions of the insurance contract\u201d at issue in that case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id., 674. Specifically, the court noted that the employer\u2019s liability to pay benefits under \u00a7 7-433c \u201carose <em>solely </em>under \u00a7 7-433c and not under the provisions of the [Workers\u2019 Compensation Act], the proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>dures of which are used in the adjudication of \u00a7 7-433c claims.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 672. The court there fore stated: \u201cIn the absence of a requirement that a heart ailment must be causally connected to the claimant\u2019s employment ... we cannot conclude that benefits paid by an employer under ... \u00a7 7-433c are benefits required by a workjers\u2019] compensation law or occupational disease law of this state. ... To do so would require us to ignore the plain effect of this legislation and to contradict our own characterization of this legislation as providing special compensation, or even an outright bonus, to qualifying [police officers] and fire[fighters].\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 673-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">In <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>193 Conn. 59, 66-67, 475 A.2d 283 (1984), this court concluded that \u201ca claimant, qualified for compensation, may elect recovery under <em>either </em>\u00a7 7-433c or chapter 568 . . . when the injury arose out of or in the course of employment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Specifically, the court stated: \u201cSection 7-433c, while similar to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes, is a <em>separate and distinct </em>legislation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">The Appellate Court, in <em>McNulty </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 37 Conn. App. 844-45, drawing upon our decisions in <em>Plainville </em>and <em>Bakelaar, </em>concluded that, under an earlier revision of \u00a7 31-306, the fund was <em>not </em>required to reimburse a municipal employer for COLAs paid in connection with \u00a7 7-433c benefits. In so concluding, the court noted that \u00a7 7-433c contains no mention of the fund, and expressly provides that the <em>employer </em>is responsible for the payment of benefits. Id., 841-42. Therefore, because neither the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act nor any other statute expressly authorized fund liability for \u00a7 7-433c benefits, the court ordered that the fund be relieved of any liability. Id., 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Significantly, <em>Plainville, Bakelaar </em>and <em>McNulty </em>were all decided before 1997, when the legislature amended \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A) to restore COLAs and provide for reimbursement from the fund. See Public Act 97-205, \u00a7 3. Nevertheless, the legislative history of that amendment contains no reference to those cases, or to the underlying statutory provision, \u00a7 7-433c. \u201cWhile we are aware that legislative inaction [as it relates to \u00a7 7-433c] is not necessarily legislative affirmation ... we also presume that the legislature is aware of [this court\u2019s] interpretation of a statute, and that its subsequent non-action may be understood as a validation of that interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nizzardo </em>v. <em>State Traffic Commission, </em>259 Conn. 131, 154, 788 A.2d 1158 (2002). Therefore, the omission of any legislative discussion concerning the impact of these cases supports the conclusion that the legislature, in amending \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A), was concerned primarily with workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and not with benefits under \u00a7 7-433c.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>This conclusion is bolstered by remarks made in both the Senate and the House of Representatives concerning how municipal employers would be impacted fiscally by the amendment to \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A). Specifically, the history reveals the legislative intent that the fiscal impact on municipalities be limited to the extent that the \u201cmunicipalities as employers pay <em>assessments </em>to the . . . [f]und, either directly as a self-insurer, or through their insurance carrier. Therefore, there will be an increase in the . . . [f]und costs to municipalities . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 40 S. Proc., Pt. 8,1997 Sess., p. 2832, remarks of Senator Prague; see 40 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 5181, remarks of Representative Donovan (\u201cin as much as a municipality pays an assessment to the [fund], there would be [a municipal impact]\u201d). Put another way, it is apparent that the legislature intended for the fund to reimburse municipal employers for COLAs paid in connection with workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and that the municipalities thereafter would pay assessments to the fund according to their liability for COLAs in the previous year. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-354 (a) (\u201cThere shall be a fund to be known as the Second Injury Fund. Each employer . . . shall . . . pay to the State Treasurer for the use of the state a sum in payment of his liability under [chapter 568] which shall be the special assessment premium surcharge . . . .\u201d); see also General Statutes \u00a7 31-349g (assessments for liabilities of fund \u201cshall be allocated between self-insured employers and insured employers based on paid losses for the preceding calendar year\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">At oral argument in the present case, however, the city conceded that \u00a7 7-433c benefits generally are not included in the calculation of assessments to the fund under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Therefore, the remarks of Senator Prague and Representative Donovan, that the amendment to \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A) would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>impact municipal employers to the extent that they pay assessments to the fund, provide further indication that the legislature was concerned with workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and not benefits under \u00a7 7-433c. Indeed, were we to imply liability to the fund in the present case, it would create the anomalous result of allowing municipal employers to obtain the benefit of fund reimbursement without incurring the statutory liability of \u201cthe special assessment premium surcharge . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-354 (a). In accordance with our well settled principles of statutory construction, we cannot conclude that the legislature intended such a result. See <em>Hartford Courant Co. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>261 Conn. 86, 101, 801 A.2d 759 (2002) (noting \u201cwell established canon of statutory construction that those who promulgate statutes or rules do not intend to promulgate statutes or rules that lead to absurd consequences or bizarre results\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">In sum, although we recognize that the legislature may well have been concerned with the fiscal impact on municipalities of retroactive payment of COLAs, and therefore expressly authorized reimbursement from the fund for that purpose with regard to workers\u2019 compensation benefits, we cannot extend that limited expression of statutory authority to imply that the fund also is liable to reimburse municipal employers for COLAs paid in connection with the separate and distinct legislation of \u00a7 7-433c. As evidenced by the legislature\u2019s usage of express statutory authority of fund reimbursement in \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A), as well as in other statutes, the legislature certainly knew how to authorize payment from the fund had it intended to do so. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-354 (expressly authorizing payment from fund under \u00a7 31-306 and General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-307b, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>31-307c, 31-349 and 31-355).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the fund is not required to reimburse a municipal employer, like the city in the present case, for COLAs paid in connection with a claim under \u00a7 7-433c.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Having concluded that the city is not entitled by statute to reimbursement from the fund, we turn to the city\u2019s claim that \u00a7\u00a7 7-433c and 31-306 (a) (2) (A) are unconstitutional under both the federal and state constitutions because they deprive the city of a property interest without providing due process of law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">As a threshold matter, we first must determine whether the city has standing constitutionally to challenge state legislation. \u201cThe issue of standing arises out of the perceived inconsistency of allowing a municipality, which is a creation of state legislation, to challenge the constitutionality of other acts of legislation by its creator. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>179 Conn. 111, 114, 425 A.2d 576 (1979). This court previously has held as a general rule that [t]owns . . . are creatures of the state, and though they may question the interpretation, they cannot challenge the legality, of legislation enacted by their creator. . . . <em>Berlin </em>v. <em>Santaguida, </em>181 Conn. 421, 424, 435 A.2d 980 (1980). However, [a]n exception to this rule has been carved out to allow a municipality, adversely affected by a statute, which is properly in court on a nonconstitutional question to challenge the constitutionality of that statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Southington, </em>259 Conn. 783, 792, 792 A.2d 76 (2002). In the present case, the city is litigating a nonconstitutional issue, namely, the proper construction of \u00a7\u00a7 7-433c and 31-306 (a) (2) (A), and is affected adversely by our construction of those statutes. As this court previously has stated, \u201ca municipality that is in court on nonconstitutional questions, as to which this question of standing is not a barrier, often has a legitimate stake in full exploration of the constitutionality of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>tested legislation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 793. Accordingly, the city has standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7\u00a7 7-433c and 31-306 (a) (2) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The city claims that \u00a7\u00a7 7-433c and 31-306 (a) (2) (A) are unconstitutional because a retroactive application of those statutes would deprive municipal employers of a protected property interest without due process of law, in violation of the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution and article first, \u00a7 10, of the state constitution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough the mere fact that a statute is retrospective does not itself render it invalid; <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>[194 Conn. 165, 174, 479 A.2d 1191 (1984)]; [Retroactive legislation presents problems of unfairness that are more serious than those posed by prospective legislation, because it can deprive citizens of legitimate expectations and upset settled transactions.

We previously have concluded that \u00a7 7-433c \u201cis justified in the interest of promoting public safety, and does not deprive a town of property without due process of law.\u201d <em>Grover </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>168 Conn. 84, 88, 357 A.2d 922, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 805, 96 S.

Specifically, we have concluded that \u00a7 7-433c is a rational means to further the legitimate legislative purpose of \u201cencourag[ing] qualified individuals to seek employment as fire [fighters] and [police officers].\u201d Id. Similarly, \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A) serves a legitimate legislative purpose, namely, to restore the annual COLAs applied to the benefits received by widows, widowers, surviving children and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>totally disabled workers.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See 40 S. Proc., supra, p. 2823, remarks of Senator Prague. Moreover, requiring that the municipal employer or its insurer pay for these COLAs is a rational means to further that legitimate legislative purpose, because the \u00a7 7-433c benefits are provided, in the first place, by municipalities or their insurers. Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7\u00a7 7-433c and 31-306 (a) (2) (A) satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-16\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) (A) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe weekly compensation rate oi' each dependent entitled to receive compensation under this section as a result of death arising from a compensable injury occurring on or after October 1, 1977, shall be adjusted annually as provided in this subdivision as of the following October first, and each subsequent October first, to provide the dependent with a cost-of-living adjustment in the dependent\u2019s weekly compensation rate as determined as of the date of the injury under section 31-309. . . .

In 1951, the General Assembly enacted a statute providing that any impairment of health caused by hypertension or heart disease resulting in the total or partial disability of a uniformed member of a paid municipal fire department who successfully passed a physical examination on entry into such service shall be presumed to have been suffered in the line of duty. [General Statutes (Sup. 1951)] \u00a7 175b. The rebuttable presumption afforded to firemen was, in 1953, made applicable to regular members of paid, municipal police departments; [General Statutes (Sup. 1953)] \u00a7 308c; and, in 1955, was applied to situations where death, as well as disability, results.

Public Acts 1967, No. 770, \u00a7 1. Apparently still dissatisfied with the restrictive implementation of those provisions, the General Assembly, in 1969, again amended the statute by making the state retirement system applicable to this section and by substituting a conclusive presumption that the hypertension or heart disease arose out of and in the course of the employee\u2019s employment in lieu of the simple presumption.

[Id., 143]. In obvious response to the suggestion in <em>Ducharme </em>that the objective of this legislation might be constitutionally attained by legislation requiring municipalities to provide special compensation or a bonus for policemen and firemen or supplemental or special risk insurance in the case of such occupations; id., 144; the General Assembly thereafter enacted \u00a7 7-433c .... Upon a subsequent constitutional challenge, the validity of \u00a7 7-433c was sustained in 1975 in <em>Grover </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>168 Conn. 84, 357 A.2d 922, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 805, 96 S.

In <em>Felia, </em>this court concluded that the language \u201ccompensation in the same amount and the same manner\u201d in \u00a7 7-433c means that a claimant under that section is entitled to benefits that are identical to those that would be awarded under chapter 568. <em>Felia </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>supra, 185.

Such claims traditionally have been analyzed under <em>substantive </em>due process principles. See <em>Usery </em>v. <em>Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., </em>428 U.S. 1, 16, 96 S. Ct. 2882, 49 L.

This bill rectifies one of those errors that was made in 1993, when the Workers Compensation bill was passed. That bill at that time changed the system. Somehow or other people like widows, widowers, surviving children, and totally disabled workers, were inadvertently eliminated from a COLA. What this bill does is restore the COLAs to those people who fall in those categories. At the public hearing we held, even the business industry acknowledged the fact that this was not their intention. That these people need to get [COLAs], and this bill does that. In addition, this bill will pay retroactively, the COLA amounts that these people were denied from 1993 to 1997. And from 1997 on, anybody who falls within these categories will get their [COLAs].\u201d 40 S. Proc., supra, p. 2823.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
