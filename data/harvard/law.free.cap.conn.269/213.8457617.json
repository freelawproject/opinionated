Ross, was charged in three cases<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with eight counts of capital felony in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b. The trial court dismissed two counts for lack of territorial jurisdiction and, after a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of four counts of capital felony in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (5) and two counts of capital felony in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 188, 194-95, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995) <em>(Ross II).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>After a separate penalty phase hearing pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-46a,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>sentenced to death. The defendant appealed from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>judgments to this court. We affirmed the defendant\u2019s convictions, but determined that certain evidentiary rulings by the trial court in the penalty phase had impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to establish a mitigating factor and, accordingly, we reversed the judgments imposing the death penalty. Ross II, supra, 286. On remand, a second penalty phase hearing was held before a jury, which found an aggravating factor for each capital felony conviction and no mitigating factor. In accordance with the jury\u2019s findings, the court, <em>Miano, </em>J., imposed a death sentence on each count. On appeal to this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-46b,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the defendant raises numerous challenges to the sentences of death. We affirm the judgments imposing the death penalty on each count of capital felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">As set forth in <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 191-92, the jury at the guilt phase trial reasonably could have found the following facts. \u201cOn June 13, 1984, the defendant accosted seventeen year old Wendy B. as she was walking along Route 12 in Lisbon. After a short conversation, he pulled Wendy B. over a stone wall, forcing her to go with him into a wooded area that led to an open field. There he sexually assaulted her, forced her to turn over on her stomach, and then strangled her.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u201cOn Thanksgiving Day, 1983, the defendant accosted nineteen year old Robyn S. on the grounds of Uncas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>on Thames State Hospital in Norwich. He forcefully pulled Robyn S. into a wooded ar ea and ordered her to remove her clothing. He then sexually assaulted her and, after ordering her to turn over on her stomach, strangled her. Before leaving, he covered her body with leaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\u201cOn Easter Sunday, 1984, the defendant picked up fourteen year old April B. and fourteen year old Leslie S., who were hitchhiking to Jewett City on Route 138. Once the girls had entered his car, he drove them easterly on Route 165 and, over their protests, past their intended destination. When April B. tried to force the defendant to stop the car by threatening him with a knife, he disarmed her and continued to transport the girls against their will, through eastern Connecticut, to Beach Pond in Rhode Island. At Beach Pond, he parked his car and bound both girls hand and foot. He then untied April B.\u2019s feet and forced her to walk a short distance from his car, where he assaulted her sexually, turned her over on her stomach and strangled her. Returning to the car, the defendant killed Leslie S. without sexually assaulting her. He then placed the bodies of both girls in his car and drove back to Preston, Connecticut, where he deposited their bodies in a culvert.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">At the second penalty phase hearing, the state sought to prove as an aggravating factor that the defendant committed all of the offenses in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-46a (h) (4). The defendant sought to prove two statutoiy and fourteen nonstatutory mitigating factors.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>found an aggravating factor and no mitigating factor for each count. Thereafter, the court imposed six sentences of death. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The defendant\u2019s claims on appeal fall into ten general categories involving: (1) rulings pertaining to the jury selection phase of the penalty hearing; (2) the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to sever the cases; (3) the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to order a competency examination; (4) evidentiary rulings; (5) the state\u2019s alleged nondisclosure of exculpatory materials in viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>tion <em>of Brady </em>v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963); (6) rulings relating to the sufficiency of the evidence in support of the mitigating and aggravating factors; (7) instructions given to the jury; (8) the constitutionality of the death penalty statute; (9) the reliability of the death sentences in light of the alleged cumulative errors; and (10) the proportionality of the death sentences, which we review pursuant to \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3). We address each of these categories in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">JURY SELECTION PHASE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">The defendant raises four claims pertaining to the jury selection phase of the trial. We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">Denial of the Defendant\u2019s For Cause Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied eight of his for cause challenges, thereby forcing him to use his peremptory challenges to remove the challenged venirepersons in violation of: (1) his statutory and constitutional right to challenge jurors peremptorily, as provided by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-82g and 54-82h<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and guaranteed by article first, \u00a7 19, of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>stitution of Connecticut, as amended by article four of the amendments;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (2) his state and federal constitutional right to a fair trial by an impartial jury, as guaranteed by the sixth<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and fourteenth<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut, as amended by articles seventeen and twenty-nine of the amendments.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. Prior to voir dire, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the trial court, pursuant to \u00a7 54-82h, granted thirty peremptory challenges to the state and to the defendant. After twelve jurors and one alternate had been accepted, the court granted one extra peremptory challenge to each party. At that time, the defendant had exhausted twenty-eight peremptory challenges and the state had exhausted seventeen. The defendant had exercised eight out of the twenty-eight peremptory challenges to excuse prospective jurors whom the trial court had refused to excuse for cause. The defendant exhausted all of his remaining challenges before the fourth and final alternate juror was accepted. At that time, the defendant requested, and the court denied, an additional challenge. The court indicated, however, that the defendant should renew his request on the following day. As instructed, on the following day, the defendant made a second request for a peremptory challenge and that too was denied. Neither of the defendant\u2019s requests for an additional peremptory challenge was made in connection with a specific juror. On May 27, 1999, the fourth and final alternate juror was accepted. Between the time that the defendant exhausted his peremptory challenges and the time that the fourth alternate was accepted, the defendant did not proffer any challenge for cause that was denied by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">After the jury had been selected, an interlocutory appeal was filed and, because of the delay occasioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>by the appeal, the jury was not recalled until January, 2000. At that time, four regular jurors and the fourth alternate juror, who was the only juror who had been selected after the defendant had exhausted his peremptory challenges, were dismissed. With the parties\u2019 agreement, the court moved the three alternates into the seats vacated by three of the dismissed jurors so that eleven jurors and no alternates remained on the panel. When jury selection to replenish the panel began, the trial court granted each party nine peremptory challenges. The defendant used eight of his nine peremptory challenges. One juror and six alternates were accepted during the second voir dire.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The defendant now claims that the trial court improperly denied his for cause challenges to the eight jurors during the first voir dire, thereby forcing him to use his peremptory challenges to remove those jurors and denying him his constitutional and statutory right to exercise his full complement of peremptory challenges. We conclude that, because the defendant did not seek an additional peremptory challenge to exercise against a specific juror who ultimately served on the jury, even if it is assumed that the trial court improperly denied one or more of the defendant\u2019s for cause challenges, any such impropriety necessarily was harmless under <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>223 Conn. 299, 613 A.2d 242 (1992). Accordingly, we do not review the merits of the trial court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">In <em>Esposito, </em>the defendant was required to exercise three peremptory challenges to excuse prospective jurors whom the court had refused to excuse for cause, thereby exhausting his peremptory challenges. Id., 303-304. Thereafter, \u201cthe defendant challenged another pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>spective juror, Richard Artkop, for cause. The trial court overruled the challenge for cause and denied the defendant\u2019s subsequent motion for an extra peremptory challenge. Consequently, Artkop became the second alternate juror. Jury selection was completed when a third alternate juror was chosen.\u201d Id., 304. Before the trial began, however, the court excused one of the twelve jurors, and Artkop, the second alternate, was randomly selected to become a member of the jury that ultimately convicted the defendant. Id., 304. The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">On appeal, this court concluded that one of the three jurors against whom the defendant had been forced to exercise a peremptory challenge should have been excused for cause. Id., 312. We noted that, if the juror \u201chad been properly removed by the court for cause, the defendant would have had one peremptory challenge remaining to remove Artkop from the jury\u201d; id., 313; and that there was no doubt that the defendant would have done so because he had both challenged the juror for cause and asked the court for an additional peremptory challenge to exercise against him. Id., 312. Accordingly, we concluded that the defendant was entitled to a new trial. We explained that \u201c[t]he Connecticut constitution guarantees a criminal defendant the right to exercise peremptory challenges in the selection of his jury. Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 19, as amended by art. IV of the amendments to the constitution; see also General Statutes \u00a7 \u00a7 54-82g and 54-82h. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s action abridged this constitutional and statutory right of the defendant. Accordingly, we agree with numerous other courts throughout the nation that \u2018it is reversible error for a trial court to force an accused to use peremptory challenges on persons who should have been excused for cause, <em>provided the party subsequently exhausts all of his or her peremptory challenges and an additional challenge is sought and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>denied.' </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The defendant argues that he has satisfied the <em>Espos-ito </em>conditions for raising a claim that the denial of a for cause challenge was reversible error because (1) he exhausted all of his peremptory challenges and (2) he sought, and was denied, an additional challenge. We disagree. We conclude that, under <em>Esposito, </em>the mere request for an additional peremptory challenge is not sufficient to establish that an allegedly improper denial of a for cause challenge was potentially harmful. Our determination in that case that the defendant\u2019s constitutional and statutory right to exercise his full complement of peremptory challenges was abridged turned on the facts that (1) if the defendant had had an additional peremptory challenge, <em>he would have used it to remove an identifiable juror </em>and (2) because he was unable to do so, <em>that juror ultimately sat on the jury. </em>In other words, it is implicit in <em>Esposito </em>that, in determining whether the denial of a for cause challenge was potentially harmful, this court considers whether an identifiable, objectionable juror actually served on the jury that decided the case, not whether the composition of the jury would have been different in the absence of the claimed error.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>In the present case, after exhausting his peremptory challenges, the defendant did not seek to exercise an additional peremptory challenge against a specific juror. Accordingly, we conclude that, even if it is assumed that the trial court improperly denied one or more of the defendant\u2019s for cause challenges, thereby forcing him to exercise his peremptory challenges to remove those jurors, his right to exercise the full complement of peremptory challenges was not abridged. Put another way, any improper denial of the for cause challenges necessarily was harmless because the defendant was not forced to accept an incompetent or objectionable juror after his peremptory challenges had been exhausted. Therefore, we need not consider the merits of the court\u2019s rulings on the defendant\u2019s for cause challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The defendant argues, however, that, under <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>481 U.S. 648, 107 S. Ct. 2045, 95 L. Ed. 2d 622 (1987), a harmless error analysis is inappropriate when an erroneous trial court ruling may have affected the composition of the jury as a whole, regardless of whether an objectionable juror actually served on the jury. He argues that the trial court\u2019s improper denials of his challenges for cause could have affected his use of peremptory challenges and that, when he made his calculated decisions to accept or strike jurors during the first voir dire, he could not have known that there would be a second voir dire to replace jurors lost as a result of the delay occasioned by the interlocutory appeal and that he would receive additional peremptory challenges to replace those jurors. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Gray </em>is misplaced because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>the United States Supreme Court has limited <em>Gray's </em>application to the specific issue raised in that case, i.e., whether the improper <em>Witherspoon-Witt</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>exclusion of a prospective juror is subject to harmless error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In <em>Gray, </em>the trial court, by its own admission, improperly denied the state\u2019s request to remove for cause at least five prospective jurors who unequivocally had stated that they could never vote to impose the death penalty, thereby forcing the state to use peremptory challenges to strike those prospective jurors from the panel. Id., 653-54. The state ultimately exhausted all of its peremptory challenges. Id., 653. When the next prospective juror was called to the jury box, she expressed reservations about imposing the death penalty but ultimately stated that she could vote for it in the appropriate case. Id. At that point, the prosecutor requested an additional peremptory challenge. Id., 654. He argued that the court erroneously had denied five or six of the state\u2019s for cause challenges and thereby had compelled the state to use its peremptory challenges against those venire members. Id. He also claimed that, if he had another challenge, he would use it to remove the prospective juror. Id. The corut denied the state\u2019s request, but excused the venireperson for cause. Id., 654-55. The jury ultimately convicted the defendant of capital murder and sentenced him to death. Id., 656. The defendant appealed, claiming that the exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>of the prospective juror was unconstitutional under <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 88 S. Ct. 1770, 20 L. Ed. 2d 776 (1968). <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, 481 U.S. 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The Mississippi Supreme Court concluded that the defendant had not been prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the venireperson. It explained that \u201c[t]he force and effect of the trial court\u2019s ruling was to correct an error he had committed in refusing to dismiss other jurors for cause after they had unequivocally stated that they could not vote to impose the death penalty in any circumstance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 657. Consequently, it explained, \u201cthe trial court was corr ect when it recognized the error in its prior rulings and took affirmative action to correct that error.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. It then affirmed both the conviction and the death sentence. Id., 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">On appeal, the United States Supreme Court reversed the death sentence. The court explained that \u201c[t]he efforts to apply a harmless-error determination to <em>With-erspoon </em>violations have suggested two analyses. . . . The first is to consider the state\u2019s retention of unexer-cised peremptory challenges at the end of jury selection as an indication that the erroneous for-cause exclusion was harmless. This approach relies on a representation by the state that it would have removed the venire member by peremptory challenge if the court had denied its for-cause motion. The second is to treat the erroneous exclusion as an isolated incident without prejudicial effect if it cannot be said that the ultimate panel did not fairly represent the community anyway. The Mississippi Supreme Court appears to have relied on a variation of the first analysis; [the] respondent urges the [c]ourt to adopt the second. We find each unpersuasive.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 660-61. The court first rejected the state\u2019s argument that the improper <em>Witherspoon-Witt </em>exclusion of a juror is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>harmless when the state has unexercised peremptory challenges because it assumed incorrectly that \u201cthe crucial question in harmless-error analysis is whether a particular prospective juror is excluded from the jury due to the trial court\u2019s erroneous ruling.\u201d Id., 665. The relevant inquiry, the court explained, is \u201cwhether the composition of <em>the jury panel as a whole </em>could possibly have been affected by the trial court\u2019s error . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The court also rejected the state\u2019s argument that the erroneous exclusion was a single technical error with no prejudicial effect. The court reasoned that \u201c[b]ecause the <em>Witherspoon-Witt </em>standard is rooted in the constitutional right to an impartial jury . . . and because the impartiality of the adjudicator goes to the very integrity of the legal system . . . harmless-error analysis cannot apply.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 668. The right to an impartial adjudicator, the court explained, is so crucial to a fair trial that its infraction can never be treated as harmless error. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>487 U.S. 81, 88-89, 108 S. Ct. 2273, 101 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1988), however, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the holding of <em>Gray </em>is limited to cases involving improper <em>Witherspoon-Witt </em>exclusions. In <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>supra, 88, the court considered whether the defendant\u2019s forced use of peremptory challenges to correct the trial court\u2019s refusal to dismiss a juror for cause was a constitutional violation. During jury selection, a prospective juror had indicated initially that he could vote to recommend a life sentence under the appropriate circumstances. Id., 83. Upon further examination by defense counsel, however, he stated that, if the jury found the defendant guilty, he would vote to impose the death penalty automatically. Id., 83-84. Defense counsel then moved to have the prospective juror dismissed for cause, and the trial court denied the motion. Id., 84. Consequently, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>was forced to exercise his sixth peremptoiy challenge to remove the prospective juror. The defendant ultimately exhausted all nine of his peremptoiy challenges. The defendant had not challenged for cause any of the twelve jurors who actually served on the jury and decided his fate, however. The jury ultimately found the defendant guilty of first degree murder and sentenced him to death. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">On appeal, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s refusal to excuse the objectionable juror was reversible error because the record did not establish that an objectionable juror actually served on the jury. Id., 84-85. Accordingly, it affirmed the sentence of death. Id. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and affirmed the judgment. Id. The court held that, although the trial court improperly had denied the defendant\u2019s for cause challenge, his sixth and fourteenth amendment rights to an impartial juiy and his fourteenth amendment right to due process had not been violated. Id., 85. The court explained that when defense counsel exercises a peremptory challenge to remove a prospective juror who should have been removed for cause, any claim that the jury was not impartial should focus <em>not </em>on the juror that was excluded, but rather, on the jurors who ultimately served. Id., 86. The court recognized that the failure to remove the potential juror could have resulted in a juiy panel different from that which otherwise would have decided the case, but concluded that that possibility did not mandate reversal. Id., 87. As long as the jury that decides a case is impartial, a defendant\u2019s forced use of a peremptoiy challenge to achieve that result does not violate the sixth amendment. Id., 88. Accordingly, the court declined \u201cto extend the rule of <em>Gray </em>beyond its context: the erroneous <em>\u2018Witherspoon </em>exclusion\u2019 of a qualified juror in a capital case. We think the broad language used by the <em>Gray </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>[c]ourt is too sweeping to be applied literally, and is best understood in the context of the facts there involved.\u201d Id., 87-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Because <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, 481 U.S. 648, applies only to erroneous <em>Witherspoon-Witt </em>exclusions, it is inapplicable here. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that <em>Esposito </em>is inconsistent with <em>Gray </em>and conclude that we need not consider the merits of the trial court\u2019s rulings on the defendant\u2019s for cause challenges because any error necessarily was harmless.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Claim that the Trial Court Improperly Excused a Juror For Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly granted the state\u2019s for cause challenge of venireperson no. 16886 in violation of his state constitutional and sixth amendment right to an impartial jury. The state counters that any error by the court was necessarily harmless because the state used only eighteen of its thirty peremptory challenges during the 1999jury selection process and, accordingly, would have excused the juror peremptorily if she had not been excused for cause. The state also argues that, even if the claim is not subject to harmless error review, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excusing potential juror no. 16886. We disagree with the state that any error was necessarily harmless. We agree with the state, however, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the state\u2019s for cause challenge to venireperson no. 16886.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. During voir dire, the state\u2019s attorney asked potential juror no. 16886 if she had any feelings about sitting on a death penalty case. She responded, \u201cI\u2019m very strongly against the death penalty, and I think that law is [a] bad law. . . . I think that law is a bad law, and I couldn\u2019t agree to it.\u201d She also indicated that she could not return a verdict that would result in someone\u2019s death. Defense counsel then questioned the juror.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thereafter, the court asked her several questions. In her responses to the court\u2019s questions, the prospective juror initially equivocated about her ability to follow the law. Ultimately, however, when the trial court reminded her that it was imperative that she keep an open mind and \u201cbe able to accept the law and apply the law ... to the facts that you find,\u201d she stated, \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it. I couldn\u2019t do it. ... I couldn\u2019t.\u201d Defense counsel then asked her, \u201c[I]f . . . you swear to uphold the law and follow the law and decide whether it is aggravation or mitigation, you\u2019re the type of person who follows the law; am I light?\u201d The prospective juror answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The court then asked, \u201cCould you follow the law in this case, the law as I\u2019ve explained it?\u201d The juror responded, \u201cGiven the worst case scenario, no, I could not.\u201d She then explained that the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d would be a finding, on the basis of the evidence, that the death sentence must be imposed. She reiterated that she could not follow the law in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The state then asked that the prospective juror be excused for cause. The defendant objected on the ground that the prospective juror had indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>her personal beliefs would not substantially impair or prevent her from following the law. The court granted the state\u2019s request. The defendant now claims that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the venireperson violated his right to an impartial jury because the venireperson merely expressed a general objection to the death penalty and did not indicate that she was incapable of making an impartial decision according to the law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">We first address the state\u2019s argument that we need not review the merits of the trial court\u2019s ruling because any error in excluding the venireperson was necessarily harmless. As we explained in part I A of this opinion, the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, 481 U.S. 668, that the erroneous <em>Witherspoon-Witt </em>exclusion of a prospective juror is not subject to harmless error review. Accordingly, we reject the state\u2019s argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u201cOur constitutional and statutory law permit each party, typically through his or her attorney, to question each prospective juror individually, outside the presence of other prospective jurors, to determine the venireperson\u2019s fitness to serve on the jury.

At the trial of the petitioner in <em>Witherspoon, </em>the state had used the statute to excuse for cause forty-seven venire-persons, nearly one half of the entire venire panel, who had expressed concerns about the death penalty. . . . The United States Supreme Court noted that \u2018the jury is given broad discretion to decide whether or not [to impose the death penalty] in a given case, and a juror\u2019s general views about capital punishment play an inevita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>ble role in any such decision.\u2019 . . . The court concluded that the jury that had been selected was \u2018uncommonly willing to condemn a man to die.\u2019 . . . Accordingly, the court held that \u2018a sentence of death cannot be carried out if the jury that imposed or recommended it was chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction.\u2019 ... In a footnote, the court indicated that a state may exclude for cause individuals \u2018who [make] unmistakably clear (1) that they would automatically vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to any evidence that might be developed at the trial of the case before them, or (2) that their attitude toward the death penalty would prevent them from making an impartial decision as to the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u201cIn <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Witt, </em>[469 U.S. 412, 105 S.

The petitioner argued that several prospective jurors had been excluded in violation of the court\u2019s decision in <em>Witherspoon. </em>The court noted that \u2018[d]espite <em>Witherspoon\u2019s </em>limited holding, later opinions in this Court and the lower courts have referred to the language in footnote 21, or similar language in <em>Witherspoon\u2019s </em>footnote 9, as setting the standard forjudging the proper exclusion of a juror opposed to capital punishment.\u2019 . . . The court explained that more recent decisions had eased the rigid requirements of <em>Witherspoon </em>by establishing a standard by which a prospective juror could be excused for cause if the individual\u2019s views concerning capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the performance of the duties of a juror in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions and the juror\u2019s oath. . . . The court con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>eluded that this test was preferable for determining juror exclusion because, as a result of the court\u2019s decisions in <em>[Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 239-40, 92 S.

Ed. 2d 859 (1976)], juries could no longer possess unlimited sentencing discretion such as was held by the jury in <em>Witherspoon. . . . </em>The court reasoned that, since <em>Furman </em>and <em>Gregg, </em>capital sentencing juries generally inform the court whether the death penalty is appropriate by answering specific questions. ... \u2018In such circumstances it does not make sense to require simply that a juror not \u201cautomatically\u201d vote against the death penalty . . . [because] the [s]tate still may properly challenge that venireman if he refuses to follow the statutory scheme and truthfully answer the questions put by the trial judge. To hold that <em>Witherspoon </em>requires anything more would be to hold, in the name of the Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury, that a [s]tate must allow a venireman to sit despite the fact that he will be unable to view the case impartially.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 435-37, 680 A.2d 147 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">As we noted in <em>Webb, </em>this court has not yet had the opportunity to decide whether the strict <em>Witherspoon </em>standard or the more flexible <em>Witt </em>standard governs as a matter of state constitutional law.

As in <em>Webb, </em>however, we need not decide that issue in this case because we conclude that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of venireperson no. 16886 met the more stringent <em>With-erspoon </em>standard \u201cthat a prospective juror may be excused for cause if the individual would automatically vote against the imposition of capital punishment regardless of the evidence presented, or if the individual\u2019s attitude concerning the death penalty would hinder an impartial determination of whether the defendant is guilty.\u201d Id., 438-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Although prospective juror no. 16886\u2019s responses to several questions pertaining to her ability to apply the law in this case were equivocal, she clearly stated that she was \u201cvery strongly against the death penalty, and [thought] that law is [a] bad law\u201d; could not return a verdict that would result in someone\u2019s death; could not keep an open mind and accept the law and apply the law to the facts found; and could not participate in a determination that the death sentence should be imposed. The trial court reasonably could have concluded that, considered in their entirety, the prospective juror\u2019s responses unambiguously established that she automatically would have voted against the imposition of the death penalty regardless of the evidence presented to the jury during the penally phase. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly granted the state\u2019s request that she be excused for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Claim Pertaining to the Trial Court\u2019s Inquiry into an Alleged Taint of a Venire Panel</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s failure to conduct an adequate inquiry into whether a venire panel had been tainted by a potentially prejudicial comment by a venireperson violated the defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to an impartial jury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. On the morning of May 17, 1999, approximately fifty venirepersons were in the jury assembly room awaiting voir dire in this case. One of the venirepersons told a court clerk, within the hearing of the other venirepersons, that the defendant had killed the venireperson\u2019s niece and he could not be an objective juror. Another court clerk immediately notified the court of what had happened. Upon being informed of this development, defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>asked the court to conduct an inquiry into whether the entire panel had been tainted. The court granted the request and began its inquiry by questioning the venire-person who had made the comment. The venireperson informed the court that his niece had been murdered by the defendant<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and admitted that he had told two venirepersons that the defendant had caused his niece\u2019s death.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> He could not remember, however, to whom he had made the comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The trial court then questioned the court clerk who had notified the court of the occurrence. The clerk stated that, at approximately 9:15 or 9:20 a.m., in the main jury assembly room that contained an estimated fifty venirepersons, another clerk had approached the venireperson and handed him a juror questionnaire. The venireperson stated to the clerk that the defendant had \u201ckilled my niece [and] I don\u2019t think I can be objective.\u201d The clerk immediately directed the venireperson to go into another room where another fifteen venire-persons had assembled awaiting voir dire before another judge. While in that room, the venireperson engaged in a conversation with two venirepersons from that panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The defendant asked the trial court to strike the entire panel. The court assumed for the purposes of its ruling that the entire panel had heard the comment, but concluded that there could be no prejudice to the defendant because the court was going to instruct the panel before voir dire that the defendant had been convicted of murdering four women. Accordingly, the court denied the request. Ultimately, the defendant accepted four venire-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>persons from the potentially tainted venire panel to serve on the jury. The defendant now claims that the trial court\u2019s failure to conduct a more searching inquiry into the alleged venire taint violated his constitutional right to an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The defendant cites <em>State </em>v. Brown, 235 Conn. 502, 668 A.2d 1288 (1995), in support of his claim that the trial court\u2019s inquiry was inadequate. In that case, we exercised our supervisory power to require that, whenever there is a claim of juror misconduct, the trial court is required to conduct an inquiry to determine the nature and extent of the jury taint, if any. The form and scope of the inquiry and whether the misconduct was so egregious as to require the court to declare a mistrial are left to the discretion of the court. Id., 526-32; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>255 Conn. 425, 436, 773 A.2d 287 (2001). The state argues that <em>Brown </em>is inapplicable in the present case because <em>Brown </em>dealt with alleged misconduct by jurors who were actually sitting on the jury. It argues that because the potential taint in this case arose before voir dire, voir dire itself provided a means to identify and to excuse potentially tainted venirepersons. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ziel, </em>197 Conn. 60, 65, 495 A.2d 1050 (1985) (affirming trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s for cause challenges of two jurors who had been exposed to prejudicial comments by other jurors before voir dire). Furthermore, it argues, by accepting without challenge four jurors from the potentially tainted venire panel, the defendant waived any claim that the jurors had been tainted.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">We agree with the state that <em>Brown </em>does not support the proposition that a trial court is required to hold an independent inquiry whenever an allegation has been made that a venire panel has been tainted before voir dire. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ziel, </em>supra, 197 Conn. 60, this court considered a situation very similar to the situation in this case. In <em>Ziel, </em>it was discovered during voir dire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>that members of the venire panel had discussed the case among themselves, and several of them had expressed the opinion that the defendant was probably guilty. Id., 62-63. The defendant moved to dismiss the entire panel, and the trial court denied the motion. Id., 63. Voir dire continued, and the defendant challenged two of the venirepersons for cause on the ground that they had overheard the remarks that the defendant was probably guilty. Id., 65-66. The court denied the challenges and the defendant accepted the jurors. Id. The defendant ultimately was convicted of murder and appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">On appeal, we held that \u201c[a]lthough it would have been proper, and perhaps more efficient, to excuse the entire panel, it was not unreasonable for the trial court to assume that the voir dire examination would disclose any prejudice upon the part of a prospective juror.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 66. Because the two venirepersons had stated repeatedly during voir dire that they had formed no opinion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt, we concluded that the trial court\u2019s denial of the for cause challenges had not deprived the defendant of a fair trial. Id., 67.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Thus, <em>Brown </em>is not applicable when allegations of jury taint are made before the affected venirepersons have been subject to voir dire. In cases involving alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>misconduct by sitting jurors, the only mechanism by which to uncover potential jury taint is an independent inquiry by the court. When an allegation is made, however, that a venire panel has been tainted, voir dire itself provides a means to uncover bias. Therefore, such an allegation does not necessarily require an independent inquiry by the court. Although we recognize that, as in the present case, there may be circumstances in which the trial court perceives a need for an inquiry exceeding the scope of voir dire, we conclude that, as in <em>Brown, </em>the form and scope of the court\u2019s inquiry, if any, into possible taint of a venire panel before voir dire depends on the circumstances of the case and is to be determined by the trial court within the exercise of its discretion. Thus, we agree with the state that our supervisory ruling in <em>Brown </em>is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">We reject the state\u2019s argument, however, that a party waives any claim of venire taint by accepting jurors from a potentially tainted panel. Such a rule would render unreviewable the trial court\u2019s rulings on motions involving allegations of venire taint before voir dire. Instead, we conclude that whether the failure to exercise a for cause or peremptory challenge to excuse a potentially tainted venireperson during voir dire constitutes a waiver of any taint claim depends on the circumstances of the case. For example, if the trial court\u2019s inquiry into potential taint of the venire panel does not adequately address crucial factual underpinnings of the taint claim that are not easily susceptible to being explored during voir dire, a party should not be required to challenge a juror in order to obtain review of the trial court\u2019s ruling. Similarly, if the trial court makes it clear that it will not allow <em>any </em>inquiry into the alleged taint during voir dire, failure to challenge the jurors would not constitute a waiver. Accordingly, we review the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>We conclude that, in the present case, the trial court\u2019s inquiry into the allegation that the venire panel had been tainted by the venireperson\u2019s comment adequately protected the defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury. The court ascertained what the venireperson had said and assumed for purposes of ruling on the defendant\u2019s request to excuse the entire venire panel that the entire panel had heard the comment. Thus, there was no need for the court to inquire of each venireperson whether he or she had overheard it. The court also reasonably concluded that the knowledge that the defendant had killed a venireperson\u2019s niece could not be prejudicial to the defendant because the first thing that the panel was going to learn during the court\u2019s preliminary instructions before voir dire was that the defendant had been convicted of murdering four women. As to the defendant\u2019s claim that the venireperson\u2019s comment, coupled with his personal presence in the jury assembly room, could have generated undue sympathy for the families of the victims, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the effect of the comment would be de minimis in light of the fact that the jurors were going to hear testimony from several members of the victims\u2019 immediate families. In any event, the defendant had the opportunity during voir dire to explore those matters. He makes no claim that he was prohibited from doing so or that the prospective jurors\u2019 responses during voir dire indicated that, because of the venire-person\u2019s comment, they had formed an opinion on the ultimate issue in the case. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Claim that the Trial Court Improperly Limited Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly prohibited him from asking prospective jurors whether they could consider his conduct in prison to be mitigat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>ing, thereby violating his state and federal constitutional right to a fair trial by an impartial jury and his state constitutional and statutory rights to voir dire individual jurors and to exercise peremptory challenges.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The state counters that the defendant\u2019s claim is not reviewable because the defendant asked the question of only three jurors and (1) the court\u2019s ruling was necessarily harmless with respect to two of those jurors who ultimately did not serve on the jury and (2) the claim was waived with respect to the third juror when the defendant withdrew the question. It further argues that, even if the claim is reviewable, the trial court\u2019s ruling was not an abuse of discretion. We conclude that the claim is reviewable but agree with the state that the trial court properly refused to allow voir dire on specific mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this claim. On April 9, 1999, several days into the jury selection phase of the trial, the defendant asked venireperson no. 17041 whether he believed that a person \u201cin prison for his . . . entire life can become a productive member of society within the prison . . . .\u201d The state objected to the question and the trial court sustained the objection. The defendant ultimately exercised a peremptory challenge to excuse the venireperson.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">On May 3, 1999, the defendant asked venireperson no. 19432 if she would consider \u201csomeone\u2019s behavior in prison, for instance a good prisoner, to be mitigation. \u201d When she answered that she would not, the defendant asked whether she would consider \u201cto be mitigation . . . someone\u2019s volunteering to have himself studied . . . .\u201d The trial court directed the defendant to \u201cget away from these examples\u201d because they \u201cmay be [introduced as] evidence.\u201d The court ultimately denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the defendant\u2019s challenge for cause with respect to venireperson no. 19432, and the defendant exercised a peremptory challenge to remove her from the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">On May 25, 1999, the defendant asked venireperson no. 15365: \u201cWhat about somebody\u2019s ability to adapt to life in prison. Do you have any feelings about whether that would be mitigating?\u201d The state objected and the trial court sustained the objection. The defendant argued that the question must be allowed under <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>504 U.S. 719, 112 S. Ct. 2222, 119 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1992). The trial court reaffirmed its ruling and ordered a recess.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">When court resumed, the court heard arguments on the applicability of <em>Morgan. </em>Ultimately, the court concluded that that case did not support the defendant\u2019s position. The defendant then withdrew the question. The defendant did not attempt to excuse venireperson no. 15365 from the panel, and he became the second alternate. Later that day, the defendant raised <em>Morgan </em>again, and the trial court explained that \u201c[t]he question\u2019s been withdrawn so there\u2019s really nothing before me.\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cThat\u2019s true, and, you know, we did accept that juror, so, you know, the question is neither here nor there. It\u2019s just, you know, more jurors are coming and who knows where I will delve in questioning.\u201d The defendant did not attempt to ask the question of another venireperson.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">As we have already noted, the parties have a statutory and state constitutional right to voir dire examination of prospective jurors. \u201cBecause of the wide range of cases submitted to juries and the impossibility of establishing a set pattern of questions appropriate for the voir dire examination of prospective jurors, the trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining the scope of counsel\u2019s inquiry. <em>State </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>172 Conn. 172, 175, 374 A.2d 156 (1976). The court has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>duty to analyze the examination of venire members and to act to prevent abuses in the voir dire process. Accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 450 A.2d 828 (1982). Therefore, the court\u2019s actions ordinarily will not be disturbed unless the court has clearly abused its discretion or it appears that prejudice to one of the parties has resulted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>203 Conn. 506, 511-12, 525 A.2d 509 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u201cThe exercise of the court\u2019s discretion, however, must be tempered to comport with the goals of the voir dire examination. We have recognized that the purpose of examining members of the venire is twofold: first, to provide information upon which the trial court may decide which prospective jurors, if any, should be excused for cause; and second, to provide information to counsel which may aid them in the exercise of their right to peremptory challenge. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>[197 Conn. 314, 318, 497 A.2d 387 (1985)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>196 Conn. 667, 671, 495 A.2d 699 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>supra, [172 Conn.] 174-75; <em>Duffy </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>137 Conn. 51, 56, 75 A.2d 33 (1950). \u2018[T]he court should grant such latitude as is reasonably necessary to fairly accomplish the purposes of the voir dire. Clearly, therefore, if there is any likelihood that some prejudice is in the juror\u2019s mind which will even subconsciously affect his decision of the case, the party who may be adversely affected should be permitted questions designed to uncover that prejudice. This is particularly true with reference to the defendant in a criminal case.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Higgs, </em>[143 Conn. 138, 142, 120 A.2d 152 (1956)].\u201d <em>State v. Dolphin, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">In <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 504 U.S. 719, the United States Supreme Court considered the issue of \u201clife qualification\u201d of venirepersons in bifurcated capital felony trials. In that case, the trial court had permitted the state to ask potential jurors during voir dire whether their opposition to the death penalty would prevent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>them from performing their duties as jurors. Id., 722. Over defense objection, the trial court asked each venire panel whether any member had moral or religious principles so strong that he or she could not impose the death penalty \u201c \u2018regardless of the facts.\u2019 \u201d Id. In addition, all of the jurors who were eventually empaneled were asked and responded negatively to the following question, or a slight variation thereof: \u201c \u2018Would you automatically vote against the death penalty no matter what the facts of the case were?\u2019 \u201d Id., 723. The trial court refused, however, the defendant\u2019s request to ask all prospective jurors the following question: \u201c \u2018If you found [the defendant] guilty, would you automatically vote to impose the death penalty no matter what the facts are?\u2019 \u201d Id. The defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. Id., 722. On appeal, the Illinois Supreme Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that, during voir dire, the trial court must grant a defendant\u2019s request to ask the \u201c \u2018life qualifying\u2019 or <em>\u2018reverse-Witherspoon\u2019 </em>\u201d question upon request. Id., 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The United States Supreme Court reversed the conviction on the ground that the federal constitution guarantees defendants in capital cases the right to question and to challenge for cause any venireperson who, upon conviction, automatically would vote to apply the death penalty regardless of the facts. Id., 729. The court explained that \u201c[a]ny juror who states that he or she will automatically vote for the death penalty without regard to the mitigating evidence is announcing an intention not to follow the instructions to consider the mitigating evidence and to decide if it is sufficient to preclude imposition of the death penalty.\u201d Id., 738. The court explained further that \u201csuch jurors obviously deem mitigating evidence to be irrelevant to their decision to impose the death penalty: They not only refuse to give such evidence any weight, but are also plainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>saying that mitigating evidence is not worth their consideration and that they will not consider it.\u201d Id., 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Thus, <em>Morgan </em>recognized the right of a defendant to ask the general question whether a prospective juror automatically will impose the death sentence upon finding an aggravating factor. Since <em>Morgan </em>was decided, however, numerous courts have concluded that that case does not entitle defendants to ask questions pertaining to specific mitigating evidence. See <em>United States </em>v. McVeigh, 153 F.3d 1166, 1208 (10th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1007, 119 S. Ct. 1148, 143 L.

Indeed, as the court in <em>McVeigh </em>noted, some courts have held not only that <em>Morgan </em>does not grant the right to ask such questions, but also that such questions are improper. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>McVeigh, </em>supra, 1208, citing <em>Evans </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 676 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>(explaining why \u201cstake-out\u201d questions are impermissible); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>supra, 312 (same). The reasoning of these cases is the same as that applied by this court in noncapital cases involving claims that the trial court improperly limited voir dire, namely, that \u201c[a] party has no right to . . . ascertain a juror\u2019s opinion [on the evidence] in advance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>164 Conn. 224, 226, 319 A.2d 398 (1973). \u201c[A]ll too frequently such inquiries represent a calculated effort on the part of counsel to ascertain . . . what the reaction of the venireman will be to certain issues of fact or law .... Such an effort transcends the proper limits of the voir dire and represents an abuse of the statutory right of examination.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Before addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow him to ask potential jurors whether they would consider postincarceration conduct \u201cto be mitigation,\u201d we address the state\u2019s argument that the claim is not reviewable because the defendant exercised peremptory challenges against two of the prospective jurors to whom the question had been addressed and withdrew his question as to the third. The defendant counters that the trial court\u2019s ruling amounted to a blanket prohibition on questions pertaining to his conduct in prison. Accordingly, he argues, it is possible that prospective jurors who would have answered the question negatively if the defendant had been permitted to ask it may have served on the jury. Although we agree with the state that the record leaves some doubt as to whether the defendant would have questioned any jurors other than the three identified jurors on their views of the mitigating nature of the defendant\u2019s conduct in prison if not for the trial court\u2019s ruling, we assume for the purposes of this claim that the defendant believed that the trial court would not have permitted him to ask the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>question of any juror and that he would have done so if permitted. Accordingly, we review the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in barring the defendant from asking the prospective jurors whether they could consider his conduct in prison to be mitigating. We are persuaded by the great weight of authority that, as a matter of federal constitutional law, <em>Morgan </em>does not require that defendants be permitted to ask potential jurors during voir dire whether they would consider specific evidence in mitigation. \u201cTo the contrary, <em>Morgan </em>specifically directed its holding toward the end of discovering jurors for whom \u2018the presence or absence of either aggravating ormitigating circumstances is entirely irrelevant.\u2019 \u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 182 Ill. 2d 59-60, quoting <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 504 U.S. 729. <em>Morgan </em>does not suggest that a venireperson who indicates a general willingness to consider facts and circumstances in mitigation, but who believes that a specific fact or circumstance is not mitigating, should be precluded from serving on the jury.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> A contrary conclusion would allow the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>to use voir dire to form trial strategy and to select jurors sympathetic to specific mitigating claims. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim under the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">We also are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that the state constitution provides greater protection than the federal constitution on this matter. \u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>[222 Conn. 672, 684-86, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992)], we enumerated the following six factors to be considered in determining that issue: (1) persuasive relevant federal precedents; (2) the text of the operative constitutional provisions; (3) historical insights into the intent of our constitutional forebears; (4) related Connecticut precedents; (5) persuasive precedents of other state courts; and (6) contemporary understandings of applicable economic and sociological norms, or as otherwise described, relevant public policies.\u201d <em>City Recycling, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>257 Conn. 429, 444 n.12, 778 A.2d 77 (2001). The defendant concedes that state precedent,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>federal precedent and contemporary sociological norms<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> provide no support for his specific claim. He argues, however, that the text of article first, \u00a7 19, of the constitution of Connecticut, as amended by article four of the amendments,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> sibling state precedent and the intent of the framers of the constitution all support the claim that he has a state constitutional right to question venirepersons about specific mitigating factors. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">With respect to the text of the state constitution and the intent of the framers, the defendant argues only that peremptory challenges \u201coccupy a special position in this state\u2019s jurisprudence\u201d and \u201cthe right to liberal, individual voir dire has been a fixture in Connecticut for centuries, to a degree unknown elsewhere in the nation.\u201d We have no quarrel with these propositions. They do not support the argument, however, that the defendant has a right to ascertain a juror\u2019s opinion on specific evidence in advance of trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 164 Conn. 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">With respect to sibling state precedent, the defendant relies primarily on statements made by the Louisiana Supreme Court in an unpublished appendix to its decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Comeaux, </em>699 So. 2d 16 (La. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1150, 118 S. Ct. 1169, 140 L. Ed. 2d 179 (1998), and <em>People </em>v. <em>Cash, </em>28 Cal. 4th 703, 50 P.3d 332, 122 Cal. Rptr. 2d 545 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1199, 123 S. Ct. 1270, 154 L. Ed. 2d 1039 (2003).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>appendix to <em>Comeaux, </em>the Supreme Court of Louisiana stated that \u201cthe prosecutor properly may probe into a prospective juror\u2019s general attitude about certain mitigating circumstances, just as the defense may probe into the juror\u2019s general attitude about aggravating circumstances.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Comeaux, </em>1997 La. LEXIS 1719, *66-*67 (1997). The court also stated, however, that \u201chypothetical questions and questions of law which call for prejudgment of any supposed case on the facts are not permissible in voir dire examination.\u201d Id., *67.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In <em>Cash, </em>the trial court prohibited the defendant from asking prospective jurors whether they automatically would impose the death penalty if the defendant previously had committed another murder. The California Supreme Court stated that \u201c[b]y absolutely barring any voir dire beyond facts alleged on the face of the charging document, the trial court created a risk that a juror who would automatically vote to impose the death penalty on a defendant who had previously committed murder was empanelled and acted on those views . . . .\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Cash, </em>supra, 28 Cal. 4th 723. The court also stated, however, that \u201cdeath-qualification voir dire must avoid two extremes. On the one hand, it must not be so abstract that it fails to identify those jurors whose death penalty views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties as jurors in the case being tried. On the other hand, <em>it must not be so specific that it requires the prospective jurors to prejudge the penalty issue based on a summary of the mitigating and aggravating evidence likely to be presented. </em>... In deciding where to strike the balance in a particular case, trial courts have considerable discretion. . . . They may not, however, as the trial court did here, strike the balance by precluding mention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>any general fact or circumstance not expressly pleaded in the information.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 721-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">We conclude that, contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, neither <em>Comeaux </em>nor <em>Cash </em>stands for the proposition that a defendant has a constitutional right to ascertain the opinions of prospective jurors on the mitigating nature of specific mitigating claims prior to trial. Although <em>Cash </em>suggests that the parties may voir dire prospective jurors on certain <em>general </em>facts or circumstances beyond those set forth in the information, it expressly states that questions pertaining to specific mitigating claims are not allowed. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim under the state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Finally, we conclude that the foregoing analysis forecloses the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s ruling violated \u00a7\u00a7 54-82f and 54-82g. Nothing in those statutes requires the trial court to permit a party to ascertain prospective jurors\u2019 views on specific evidence during voir dire. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">THE DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION TO SEVER</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motions to sever and his motion for reconsideration, both made prior to the penalty phase of these proceedings. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">The following procedural history is relevant to our resolution of this claim. Initially, the state brought three separate informations against the defendant, charging him, respectively, with: (1) the kidnap-murder and sexual assault-murder of Wendy B.; (2) the kidnap-murder and sexual assault-murder of Robyn S.; and (3) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>kidnap-murders of April B. and Leslie S.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The cases were consolidated for trial. <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 225. The defendant filed a motion to sever the cases prior to the guilt phase of his trial, which the trial court denied. Id. He also filed a motion to sever prior to the first penalty phase of the proceedings, which was also denied. In <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 225-26, this court rejected the defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to sever that he had made before the guilt phase. We did not reach his claim concerning the denial of his second motion to sever that was filed before the first penalty phase. Id., 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">After we remanded the case for new penalty phase proceedings, the defendant again filed a motion to sever. The trial court denied the motion because the defendant had not met his burden of showing that consolidation of the cases for the penalty phase gave rise to substantial prejudice. Specifically, the trial court found that: (1) the three cases were easily distinguishable on their facts; (2) the facts of each case were equally shocking, thus reducing the risk that the facts of one case would taint the others; and (3) the duration and complexity of the trial did not warrant severance. The trial court also noted that there was no representation that the defendant wanted to testify as to only some of the charges and that there were no antagonistic or inconsistent defenses. Recognizing, however, that consolidation of the cases potentially could confuse the jury, the court ordered the state to compartmentalize its presentation of the evidence pertaining to each separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>case. The defendant now challenges the denial of his motions to sever. The state argues that this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Ross II </em>affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to sever made prior to the guilt phase is the law of the case and is controlling here. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u201cThe law of the case doctrine provides that when a matter has previously been ruled upon interlocutorily, the court in a subsequent proceeding in the case may treat that decision as the law of the case, if it is of the opinion that the issue was correctly decided, in the absence of some new or overriding circumstance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Clark Equipment Co., </em>259 Conn. 114, 130 n.21, 788 A.2d 83 (2002). This court follows the \u201cwell-recognized principle of law that the opinion of an appellate court, so far as it is applicable, establishes the law of the case upon a retrial, and is equally obligatory upon the parties to the action and upon the trial court. . . . The rule is that a determination once made will be treated as correct throughout all subsequent stages of the proceeding except when the question comes before a higher court . . . and [the doctrine] applies both to remands for new trial . . . and to remands for articulation.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>209 Conn. 225, 237, 550 A.2d 885 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1069, 109 S. Ct. 1349, 103 L. Ed. 2d 817 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">In <em>Ross II, </em>we determined that the trial court reasonably could have concluded, under <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>204 Conn. 714, 720-25, 529 A.2d 1260 (1987), that the cases should be consolidated for the guilt phase because the three incidents involved were factually discrete and easily distinguishable, the violence in each of them would not have led to jury confusion or undue prejudice and conducting the proceedings jointly would not produce such a complex and lengthy process that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the jury would be influenced to consider evidence cumulatively and not independently. <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 226. The defendant now claims that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to sever the cases prior to the second penalty phase was improper because: (1) the crimes could not easily be separated into distinct events and, therefore, were bound to confuse the jury, thereby impairing the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and independent consideration of the evidence in each case separately; (2) the evidence concerning the double homicide was of such a brutal and violent nature that it was bound to influence the jury\u2019s view of the other homicides; and (3) the complexity and length of the trial was bound to influence the jury to consider the evidence cumulatively rather than independently. These are precisely the same issues, however, as the issues raised by the defendant before the first guilt phase and reviewed by this court in <em>Ross II. </em>Accordingly, we conclude that this claim is governed by the law of the case and that the trial court properly denied the motion to sever.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Casanova, </em>255 Conn. 581, 594, 767 A.2d 1189 (2001) (\u201c[the law of the case] doctrine is inapplicable here because the issue raised by the pretrial motion to dismiss was different from the evidentiary issue subsequently presented to the trial court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The defendant argues, however, that the mere fact that the request to sever the cases was made at the penalty phase entitled him to a second bite at the apple. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>We disagree. First, he has provided no authority for the proposition that the standards for consolidation that apply at a penalty phase proceeding are different from those that apply at a guilt phase proceeding. Nor has he explained, and we cannot perceive, why the risk of undue prejudice should be greater at the penalty phase than at the guilt phase. As in <em>Ross II, </em>where he presented evidence of all of the offenses at issue here, as well as two additional sexual assault-murders that he committed in Windham county (Windham county murders),<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> in support of his insanity defense, the defendant himself chose at the second penalty phase to introduce evidence of all three incidents and of other crimes in support of his claimed mitigating factor that he had a substantial mental impairment. Thus, the risk that the jury would consider the evidence cumulatively was one that the defendant chose to take, and it could not have been avoided even if the cases had been severed. Moreover, as in <em>Ross II, </em>the jury was not faced with antagonistic or confusing theories of mitigation for each separate offense, but was presented with a single theory applicable to each case. Accordingly, we see no reason that this court\u2019s holding in <em>Ross II </em>should not govern here.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The defendant also claims that, even if the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to sever, the consolidation was prejudicial because, during the penalty phase hearing, the state failed to comply with the trial court\u2019s order to compartmentalize the evidence. He further argues that the instructions given by the trial judge were insufficient to cure the confusion produced by the state\u2019s commingling of evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The defendant argues that the state\u2019s presentation of evidence was confusing because the sequence in which the offenses were discussed in the defendant\u2019s audio-taped confessions was different from the sequence in which the state initially presented evidence concerning the three cases. In addition, he argues that the audiotape contained a commingled and confusing discussion of the offenses, as well as two murders and a rape not at issue in this case. The defendant also argues that the testimony given by various witnesses impermissibly commingled all three cases. Finally, he complains of the state\u2019s characterization of the three separate cases during closing argument as \u201cthis case\u201d and \u201cthe case\u201d; its use of the words \u201cthey,\u201d \u201cthose poor girls\u201d and \u201cpeople\u201d and the like to refer to the victims; and the use of the phrases \u201cthe case\u201d and \u201cthe offense\u201d by the court during its instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Thus, the defendant argues, in effect, that the trial court\u2019s order to the state to compartmentalize the evidence pertaining to the three cases required the state to conduct a separate evidentiary proceeding for each of the cases within the context of the consolidated proceeding. In other words, the defendant appears to believe that the state was required to call the same witnesses separately for each case and to edit and redact the documentary evidence and the audiotaped confessions so that they could be presented separately for each case. We disagree. Such a proceeding could only create confusion, not dispel it. Moreover, we note that, when the trial court ordered the state to compartmentalize the evidence, it explicitly recognized that some of the evidence applied to all of the offenses, and it excepted such evidence from its order. Presumably, the cases were consolidated in part <em>because </em>much of the evidence pertained to more than one case and it was more efficient and less confusing to introduce such evidence only once. Requiring the state to present three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>hermetically sealed cases would undermine the very purpose of a consolidated trial, i.e., to avoid multiplicity of litigation and to promote judicial efficiency. As the trial court properly found on two separate occasions, these cases are not inherently indistinguishable, complex or confusing. Our careful review of the record convinces us that the state\u2019s presentation of the evidence did not make them so.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s claim that the use of the words \u201cthis case,\u201d \u201cthe case\u201d and the like by the state during closing arguments and by the trial court in its instructions to the jury, we conclude that it would have been unduly confusing, and simply impracticable, for the state and the court, in evexy instance in which they referred to this matter, to refer separately to each of the individual offenses. Moreover, the examples of allegedly improper instructions by the court that the defendant presented were taken almost exclusively from the court\u2019s instructions on the mitigating factor. As we have noted, it was the defendant himself who chose to claim that the circumstances of all of the offenses, i.e., \u201cthe case,\u201d showed that a mitigating factor existed as to each separate offense. Accordingly, we conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury was misled either by the state\u2019s presentation of evidence or by the court\u2019s instructions, to believe that it did not have to consider each offense with which the defendant was charged separately, especially in light of the court\u2019s repeated instructions that the jury had to consider the offenses separately. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">THE DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR A COMPETENCY EXAMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a competency examination pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> in violation of his due process rights to a fair trial under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. In an apparent attempt to commit suicide, the defendant ingested an overdose of prescription sedatives on November 2, 1998. As a result of the suicide attempt, the defendant was hospitalized. Defense counsel visited the defendant in the hospital on November 4,1998, and observed that he was suffering from hallucinations. The defendant refused to see one of his attorneys on November 10, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Shortly after the suicide attempt, the defendant requested that the trial court order a competency examination. A hearing on the request was held on November 20, 1998. At the hearing, defense counsel indicated that the defendant was limiting his claim that he was incom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>petent to the second prong of \u00a7 54-56d, i.e., that he was unable to assist in his own defense. Defense counsel indicated that the defendant was suffering from severe depression and made repeated representations to the effect that he was \u201cunable to rationally have discussion with regard to choices in his case at this time.\u201d She also informed the court of the defendant\u2019s suicide attempt and of his continuing desire to waive the penalty hearing and to stipulate to the death penalty. The defendant presented no testimony, exhibits or medical reports in support of his claimed incompetence, however. The trial court canvassed the defendant on his understanding of the nature of the proceedings.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>The court rendered its decision on December 17, 1998. The court found that the defendant was well educated, intelligent and articulate; that he could read and was a prolific writer; that he did not suffer from any known or apparent illness or defect that would impair his ability to assist his counsel; that the medication that was prescribed for him did not interfere with his ability to participate in or to comprehend fully the nature of the proceedings; that he understood and fully comprehended the status of his case and the nature and circumstances of the pending penalty phase proceeding; that he understood and fully appreciated the duties of the fact finder at a penalty phase proceeding and the consequences of the findings of the fact finder, including the imposition of the penalty of death; and that he comprehended the respective burdens of proof and standards of proof of the parties that would apply at the penalty phase proceeding. On the basis of these findings, the court determined that the evidence did not establish that the defendant was unable to assist counsel and that any doubt on that matter was based not on the defendant\u2019s <em>inability </em>to assist counsel, but \u201cupon a difference of opinion [between the defendant] and his counsel concerning the manner in which the case in mitigation [was] to be presented, if presented at all.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>motion for a competency examination. Over the course of the ensuing penalty phase proceeding, the trial court noted periodically on the record that the defendant was interacting appropriately with his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The defendant now claims that the trial court improperly determined that the evidence did not establish a reasonable doubt as to his competency. Specifically, the defendant points to (1) his attempted suicide, (2) his past attempt to accept the death penalty, and (3) defense counsel's representations that he was unable to assist in his own defense due to his depression. We disagree and conclude that the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a competency examination was within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The sentencing of \u201can accused person who is not legally competent to stand trial violates the due process of law guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions.

General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (a), which codifies this constitutional mandate, provides that \u201c[a] defendant shall not be tried, convicted or sentenced while he is not competent. For the purposes of this section, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>a defendant is not competent if he is unable to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u201cThis statutory definition mirrors the federal competency standard enunciated in <em>Dusky </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S. Ct. 788, 4 L. Ed. 2d 824 (1960) (per curiam). According to <em>Dusky, </em>the test for competency must be whether [the defendant] has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u2014and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him. ... Id.; see also <em>Drope </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 172, 95 S. Ct. 896, 43 L. Ed. 2d 103 (1975). Even when a defendant is competent at the commencement of his trial, a trial court must always be alert to circumstances suggesting a change that would render the accused unable to meet the standards of competence to stand trial. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>205 Conn. 673, 686-87, 535 A.2d 345 (1987).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The defendant argues that the trial court was required to order a competency examination pursuant to \u00a7 54-46d upon being presented with factual allegations that, if true, would constitute evidence of incompetence. In support of his claim, the defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 21, in which this court stated that \u201c[a]s a matter of due process, the trial court is required to conduct an independent inquiry into the defendant\u2019s competence whenever he makes specific factual allegations that, if true, would constitute substantial evidence of mental impairment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In interpreting this language, however, it is important to distinguish between an \u201cindependent inquiry\u201d by the court and an independent competency examination of the defendant as provided by \u00a7 54-56d (d). We recognize that this court has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>always clearly made that distinction. See e.g., id., 21 (suggesting that same standard applies to request for \u201ccompetency examination\u201d and request for \u201cindependent inquiry\u201d by court). It is clear, however, that the \u201cindependent inquiry\u201d required by due process whenever an allegation of incompetence has been made is a hearing before the court, not an independent psychiatric evaluation as provided by statute. See id., citing <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 21, 83 S. Ct. 1068, 10 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1963) (colorable allegation of incompetence entitles prisoner to court hearing, but court has discretion to ascertain whether claim is substantial before allowing prisoner to testify). The provisions of \u00a7 54-56d \u201cstate that if it \u2018appears\u2019 that the defendant is not competent, and if the trial court finds that a request for a competency evaluation is \u2018justified,\u2019 the court must order a competency examination. We have interpreted this standard as requiring a competency evaluation any time a reasonable doubt is raised regarding the defendant\u2019s competency.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 24. To establish such reasonable doubt, the defendant must present substantial evidence, not merely allegations, that he is incompetent. See id., 21-25. \u201cSubstantial evidence is a term of art. Evidence encompasses all information properly before the court, whether it is in the form of testimony or exhibits formally admitted or it is in the form of medical reports or other kinds of reports that have been filed with the court. Evidence is substantial if it raises a reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s competency .... <em>Moore </em>v. <em>United States, </em>464 F.2d 663, 666 (9th Cir. 1972). <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>[198 Conn. 598, 605, 504 A.2d 497 (1986)]; see <em>Pate </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>[supra, 383 U.S. 385]; <em>de Kaplany </em>v. <em>Enomoto, </em>540 F.2d 975, 982-83 (9th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1075, 97 S. Ct. 815, 50 L. Ed. 2d 793 (1977); <em>People </em>v. <em>Pennington, </em>66 Cal. 2d 508, 518, 426 P.2d 942, 58 Cal. Rptr. 374 (1967).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>We conclude that the trial court reasonably could have determined, on the basis of its canvass of the defendant at the November 20, 1998 hearing, and the lack of any testimony, exhibits or medical reports to support the defendant\u2019s claim of incompetence, that there was no reasonable doubt that the defendant not only understood the nature of the proceedings but also was able to communicate with and assist his counsel. As the trial court noted, the facts adduced at the hearing supported, at most, an inference that the defendant was reluctant to assist counsel, not that he was <em>unable </em>to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The defendant\u2019s suicide attempt, his attempt to stipulate to the imposition of the death penalty and his counsel\u2019s statements at the hearing on the motion for a competency examination do not compel a different conclusion. First, we previously have held that an attempted suicide does not automatically create a reasonable doubt as to a defendant\u2019s competency and require the trial judge to order a competency examination. See <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>192 Conn. 383,388, 472 A.2d 759 (1984) (attempted suicide does not automatically require trial judge to order competency hearing). This is so because, \u201c[c]ompetence to stand trial ... is not defined in terms of mental illness. An accused may be suffering from a mental illness and nonetheless be able to understand the charges against him and to assist in his own defense . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeAngelis, </em>200 Conn. 224, 230, 511 A.2d 310 (1986). Similarly, the defendant\u2019s past attempts to stipulate to the imposition of the death penalty did not raise a reasonable doubt as to his competency, especially in light of the fact that he was found competent on April 9, 1998, at the time he was pursuing the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Finally, we conclude that the defendant places undue weight on the representations made by defense counsel at the November 20, 1998 hearing. \u201cAlthough . . . the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>opinion of the defendant\u2019s counsel \u2018is unquestionably a factor which should be considered,\u2019 we note that the trial court need not accept it without question. <em>Drope </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>[supra, 420 U.S. 177 n.13].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DesLaurier, </em>230 Conn. 572, 588, 646 A.2d 108 (1994). Moreover, we agree with the trial court that defense counsel\u2019s representations constituted legal conclusions, not evidence from which the trial court could make its own legal determination as to the defendant\u2019s competency. In short, the representations of defense counsel \u201cprovided no reasonable basis for the trial court to disregard its own, in-court observations about the defendant\u2019s then present competency.\u201d Id., 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">We conclude that the trial court reasonably could have determined that there was no reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s competency. Therefore, it did not abuse its discretion when it declined to order a psychological examination of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">EVIDENTIARY ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">The defendant challenges several evidentiary rulings by the trial court. We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">The Admission of Prior Testimony By Psychiatrist Robert Miller</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s admission of guilt phase testimony given by Robert Miller, a now deceased psychiatric expert for the state, to rebut certain mitigating evidence violated the defendant\u2019s due process and confrontation rights because: (1) Miller\u2019s testimony at the guilt phase did not address the question of mental impairment, which was the issue at the penalty phase, and, therefore, there was not an identity of issues; (2) the defendant had no opportunity to cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>examine Miller on the substance of his testimony; and (3) the testimony was more prejudicial than probative. The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the use of the testimony. We reject these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">This court previously has taken note of certain facts relevant to the resolution of this issue. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>251 Conn. 579, 589-90, 742 A.2d 312 (1999) <em>(Ross III), </em>we stated that \u201c[p]rior to the commencement of the defendant\u2019s trial in 1987, Miller, the psychiatric expert employed by the state, examined the defendant. Subsequent to the examination, Miller issued a report in which he diagnosed the defendant as a sexual sadist, but concluded that the defendant was not legally insane. Eight months after his examination of the defendant, however, in a letter to [C. Robert Satti, Sr.], the prosecutor handling the case, Miller expressed his doubts about \u2018how [he] could testify against psychopathology playing a sufficient role in [the] defendant\u2019s behavior to mitigate the type of penalty.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The state disclosed a portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>this letter to the defendant at some point before or during the guilt phase trial, including Miller\u2019s statement that \u201c[i]f it had been only one or two incidents I could have held up, but the repetitive nature of the acts as well as past history of assaultive behavior make my (our) position untenable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">During the guilt phase of the trial, Miller testified in rebuttal of the defendant\u2019s insanity defense. Specifically, he testified about the general nature of sexual sadism, including his opinion that sexual sadists are capable of controlling their behavior. He did not testify about his diagnosis of the defendant or his opinion as to the defendant\u2019s ability to control his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">On cross-examination at the guilt phase, defense counsel attempted to ask Miller about the portion of his letter to Satti that had been disclosed to the defendant. When defense counsel started to ask about Miller\u2019s statement concerning the repetitive nature of the defendant\u2019s acts, the state interrupted and objected on the ground that the question was beyond the scope of direct examination. The defendant countered that the question went to Miller\u2019s bias. After a discussion off the record, the court sustained the state\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">At that point, the defendant requested that, for purposes of preserving the record, he be permitted to mark for identification the item on which he had attempted to question Miller. The court then dismissed the jury and entertained argument on the defendant\u2019s request. The court first noted that Miller\u2019s letter was not part of the record and that defense counsel\u2019s question to Miller about the letter was therefore without any proper context. The state then offered to provide a copy of the letter to the court so that the court could determine whether it showed bias on Miller\u2019s part. Defense counsel agreed that he intended to use the letter only to show bias and that he did not intend to go beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>scope of direct examination. Upon review of the letter, the court determined that it did not demonstrate any bias that could not be otheiwise brought out by questioning the witness. Accordingly, the court denied the defendant\u2019s request to read the letter and ordered that the letter be sealed. Defense counsel asked Miller one more question\u2014whether a person must be psychotic to be mentally ill\u2014and then ended his cross-examination. Miller was excused as a witness shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The next day, the court, sua sponte, reversed its ruling denying the defendant\u2019s request to read the entire letter. The court stated that its new ruling did not necessarily \u201cmean that there\u2019s going to be any further inquiry [regarding the letter]. Certainly, if there is, it requires Dr. Miller\u2019s presence. He resumes the same position he had at the termination yesterday.\u201d The court then provided the letter to defense counsel and granted his request to leave the courtroom to review and discuss the letter with cocounsel. Upon returning to the courtroom, defense counsel returned the letter to the court and requested that it be marked for identification. Defense counsel gave no indication that he wanted to accept the offer to resume his cross-examination of Miller. As previously noted, at the conclusion of the guilt phase, the defendant was convicted of all of the offenses with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Thereafter, at the first penalty phase hearing, the defendant offered Miller\u2019s report diagnosing the defendant as a sexual sadist and Miller\u2019s letter to Satti as exhibits in support of his claims in mitigation that he suffered from a significant impairment of mental capacity and lacked the ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. The state objected on the ground that Miller was available as a witness and the documents were inadmissible hearsay. The defendant argued that the rules of evidence did not apply to relevant mitigating evidence. The court sustained the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>objection. Ultimately, the jury found an aggravating factor and no mitigating factor, and the court sentenced the defendant to death on each count. <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 188-90. The defendant appealed and this court determined that the trial court improperly had excluded Miller\u2019s report and letter. Id., 271. Accordingly, we reversed the death sentence and remanded the case for a second penalty hearing. Id., 273. Meanwhile, Miller had died in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">At the second penalty phase, the defendant again claimed as statutory mitigating factors pursuant to \u00a7 53a-46a (g) (2) that at the time of the offense \u201chis mental capacity was significantly impaired\u201d and that \u201chis ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was significantly impaired but not so impaired in either case as to constitute a defense to prosecution . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In support of these mitigating factors, the defendant presented evidence from his own psychiatric experts that he suffered from the mental illness of sexual sadism and that that condition significantly impaired his ability to control his actions.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> He also placed in evidence Miller\u2019s report and his letter to Satti.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">In its rebuttal case, the state sought to introduce into evidence the transcript of Miller\u2019s testimony during the guilt phase. The defendant objected on the grounds that he had not been able to cross-examine Miller on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>substance of his testimony and that Miller\u2019s testimony was relevant only to the guilt phase issue of insanity, not to the mitigating factors claimed by the defendant. The state argued that the rules of evidence do not apply to evidence offered to rebut mitigation. The court, after noting that it was not strictly required to establish that Miller\u2019s testimony met the criteria for admissibility, concluded that the issues addressed by the documents introduced by the defendant and Miller\u2019s testimony were substantially similar and the testimony was otherwise admissible. The court specifically noted that the defendant had opened the door to the testimony by introducing Miller\u2019s report, which went to the issue of the defendant\u2019s insanity, and that the testimony probably would not have been admissible if the report had not been admitted. The court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection and allowed the state to read selected portions of Miller\u2019s testimony into the record. Among other things, the jury heard Miller\u2019s testimony concerning the general nature of sexual sadism and his opinion that sexual sadists are capable of controlling their behavior.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> On surrebuttal, the defendant played for the jury videotaped interviews by defense counsel of James M. Alexander, a psychiatrist who had worked closely with Miller for several years, and Miller\u2019s wife, Shirley Miller. Alexander and Shirley Miller stated that, in their views, Miller was forthright and principled and that his letter to Satti reflected a genuine change of opinion about the defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Immediately after Robert Miller\u2019s testimony was read to the jury, the court instructed the jury that the testimony was \u201crelevant to sexual sadism [and was] offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>as the general criteria of sexual sadism and not offered relevant specifically to Dr. Miller\u2019s diagnosis of [the defendant].\u201d The court also charged the jury at the conclusion of evidence that Miller\u2019s testimony had been given during the guilt phase on the issue of insanity and that insanity was not an issue in the penalty hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The defendant now claims that the trial court improperly admitted Miller\u2019s prior testimony into evidence. He concedes that, under \u00a7 53a-46a (c), which allows \u201c[a]ny information relevant to any mitigating factor [to] be presented by either the state or the defendant, regardless of its admissibility under the rules governing admission of evidence in trials of criminal matters,\u201d the rules of evidence did not apply to the testimony. See <em>Ross </em>III, supra, 251 Conn. 588-89. He argues, however, that the testimony was so unreliable and prejudicial that its admission violated his due process right to a fair trial and his rights under the confrontation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">We begin our analysis by addressing the appropriate standard of review. We stated in <em>Ross III, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 587-88, that, although the rules of evidence do not apply to evidence presented in rebuttal of mitigating evidence, the trial court nevertheless continues \u201cto have the authority to preserve the integrity of the proceeding before it. That authority necessarily encompasses the duty to exclude evidence that, although relevant, is, for example, too prejudicial to be admissible or that is cumulative of evidence previously introduced. Having the authority to make such an exclusionary ruling, the trial court indubitably also has the authority to instruct the fact finder about the limited uses to which admissible evidence properly may be put. ... [A] literal reading of [\u00a7 53a-46a (c)] does not divest a trial court of its traditional authority and obligation to exclude unreliable and unduly prejudicial evidence.\u201d Thus, although the ordinary rules of evidence do not apply to evidence pertaining to mitigation, the trial court retains discre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>lion to rule on the reliability and prejudicial nature of such evidence. Such rulings are subject to review under an abuse of discretion standard. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirsch, </em>263 Conn. 390, 399, 820 A.2d 236 (2003). \u201cIf the [evidentiary] claim is of constitutional magnitude [and an abuse of discretion is found], the state has the burden of proving the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">We next review the legal standards governing the admission of testimony given at a separate proceeding. Section 8-6 (1) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides an exception to the hearsay rule for \u201c[testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, provided (A) the issues in the former hearing are the same or substantially similar to those in the hearing in which the testimony is being offered, and (B) the party against whom the testimony is now offered had an opportunity to develop the testimony in the former hearing.\u201d These restrictions on the hearsay exception have their roots in the confrontation clause. As we stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>255 Conn. 477, 491 n.19, 774 A.2d 927 (2001), \u201c[t]he confrontation clause demands that where prior testimony is admitted at a later proceeding, the party against whom the testimony is admitted must have had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the earlier proceeding sufficient to endow the testimony as a whole with some indicia of reliability . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>omitted.) See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wingate, </em>520 F.2d 309, 316 (2d Cir. 1975) (\u201c[testimony given at a pretrial or at a previous hearing by a presently unavailable witness is inadmissible at a subsequent trial unless the issues in the two proceedings are sufficiently similar to assure that the opposing party had a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine when the testimony was first offered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The defendant claims that the admission of Miller\u2019s prior testimony violated his rights under the confrontation clause because the testimony did not satisfy either prong of the hearsay exception. We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the issues at the two proceedings were not substantially similar. We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the issues at the guilt phase and at the second penalty phase were substantially similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">At the guilt phase, the state used Miller\u2019s testimony to rebut a defense of insanity. Although the defendant did not expressly claim insanity at the second penalty phase, the jury, confronted only with Miller\u2019s report and his letter, in which he stated, among other things, that he had reversed his \u201cearlier intemperate stand, which was based more on emotion than reason,\u201d and \u201cthe repetitive nature of the acts as well as past history of assaultive behavior make my (our) position untenable\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 272 n.39; could have come to the conclusion that, in the letter, Miller had repudiated the opinion contained in his report, i.e., that the defendant was not insane.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The state used Miller\u2019s testimony to rebut that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>potential inference by showing that, although Miller\u2019s letter showed that he ultimately had concluded that he could not testify that the defendant did not suffer from some psychopathology that <em>impaired </em>his ability to control his conduct, he continued to believe that sexual sadists\u2014and by implication the defendant\u2014are not <em>incapable </em>of controlling their conduct. Accordingly, we conclude that, although there is merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that, as a general rule, the issue of insanity is not substantially similar to the issue of significant mental impairment and, therefore, testimony tending to show only that a defendant was not insane does not rebut evidence of significant mental impairment, under the circumstances of this case, where the defendant interjected the issue of his insanity into the penalty phase proceeding by placing Miller\u2019s report into evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the issues raised at both proceedings were substantially similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that Miller\u2019s testimony should have been excluded because he did not have an adequate opportunity to cross-examine Miller on it. The defendant argues in his brief that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u201c[b]ecause the scope of direct examination avoided any diagnosis of the defendant, <em>no </em>cross-examination about the defendant was possible.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We agree that the defendant could not have cross-examined Miller on testimony that he had not given on direct examination. The defendant could have cross-examined Miller on the primary substantive issue on which he <em>did </em>testify, however, namely, that sexual sadists can control their conduct. He was not prevented from exploring whether that testimony was consistent with Miller\u2019s report, in which he had diagnosed the defendant as a sexual sadist, and his letter to Satti stating that he could not testify that the defendant\u2019s psychopathology was not mitigating. He simply made no attempt to do so. \u201c[T]he test [for the admissibility of prior testimony] is [whether the party against whom the evidence is offered had] the opportunity for full and complete cross-examination rather than the use made of that opportunity.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 491 n.19. We conclude that the trial court reasonably could have concluded that that test was met.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the testimony should have been excluded because it was more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>prejudicial than probative. The defendant argues that the testimony could have misled the jury to believe that, because Miller gave it after he wrote the letter to Satti, it was a retraction of that letter.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> As we have noted, however, the testimony went to the issue of whether sexual sadists are insane while the letter went to the issue of the defendant\u2019s claim of mitigating mental impairment. The testimony merely tended to show that Miller continued to believe that sexual sadists are not insane, an issue that had been interjected into the proceeding when the defendant introduced Miller\u2019s report diagnosing the defendant as a sexual sadist and offering the opinion that he was not insane. We have concluded that the testimony was properly admitted for the purpose of raising this inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">This brings us to the defendant\u2019s claim that the court\u2019s instructions on the use of Miller\u2019s testimony were improper. The defendant argues that the trial court improperly told the jury that the admission of Miller\u2019s testimony was unusual<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and denied his requests that the court explain to the jury the differences between insanity and \u201csignificant impairment\u201d; define \u201csignificant impairment\u201d; explain that Miller\u2019s testimony could not be used to determine whether a mental impairment had been proven; explain that the defendant had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>precluded from cross-examining Miller with his letter and report; explain that the first sentencing jury had not been permitted to see the report or letter; and instruct that, if it found that no mental impairment existed, the jury would have to find that none of the psychiatric evidence was credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u201cThe standard of review for constitutional claims of improper juiy instructions is well settled. In determining whether it was . . . reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, the charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied ... is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 128, 836 A.2d 224 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">With respect to the claim that the court improperly told the jury that the admission of Miller\u2019s testimony was unusual, the defendant argues that \u201c[s]uch an influential charge could have had only one effect: to lend the court\u2019s endorsement to the reliability of Miller\u2019s damaging testimony\u201d and that \u201c[t]he charge made it seem that Miller\u2019s testimony was somehow particularly worthy of credence . . . .\u201d We do not agree that the court\u2019s general characterization of the use of prior testimony as \u201ca little bit unusual\u201d amounted to an improper endorsement of the testimony or Miller\u2019s credibility. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">With respect to the remaining claims, we conclude that the court\u2019s instruction that Miller\u2019s testimony had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>been given during the guilt phase on the issue of insanity and that insanity was not an issue in the penalty hearing adequately informed the jury that it was not required to find that the defendant was insane in order to find that he had a significant mental impairment. We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that the court\u2019s refusal to expound on the definition of \u201csignificant impairment,\u201d to tell the jury what evidence had been presented to the previous penalty phase jury or to instruct it that a determination that there was no mitigation would be inconsistent with all of the psychiatric evidence allowed the jury to reach a verdict not sanctioned by law or supported by properly admitted evidence. Accordingly, we reject these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The Exclusion of Testimony by Bishop Daniel Hart</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly excluded testimony by Daniel Hart, the Bishop of the Norwich Roman Catholic Diocese, on the concept of mercy, including the extension of mercy to those who have committed heinous crimes, and the Catholic church\u2019s position on capital punishment. The trial court concluded that the evidence was not relevant to the question of whether anything in the defendant\u2019s character, background and history warranted a sentence less than death. The defendant argues that the exclusion of the testimony violated the constitutional principle that \u201c[s]tates cannot limit the sentencer\u2019s consideration of any relevant circumstance that could cause it to decline to impose the [death] penalty.\u201d <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>481 U.S. 279, 306, 107 S. Ct. 1756, 95 L. Ed. 2d 262 (1987). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">As we previously have noted in this opinion, the rules of evidence do not apply to the admission of mitigating evidence at the penalty phase. <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 268. The court retains discretion to exclude irrelevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>evidence, however. See id.; see also <em>Ross III, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 587. To be relevant, evidence that the defendant seeks to introduce as mitigating must bear on the \u201cdefendant\u2019s character, background and history, or the nature and circumstances of the crime . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-46a (b); see also <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 604 n.12, 98 S. Ct. 2954, 57 L. Ed. 2d 973 (1978) (\u201c[n]othing in this opinion limits the traditional authority of a court to exclude, as irrelevant, evidence not bearing on the defendant\u2019s character, prior record, or the circumstances of his offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">We agree with the trial court that general ethical or religious teachings on the nature of mercy or the morality of the death penalty have no bearing on any fact pertaining to the defendant\u2019s background, character or history, or to the circumstances of the offense.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Bishop Hart\u2019s proposed testimony as irrelevant. Moreover, the governing law of this state is that, when a defendant has been convicted of a capital felony and an aggravating factor has been found, the death sentence must be imposed unless the defendant has established a circumstance specific to himself or the case that constitutes a basis for a sentence less than death. The admission of opinion testimony on the compatibility of that law with a particular moral or religious doctrine impermissibly would encourage jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>nullification of the law. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The Admission of the Videotaped Interviews with Howard Zonana</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly allowed the state to impeach Donald Grayson, a psychiatrist retained by the defendant as an expert witness, with videotaped interviews between the defendant and Howard Zonana, another of the defendant\u2019s psychiatric experts. He argues that the admission of the videotapes violated his constitutional right to counsel, his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and the attorney-client and psychiatrist-patient privileges. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this claim. The defendant retained Zonana to perform a psychiatric evaluation in 1985. At that time, Zonana conducted several interviews of the defendant and videotaped them. Zonana advised the defendant that the interviews were confidential and would be covered by the attorney-client privilege unless both the defendant and his attorneys agreed to disclose them.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">At the first penalty phase hearing, Fred Berlin, another psychiatric expert for the defendant, testified that he had viewed the videotapes as part of his evaluation of the defendant. The state asked for copies of the videotapes. The defendant objected, claiming that disclosure would violate his fifth amendment rights and the attorney-client privilege. The court overruled the objection and the videotapes were disclosed to the state. The state did not attempt to place the videotapes into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Before the second penalty hearing, the defendant indicated that he intended to call Berlin and Grayson as psychiatric experts. The defendant never called Berlin. Grayson testified that he had reviewed Berlin\u2019s reports as part of his evaluation of the defendant. The defendant also placed into evidence a report by Grayson in which he discussed in detail several letters and reports by Berlin in which Berlin had concluded that the defendant suffered from sexual sadism, that the condition caused him personal anguish and that it might be treatable with medication. During cross-examination of Grayson, the state asked him whether he was aware that the defendant had retained Zonana. The defendant objected to the question, and the jury was excused. The state indicated to the court that it intended to offer evidence that the defendant had made statements to Zonana that were inconsistent with those that he had made to Gray-son and to ask Grayson whether those statements would change his opinion.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The defendant argued that the statements to Zonana were covered by the psychiatrist-patient privilege and the attorney-client privilege. The state countered that any privilege had \u201cdisappeared\u201d when the videotapes were given to Berlin and the defendant called Berlin to testily during the penalty phase. After reviewing the portions of the videotapes that the state intended to show to Grayson, the court ruled that they were relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim of mental impairment and admitted them.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Several days later, the court explained in greater depth its reasons for admitting the videotapes. The court stated that the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination had been waived at the guilt phase and second penalty phase when the defendant presented evidence in which he admitted that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>had committed the offenses, but the court recognized that the videotapes were subject to the psychiatrist-patient and attorney-client privileges. The court concluded, however, that the defendant had given a qualified waiver of those privileges when he placed his mental condition in issue. The court then concluded that, on two separate occasions, the defendant specifically had waived the privilege with respect to the videotapes. The first waiver was in 1987 when he called Berlin to testily at the first penalty phase and the videotapes were disclosed to the state. The court noted that, once the videotapes had been disclosed, their confidentiality could not be reasserted. The second waiver was in 2000 when the defendant called Grayson, who had relied on Berlin\u2019s reports, to testify at the second penalty phase hearing. Accordingly, the court concluded that the videotapes were admissible. At the close of evidence, the court instructed the jury that the videotapes had been entered into evidence for the sole purpose of testing the basis of Grayson\u2019s expert opinion and could not be used to establish any fact in issue. The defendant now challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to admit the videotapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">As a preliminary matter, we address the proper standard of review. Whether the defendant waived the attorney-client, psychiatrist-patient and fifth amendment privileges is a mixed question of law and fact over which our review is de novo. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>259 Conn. 374, 387, 788 A.2d 1221 (mixed question of law and fact is subject to de novo review), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 836, 123 S. Ct. 152, 154 L. Ed. 2d 56 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In support of his argument that the admission of the videotapes violated the psychiatrist-patient privilege, the defendant points out that \u201c[t]he people of this state enjoy a broad privilege in the confidentiality of their psychiatric communications and records . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Falco </em>v. <em>Institute of Liv</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>ing, </em>254 Conn. 321, 328, 757 A.2d 571 (2000); see also General Statutes \u00a7 52-146e.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201c[wjhere a psychiatric expert ... is retained by a criminal defendant or by his counsel for the sole purpose of aiding the accused and his counsel in the preparation of his defense, the attorney-client privilege bars the state from calling the expert as a witness.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>178 Conn. 626, 628, 424 A.2d 293 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">This court has recognized, however, that \u201c[a] defendant waives many significant rights when he chooses to assert a defense of insanity.\u201d <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 213. \u201cSpecifically, a defendant\u2019s assertion of an insanity defense requires at least a partial waiver of his attorney-client privilege because, under Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 [40-18 and 40-19], he must disclose defense psychiatric reports and submit to a court-ordered psychiatric examination on behalf of the state.\u201d Id., 214. It is also clear that such disclosure of psychiatric evidence to the state necessarily constitutes a waiver of the psychiatrist-patient privilege with respect to the disclosed materials. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has held that a defendant who introduces psychiatric evidence has \u201cno Fifth Amendment privilege against the introduction of [the psychiatric reports of the defendant\u2019s experts] by the prosecution.\u201d <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>483 U.S. 402, 423, 107 S. Ct. 2906, 97 L. Ed. 2d 336 (1987); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Manfredi, </em>213 Conn. 500, 513, 569 A.2d 506 (defendant waives fifth amendment privilege against sett-incrimination when he places mental status in issue), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 818, 111 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Ct. 62, 112 L. Ed. 2d 37 (1990). \u201c[I]f a defendant . . . presents psychiatric evidence, then, at the very least, the prosecution may rebut this presentation with evidence from the reports of the examination that the defendant requested.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Steiger, </em>218 Conn. 349, 362-63, 590 A.2d 408 (1991), quoting <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 422-23.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Otherwise, \u201c[the defendant\u2019s] silence may deprive the State of the only effective means it has of controverting his proof on an issue that he interjected into the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">In the present case, the defendant raised the claim of significant mental impairment and called Grayson to testify in support of that claim. Grayson testified that he had read Berlin\u2019s reports and he quoted those reports at length in his own written report, which was admitted into evidence. In turn, Berlin had testified at the first penalty phase that he had relied in part on the Zonana videotapes in forming his own opinion about the defendant\u2019s mental status. Thus, the reliability of Grayson\u2019s testimony was dependent in part on whether Berlin\u2019s opinion was supported by the statements made by the defendant to Zonana. Therefore, the state was entitled to test the basis of Grayson\u2019s opinion by confronting him with the videotapes. Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that the defendant implicitly waived the psychiatrist-patient privilege with respect to the videotapes when he called Grayson as a witness. A fortiori, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the defendant waived the privilege in 1987 when he called Berlin to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The defendant argues, however, that there can be no implied waiver of the psychiatrist-patient privilege and, even if it is assumed that an implied waiver is permissible, the waiver in this case was not knowing and intelligent. He has cited no authority for the proposition that an express waiver of the privilege is required in cases where the defendant has raised the issue of his mental status, however, and it is clear that such a requirement would eviscerate the principle that a defendant, having chosen to place his mental status in issue, cannot selectively conceal relevant psychiatric evidence behind the shield of privilege. With respect to the defendant\u2019s claim that his waiver was not knowing and intelligent, we note that he makes no claim that his attorneys failed to advise him that a claim of mental impairment at the second penalty phase would act as a waiver of any privilege in the videotapes or that he would not have claimed mental impairment if he had known that it meant waiving any privilege.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> In the complete absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>of any such claim, we must \u201cassume that the defendant\u2019s experienced and highly competent counsel knew that the results of the . . . psychiatric examination could be used in rebuttal [if he raised impaired mental status as a mitigating claim] and informed the defendant of the potential nature and scope of the . . . examination\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Steiger, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 370; and that the defendant\u2019s decision to claim mental impairment was made intelligently and with full knowledge of the consequences. For the same reasons, we also reject the defendant\u2019s claim that use of the videotapes violated his sixth amendment right to counsel. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The defendant also argues that a defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination protects him against compul-soiy submission to a psychiatric evaluation unless he has placed in issue whether he \u201chad the mental state required for the offense charged\u201d; Practice Book \u00a7 40-18;<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> and that whether the defendant had the mental state required for the offenses was not in issue during the penalty phase. Thus, he implicitly argues that the foregoing principles apply only when a defendant has raised an insanity defense at the guilt phase and not when he has raised a claim of mental impairment at the penalty phase. We disagree. As we have noted, the state has a statutory right to rebut mitigating evidence presented by the defendant at the penalty phase. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-46a, (c). The defendant has provided no authority in support of his claim that the constitution prohibits the state from using otherwise admissible psychiatric evidence to rebut a mitigating claim of mental impairment at the penalty phase, and we can conceive of no reason that the waiver princi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>pies that apply at the guilt phase should not also apply at the penalty phase. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Finally, the defendant argues that under Practice Book \u00a7 40-13 (b), which provides in relevant part that the defendant shall provide to the state \u201cany statements of the witnesses other than the defendant,\u201d his statements are not subject to disclosure. That section of the Practice Book merely provides that certain materials are discoverable by the state as of right, however. It does not prohibit the disclosure of other materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the defendant waived his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination and his attorney-client and psychiatrist-patient privileges in the Zonana videotapes when he claimed significant mental impairment as a mitigating factor and called Grayson and Berlin to testify in support of that claim. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">The Motion to Suppress the Defendant\u2019s Confession</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress his confessions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">We previously have taken note of certain facts and procedural history that are relevant to our resolution of this claim. \u201cOn June 28, 1984, while at the Lisbon town hall, the defendant made numerous inculpatory statements to the state police: He admitted, orally and in writing, that he had killed Wendy B. and Robyn S., murders that were committed in New London county. He also confessed to killing April B. and Leslie S. in Rhode Island and to other murders in Windham county.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">\u201cAfter an evidentiary hearing, the trial court, <em>Hendel, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his incul-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>patory statements. In support of its ruling, the trial court made the following findings of fact. The defendant came to the Lisbon town hall voluntarily. He made his first incriminatory statement to detective Michael Malchik [of the Connecticut state police major crime unit] before having received <em>Miranda </em>warnings. This statement resulted from an extended conversation in a town hall conference room. During this conversation, the defendant was not physically restrained and twice had been advised that he was free to leave. It was the defendant who initiated an inquiry into the type of person who might have killed Wendy B. and whether such person might receive psychotherapy. The defendant then asked Malchik whether Malchik thought the defendant had killed Wendy B. Malchik replied in the affirmative and told the defendant that he felt that \u2018he [the defendant] would do it again and I thought that was the most important thing, that he didn\u2019t do it again.\u2019 Immediately thereafter, without any questioning by Malchik, the defendant admitted to having killed Wendy B. Upon hearing this incriminatory statement, Malchik terminated any further conversation with the defendant and treated him as a custodial suspect. Before asking any further questions, Malchik gave the defendant the required <em>Miranda </em>warnings; <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966); and asked the defendant to sign a <em>Miranda </em>waiver, which he did. All the defendant\u2019s subsequent incriminatory statements followed repeated <em>Miranda </em>warnings and waivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u201cThe trial court concluded that: (1) the police had not illegally detained or arrested the defendant; (2) the defendant had made his statements to the police voluntarily; and (3) there was no <em>Miranda </em>violation in the manner in which the police obtained statements from the defendant. Accordingly, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.\u201d <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Conn. 202-204. The defendant challenged that ruling on appeal. This court affirmed the denial, stating that \u201c[considering the record of the meeting in its entirety, we are persuaded that the trial court was not clearly erroneous in its determination that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have felt free to leave even after Malchik had voiced his belief that the defendant had killed Wendy B.\u201d Id., 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">At the second penalty phase, the defendant renewed his motion to suppress the confession. He argued that this court improperly had applied a deferential standard of review in <em>Ross II </em>and that legal developments since the release of that opinion had clarified that \u201cin custody\u201d determinations are reviewed de novo. See <em>Thompson </em>v. Keohane, 516 U.S. 99, 112-13, 116 S. Ct. 457, 133 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1995). The trial court held that <em>Thompson </em>had not changed the standard of review and that this court\u2019s ruling in <em>Ross II </em>was controlling. Cf. <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>Jack\u2019s Auto Sales, </em>54 Conn. App. 289, 293-94, 734 A.2d 1036 (1999) (law of the case applies in absence of overriding circumstance such as \u201cdecision of the Supreme Court after the first review that is inconsistent with the decision on review\u201d). Accordingly, it denied the motion to suppress. The defendant now challenges that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">In <em>Thompson, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that review of \u201cin custody\u201d determinations involves two distinct inquiries: \u201cfirst, what were the circumstances surrounding the interrogation; and second, given those circumstances, would a reasonable person have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Keohane, </em>supra, 516 U.S. 112. \u201cThe first inquiry ... is distinctly factual. State-court findings on these scene- and action-setting questions attract a presumption of correctness .... The second inquiry, however, calls for application of the controlling legal standard to the historical facts. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ultimate determination, we hold, presents a \u2018mixed question of law and fact\u2019 qualifying for independent review.\u201d Id., 112-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\"><em>In State v. Atkinson, </em>235 Conn. 748, 759 n.17, 670 A.2d 276 (1996), this court concluded that the <em>Thompson </em>analysis \u201cis similar to the one that we have always applied [to in-custody determinations]. We first examine the trial court\u2019s conclusion regarding the historical facts in order to determine whether it is clearly erroneous. We next conduct an independent review in light of the totality of the circumstances by scrupulously examining the record to determine if an application of the law to the facts leads us to conclude that the defendant was in custody. In contrast with the [United States] Supreme Court, however, we have never expressly labeled this second determination as a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d Thus, we recognized in <em>Atkinson </em>that <em>Thompson </em>applied another name to, but did not alter, the standard of review that this court always had applied to \u201cin custody\u201d determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">We recognize that, in <em>Ross II, </em>we used the phrase \u201cthe trial court was not clearly erroneous\u201d in affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 205. A careful reading of our opinion in that case convinces us, however, that we in fact applied the standard of review that we traditionally have applied to \u201cin custody determinations,\u201d as set forth in <em>Atkinson, </em>and did not merely defer to the trial court\u2019s determination. Specifically, we first set forth the governing law; id., 204; and then set forth the constitutionally relevant facts gleaned from our independent review of the entire record. Id., 205. Applying the law to the facts, we stated that <em>\u201c[wjefind, </em>it especially probative that, contrary to the facts of the cases on which the defendant relies, it was the defendant, not Malchik, who initiated the discussion of the murder of Wendy B.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. We did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>not defer to any determination by the trial court on the constitutional significance of that fact, our independent assessment of which was central to our resolution of the claim. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that this court in <em>Ross II </em>had applied the proper standard of review to the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress at the guilt phase and our affirmance of that ruling is, therefore, controlling here. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s renewed motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">THE DEFENDANT\u2019S <em>BRADY </em>CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">The defendant claims that the court improperly denied his motion for a mistrial or a life sentence in which he claimed that the state failed to disclose exculpatory evidence in a timely manner in violation of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 373 U.S. 83. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. On March 16, 2000, two days after the defendant had rested his case in mitigation, the state disclosed to him certain documents pertaining to the investigation of a rape, a death and an attempted rape that had occurred at Cornell University (Cornell) in Ithaca, New York, in the spring of 1981. Specifically, the documents pertained to the investigations of the rape of a woman, identified only as K.G., on May 6, 1981; the death of a woman, identified as D.N.T., on May 12, 1981; and the attempted rape of a woman, identified as T.T., on May 14, 1981. The defendant\u2019s possible involvement in these incidents had been public knowledge since 1987<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> and the defendant had confessed in 1998 to committing a rape-murder and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>offenses when he was a student at Cornell in 1981.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> A videotape of an interview between the defendant and Zonana concerning a rape, attempted rape and rape-murder that he had committed at Cornell had been admitted as a full exhibit and played to the jury at the second penalty phase.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">After the disclosure of the materials, the defendant immediately claimed that the state improperly had withheld exculpatory materials and asked the court to impose a life sentence or, in the alternative, to declare a mistrial. He also asked that, if the court denied those motions, the state be precluded from using any of the evidence in rebuttal. The state acknowledged that it had had most of the materials in its possession for \u201can appreciable amount of time,\u201d but argued that they were not exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The court did not rule on the defendant\u2019s requests immediately, but heard additional arguments the next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>day. At that time, the defendant argued that the materials were exculpatory because they (1) showed that he was remorseful, (2) corroborated his claim that he suffered from sexual sadism and (3) undermined the state\u2019s claim that he had killed the victims to avoid detection. In support of his argument that the materials showed that he was remorseful, he pointed to a file memorandum dated May 21, 1987, authored by Scott Hamilton of Cornell\u2019s department of public safety indicating that, on March 25,1987, Malchik had told him that the defendant was reluctant to talk about the murders that he had committed outside of Connecticut because he wanted the death penalty to be carried out as soon as possible. The defendant argued that this evidence impeached Malchik\u2019s testimony that, at the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest and confession in June, 1984, he had stated untruthfully that he had committed murders only in Connecticut. In addition, he argued that it impeached testimony by Frank Griffin, a captain with the state police, that the defendant showed no remorse at the time of his arrest and confession. With respect to his claim that the materials pertaining to the rape and attempted rape corroborated his diagnosis of sexual sadism, he argued that the materials showed the ritualistic, repetitive and progressive nature of his conduct. In support of his argument that the materials undermined the state\u2019s theory that he had killed the victims in order to avoid detection and not because of his sexual sadism, the defendant contended that the police reports, which indicated that D.N.T.\u2019s body had been found fully clothed, and a portion of Hamilton\u2019s memorandum, which indicated that Malchik had stated to Hamilton that the defendant had redressed one of the Connecticut victims after killing her, corroborated the defendant\u2019s account given to one of his psychiatric experts that he had sexually assaulted Leslie S., whose body had been found fully clothed, and tended to show that the murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>was, therefore, sexually motivated. The defendant also argues in his brief to this court that the police reports showed that the defendant could have been identified by at least two surviving victims in addition to a woman he had confessed to raping in Connecticut, identified as Vivian S., who identified him after his arrest. Finally, he argued to the trial court that the materials had been produced too late for him to be able to make effective use of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">On March 20, 2000, the court issued its ruling that the undisclosed materials were not material under <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 373 U.S. 83, and denied the defendant\u2019s motions for a life sentence, a mistrial and exclusion of the evidence in the state\u2019s rebuttal case. The couit also indicated, however, that it would entertain a request for a continuance or to recall excused witnesses. The defendant declined the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Later that day, the court considered the state\u2019s offer of testimony by K.G. The state told the court that K.G. would testify, in rebuttal of the defendant\u2019s claim that he did not kill his victims to avoid detection but because of his sexual sadism, that the person who had raped her had taken steps to ensure that she could not identify him and had not attempted to degrade or humiliate her. The defendant argued that the testimony should not be admitted because it was not entirely clear that it was the defendant who had raped K.G. The court agreed that the record did not sufficiently establish that the defendant had committed the rape and excluded the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The defendant then asked that the portion of Hamilton\u2019s memorandum stating that Maichik had told Hamilton that the defendant wanted to be executed as soon as possible be introduced as a full exhibit. The court allowed it and the exhibit was read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>The defendant claims on appeal that the trial court improperly denied his motions for a life sentence or a mistrial on the ground that the undisclosed materials were not material for <em>Brady </em>purposes. \u201cIn <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 373 U.S. 87, the United States Supreme Court held that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused . . . violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution. To establish a <em>Brady </em>violation, the defendant must show that (1) the government suppressed evidence, (2) the suppressed evidence was favorable to the defendant, and (3) it was material [either to guilt or to punishment].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>254 Conn. 441, 452, 758 A.2d 824 (2000) \u201cThe United States Supreme Court ... in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985), [held] that undisclosed exculpatory evidence is material, and that constitutional error results from its suppression by the government, if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>supra, 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that Hamilton\u2019s memorandum undermined evidence presented by the state that the defendant was not remorseful. The memorandum indicated that Malchik had told Hamilton that the defendant was reluctant to talk about crimes outside of Connecticut because he wanted to be executed as soon as possible. The defendant concedes that this triple hearsay evidence of the defendant\u2019s state of mind ultimately was given to the jury, but argues that he was prejudiced by not being able to use the memorandum to cross-examine Malchik immediately on his testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>that the defendant had lied about committing murders outside the state of Connecticut and to cross-examine Griffin on his testimony that the defendant was not remorseful. He argues that recalling Malchik and Griffin to resume cross-examination would not have been effective because the jury could have assumed that the recall was attributable to a lack of preparation by defense counsel, or could have been \u201ctoo drained and exhausted by that time to give impeachment its due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">We conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the outcome would have been different if the defendant had been able to cross-examine Malchik and Griffin on the memorandum immediately after their testimony. First, the memorandum did not impeach Mal-chik\u2019s testimony that the defendant deceitfully had concealed the New York offenses at the time of his arrest and confession or Griffin\u2019s testimony that the defendant exhibited no remorse at that time. It showed only that, three years later, Malchik believed, on the basis of his contacts with the defendant in the interim, that the reason for his current reluctance to talk about the New York offenses was his desire to be prosecuted in Connecticut and executed as soon as possible. Accordingly, the evidentiary value of the memorandum was not significantly reduced because the defendant could not cross-examine Malchik and Griffin on it immediately. Second, the evidence was only weakly probative. The defendant\u2019s willingness to lie about the New York offenses at the time of his arrest in order to ensure that he was executed in Connecticut as soon as possible did not necessarily indicate remorse or concern for the families of the victims. A desire to die is not the same thing as remorse. Moreover, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant\u2019s expressed desire to be executed was not a genuine explanation for his previous lies.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Finally, if the defendant believed that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>was crucial to confront Malchik and Griffin with the memorandum, he could have done so. We are not persuaded by his arguments that the jury was likely either to make improper assumptions about the reasons for recalling the witnesses or to reject the evidence arbitrarily. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that there was no <em>Brady </em>violation with respect to the Hamilton memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the police statements and reports pertaining to the rape of K.G. and attempted rape of T.T. corroborated the defendant\u2019s claim that he suffered from sexual sadism. He argues that the evidence corroborated the ritualistic, repetitive and progressive nature of his assaultive conduct and undermined the state\u2019s theory that the defendant had learned how to fake the symptoms of sexual sadism during his incarceration after his arrest. The jury already had heard detailed descriptions of the New York offenses, however, and the state never had disputed that the defendant had a long and ghastly history of accosting vulnerable young women who happened to cross his path, dragging them to secluded spots, forcibly restraining them, forcing them to perform oral sex, raping them and, on eight occasions, strangling them to death. Rather, it contested the credibility of the defendant\u2019s claims that his ability to control this conduct was significantly impaired and that he derived sexual pleasure from the act of strangulation. The details contained in the police reports did not add appre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>ciably to the credibility of these claims. Moreover, the defendant himself argued that the evidence was not sufficient to establish that he had assaulted K.G. and, by implication, T.T. Accordingly, we conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the admission of the police reports corroborating the defendant\u2019s undisputed criminal history would have resulted in a different outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Finally, we address the defendant\u2019s claim that the police reports undermined the state\u2019s contention that he had killed the victims to avoid detection. First, he argues that the reports showed that he had assaulted two women in New York but did not kill them to eliminate them as witnesses. The police records show, however, that T.T. escaped from her attacker after she screamed \u201crape\u201d and a bystander ran to her rescue. The records also show that the person who raped K.G. approached her from behind and pulled her sweater over her face before he raped her. He explained to her that he did not want her to \u201cget a look at him in case there were questions or an investigation later.\u201d The rape occurred at about 10:30 p.m., when it was dark. The police complaint and report stated that K.G. \u201cwas unable to furnish [the police] with any description of the subject.\u201d She was able, however, to give a general description of the build and clothing of a man she had seen immediately before the rape and to tell the police that the rapist was tall, slender and smooth-faced. Thus, the reports contained only very weak evidence, at best, that the defendant deliberately had allowed victims who could have identified him to escape with their lives. We conclude, therefore, that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence could have resulted in a different outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The defendant also claims that the evidence showing that D.N.T.\u2019s body had been found fully clothed and that Malchik had told Hamilton that the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>redressed the body of a Connecticut victim corroborated his account that he had sexually assaulted Leslie S., whose body had been found fully clothed, and, therefore, supported his claim that he had killed her to satisfy his compulsive sexual urges and not to avoid detection. The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. Malchik testified at the second penalty phase that, immediately after the defendant was arrested in 1984, he had stated to the police on seventeen separate occasions that he had killed his victims to avoid being caught and sent to jail.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The defendant also specifically had denied to the police at that time that he had sexually assaulted Leslie S. and stated that he had killed her because, having killed April B., he \u201ccouldn\u2019t let her go.\u201d The defendant told Zonana in 1985 that Leslie S. had been the only murder victim whom he had not raped and that he had not raped her because he had been unable to maintain an erection. He also told Zonana that he believed that this murder was \u201cthe one that\u2019s going to hang me.\u201d Still later, after the first penalty phase, the defendant told Grayson that he had sodomized Leslie S. before killing her and had been too ashamed to admit it to the police. Grayson testified that he did not believe that that account was inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s statements to Zonana.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>As we previously have indicated, immediately after his arrest, the defendant had confessed to the rape and murder of two additional victims, Debby T. and Tammy W., in Windham county. Evidence introduced by the defendant at the penalty phase indicated that the bodies of these victims had been found fully clothed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We conclude that the materials pertaining to D.N.T. were cumulative of the evidence pertaining to the Wind-ham county murder victims, which tended to support the defendant\u2019s claim that the fact that Leslie S.\u2019s body had been found fully clothed did not prove that she had not been raped and, therefore, undermined the state\u2019s contention that the murders were solely motivated by the desire to avoid detection. In any event, if the defendant believed that the materials were crucial to his case, he had the opportunity to place them before the jury. He declined to do so. We conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that there would have been a different outcome if the defendant had had that opportunity at an earlier time.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the documents disclosed by the state to the defendant on March 16, 2000, were not material for <em>Brady </em>purposes. Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly denied the defendant\u2019s request for a life sentence, a mistrial and exclusion of the evidence for rebuttal purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">SUFFICIENCY CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">The defendant claims both that the evidence established a mitigating factor as a matter of law and that there was insufficient evidence to establish the aggravating factor. We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The Defendant\u2019s Claim that the Evidence Established the Mitigating Factors as a Matter of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence established his claimed statutory mitigating factors that: (1) \u201cat the time of the offenses, [the defendant\u2019s] mental capacity was significantly impaired but not so impaired as to constitute a defense to prosecution\u201d; and (2) \u201cat the time of the offenses, [the defendant\u2019s] ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was significantly impaired but not so impaired as to constitute a defense to prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Before turning to the evidence presented in support of. these mitigating factors, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cAlthough our review of the evidence in mitigation of the death penalty is a heightened one . . . we will not substitute our judgment or opinions for that of a reasonable jury. . . . Instead, we must determine whether the defendant\u2019s proof of a mitigating factor was so clear and so compelling that the jury, in the exercise of reasoned judgment, could not have rejected it.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>235 Conn. 206, 229, 663 A.2d 1026 (1995) <em>(Breton II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">In support of his claimed statutory mitigating factors, the defendant presented, among other evidence, testimony by Grayson that the defendant suffered from sexual sadism<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> and that his ability to control his actions was significantly impaired; testimony by Stanley KapuchinsM, a consulting psychiatrist to the Connecti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>cut department of correction, concerning his treatment of the defendant for sexual sadism; testimony by Robert Goodwin, also a consulting psychiatrist to the Connecticut department of correction, that the defendant suffered from sexual sadism, which significantly impaired his ability to control his actions; a report by Grayson in which he stated that Berlin<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> had diagnosed the defendant as a sexual sadist and that James Merikangas, a physician specializing in neurology and psychiatiy, had diagnosed him with brain abnormalities;<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Miller\u2019s report diagnosing the defendant as a sexual sadist and his letter stating that he could not testify that the defendant\u2019s psychopathology was not mitigating; and the videotape of interviews given by the defendant to a British journalist in 1994. He also introduced testimony by James O\u2019Brien, a pharmacologist, that Ritalin, a drug used by the defendant when he was a child, can impair development of impulse control.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Grayson testified at length about the defendant\u2019s background and histoiy and the progression of his claimed mental impairment. Grayson was retained to evaluate the defendant in 1999. He testified that, during the course of his evaluation, he heard reports from a number of sources, including the defendant, that both of the defendant\u2019s parents had physically and emotionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>abused him when he was a child. Specifically, Grayson heard that the defendant\u2019s father was cold and detached and beat the defendant with a board on a monthly basis. The defendant\u2019s mother was described as punitive, detached, angry, cold, manipulative and unpredictable. She spanked her children excessively and unjustifiably and locked them out of the house even during the winter. The defendant told Grayson that, when he was a young child, his mother would administer enemas to him, deprive him of access to the toilet, and then berate him when he soiled himself.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> She was briefly hospitalized twice for mental illness during the defendant\u2019s childhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">As a young child, the defendant had exhibited several symptoms of emotional turmoil, including bedwetting, sleepwalking, talking in his sleep, recurrent nightmares and trichotillomania, which is the compulsive desire to pull out one\u2019s hair. In early adolescence, the defendant was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder for which he was medicated with Ritalin. At that time, the defendant also started to have aggressive sexual fantasies and to engage in compulsive masturbation. At the age of fourteen, he was discovered rubbing his penis against a naked seven year old girl. He also had some form of sexual contact with his seven year old sister, for which he was hit with a board and forced to be his sister\u2019s \u201cslave\u201d for a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Grayson testified that, while the defendant was at Cornell, he had had a long-term sexual relationship with one woman during his freshman and sophomore years and with a second woman during his junior and senior years. When the second woman told him that she pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>viously had been raped, he began to develop violent sexual fantasies. Eventually, he was fantasizing about raping and killing women. At that point, he started to stalk women on the Cornell campus. By the end of his senior year, he had committed the rape of K.G., attempted rape of T.T. and rape-murder of D.N.T. After the murder, the defendant became extremely depressed and contemplated killing himself. Ultimately, he convinced himself that it would not happen again. Over the next three years, however, he assaulted and raped numerous women, eight of whom, including D.N.T., he strangled to death. The defendant was arrested in connection with two of these offenses, one of which had been committed in Illinois and the other in Ohio. He was convicted of unlawful restraint in connection with the Illinois incident and was fined $500 and sentenced to two years probation. He was convicted of assault in connection with the Ohio incident and was fined $1000 and sentenced to six months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Grayson testified that the defendant had told him that the strangulation of the women had been the most sexually gratifying part of the assaults. He also stated that he had obtained sexual gratification from degrading and humiliating the women. Grayson testified that he believed the defendant and that his history and symptoms were consistent with all of the literature on sexual sadism that he had read. He acknowledged that the defendant appeared to be quite intelligent, that he had had fifteen years since his arrest to learn about the symptoms of sexual sadism, and that there were serious inconsistencies between what the defendant had told him and what he had told the police in 1984. He concluded, however, that the defendant\u2019s cooperation with the police, his ongoing consensual sexual relationships with a number of women during the period when he was committing the assaults, the lack of any other history of criminal activity, the fact that he had not killed Vivian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>S. to avoid detection after raping her,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> his willingness to undergo a dangerous medical treatment and his responsiveness to that treatment all tended to support the genuineness of the defendant\u2019s account of his history and his symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Grayson testified that he agreed with the portion of Merikangas\u2019 report that stated that the medications taken by the defendant had been very effective. He did not feel that he was competent to evaluate Merikangas\u2019 opinion that the defendant\u2019s compulsive conduct was the consequence of physical biological brain abnormalities. He was concerned, however, that Merikangas\u2019 conclusion seemed to be based in part on an uncritical acceptance of everything that the defendant told him.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Kapuchinski testified that he treated the defendant from 1989 through 1994. In 1989, the defendant told him that he was engaging in compulsive masturbation involving fantasies of restraining and killing women and that he wanted to get rid of these obsessive thoughts. Kapuchinski believed that the defendant\u2019s prior diagnosis of sexual sadism was appropriate. He told the defendant that his symptoms might be treatable with Depo-Provera, a medication that reduces systemic testosterone and decreases sex drive. He also advised the defendant that the medication could cause any of numerous adverse side effects. At some point in 1989, the defendant started receiving the medication and, according to him, it controlled his fantasies for a time. In January 1990, the defendant told Kapuchinski that he was again having violent fantasies, and the dosage was increased. After receiving the increased dosage, the defendant reported that the violence of the fantasies had abated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>somewhat, but the fantasies had not stopped. The dosage was increased again in April, 1990. By November, 1991, the defendant reported having no violent sexual fantasies. In 1992, routine tests showed that the defendant had developed an abnormal liver function. The Depo-Provera was discontinued at that time, and the defendant later reported that the violent sexual fantasies had returned. In 1994, the defendant started taking another medication, Depo-Lupron, and he later reported that fantasies had again abated.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Kapuchinski testified that the successful treatment of the defendant with medication confirmed the diagnosis of sexual sadism. He also testified that he believed that the defendant was genuine in his reporting of his symptoms. Finally, he testified that, based on a reasonable medical probability, the defendant\u2019s repetitive assaultive behavior was the result of a combination of some congenital biological trait and his upbringing.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Goodwin testified that he had treated the defendant at various times between 1984 and 1987 and between 1990 and 1998. He agreed with the diagnosis of sexual sadism that had been made by other psychiatrists between 1987 and 1990. His agreement was based in part on the defendant\u2019s willingness to undertake radical pharmacological treatment that amounted to chemical castration and that had unpleasant and even highly dangerous side effects. Goodwin also testified that the defendant\u2019s statements to police that he had killed his victims in order to avoid detection were not inconsistent with his claim that he had killed them to achieve sexual gratification, because he could have killed for both reasons. He testified that, in his experience, people often have difficulty discussing sexual issues. The defendant eventually told Goodwin about his obsessive sexual fantasies, however, which the defendant described as \u201cliving with a noisy rambunctious roommate twenty-four hours a day, from whom there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>no escape.\u201d Goodwin believed the defendant because of the consistency of his reports to the various psychiatrists and because of his willingness to undertake a dangerous treatment program. Goodwin also believed that there was an impulsive and compulsive aspect to the defendant\u2019s assaultive behavior that was progressive and ultimately culminated in apparent indifference to the risk of being caught. In Goodwin\u2019s opinion, within a reasonable medical probability, the defendant\u2019s sexual sadism significantly impaired his ability to control his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The defendant stated in the videotaped interview with the British journalist that, when he had assaulted his victims, there had been \u201ca gradual building up and then a coming back down\u201d of his inability to control his acts. He did not believe that he was in control during the assaults, or that he could have stopped. His perception of what was occurring was \u201clike watching an old film\u201d that was spliced together and would \u201cjump.\u201d He felt that he \u201cwasn\u2019t a hundred percent there.\u201d It was not until the victims were dead that he fully realized that he had hurt and killed them. The defendant also stated that, when he started taking the Depo-Provera, it \u201cwas like a blind man being given eyes.\u201d The medication allowed him to get away from \u201cthe obnoxious roommate\u201d and become \u201chuman again.\u201d When he was forced to stop taking the medication because of the abnormal liver function, it was \u201cthe toughest year [he] ever had to go through\u201d because he started having thoughts about hurting women again. In particular, he fantasized about hurting a prison nurse who had been kind and helpful to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The state relied in part on its cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s witnesses to rebut the claimed statutory mitigating factors. Grayson testified on cross-examination that one of the discrepancies between the defendant\u2019s account to him of the crimes and his confession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>to the police was that he did not tell Grayson that he had become angry and \u201cblew up\u201d at Robyn S. and Wendy B. before attacking them. He acknowledged that a rape committed out of anger was not necessarily sexually sadistic. He also acknowledged that a murder committed to avoid detection would not be consistent with sexual sadism. Grayson indicated that the defendant had told him that he had read articles about sexual sadism that he had received from Berlin. Grayson also acknowledged that a criminal defendant \u201cmay well have a very real motive [for it] to appear\u201d that his crimes resulted from a mental disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The state also confronted Grayson with the videotaped interviews of the defendant by Zonana, which Grayson had never seen before. The defendant told Zonana that he had not raped Leslie S. and stated, \u201cThat\u2019s the one that\u2019s going to hang me.\u201d The defendant also told Zonana that he \u201cusually had an orgasm fairly quickly, and that was it. Then I strangled them and killed them. I think\u2014I think that helped me work up to get mad too, more, because I wasn\u2019t\u2014wasn\u2019t satisfied, like, you know, I don\u2019t think it really satisfied me. If I want sex, I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t go for something like that. I had much better sex at home.\u201d Grayson acknowledged that it was possible that the defendant killed the victims out of anger and not for sexual gratification. He also acknowledged that that conclusion was bolstered by the defendant\u2019s statement to Zonana that the rape and murder of April B. and Leslie S. had been preceded by \u201ca hell of a fight\u201d with his girlfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The state also asked Grayson about the defendant\u2019s description to Zonana of the New York crimes and his statement that he had not told Walter Borden, a psychiatrist, about those crimes immediately because they had preceded his parents\u2019 divorce and he had \u201cfirst blamed everything on the divorce.\u201d Grayson acknowledged that nothing in the defendant\u2019s description of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>those crimes suggested that he had obtained sexual gratification from the act of strangulation. He also acknowledged that the defendant\u2019s lack of truthfulness about committing the crimes would justify a raised level of skepticism about his other claims. The state also asked Grayson about the defendant\u2019s statement to Zonana that he had not told his psychiatrists or lawyers about the crimes he committed in other states because he did not want to be prosecuted in those states and still hoped \u201csomeday, maybe if [he was] really lucky, [to] be out of this slum hole.\u201d Grayson acknowledged that that statement showed that the defendant could be manipulative in order to achieve his own ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In support of its rebuttal case, the state also presented testimony by Michael Lajoie, an officer with the department of correction, who had had frequent contact with the defendant when he was imprisoned at the Connecticut correctional institution in Somers after he was sentenced to death in the first penalty phase in 1987. The defendant was under \u201cone-to-one\u201d supervision for about one year and his activities were recorded in a log book every fifteen minutes. Lajoie testified that, if the defendant had masturbated during that period, a report would have been made and that he knew of no such reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The defendant contends that, in light of this evidence, no reasonable jury could have rejected his claimed statutory mitigating factors. He points out that the state presented no expert testimony to contradict the testimony of his expert psychiatrists that he suffered from sexual sadism and that his ability to control his conduct was significantly impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">We repeatedly have held, however, that the state is not required to offer independent evidence to rebut the existence of mitigating factors, but \u201ccan weaken the force of the defendant\u2019s presentation by cross-examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>tion and by pointing to inconsistencies in the evidence. . . . Furthermore, the general rule that a [finder of fact] is free either to accept or reject, in whole or in part, the evidence presented by the defendant\u2019s witnesses . . . has particular applicability where, as here, the state has vigorously contested the force of that testimony by cross-examination. . . . [T]he credibility of the defendant\u2019s expert and lay witnesses, and the weight to be given to their testimony regarding the existence of mitigating factors, [moreover] is a matter committed to the sound judgment and common sense of the trier of fact.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 490-91, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000) <em>(Cobb II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">We conclude that, in this case, the evidence in support of the claimed statutory mitigating factors was not so compelling that the jury could not reasonably have rejected it. As the trial court aptly stated, the credibility of the defendant\u2019s representations to his psychiatric experts and others was \u201cthe crux of the case.\u201d There was ample evidence that the defendant had been deceitful and inconsistent in his accounts to the police, his lawyers and his psychiatrists. For example, the defendant originally concealed from the police the fact that he had committed two murders outside the state of Connecticut and, after those murders ultimately were revealed, gave conflicting explanations for his deception; he told the police and Zonana that he had not raped Leslie S. but, after the first penalty phase, told Grayson that he had sodomized her; he told the police that he had killed the victims to avoid detection but, again after the first penalty phase, told Grayson that strangulation was the ultimate sexual gratification for him; he told the police that he \u201cblew up\u201d at certain victims but did not reveal to Grayson that he had been angry with them; and he told his psychiatrists that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>compulsively masturbated but never was seen masturbating by prison personnel. The jury was not required to accept the defendant\u2019s explanations for these discrepancies and reasonably could have concluded that he had lied and selectively revealed the truth and that his motive for doing so was self-preservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">There was also evidence that the defendant had had the motive and opportunity to educate himself about the symptoms of sexual sadism and that, as his accounts of his background and the offenses changed over the course of time, they increasingly reflected those symptoms. Moreover, even if the jury accepted the evidence that the defendant suffered from sexual sadism, it reasonably could have rejected the opinions of his experts that his ability to restrain himself from acting out his sexually sadistic fantasies was significantly impaired. Those opinions were the product of subjective judgment and were based in large part on unverifiable reports by the defendant as to his own state of mind. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that his claimed statutory mitigating factors were established as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s claim pertaining to his claimed nonstatutory mitigating factors. Before reviewing the evidence in support of these mitigating factors, we briefly review the applicable law. Under General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-46a (d), the sen-tencer must engage in a two step process to determine whether the defendant has proved a nonstatutory mitigating factor. First, it is asked to \u201cdetermine whether a particular factor concerning the defendant\u2019s character, background or history, or the nature and circumstances of the crime, has been established by the evidence . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-46a (d). Then, as to any such facts proven, the sentencer \u201cshall determine further whether that factor is mitigating in nature, considering all the facts and circumstances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the case . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-46a (d). The standard for our review of both steps in this process is the same as for statutory mitigating factors, i.e., whether the proof \u201cwas so clear and so compelling that the [sentencer], in the exercise of reasoned judgment, could not have rejected it.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>264 Conn. 327, 369-70, 824 A.2d 778, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1055, 124 S. Ct. 819, 157 L. Ed. 2d 708 (2003) <em>(Breton III).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The defendant claimed fourteen nonstatutory mitigating factors. See footnote 7 of this opinion. He called several witnesses to testify as to his productive postin-carceration conduct, including his good behavior in prison, his participation in a prison program to help the blind, his publication of numerous articles about sexual sadism and the death penalty, his correspondence with other people about treatment options for sexual sadism, and his willingness to be a subject of study to increase psychiatric knowledge of violent sex offenders. He also called numerous witnesses to testify that he had expressed remorse and concern for the families of his victims, he had attempted to kill himself and seemed to welcome death, and he had attempted to enter a stipulation seeking execution in order to spare the victims\u2019 families the pain of a penalty hearing. He also presented evidence in support of his claimed mitigating factors that he had worked hard throughout his life and put himself through college with his earnings, he had cooperated with police, he was serving two consecutive life sentences for the two Windham county murders, and his religious faith had grown while he was in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>In rebuttal, the state presented, among other evidence, testimony by Robert Bardelli, a detective with the state police, that he had escorted the defendant to court for sentencing on his plea of nolo contendere to the two Windham county murders and that the defendant appeared to be carefree, nonchalant and easygoing. The defendant asked Bardelli if he would shoot him if he tried to run away and, when Bardelli failed to answer, \u201csmirked\u201d at Bardelli and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it, I\u2019m going to write a book and give it to my father and become a millionaire.\u201d The state also entered into evidence a newspaper article authored by the defendant in which he wrote, \u201cPart of the reason I can\u2019t forgive myself is that I have never really felt any remorse toward the women I have killed.\u201d The defendant also wrote, however, that he recognized the pain suffered by the victims\u2019 families. The state presented testimony by Lajoie that the defendant was cunning and manipulative with the prison staff and appeared to enjoy his celebrity status.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">After careful review of the record, we are persuaded that the evidence in support of the claimed nonstatutory mitigating factors was not so clear and compelling that the jury could not have rejected it. Even if it is assumed that one or more of the factors were factually proven, the evidence left ample room for the jury to determine that, \u201cconsidering all the facts and circumstances of the case,\u201d any such proven facts did not \u201cextenuate or reduce the degree of [the defendant\u2019s] culpability or blame for the offense or . . . otherwise constitute a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-46a (d). Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The Defendant\u2019s Claim that There Was Insufficient Evidence in Support of the Aggravating Factor</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The defendant next claims that there was insufficient evidence that the capital offenses were committed in an especially cruel, heinous or depraved manner within the meaning of General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-46a (h) (4). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The defendant makes two arguments in support of this claim. First, he argues that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, \u00a7 53a-46a (h) (4) requires the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally inflicted extreme pain or torture beyond that necessarily accompanying <em>each of the elements </em>of each capital offense of which he was convicted and that it failed to do so. Second, he claims that, even if the statute does not require each element of the offense to be accompanied by intentional conduct resulting in extreme pain or torture, the evidence was not sufficient to establish that the murders were committed in an especially cruel, heinous or depraved manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">With respect to the first claim, we note that the defendant did not submit a request to charge the jury that the state must prove that each component of each capital offense, i.e., both the kidnapping and the murder for the kidnap-murder charges and both the sexual assault and the murder for the sexual assault-murder charges, was committed in an especially cruel, heinous or depraved manner.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Nor has he provided any authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>for the proposition that the state or federal constitution requires such a charge. Accordingly, this claim was not preserved and is not reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Even if the claim were preserved, however, it is meritless. This court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 551-59, 816 A.2d 562 (2003), that the state need prove only that one murder in a multiple murder is aggravated, was based in large part on its interpretation of subdivision (5) and what had been subdivision (7) but is now subdivision (6) of \u00a7 53a-54b, that the state need prove only that the murder in a Mdnap-murder or sexual-assault murder was aggravated in order to establish the aggravating factor.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence presented by the state was not sufficient to prove that he committed the murders in an especially cruel, heinous or depraved manner. \u201cThe standard governing our review of sufficiency of evidence claims is well established. We first review the evidence presented at trial, construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the facts . . . impliedly found by the jury. We then decide whether, upon the facts thus established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the trial court or the jury could reasonably have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>228 Conn. 118, 127, 635 A.2d 762 (1993). \u201cIn a review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of an aggravating factor under \u00a7 53a-46a (h) (4) . . . the focus must be on whether the state has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant engaged in intentional conduct that inflicted extreme physical or psychological pain or torture on each of his victims above and beyond that necessarily accompanying the underlying killing.\u201d <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 262. \u201c[B]ecause of the seriousness of any death penalty determination, we will subject a finding of an aggravating factor to the same independent and scrupulous examination of the entire record that we employ in our review of constitutional fact-finding, such as the voluntariness of a confession . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. With respect to the murder of Wendy B., the defendant told police that she had screamed and fought after he grabbed her and that he threatened to hurt her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>if she did not stop. She complied with his demand and pleaded with him not to hurt her. He then led her into the woods, raped her and told her to turn over onto her stomach. She continued to struggle as he strangled her to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Malchik testified that the defendant had told him that his hands had cramped as he strangled both Wendy B. and Robyn S. and that he had had to reapply his grip.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Both victims were \u201cmoving and writhing\u201d as he strangled them and the defendant stated that he had found Robyn S. to be \u201cstrong.\u201d The defendant also had told police that Robyn S. had been \u201ca hundred percent unwilling\u201d to engage in sex but that he had been able to force her because he was \u201cbigger and stronger\u201d and had intimidated her.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">With respect to April B. and Leslie S., the defendant stated to the police that he had picked them up while they were hitchhiking. They asked him to drive them to a certain gas station, but when they arrived there, the defendant refused to stop the car. At that point, April B. pulled a steak knife out of her pocket and threatened to stab the defendant if he did not stop. The defendant stated that he yelled at her and nearly drove off the road, at which point she \u201cpanicked\u201d and gave him the knife. He then drove to a remote area, parked the car and told both victims to get in the backseat. He tied up Leslie S. with an elastic belt she had been wearing. He then took April B. out of the car. During the incident, April B. was \u201cmouthy\u201d and struggled with the defendant, but Leslie S. urged her \u201cto do exactly everything he wanted [her] to do.\u201d He forced April B. to remove her jeans and cut the jeans into strips with the steak knife. He tied her hands and feet with the strips <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>and then returned to Leslie S. and tied her feet. The jury heard evidence that he then placed Leslie S. in the trunk of the car. At that point, he raped April B. and then strangled her to death. The jury heard evidence that the defendant did not tell Leslie S. that he had killed April B. It also saw a videotape in which the defendant told a journalist that he put April B.\u2019s body in the front seat of the car after killing her. He then took Leslie S. out of the car, placed her on the ground and strangled her.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The jury also heard evidence that the defendant\u2019s intention was to degrade, to humiliate and to subjugate his victims when he forced them to disrobe and sexually assaulted them and that he derived satisfaction from the act of strangulation. Grayson reported that the defendant had told him: \u201cIf I shot them in the head or stabbed them it would\u2019ve been out of character with the power and degradation. . . . Also, shooting them would be too quick.\u201d The jury also heard evidence that the defendant had acknowledged that all of his victims had suffered and that he had \u201csadistically brutalized and murdered\u201d them.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">We conclude that the jury reasonably could have determined that the cumulative effect of this evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of an aggravating factor as defined by \u00a7 53a-46a (h) (4) for each of the six capital felony counts with which the defendant was charged. As we noted in <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 262-63, \u201c[t]he jury reasonably could have found, for each of the defendant\u2019s four victims in the circumstances of these cases, that their manual strangulation by the defendant was an especially cruel way of inflicting death.\u201d The jury also could have inferred that the defendant chose that method of killing for that very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>reason.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The jury also reasonably could have found that, \u201c[i]n the cases of Wendy B. and Robyn S., the defendant\u2019s cruelty was exacerbated when their strangulation was prolonged by the cramping of the defendant\u2019s hands, which caused him to stop before resuming the strangulation.\u201d Id., 263. Although the jury heard evidence at the second penalty phase that the defendant had denied stopping mid-killing and then reapplying his grip, the jury was not required to credit that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Moreover, from the evidence presented at the second penalty phase hearing, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the defendant sexually assaulted all of the victims, including Leslie S. As we stated in <em>Ross II, </em>\u201cthe jury reasonably could have inferred that the victims\u2019 terror would have been increased by the defendant\u2019s sexual assaults upon them.\u201d Id. If the jury determined that the defendant had not sexually assaulted Leslie S., it \u201creasonably could have found that she would have been terrified by sitting in the defendant\u2019s car, bound hand and foot, and coming to understand that her best friend April B., was being sexually abused and then killed.\u201d Id. Although there was evidence that the defendant had not told Leslie S. that he had killed April B., the jury reasonably could have found that, as she waited, bound hand and foot, in the trunk of the defendant\u2019s car and listened to April B.\u2019s struggles and protests, Leslie S. knewthefate ofher friend without having been informed of it by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Finally, as we did in <em>Ross II, </em>we reject the defendant\u2019s claims that his conduct was not \u201cespecially heinous, cruel or depraved,\u201d as a matter of law, \u201cbecause his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>conduct did not go beyond that which is necessarily encompassed by the capital felonies of which he was convicted.\u201d Id. On the basis of the evidence presented at the second penalty phase, \u201cthe jury reasonably could have found an aggravating factor for each of these capital felony counts [with respect to Wendy B. and Robyn S.] because of the proof of an added element from the other [capital] felony count. . . . With respect to April B. [and Leslie S., their] sexual assault by the defendant was likewise an aggravating factor above and beyond the kidnapping and the murder that were elements in the capital felony as charged.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 264. Even if the jury determined that the defendant had not sexually assaulted Leslie S., it reasonably could have found that \u201can aggravating factor of special cruelty was the exacerbated psychological anguish inflicted upon her by her own bondage and her fear for the fate of her best friend.\u201d Id. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">JURY CHARGE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The defendant next challenges certain juiy charges given by the trial court. As a preliminary matter, we set forth the standard of review governing each of these claims. \u201cThe standard of review for constitutional claims of improper jury instructions is well settled. In determining whether it was . . . reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, the charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied ... is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>that no injustice will result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Respass, </em>256 Conn. 164, 182, 770 A.2d 471, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1002, 122 S. Ct. 478, 151 L. Ed. 2d 392 (2001). We address each of the defendant\u2019s claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s jury charge and the language of the special verdict form submitted to the jury pursuant to \u00a7 53a-46a (e) deprived him of his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict on the mitigating factors. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">We first address the state\u2019s claim that this issue was not preserved for review. The state argues that the defendant conceded at trial that the verdict form conformed to applicable law and was proper. We conclude that we need not determine whether the claim was preserved because, in light of \u201cheightened reliability demanded by the Eighth Amendment in the determination whether the death penalty is appropriate\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>207 Conn. 374, 389, 542 A.2d 306 (1988); the claim is reviewable pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 233. We also conclude, however, that the claim fails under the third prong of the <em>Golding </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">This court concluded in <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 374, that, in light of the \u201cheightened reliability demanded by the Eighth Amendment in the determination whether the death penalty is appropriate\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 389; \u201cthe imposition of the death penalty under \u00a7 53a-46a (e) must be premised on two unanimous findings by the trier of fact: that the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that an aggravating factor exists and that the defendant has not proved by a preponderance of the evidence that a mitigating factor exists.\u201d Id., 394. \u201cThus, the death penalty cannot be imposed under \u00a7 53a-46a (e) unless each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>and every juror finds that the defendant failed to prove the existence of each and every mitigating factor by a preponderance of the evidence. ... If one or more of the jurors believe that the defendant has proven a mitigating factor but the other jurors disagree, a hung jury results.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Breton II, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In <em>Breton II, </em>the defendant challenged a special verdict form that provided, as one of two alternative answers to the question whether the defendant had proved a mitigating factor, <em>\u201cNo, </em>we the jury do not unanimously agree that the [defendant proved this mitigating factor by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 237. The defendant argued that the language was ambiguous as to whether the jury must unanimously reject each mitigating factor or whether it must reject each factor if it merely was unable to agree as to whether the defendant had proved it. Id., 238. We agreed that the form could have misled the jury to believe that it could reject a mitigating factor even if one or more jurors had concluded that the factor had been proven and, accordingly, we reversed the verdict. Id., 239. We also stated that a special verdict form using the language, \u201c \u2018No, we unanimously conclude that the defendant has not proved the existence of a mitigating factor,\u2019 \u201d would have sufficed to protect the defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous finding. Id., 240 n.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The special verdict form in the present case provided as follows for each of the six capital felony counts: \u201cDID THE DEFENDANT MICHAEL B. ROSS PROVE BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE ANY MITIGATING FACTOR:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">\u201c_YES. After having considered all of the mitigating factors listed by the defendant and any other suggested by the evidence, we, the juiy, unanimously find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>that the defendant HAS PROVED by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of a mitigating factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">\u201c_NO. After having considered all the mitigating factors listed by the defendant and any others suggested by the evidence, we, the jury, unanimously find that the defendant HAS NOT PROVED by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of any mitigating factors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">The verdict form provided signature lines for each of the twelve jurors after each finding. Each of the jurors signed the form indicating that they unanimously agreed that the defendant had not proved any mitigating factor for each of the six counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Inexplicably, the defendant claims that \u201c[t]he special verdict form in this case is phrased identically to the one at issue in <em>Breton [II].\u201d </em>To the contrary, the verdict form in this case conforms to the language that this court explicitly <em>endorsed </em>in <em>Breton II. </em>The defendant has not explained, and we cannot conceive, how this language indicating that the jury <em>unanimously </em>had agreed that the defendant had not proved <em>any </em>mitigating factor could have misled a reasonable jury to believe that, if any of the jurors found that a mitigating factor had been proven, all of the jurors nevertheless should sign the verdict form. Accordingly, we conclude that the form adequately protected the defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous jury verdict. Because we conclude that the special verdict form was not defective, we also reject the defendant\u2019s claims that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on this issue, which essentially reinforced the language of the special verdict form, \u201cexacerbated\u201d the claimed error.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>The defendant also claims that, under <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>486 U.S. 367, 108 S. Ct. 1860, 100 L. Ed. 2d 384 (1988), and <em>McKoy </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>494 U.S. 433, 110 S. Ct. 1227, 108 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1990), the trial court was required to instruct the jury that if it was unable to answer \u201cyes\u201d to the question of whether the defendant had proved a mitigating factor, it did not have to answer \u201cno.\u201d See <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 378-79 n.11 (noting that trial court had not instructed jury that if it could not reach unanimity to answer \u201cyes\u201d to question whether defendant had established mitigating factor, it could do something other than answer \u201cno\u201d). The verdict form found defective in <em>Mills </em>had the same defect as the verdict form in <em>Breton II, </em>however, in that it did not unambiguously indicate that the answer \u201cno\u201d had to be predicated on the unanimous finding of the jury that the defendant had not proved any mitigating factor. Instead, the form improperly raised \u201cthe probable inference that \u2018no\u2019 is the opposite of \u2018yes,\u2019 and therefore the appropriate answer to reflect an inability to answer a question in the affirmative.\u201d Id., 378. Nothing in <em>Mills </em>suggests that, if a verdict form unambiguously provides that, in order to answer \u201cno,\u201d the jury must unanimously find that the defendant had not proved any mitigating factor, the court is required to instruct the jury that, if it does not unanimously find that no mitigating factor has been proved, it is not required to answer \u201cno.\u201d Indeed, merely to state this proposition is to reveal its absurdity. Confronted with such a verdict form, no reasonable jury could believe that it was <em>permitted, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>much less <em>required, </em>to answer \u201cno\u201d in the absence of a unanimous finding that no mitigating factor had been proved. Therefore, having concluded that the special verdict form in this case unambiguously informed the jury of the requirement for unanimity, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The defendant also appears to claim that the verdict form and jury instructions were defective because they did not inform the jury what would happen in the event that they were unable to come to a unanimous agreement as to whether a mitigating factor had been proved.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> In the complete absence of any claim that an instruction on what would happen if the jurors were unable to come to a unanimous agreement was necessary because the jury had been misled on that issue, we disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim. A requirement that the jury be instructed on the consequences of a deadlock has no basis either in our statutes or in the constitution. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>527 U.S. 373, 381-82, 119 S. Ct. 2090, 144 L. Ed. 2d 370 (1999) (rejecting claim that eighth amendment requires that jury in capital sentencing proceeding be instructed in consequences of deadlock). Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the meaning of reasonable doubt in violation of his rights to due process and a jury trial under the federal and state constitutions. Specifically, he challenges the trial court\u2019s instruction that reasonable doubt is not \u201ca doubt suggested by ingenuity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>counsel .... [It] is such a doubt as would cause reasonable men and women to hesitate to act upon it in matters of importance. ... It is ... a real doubt, an honest doubt ... a doubt that is honestly entertained and is reasonable in light of the evidence after a careful comparison and careful examination of all the evidence.\u201d The state argues that the defendant\u2019s challenges to the trial court\u2019s instructions on the burden of proof were not preserved because the defendant failed to object to the instructions at trial. The defendant counters that the claims were preserved by his submission of a request to charge on the issue of burden of proof. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\u201cIt is well settled . . . that a party may preserve for appeal a claim that an instruction . . . was . . . defective either by: (1) submitting a written request to charge covering the matter; or (2) taking an exception to the charge as given.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>261 Conn. 156, 170, 801 A.2d 788 (2002); see also Practice Book \u00a7 16-20.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he purpose of the [preservation requirement] is to alert the court to any claims of error while there is still an opportunity for correction in order to avoid the economic waste and increased court congestion caused by unnecessary retrials.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>supra, 170; see also <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Kibbe, </em>431 U.S. 145, 154, 97 S. Ct. 1730, 52 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1977) (\u201c[o]rderly procedure requires that the respective adversaries\u2019 views as to how the jury should be instructed be presented to the trial judge in time to enable him to deliver an accurate charge and to minimize the risk of committing reversible error\u201d). Thus, the essence of the preservation requirement is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>that <em>fair notice </em>be given to the trial court of the party\u2019s view of the governing law and of any disagreement that the party may have had with the charge actually given.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">We have recognized that \u201ca request to charge addressed to the subject matter generally, but which omits an instruction on a specific component, [does not preserve] a claim that the trial court\u2019s instruction regarding that component was defective.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 170-71. Similarly, we now conclude that a request to charge that provides a party\u2019s version of generally applicable law, such as the burden of proof, on which the court is bound to instruct the jury regardless of whether a charge is requested, does not necessarily preserve a claim that the instruction actually given on that issue was defective. The trial court should not be required to choose between adopting a party\u2019s presumably self-serving version of the law wholesale and relinquishing any expectation that it will be notified by that party of errors in the charge actually given.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">We note that the defendant\u2019s request to charge in the present case, together with two supplemental requests to charge filed by him, comprised some seventy-two typewritten pages, several pages of which were single spaced, covering virtually every aspect of the case. It would be unfair, unrealistic and counterproductive to conclude that the filing of such a request to charge absolved the defendant of any obligation to take exception to the charge as given in order to preserve an issue for appeal. Accordingly, we conclude that the request to charge, which addressed the applicable burden of proof generally and which alerted the court to specific language that the defendant would find objectionable, but which did not address the language that he now challenges,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> was not sufficient to preserve this claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Nor can the defendant prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 233, because he cannot demonstrate that the challenged instructions were constitutionally infirm. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>256 Conn. 193, 201-202, 770 A.2d 491 (2001) (Rejecting constitutional challenge to instruction that \u201creasonable doubt is a doubt which is something more than a guess or a surmise.

Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly charged the jury that the defendant was required to prove that his \u201cability to <em>control </em>his conduct to the requirements of the law was significantly impaired,\u201d rather than \u201chis ability to <em>conform </em>his conduct.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-46a (g) (2). He argues that the instruction unlawfully added to his burden of proof. The state argues that the claim was not preserved because the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>did not take exception to this instruction.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> He did, however, file a specific request to charge on the issue. Accordingly, we conclude that the claim was preserved. We also conclude, however, that it is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In support of his claim, the defendant points out that Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201ccontrol\u201d as \u201cto exercise restraining or directing influence over . . . have power over\u201d; and defines \u201cconform\u201d as \u201cto be obedient: comply . . . act in accordance with prevailing standard or custom.\u201d Thus, the defendant implicitly claims that, under these definitions, it would have been possible for the jury to find that, at the time of the offense, the defendant\u2019s ability to \u201ccontrol,\u201d i.e., \u201cto exercise restraining or directing influence over,\u201d his conduct within the requirements of the law <em>was not </em>impaired even though his ability to \u201cconform,\u201d his conduct to the requirements of the law, or \u201cto be obedient [to or] comply\u201d with those requirements, <em>was </em>impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Although we recognize that the trial court generally should use the language of \u00a7 53a-46a (g) (2) in instructing the jury on the statutory mitigating factor, we cannot conclude that it is reasonably possible that the court\u2019s minor misstatement, involving such a tenu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>ous semantic distinction, could have misled the jury. This is especially so under the circumstances of this case. The defendant\u2019s entire theory of mitigation was that his ability to conform his conduct to the governing law was impaired <em>because </em>his ability to control his sadistic impulses was impaired. Indeed, defense counsel stated at closing argument that \u201cthe question for [the jury], again on the issue of control, is whether or not [the defendant\u2019s] ability to control was significantly impaired. . . . But it\u2019s not [that] he absolutely had no control, the question was, was his ability to control significantly impaired?\u201d Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly used a verdict form that did not indicate for each non-statutory mitigating factor whether the jury had found the factual basis for the mitigating factor proved. He argues that the alleged defect rendered the jury\u2019s findings unreviewable. We recently rejected an identical claim in <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 138, and see no reason to reconsider that decision here. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly failed to give his requested charge that he would never be released from prison if the jury did not return a verdict of death. In support of this claim, he argues that he had a due process right that the jury be informed that it was not necessary to sentence him to death in order to protect society from him. See <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>512 U.S. 154, 169, 114 S. Ct. 2187, 129 L. Ed. 2d 133 (1994) (defendant has due process right to rebut claim of future dangerousness by informing jury that he will be ineligible for parole). We conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>that, under the circumstances of the present case, this claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The following facts and procedural histoiy are relevant to our resolution of this claim. The defendant requested a jury charge that \u201c[c]onsecutive life sentences in the present cases may ... be imposed consecutively to the 120 years<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> for a total of 480 years.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> As a consequence of consecutive life sentences, [the defendant] will be incarcerated until he dies in prison.\u201d As part of its instructions on the aggravating factor, the trial court instructed the jury that, if it failed to find an aggravating factor, \u201cthe defendant will be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release . . . .\u201d On several other occasions, it instructed the jury that a finding that no aggravating factor had been proved or that a mitigating factor had been proved would result in a sentence of \u201clife imprisonment\u201d on the applicable count or counts. The defendant did not take an exception to these instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Dining jury deliberations, the jury requested that the court reread its instructions on the aggravating factor. After the instructions were read to the jury by the court clerk, the trial court and the parties realized that the court erroneously had instructed the jury that the defendant would be sentenced to \u201clife, without the possibility of release.\u201d Defense counsel argued that the court should not correct the instructions. He stated that \u201c[o]ur position would be do nothing for a couple [of] good reasons. The first reason is it\u2019s clear throughout the charge that we\u2019re talking about life imprisonment, not life without release. The second reason is we all kind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>of agree, it makes no difference, even [the state\u2019s attorney] in the postremand transcripts of 1998 indicated life without the possibility of release in this case .... I don\u2019t think this verdict is going to turn one way or another based on the wording that was isolated in one paragraph that we all forgot to delete. . . . We all know [the defendant] is never going to go home. We all agree with that. I think we should leave it alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">We conclude that any claim that the jury could have been misled by the court\u2019s instructions to believe that the defendant could be released from prison was waived by the defendant when he implicitly conceded that, although the charge actually given was erroneous, it was at least as favorable to him as the charge that he had requested, and, when he expressly declined to request a corrective instruction. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury that he was not required to establish a causal nexus between his impaired mental capacity and the commission of the offenses.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> We reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Whether \u00a7 53a-46a (g) (2) requires a nexus between the mental impairment and the commission of the offense is a question of statutory interpretation over which our review is plenary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>March, </em>265 Conn. 697, 705, 830 A.2d 212 (2003). The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>argues that the language of \u00a7 53a-46a (g) (2) merely requires the defendant to establish that \u201cat the time of the offense ... his mental capacity was significantly impaired\u201d and does not require a causal nexus between that impairment and the commission of the offense.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> The state counters that the language and structure of \u00a7 53a-46a (g) indicate that the mitigating factor of subdivision (2) must be tied to the commission of the offense. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">First, we note that all of the other statutory mitigating factors set forth in \u00a7 53a-46a (g) are predicated on the defendant\u2019s reduced moral culpability for committing the offense.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> We also note that the deterrent purpose of the death penalty statute would not be advanced by imposing the penalty on defendants who can establish any of these factors. See <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 320, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335 (2002) (\u201cthe same cognitive and behavioral impairments that make these defendants less morally culpable . . . also make it less likely that they can process the information of the possibility of execution as a penalty and, as a result, control their conduct based upon that information\u201d). Thus, the general thrust of the statute as a whole persuades us that the legislature intended to recognize as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>mitigating, per se, only those factors that tend to reduce a defendant\u2019s moral culpability for the offense and make it unlikely that the threat of execution would serve as an effective deterrent.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Second, \u00a7 53a-46a(g) (2) requires that the impairment to the defendant\u2019s mental capacity exist \u201cat the time of the offense\u201d and provides that, under both prongs of the subsection, the defendant\u2019s mental state need not be \u201cso impaired ... as to constitute a defense to pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>ecution . . . .\u201d This strongly suggests that both prongs constitute lesser degrees of the types of mental impairment that must be proved in order to establish a complete defense to the prosecution under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13 (a),<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> i.e., that at the time of the offense, the defendant had a substantial cognitive or volitional disability that had a causal nexus to his commission of the offense. In other words, the phrase \u201cmental capacity\u201d as used in \u00a7 53a-46a (g) (2) is not an open-ended term referring to any and all types of mental function, but refers specifically to the defendant\u2019s ability, at the time of the offense, to understand the wrongful nature and the consequences of his conduct. Accordingly, we conclude that the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting \u00a7 53a-46a (g) was to specify the factual circumstances under which a defendant\u2019s moral culpability for committing the offense is reduced.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>In the present case, the defendant asked the trial court to instruct the jury that it could find: (1) that his mental capacity was significantly impaired because he suffered from sexual sadism; (2) that his sexual sadism did not cause him to commit the offenses; and (3) that the sexual sadism was, nevertheless, mitigating per se. In other words, the defendant wished to inform the jury that it could find that: (1) his predilection for kidnapping, raping and strangling vulnerable young women constituted a significant impairment to his mental capacity; (2) this mental impairment did not significantly affect his ability to understand the wrongfulness of his conduct or to refrain from engaging in it; and (3) the impairment, nevertheless, met the requirements of \u00a7 53a-46a (g) (2). Even without the foregoing statutory analysis, it is difficult to see how such a result could be anything but bizarre. We cannot conceive in what <em>possible sense </em>such a mental condition could be understood as mitigating. In any event, our conclusion that, in order to establish either prong of the mitigating factor of subdivision (2) of \u00a7 53a-46a (g), the defendant must show that his mental impairment had a causal nexus with the offense, thereby reducing his moral culpability, leaves no doubt that this claim is meritless. A significant mental impairment that does not affect the defendant\u2019s ability to understand the consequences or wrongfulness of his conduct or to refrain from engaging in it does not have a causal connection to or reduce his moral culpability for it and, therefore, does not meet the statutory requirement. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly refused to give the instruction requested by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>G</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that the state and its people looked to the jury to return death sentences if the facts and law required such a verdict. He argues that the law never requires a verdict of death. We disagree. If the jury found an aggravating factor, in accordance with the instructions of the court, and no mitigating factor, again in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions, then the law required it to return a verdict of death, and this state and its people were entitled to that verdict. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">H</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The remaining instructional claims of the defendant are addressed in part VI B of this opinion (claim that trial court improperly failed to instruct jury that each component of offense must be aggravated); part VIIIA of this opinion (claim that trial court improperly instructed jury on \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d language of statutory mitigating factors); and part VIII C of this opinion (claim that trial court improperly instructed jury on aggravating factor).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">The defendant raises several claims that this state\u2019s death penalty statute violates the federal and state constitutions. The standard of review for challenges to the constitutionality of a statute is well established. \u201c[T]he party attacking a validly enacted statute . . . bears the heavy burden of proving its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt and we indulge in every presumption in favor of the statute\u2019s constitutionality. ... In choosing between two constructions of a statute, one valid and one constitutionally precarious, we will search for an effective and constitutional construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>that reasonably accords with the legislature\u2019s underlying intent. . . . We undertake this search for a constitutionally valid construction when confronted with criminal statutes as well as with civil statutes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 236. We address each of the defendant\u2019s constitutional claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The defendant claims that the language of \u00a7 53a-46a (d)<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> requiring the sentencer to determine whether a claimed mitigating factor \u201cis mitigating in nature, <em>considering all the facts and circumstances of the case\u201d; </em>(emphasis added); violates the constitutional principle that the sentencer may not be precluded from considering any evidence presented by the defendant as the basis for a sentence less than death. <em>See Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 438 U.S. 604. The defendant\u2019s arguments are nearly identical to those made in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rizzo, </em>266 Conn. 171, 291, 833 A.2d 363 (2003). In <em>Rizzo, </em>we rejected the claim that the \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d language of \u00a7 53a-46a (d):<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> \u201c(1) screens out mitigating evidence from the weighing process; (2) allows the jury to refuse to consider constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence in the weighing process; and (3) allows the jury to conclude incorrectly that there must be a nexus between the mitigating evidence and the offense committed by the defendant.\u201d Id. We decline to reconsider those arguments here.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The defendant also urges us to reconsider our holdings in <em>Cobb II, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 494, that the \u201cfacts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>circumstances\u201d language does not require the sentencer improperly to weigh the aggravating factors against the mitigating factors, and in <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 282-83, that that language applies retroactively. Because the defendant has provided no new authority or argument in support of these claims, we decline to reconsider our previous decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Finally, the defendant argues that, even if the \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d language of \u00a7 53a-46a (d) is facially constitutional, the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury in this case, taken as a whole, misled the jury to believe that it must find a nexus between the mitigating factor and the crime and to weigh the aggravating factor against the mitigating factor. Specifically, the defendant challenges the following instructions: \u201cOur law . . . demands that the decision to impose the sentence of death or the sentence of life imprisonment must be based on the unique individual nature of the defendant before you and the facts and circumstances of the offense. . . . [I]f a particular factor has been established by the evidence, then . . . you, the jury, shall determine whether that factor is mitigating in nature, considering all the facts and circumstances of the case .... [T]he statute provides a mitigating factor may be considered to the extent that they concern the defendant\u2019s character, background, and history, or the nature and circumstances of the crime .... The procedures provided by our statute require you, as the jury, to consider and focus upon the circumstances of the crime and the background, history, and character of the defendant before you make your findings with regard to the existence or nonexistence of mitigating factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The only possible defect in these instructions that we can perceive is that the trial court referred to the facts and circumstances of the \u201ccrime\u201d and the \u201coffense,\u201d which words arguably are narrower than the word used in the statute, namely, \u201ccase.\u201d We do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>believe, however, that the use of that language rendered the instructions unconstitutional in light of the entire context in which the words were used. Specifically, we note that, in addition to providing the foregoing instructions that the jury must consider the defendant\u2019s character, background and history, the court instructed the jury that \u201c[generally stated, a mitigating factor is any aspect of the defendant\u2019s character, background and history, or of the nature and circumstances of his crime which may serve as a basis for your decision that the appropriate sentence to impose is life imprisonment rather than death. . . . [Y]ou are required by law to consider the information you have to determine whether there are any factors which can serve as a basis for a sentence less than death. If you do not fully consider such information, the particularized and individualized sentence determination that our law requires you to make would not be made and society would have no assurance that a just and proper result had been reached in this case. The requirement that you, as the sentencer . . . not simply disregard any mitigating factor, reflects the fundamental reason for humanity which underlies our law. . . . [T]he circumstances of the crime itself, that is only one category or type of mitigating factor. You must then consider whether there are any mitigating factors in the defendant himself, in his character, in his history, or in his background. Obviously, such factors do not relate to the commission of the offense itself, and in no way serve to excuse the offense or to explain why it happened. Rather, these mitigating factors concern the defendant himself, his character, his history and his background. Any aspect of this defendant\u2019s character, background, and history may be found by you, in fairness and mercy, to be a mitigating factor.\u201d We conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the instructions, taken as a whole, could have misled the juiy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>believe that it was limited to finding a mitigating factor that had a nexus to the crime or that it could weigh the mitigating factor against the aggravating factor. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The defendant claims that the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment as applied to him because he suffers from a mental disability. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">In support of his claim that he suffers from a mental disability, the defendant relies on the same evidence that he relied on in support of his claim that, as a matter of law, he established his claimed mitigating factors that, at the time of the offense, he had (1) a significant impairment to his mental capacity and (2) a significant impairment to his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> We have already concluded that the jury reasonably could have found that the defendant\u2019s mental disorder, if any, did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 53a-46a (g) (2). Accordingly, we treat the present claim as alleging that, if the defendant established that he had any mental disability, regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>whether it met the requirements of \u00a7 53a-46a (g) (2),<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> it would be unconstitutional to impose the death penalty against him. We assume for the purposes of addressing this issue that the jury found that the defendant suffered from some degree of mental disorder not warranting a finding of mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">As authority for his legal claim that the imposition of the death penalty on a defendant who suffers from any mental disability violates the constitution, the defendant cites a number of scholarly sources for the general proposition that evolving standards of decency require the abolition of the death penalty. This proposition repeatedly has been rejected as a matter of state and federal constitutional doctrine. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 236 (citing cases in which this court has rejected state constitutional claim that death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment). The defendant cites no authority for the specific proposition that either the federal or state constitution bars the death penalty in cases in which, although the defendant suffered from some mental disorder, he had no significant cognitive or volitional impairment that reduced his moral culpability for the crime.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Nor does he point to any trend in other jurisdictions toward exempting persons with such mental disorders from the death penalty. Cf. <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>supra, 536 U.S. 313--16 (trend in state jurisdictions of banning death penalty for mentally retarded defendants supported determination that imposition of death penalty on such defendants is unconstitutional).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>We are not persuaded that either the state or federal constitution requires that any mental disability or disorder, regardless of whether it significantly reduced the defendant\u2019s moral culpability for committing the crime, must be treated as mitigating. Such a conclusion would be tantamount to declaring that the death penalty, although theoretically constitutional, could never constitutionally be imposed on any person who commits a capital offense. As the state points out, when a defendant has been convicted of a capital offense and the \u201cespecially heinous, cruel or depraved\u201d aggravating factor has been established, it necessarily has been established that the defendant\u2019s mental status did not conform to socially accepted norms. \u201cWe may go further and say that it is difficult to suppose that there are any persons who commit the kind of vicious crime for which the death penalty is now imposed in this [state] who do not possess one or more of the personality disorders or one or more of the neuroses recognized as mental disorders by the American Psychiatric Association. To hold that each of these conditions must be a mitigating factor when the death penalty is considered would be to undermine the death penalty under the guise of acknowledging that what the American Psychiatric Association finds to be a mental disorder must be treated as a factor that calls for less severe punishment than death. We cannot say that the evolving standards of decency that have characterized interpretation of the eighth amendment require a state to conform its scheme of capital punishment to such a norm.\u201d <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Pulley, </em>885 F.2d 1354, 1383 (9th Cir. 1989) (en banc). Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The defendant challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 53a-46a (h) (4) on the grounds that the statute: (1) fails to make an adequate distinction between defendants who may be sentenced to death and those who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>may not; (2) does not require specific intent to inflict extreme physical or psychological pain; (3) allows imposition of the death penalty if the defendant has inflicted extreme psychological pain; and (4) violates due process and the ex post facto clause as applied retroactively. We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In support of his claim that \u00a7 53a-46a (h) (4) fails to provide a meaningful distinction between those who have been sentenced to death and those who have not, the defendant merely cites the cases in which we have construed this statute and placed a limiting gloss on it; see <em>Cobb II, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 442-46; <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 255-56; <em>Breton I, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 265-71; and states conclusorily that the statute leaves the sen-tencer with the type of open-ended discretion held invalid in <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>supra, 408 U.S. 239-40. We decline to revisit our holdings in the cases cited and, accordingly, reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that the aggravating factor of subsection (h) (4) is unconstitutional because it does not require the state to prove that the defendant had the specific intent to inflict extreme physical or psychological pain or torture on his victims.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> Specifically, he challenges the constitutionality of the gloss placed on the statute by this court in <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 262, that the state must prove that \u201cthe defendant engaged in intentional conduct that inflicted extreme physical or psychological pain or torture on each of his victims above and beyond that necessarily accompanying the underlying killing. Evidence of the defendant\u2019s callousness or indifference to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>victims\u2019 suffering would substantiate such a finding, but it would not suffice without some showing of the infliction of extreme pain, suffering or torture on the victims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, the United States Supreme Court has held that the imposition of the death penalty is constitutional \u201cwhen the perpetrator \u2018relishes the murder, evidencing debasement or perversion,\u2019 or \u2018shows an indifference to the suffering of the victim and evidences \u00e1sense of pleasure\u2019 in the killing.\u201d <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>497 U.S. 639, 655, 110 S. Ct. 3047, 111 L. Ed. 2d 511 (1990), overruled on other grounds, <em>Ring </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 609, 122 S. Ct. 2428, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556 (2002). Thus, there is no federal constitutional requirement that the defendant have the specific intent to inflict suffering before the death penalty may be imposed. The court\u2019s decision in <em>Walton </em>also disposes of the defendant\u2019s claim that the infliction of psychological pain constitutionally cannot provide the basis for a death sentence. See id., 654 (no constitutional infirmity in trial court\u2019s instruction that \u201ccrime is committed in an especially cruel manner when the perpetrator inflicts mental anguish or physical abuse before the victim\u2019s death\u201d). To the extent that the defendant claims that the statute violates the state constitution for these reasons, he has not adequately briefed those claims and, accordingly, we decline to address them. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rizzo, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 290 n.69.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Finally, we address the defendant\u2019s claim that the application of the gloss placed on the statute by this court in <em>Ross II </em>to him violates due process and the ex post facto clause. We rejected an identical claim in <em>Cobb II, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 442, and decline to revisit the issue here. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">The defendant claims that the death penalty statute is unconstitutional because it does not require the impo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>sition of a life sentence if one or more jurors, but fewer than all of the jurors, find a mitigating factor. We have already concluded, however, that the verdict form in this case made it clear that none of the jurors found a mitigating factor. Accordingly, there is no need to consider this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">We repeatedly have rejected claims identical to the defendant\u2019s claims that the statute is unconstitutional because: (1) it places the burden of proving the mitigating factor on the defendant; see <em>Cobb II </em>supra, 251 Conn. 496-97; <em>Breton II, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 217-18; <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 254-55; (2) it embodies a presumption of death and imposes a mandatory death sentence; see <em>Cobb II, </em>supra, 496-97; <em>Breton II, </em>supra, 217-18; <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 241-42 n.24; (3) the sentencer\u2019s determination of mitigating factors is standardless and unreviewable; <em>Breton II, </em>supra, 218; <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 281-84; (4) the statute fails to provide for a sentencer who makes an individualized determination that death is the appropriate punishment; see <em>Cobb II, </em>supra, 496-97; <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 412; <em>Breton II, </em>supra, 217-18; <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 235-41,252; and (5) it is unconstitutional per se under the state constitution; see <em>Cobb II, </em>supra, 496-97; <em>Breton II, </em>supra, 217-18; <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 254. The defendant has provided no compelling reason to reconsider these decisions here and, accordingly, we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">CUMULATIVE ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">The defendant claims that, even if we conclude that none of the claims raised by him constitute reversible error when considered separately, the cumulative effect of the many \u201cnear errors\u201d or harmless errors requires reversal. We have not concluded that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>committed many near errors or harmless errors. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">X</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">PROPORTIONALITY REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">\u201cPursuant to ... \u00a7 53a-46b (a), this court is responsible for reviewing [a]ny sentence of death imposed in accordance with the provisions of [\u00a7] 53a-46a .... In carrying out this function, the legislature has directed us to affirm the sentence of death unless [we determine] that . . . the sentence is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant. General Statutes [Rev. to 1987] \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3). Under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3), therefore, we must engage in what has come to be known as proportionality review of the defendant\u2019s death sentence.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> <em>[State </em>v. <em>Webb], </em>supra, 238 Conn. 490-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u201cAs we previously have stated, our function in undertaking [proportionality review] is to assure that upon consideration of both the crime and the defendant the aggravating and mitigating circumstances present in one capital case will lead to a result similar to that reached under similar circumstances in another capital case, thus identifying the aberrant sentence and avoiding its ultimate imposition. . . . The search, however, is not for a case involving a rough equivalence of moral blameworthiness; the search is, rather, for a gross disparity between the case on review and other cases within the selected pool of similar cases. . . . Thus, proportionality review requires a comparison of the decision to impose a death sentence, made by the fact finder in the case before us on the basis of the presence or absence of aggravating and mitigating factors, with decisions to impose sentences of death or life imprisonment, made by the fact finders in the other relevant cases on the basis of the presence or absence of aggravating and mitigating factors. That process requires us to determine whether, as compared to those cases, this case is an outlier. . . . <em>Cobb II, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 509-10. In other words, because [t]he process of proportionality review requires that we canvass a set of similar cases to determine whether the death penalty in the case before us was, with respect to that set of cases, wantonly or freakishly imposed by the fact finder. <em>[State </em>v. <em>Webb], </em>supra, 238 Conn. 516. We will not vacate a death sentence as disproportionate under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3) unless that sentence is truly aberrational with respect to similar cases. See id., 501.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\u201cOur first task, therefore, is to determine the universe of cases from which can be culled the pool of cases deemed to be similar cases for purposes of proportionality review under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3). Id., 513. In accordance with the statutory mandate of \u00a7 53a-46b (a) that we review all sentences of death pursuant to [our] rules, we adopted [what is now] Practice Book \u00a7 [67-6],<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>under which we defined the universe as follows: Only those capital felony cases that have been prosecuted in this state after October 1,1973, and in which hearings on the imposition of the death penalty have taken place, whether or not the death penalty has been imposed, shall be deemed eligible for consideration as similar' cases. . . . We allowed for an expansion of this universe in a given case, however, on application of a party claiming that the resulting pool of eligible cases is inadequate for disproportionality review. ... Id. In the absence of such a showing, the universe of cases from which we cull the ultimate pool of cases deemed similar cases consists only of capital felony convictions in which there was a penalty phase hearing. ... Id., 528. We have further refined the universe to include cases currently on appeal and, absent exceptional circumstances wholly undermining the fundamental reliability of the fact-finding process, cases that have been reversed on appeal. . . . [I]n the absence of such exceptional circumstances, a reversed finding regarding an aggravating factor in the case on review will be included in the process of proportionality review. Id. Two exceptional circumstances that require the exclusion of an otherwise eligible case from the universe of cases involve: (1) cases in which the capital felony conviction has been reversed on the basis of insufficient evidence; id., 520 n.83, 522; and (2) cases in which the death sentence has been vacated on the basis of insufficient evidence with respect to the existence of the aggravating factor or factors that served as the basis for the imposition of the death penalty. Id., 520 n.83.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 237-41. <em>In Breton III, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 425-26, we concluded that prior reversed convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>in the same case that is under review must also be excluded from the universe of cases.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In the present case, we granted the defendant\u2019s application to expand the universe of similar cases to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>include: (1) his convictions for the two Windham county murders for which consecutive life sentences were imposed; and (2) cases \u201cin which a capital felony conviction has been obtained and the conviction was followed not by a hearing on the imposition of the death penalty but by an imposition of a sentence other than death, either by virtue of a plea agreement or by virtue of the fact that the state did not seek the death penalty.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, 225 </em>Conn. 559, 561, 624 A.2d 886 (1993) <em>(Ross I).</em><footnotemark><em>90</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The state argues, however, that those cases are no longer included in the universe of cases because the defendant\u2019s application was granted before this court had had the opportunity to define the contours of the universe within the context of a case in which we actually performed proportionality review. We disagree. If the state desired this court to vacate the order expanding the universe of cases, it should have filed an application requesting that action in a timely manner so as to allow the defendant an opportunity to respond and this court an opportunity to consider the views of both parties. In the absence of any such application, the order stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\u201cWe next turn to the question of how to go about culling from the universe of eligible cases the ultimate pool of cases deemed to be similar cases for purposes of proportionality review. Having defined and limited the universe of cases, we must determine which particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>lar cases within that universe are similar to th[e] [present] case for purposes of deciding whether the death sentence being reviewed is an outlier. . . . What the ultimate pool of similar cases will consist of in any particular case will have to be developed on a case-by-case basis. . . . [The term] similar cases means, in general, cases in which the underlying capital felonies were based on conduct of other defendants that is substantially similar, in its criminal characteristics, to that of the defendant in the case under review. We ask: in the general transaction that underlies the conviction for capital felony in the case under review, in what kind of criminal conduct, in general, did the defendant engage? We then seek to identify other cases in which the defendants engaged in substantially similar conduct. . . . Thus, in ascertaining the pool of similar cases, we are not limited only to those cases involving the same subsections of the capital felony statute. Rather, we look to the characteristics of the criminal conduct underlying the capital felony conviction to determine whether that conduct is sufficiently similar to the conduct underlying the case under review to provide a fair basis for comparison. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u201cFinally, we do not differentiate, for purposes of defining the pool of similar cases, between aggravating and mitigating factors, because both may implicate the circumstances of the crime, and both may also implicate the character and record of the defendant. . . . [Therefore . . . both aggravants and mitigants must be viewed together, analytically, although not as part of the definition of similar cases. Rather, they must both be considered in the process of actually comparing the case before us on review with the predetermined pool of similar cases . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 243-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>With these principles in mind, we now undertake the task of identifying the ultimate pool of similar cases in the present case. The defendant was found guilty of six counts of capital felony involving kidnap-murder and sexual assault-murder. Although the defendant was not charged with this conduct, the defendant also committed a double murder. Accordingly, we cull from the universe of similar cases those cases involving kidnap-murder, sexual assault-murder and multiple murder, or some combination thereof. Cf. <em>Breton III, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 427 <em>(Breton III </em>and <em>Ross II </em>are similar cases even though defendant in <em>Ross II, </em>unlike defendant in <em>Breton III, </em>was not charged with multiple homicide). The defendant identifies the following cases involving (1) sexual assault murders or sexual assault and kidnap-murders: <em>State </em>v. <em>Usry, </em>205 Conn. 298, 533 A.2d 212 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Windham, Docket No. CR11-49329-8193; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Windham, Docket No. CR11-49330-8194; <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 183 (four murders that are basis for present appeal); <em>Cobb II, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 285; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lapointe, </em>237 Conn. 694, 678 A.2d 942, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 994, 117 S.

See footnote 89 of this opinion. Moreover, to the extent that the state suggests that we should compare the defendant\u2019s current sentences to his previously reversed sentences, we have concluded that previously reversed sentences in the same case are not \u201csimilar cases\u201d for purposes of proportionality review. See id. We exclude <em>Hoyesen </em>because the only similarity claimed by the defendant is that the defendants in those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>cases claimed a mitigating factor that he also claimed. As we have noted, aggravating and mitigating factors are not part of the definition of \u201csimilar cases.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 525. We exclude <em>Peeler, Colon </em>and <em>West, </em>because the state has not provided an appendix setting forth \u201cthe circumstances of the crimes that are claimed to be similar to that of which the defendant has been convicted and the characters and records of the defendants involved therein so far as these are ascertainable from the transcripts of those trials and hearings on the imposition of the death penalty or may be judicially noticed,\u201d as required by Practice Book \u00a7 67-6 (b), and the facts and circumstances of these cases have not previously been subject to review by this court. Finally, we exclude <em>Rizzo </em>because murder of a person under the age of sixteen was not a capital felony at the time that the defendant murdered Leslie S. and April B. Accordingly, the ultimate pool of similar cases is <em>Usry, Ross </em>(Superior Court Docket No. CR1149329- 8193), <em>Ross </em>(Superior Court, Docket No. CR1149330- 8194), <em>Cobb, Lapointe, Hafford, King, Whitworth, Daniels, Webb, Paradise, Rodriguez, Diaz-Marrero </em>(treated as two cases), <em>Ortiz </em>(treated as two cases), <em>Johnson, Steiger, Roseboro, Wood, Griffin, Breton </em>and <em>Day.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">With respect to the similar cases involving sexual assault-murder or sexual assault-kidnap-murder, we restrict our consideration of those cases to a comparison with the defendant\u2019s convictions for the murders of Wendy B., Robyn S. and April B. With respect to the similar cases involving only multiple murder, we restrict our consideration of those cases to a comparison with the defendant\u2019s convictions for the murders of Leslie S. and April B.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">We first consider the facts and circumstances of each of the similar cases involving kidnap-murder, namely, <em>Paradise, Rodriguez, Diaz-Marrero, Ortiz </em>and <em>John</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number><em>son. </em>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 388, the defendant, along with two other men, Brian Ellis and David Worthington, abducted the victim, who allegedly owed the defendant $6000 to $7000 from a drug deal, and drove him to a secluded area in Enfield. There, the defendant, the victim and Worthington got out of the vehicle. Worthington punched the victim, who fell to the ground, and kicked him. As the victim tried to get to his feet, the defendant stabbed him. The defendant then forced both Worthington and Ellis to stab the victim, who died as a result of the stabbing. Id., 391-92. More than seven years later, the defendant was arrested and charged with capital felony in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (5), the kidnap-murder statute. He waived a preliminary hearing to determine probable cause in exchange for the state\u2019s agreement not to seek the death penalty. Id., 390. After a jury trial, he was convicted of capital felony. Id., 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, Superior Court, Docket No. CR 94-456268, the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of kidnap-murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (5). On the morning of February 21,1994, the victim reported to work at the University Club in Hartford. Later that day, police received a report that she had not been seen since her arrival at work. A search was initiated and at about 8 p.m. her naked body was found in an attic space in the club. The cause of death was blunt trauma to the head and strangulation. The defendant, who was an employee at the club, became a suspect after he failed a polygraph test.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The state indicated at the sentencing hearing that it was willing to forgo seeking the death penalty on the capital felony charge because the evidence supporting the kidnapping and the evidence of sexual assault, with which the defendant had not been charged, was circumstantial, as was the evidence pertaining to the aggravating factor. In addition, the trial court had made several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>trial rulings adverse to the state. Accordingly, the defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The <em>Ortiz </em>and <em>Diaz-Marrero </em>cases were tried in a consolidated proceeding and each defendant was convicted of, inter alia, one count of capital felony based on multiple murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (8), now (7), and two counts of capital felony based on kidnap-murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (5). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>supra, 252 Conn. 536. On July 27, 1994, Julio Diaz-Mar-rero forced the victims, Hector Alvarado and Alvarado\u2019s wife, Migdalia Bermudez, at gunpoint into a van driven by Angel Luis Ortiz. Id., 539-40. Ortiz then drove to the apartment building where Alvarado lived. Diaz-Marrero ordered Alvarado to accompany him into the building and, when they emerged a short time later, Diaz-Marrero was carrying a paper bag. Ortiz then drove to another location where Diaz-Marrero ordered the victims out of the van. Id., 540. Several shots were then fired. Diaz-Marrero returned to the van alone and ordered Ortiz to \u201cget out of here.\u201d Id. Alavardo died instantly from a gunshot wound to the head. Bermudez suffered severe gunshot wounds to her back, hips and buttocks and died approximately five hours later. Id., 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">At the penalty phase hearing, the state sought to prove as an aggravating factor that Bermudez\u2019 murder had been committed in an especially heinous, cruel and depraved manner within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (4), formerly (h) (4). In mitigation, Diaz-Marrero presented evidence that his mother had been sixteen years old when she became pregnant with him and that she never married his father; that his mother had moved to New York and left him in Puerto Rico in the care of his grandmother for an extended period of time; that he had been shuffled between the care of his mother, father and grandmothers throughout his childhood; and that his mother\u2019s common-law husband did not like him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>and would hit him. Ortiz presented evidence that he was a good husband and father, a good worker and a good provider, that he had no criminal record, that he and Alvarado were friends and that he was married to Alvarado\u2019s sister. Toward the end of the hearing, Ortiz also sought to introduce evidence that Diaz-Marrero was a contract killer. As a result, the court bifurcated the cases and continued Ortiz\u2019 hearing until a verdict was rendered in Diaz-Marrero\u2019s case. In Diaz-Marrero\u2019s case, the jury found an aggravating factor and deadlocked on the existence of a mitigating factor. Shortly thereafter, the state indicated that it would not continue to seek the death penalty in Ortiz\u2019 case. The court dismissed both penalty hearings and, in each case, imposed an effective sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, Superior Court, Docket No. CR99-0170353, the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of kidnap-murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (5). On October 15,1999, the defendant and his codefendant schemed to hijack a car from the parking lot of a bar located in East Hartford. They watched as the victim drove his car into the parking lot, went into the bar and then emerged a short time later. The defendant forced the victim at gunpoint to relinquish his car keys and to get into the backseat of his car. The codefendant got into the backseat with the victim. The defendant then drove the car to an automatic teller machine where he forced the victim to reveal his personal identification number and withdrew money from the victim\u2019s bank account. As the victim pleaded to be released, the defendant drove the car to an entrance ramp to Interstate 84. The defendant forced the victim to get out of the car and shot him. The state declined to seek the death penalty against the defendant because the victim\u2019s family had indicated that it had no desire to see it imposed and because it believed that, under the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>of the case, the jury might find the fact that the defendant was eighteen years old at the time of the crime to be a mitigating factor. The defendant was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of release.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">We now compare these sentences to the defendant\u2019s sentences. We conclude that there exists a meaningful difference between each of these cases and each of the sentences under review in this case. Specifically, in <em>Paradise, </em>the defendant was not arrested until more than seven years after the crime had been committed and the state agreed not to seek the death penalty in exchange for the defendant\u2019s waiver of aprobable cause hearing; in <em>Rodriguez, </em>the state declined to seek the death penalty because it was concerned about the strength of the evidence supporting the elements that differentiate murder from a capital felony and the evidence supporting the aggravating factor; in <em>Ortiz </em>and <em>Diaz-Marrero, </em>each of which is treated as two cases, the defendants introduced mitigating evidence that was not introduced in this case and, after the jury deadlocked in <em>Diaz-Marrero </em>and the state indicated that it would no longer pursue the death penalty against Ortiz, the trial court dismissed the sentencing proceeding against both of them; and in <em>Johnson, </em>the state declined to seek the death penalty in part because it believed that there was a strong possibility that the jury would find the defendant\u2019s young age to be a mitigating factor. We conclude that the differences between each of these cases and each of the sentences under review in this case meaningfully account for the difference in result.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">We next consider the facts and circumstances of each of the similar cases involving sexual assault-murder or sexual assault-kidnap-murder, namely, <em>Usry, </em>the two <em>Ross </em>cases, <em>Cobb, Lapointe, Hafford, King, Whitworth, Daniels </em>and <em>Webb. </em>As we have noted, we restrict our consideration of these cases to a comparison with the defendant\u2019s convictions for the murders of Wendy B., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Robyn S. and April B. \u201cIn the case of State v. <em>Usry, </em>supra, [205 Conn. 299-300], the defendant was convicted of the capital felony of murder in the course of a sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (7) [now (6)]. The defendant, who had just reached the age of eighteen at the time of the crime, climbed into the victim\u2019s first floor apartment through a window. He forcibly sexually assaulted the victim, put sugar around her vaginal area, and killed her by repeated blows to the head with a brick. The victim survived for approximately ten to twenty minutes after first being disabled by a blow to the head. One of the blows, namely, to her nose, was extremely painful. She may have remained conscious until the last blow.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u201cThe state claimed that the offense had been committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner. The defendant claimed the following nine mitigating factors: (1) his mental capacity was significantly impaired at the time of the offense; (2) he was emotionally disturbed; (3) he was of youthful age at the time of the offense because it was committed only five weeks after his eighteenth birthday, and \u00a7 53a-46a (g) (1) precludes the death penalty for a defendant who was under the age of eighteen at the time of the offense; (4) his mental or emotional development was below his chronological age at the time of the offense; (5) he suffered from an emotionally deprived early childhood; (6) he was the product of a pathological family unit; (7) he did not obtain help for his psychological problems because he was the victim of parental neglect; (8) he suffered from a mental disease or defect, namely, paranoid personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder; and (9) any other mitigating factors suggested by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u201cThe jury found that the defendant had committed the crime in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner. With respect to mitigating factors, the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>could not reach a unanimous verdict and, pursuant to the court\u2019s instruction, indicated that five jurors found a mitigating factor proven and seven jurors found no mitigating factor proven. The trial court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 547-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, Superior Court, Docket No. CR11-49329-8193, the defendant abducted the victim as she walked along Route 6 in Brooklyn. He dragged her to his car and then drove to a location a short distance away, where he raped her. He then led her into a nearby wood, forced her to lie face down on the ground, sat on her back and strangled her to death. The defendant entered into a plea agreement with the state whereby he pleaded nolo contendere to the crime in exchange for a sentence of sixty years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">In <em>State v. Ross, </em>supra, Superior Court, Docket No. CR 11-49330-8194, the defendant struck up a conversation with the victim as she sat on the steps of a band shell in Davis Park in Danielson. Eventually, he offered her a ride to her home in Jewett City. Instead of driving her home, however, he took her to a cornfield in Canterbury where he raped her and strangled her to death. The defendant entered into a plea agreement with the state whereby he pleaded nolo contendere to the crime in exchange for a sentence of sixty years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">In both of the Windham county murder cases, the state declined to seek the death penalty because it believed that, under the corpus delicti rule,<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> it would be unable, because of the skeletal conditions of the victims\u2019 bodies, to establish the sexual assault element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>of the capital offense which was necessary to introduce the defendant\u2019s confession into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u201cIn the case of <em>[Cobb II, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 285], the defendant was convicted of two capital felonies: (1) murder in the course of a sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (7) [now (6)]; and (2) murder of a kidnapped person in the course of a kidnapping in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (5) . . . both involving the same victim and the same transaction. The defendant abducted the female victim from a shopping mall parking lot. He forced the victim to drive her car to an isolated area near a dam, where he sexually assaulted her. He then placed a leather glove in her mouth, bound her hands, feet and mouth with tape, and threw her from the top of the dam onto an ice-covered concrete apron that was approximately twenty feet below. The fall injured, but did not kill, the victim. When the defendant realized that the victim had survived, he went to the bottom of the dam and caused her to die by asphyxiation. The defendant later returned to the scene in order to make sure that the victim was dead. With respect to aggravating factors, a three judge panel found that the murder had been committed in an especially heinous and cruel manner. With respect to mitigating factors, the panel also found that the defendant had not proven: (1) that his mental capacity was significantly impaired; (2) that his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was significantly impaired; and (3) with respect to his list of mitigants, \u2018any factor that can be considered as mitigating.\u2019 Accordingly, the panel imposed the death penalty.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 542-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">\u201cIn the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Lapointe, </em>supra, [237 Conn. 694] the defendant was convicted of the capital felony of murder committed in the course of a sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (7) [now (6)]. He sexually assaulted his wife\u2019s grandmother in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>her apartment. When the victim told the defendant that she would tell his wife what he had done, he stabbed her repeatedly in the stomach and back. He then attempted to strangle her, and he set fire to the sofa on which she was lying. Although the victim had been grievously injured by the stabbing and the fire, she died of smoke inhalation. With respect to aggravating factors, the juiy found that the defendant had committed the offense in such a way as knowingly to create a grave risk of death to a person other than the victim. The jury found that the state had not proved that the offense had been committed in an especially heinous or depraved manner. The jury reached no verdict concerning whether the crime had been committed in an especially cruel manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u201cThe defendant claimed the following fifteen mitigating factors: (1) at the time of the offense, his mental capacity was significantly impaired; (2) at the time of the offense, his mental capacity was impaired such that his innate ability to perform and achieve was compromised by his psychological and intellectual deficiencies; (3) in his youth and adolescence, he suffered from a congenital cranial deformity known as Dandy-Walker syndrome, resulting in hydrocephalus and requiring five cranial operations that left ham with permanent injury to the frontal lobe and right side of his brain; (4) in his youth and adolescence, he had been bullied and taunted by his peers, which adversely affected his education and his emotional, psychological and social development; (5) despite his significant intellectual and vocational deficiencies, his formal education had been terminated with the acquiescence and encouragement of his school system; (6) despite his deficiencies, he had a history of steady and reliable employment and positive accomplishments, and worked hard to improve his and his family\u2019s socioeconomic situation; (7) he was married, was a loving father to his son, and worked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>regularly to provide for his family; (8) he demonstrated appropriate parental concern for the secular and religious education of his son; (9) he is a person with religious beliefs, who believes in God and participates in the Catholic religion; (10) before his marriage in 1978, he had volunteered his time and services for the benefit of a neighborhood center for the blind; (11) he was a well adjusted and adaptable prisoner who should present few, if any, prison discipline problems; (12) he had no prior criminal history, except for a minor incident when he was twenty-one years old; (13) mercy, and concern for his unique life; (14) any other factor concerning his character, background or history, or the nature or circumstances of the crime; and (15) life imprisonment without the possibility of release is the appropriate sentence in the case. The jury found that the defendant had proven a mitigating factor. The jury was not required to, and did not, specify which mitigating factor or factors it found proven. Accordingly, a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release was imposed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 543-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafford, </em>supra, 252 Conn. 274, the defendant was convicted of capital felony in connection with a murder committed in the course of a sexual assault. Id., 276, 281. The murder and sexual assault occurred during the course of a gas station robbery. Id., 280-81. The defendant, Christopher Hafford, compelled the gas station attendant to hand over the cash from the cash register and, after she complied, Hafford forced her into a back room, where he sexually assaulted her and then killed her with a knife and a shovel. Id. At the conclusion of the penalty phase hearing, the three judge panel found the existence of an aggravating factor, namely, that Hafford had committed the murder in an especially cruel manner. Id., 277-79 and n.3. The panel also found, as a nonstatutory mitigating factor, that, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the time of the offenses, [Hafford\u2019s] mental capacity was impaired and that Hafford\u2019s ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law [also] was impaired .... Id., 279-80 n.4. The panel farther found that Hafford gave both oral and written statements to the police shortly after his arrest, fully admitting his guilt. He was remorseful, cooperative, and regretful. ... Id. The panel thereupon concluded that these factors, when considered in combination with the other mitigating factors found, in fairness and in mercy, constitutes [sic] a mitigating factor. ... Id. The panel therefore imposed a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release. Id., 279-80.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 246-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 645, the defendant was convicted of one count of capital felony for kidnap-murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (5) and one count of capital felony for sexual-assault murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (7), now (6). \u201c[T]he defendant broke into a neighbor\u2019s home in the middle of the night, where the fifteen year old female victim was baby-sitting for her two and one-half year old sister. The defendant sexually assaulted, beat, strangled and stabbed the victim, causing her extreme physical pain and terror. The victim was found after 4 a.m., lying face down on the bed, bound with duct tape on her mouth, still alive but unresponsive and bleeding from various wounds. Id., 654. She died several hours later while undergoing surgery for the wounds that the defendant had inflicted on her. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u201cThe state claimed that the crime was committed in an especially heinous, cruel and depraved manner. The defendant claimed fourteen mitigating factors, including the two statutory mitigating factors of significant impairment of his mental capacity and significant impairment of his ability to conform his conduct to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>requirements of the law. His twelve claimed nonstatu-tory mitigants were: (1) a lesser degree of impairment of mental capacity; (2) a lesser degree of impairment of his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law; (3) his age of twenty years at the time of the offense; (4) his mother\u2019s abandonment, emotional neglect and failure to protect him from emotional, sexual and physical abuse adversely affected his childhood development; (5) his moral, psychological, social and educational development was impaired by his early childhood environment; (6) his ability to pursue education and develop friendships was impaired by numerous changes in residence and schools while growing up; (7) at age eight and one-half years, he left his home with his mother\u2019s acquiescence to live with another person, in order to escape abuse and neglect at home; (8) his family wants to maintain personal relationships with him and will support him during incarceration; (9) he has done positive things in his life; (10) life imprisonment is the appropriate sentence for him; (11) the catchall factor; and (12) any or all of the first thirteen factors, in fairness or in mercy, provides a reason for a sentence of less than death.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u201cThe juiy returned a special verdict finding that the state had proven the aggravating factor alleged, and that the defendant had proven the existence of a mitigating factor, which the jury did not identify. Accordingly, the defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release. Id., 650-51.\u201d <em>Cobb II, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 514-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitworth, </em>supra, Superior Court, Docket No. CR97-0236229, the defendant saw the sixteen year old victim in a telephone booth outside the Dolphin Mart in Groton at about 2:30 a.m. on December 28, 1996. The defendant offered to take the victim to Dunkin Donuts and, when she accepted, drove her to the parking lot located between Dunkin Donuts and the Best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Western Hotel in Groton. He then forced the victim into the bushes behind the parking lot, disrobed her and sexually assaulted her. Fearing that she would report the assault, he retrieved some twine from his car and attempted to strangle her with it. When she managed to remove the twine from her neck, he punched her, knocked her to the ground and struck her in the head multiple times with a large rock, thereby killing her. He then went home. Later, he returned to the body, put it in the back of his car, and moved it to another location where he disposed of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The defendant pleaded guilty to capital felony for sexual assault-murder. The state declined to seek the death penalty, citing the facts that the defendant was twenty-five years old at the time of the crime, was married, was the father of a young child, came from a close and loving family, was a very good father, had had a successful naval career, pleaded guilty without seeking a deal, was remorseful and did not attempt to assert any spurious or speculative defenses. In addition, the state noted that it had no reason to believe that the defendant had ever committed a similar offense. The defendant was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 376-78, the defendant was convicted of multiple murder capital felony in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (8) [now (7)], murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a and sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71. Late at night, the defendant entered the home of his girlfriend, where he attacked his girlfriend\u2019s roommate and the roommate\u2019s three year old child. The defendant stabbed the roommate multiple times in the chest. He then proceeded to strangle the child and slit the child\u2019s throat. Then, upon hearing the roommate making gurgling noises, he sexually assaulted her and stabbed her again. Id., 378-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>\u201cAt the penalty phase hearing, the jury found that the state had proved the existence of an aggravating factor, that the defendant had committed the murders in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner. In mitigation, the defendant \u2018presented evidence of his deprived home life and mental impairment. According to the defendant\u2019s mother, the defendant had grown up in a family atmosphere marked by violence and tragedy. She testified that during his childhood, the defendant had suffered numerous head injuries, had been beaten regularly by his father, who had often been drunk, and had witnessed numerous acts of violence perpetrated by his father on his mother. According to Charles Opsahl, a psychologist, the defendant\u2019s childhood difficulties were reflected in current test results that showed his strong depression and his heightened sensitivity to rejection by others. The defendant also presented the testimony of James Merikangus, a psychiatrist, who concluded, after an examination of the defendant, that he suffered from organic brain dysfunction. In addition, the defendant introduced evidence that he had been drinking excessively on the night of the murders and that he had a tendency to get out of control when drinking. On rebuttal, the state called another psychiatrist, Robert Miller, who disagreed with Merikangus\u2019 conclusions and diagnosed the defendant as having a mixed personality disorder with antisocial and explosive tendencies.\u2019 Id., 379-81. The jury could not agree on the existence of a mitigating factor, and the court sentenced the defendant to a term of life imprisonment. Id., 380.\u201d <em>Breton III, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 435-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u201cIn <em>[State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 389], the defendant, after kidnapping the victim at gunpoint, drove her nearly four miles to a public golf course, where he forcibly attempted to assault her sexually. When she broke free, he shot her twice in the back and, after she had crawled thirty-three yards away, coughing blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>and in excruciating pain, he stood in front of the conscious and prostate victim. He then shot her in the chest, in the ear, and point blank in the face, with bullets specially enhanced for potency to do damage. [Id.,] 540-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u201cThe state claimed two aggravating factors: (1) the offense had been committed during the commission of a sexual assault in the first degree, an offense of which the defendant previously had been convicted; and (2) the offense was committed in an especially cruel and heinous manner. Id., 540. The defendant claimed the following ten mitigating factors: (1) significant impairment of mental capacity; (2) a lesser degree of mental capacity; (3) an emotionally deprived childhood; (4) untreated early mental or emotional disturbance; (5) the defendant had surrendered to the police after learning that he was sought as a suspect; (6) he had maintained positive relationships with various persons; (7) a lingering doubt regarding his guilt; (8) fairness, mercy and humanity; (9) a disparity between the defendant\u2019s chronological age and his emotional development; and (10) [a]ny other mitigating factors concerning [the defendant\u2019s] character or background, or the nature and circumstances of the case suggested by the evidence. Id., 541. The jury found both of the aggravating factors proven<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> and none of the mitigating factors proven and, accordingly, the death sentence was imposed. Id., 542-43.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cobb II, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 515-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">We now compare these cases involving sexual assault-murder and sexual assault-kidnap-murder with the facts of the three sexual assault-kidnap-murders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>that the defendant committed in the present case. We first consider the two cases in which the death penalty was imposed, namely, <em>Webb </em>and <em>Cobb. </em>The defendant argues that \u201c[t]he level of planning, the presence of a weapon, the duration of the kidnapping and the extreme cruelty with which the victims were killed clearly sets these cases apart\u201d from his case. We disagree. As we have noted, even if we assumed, without necessarily agreeing, that the offenses in <em>Webb </em>and <em>Cobb </em>were somewhat more aggravated than the offenses in the present case because the victims in those cases may have suffered a somewhat more prolonged period of extreme physical and psychological pain, we would not conclude that that difference is meaningful for purposes of this analysis. In performing proportionality review, we do not demand \u201ca rough equivalence of moral blameworthiness\u201d between the case under review and the similar cases in which the death penalty has been imposed. <em>Cobb II, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 510. Rather, we look for \u201ca gross disparity between the case on review\u201d and those other cases. Id. We perceive no gross disparity between any of the kidnappings, sexual assaults and murders under review in this case and the kidnappings, sexual assaults and murders in <em>Webb </em>and <em>Cobb. </em>As to the defendant\u2019s claim that his offenses were less blameworthy because the offenses in both <em>Webb </em>and <em>Cobb </em>were premeditated and, in <em>Webb, </em>involved the use of a weapon, we note that those facts could be considered by the respective sentencing juries only as part of \u201cthe facts and circumstances of the case\u201d in determining whether a mitigating factor existed. Although those specific facts may not have existed in this case,<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> other equally egregious facts clearly did, i.e., the defendant\u2019s atrocious record of repeatedly kidnapping, sexually assaulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>and strangling vulnerable young women. Accordingly, we see no disproportionality between the sentences in this case and the sentences in <em>Webb </em>and <em>Cobb.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">We now compare the cases in which a life sentence was imposed, namely, <em>Usry, </em>the defendant\u2019s two Wind-ham county murders, <em>Lapointe, Hafford, King, Whitw-orth </em>and <em>Daniels. </em>We conclude that there exists a meaningful difference between each of these cases and the sentences under review in this case. Specifically, in <em>Usry, </em>the defendant claimed as mitigating factors, inter alia, his young age and his lack of mental and emotional development, and the jury was deadlocked on the question of whether a mitigating factor existed; in the two Windham county murders, the state declined to seek the death penalty because it believed that it did not have sufficient evidence to support the sexual assault element of sexual assault-murder; in <em>Lapointe, </em>the defendant claimed as mitigating factors, inter alia, his permanent brain injury resulting from cranial operations required by his Dandy-Walker syndrome and no significant prior criminal history and the jury found that the defendant had established an unspecified mitigating factor; in <em>Hafford, </em>the panel found as nonstatutory mitigating factors that the defendant had a significant mental impairment and that he was remorseful, cooperative and regretful; in <em>King, </em>the defendant claimed as mitigating factors that he had been subject to sexual and physical abuse, that he had been unable to pursue an education and that he had left home at the age of eight and one-half years in order to escape abuse and neglect, and the jury found that one of the claimed fourteen nonstatutory mitigating factors had been proved; in <em>Whitworth, </em>the state declined to seek the death penalty citing, among other reasons, that the defendant had, up to the time of the crime, been a good husband and father and had not committed any other offenses; and in <em>Daniels, </em>the defendant introduced direct testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>that the defendant suffered from organic brain dysfunction and had been drinking excessively on the night of the sexual assault-murder and the jury deadlocked on the question of whether there was a mitigating factor. We conclude that the differences between each of these cases and each of the sentences under review in this case meaningfully account for the difference in result.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">We now turn to the facts of the similar cases involving multiple murder, namely <em>Steiger, Roseboro, Wood, Griffin, Breton </em>and <em>Day. </em>\u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Steiger, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 349, the defendant was convicted of multiple murder capital felony in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (8) [now (7)] for the shooting deaths of two individuals. After a verbal altercation with the two victims, which took place near the home of one of the victims, the defendant left the area and proceeded to arm himself with two guns and a knife. He returned to the victim\u2019s home, where he shot each victim multiple times and threatened two people standing nearby. Id., 352-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\u201cThe state claimed two aggravating factors: (1) that the defendant committed the murders in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner; and (2) that the defendant committed the murders and in such commission knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victims of the offense pursuant to \u00a7 53a-46a (h) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\u201cIn mitigation, the defendant offered testimony that: he had suffered from severe paranoid schizophrenia; he had a mental capacity that was significantly impaired; the mental disorder from which he suffered was prone to worsen under the influence of emotionality; he showed paranoid traits such that he tended to over-interpret threats and to respond explosively to threats; he was an individual of immature emotional development and immature impulse control; he had strong conflicting and unresolved emotions concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>his father and alcoholism; his mental capacity was significantly impaired and he was under substantial duress; he had traumatic childhood experiences that could be characterized as emotional and psychological abuse; and in describing the events of that night, he appeared to be in a great deal of turmoil and pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u201cThe three judge panel that conducted the penalty phase hearing unanimously found that the state had proved both aggravating factors. Id., 351. Two of the judges found the existence of a mitigating factor in the defendant\u2019s character, background and history and that, at the time of the offense, the defendant\u2019s mental capacity was significantly impaired and his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was significantly impaired. One member of the panel found that the defendant had not proved any mitigating factors. The panel imposed a life sentence without the possibility of parole.

Following the penalty phase hearing before a three judge panel, the defendant was sentenced to death. The panel found that the state had proved its aggravating factor, that the murders were committed in an especially cruel manner. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-46a (h) (4). This finding was based on evidence demonstrating that the defendant had engaged in a prolonged and violent assault on his former wife, during which he beat her severely and stabbed her multiple times, ignoring her anguished cries that he was hurting her and begging for help. The defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>dant then turned on his son, chased him down as he attempted to escape and repeatedly stabbed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u201cThe defendant claimed the two statutory mitigating factors of significant impairment of his mental capacity and significant impairment of his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law as well as twenty-five nonstatutory mitigating factors.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>[T]he panel found that the defendant had proved the factual underpinnings of four nonstatutory mitigating factors. They were: (1) that the defendant was neglected, abandoned and the product of an abusive family unit during his childhood; (2) that the defendant had been a model prisoner at all times since his incarceration for the murders; (3) that he dropped out of school at age sixteen; and (4) that he was a good employee and a productive worker. The panel further found, however, that none of the nonstatutory mitigating factors, alone or in combination, constituted a mitigating factor considering all of the facts and circumstances of the case. Accordingly, the panel sentenced the defendant to death.\u201d <em>Breton III, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 813, 815-16, the defendant was convicted of four counts of murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a and one count of multiple murder capital felony in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (8) [now (7)] for the shooting deaths of four individuals, one of whom was a five year old child. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u201cThe state sought to prove the aggravating factor that the defendant had committed the crime in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner. The state presented testimony that one of the adult victims died from multiple gunshot wounds to the head, all fired at close range, and evidence from the trial indicated that the defendant repeatedly kicked that individual, probably while he was unconscious. The state offered further testimony indicating that the cause of death for a second adult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>victim was multiple gunshot wounds to the head and chest, any one of which could have caused her death. The state offered testimony regarding the third adult victim indicating that she was killed by two gunshot wounds to the head, both fired at close range and capable of causing her death. There was additional evidence suggesting that that victim had been strangled and struck in the head with a shovel, most likely after she was unconscious or dead. Finally, the state offered testimony indicating that the child victim was murdered by a single gunshot wound to the back of the head, killing him almost instantly.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u201cAt the close of state\u2019s evidence, the defendant moved to dismiss the penalty phase hearing and moved for imposition of a life sentence. The trial court found that the state had not presented a prima facie case from which the jury reasonably could infer that the aggravating factor had been proved by the state, and it granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and motion for imposition of a life sentence.\u201d <em>Breton III, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 431-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">As we have noted, we limit our comparison of the cases involving multiple murder to the murders of April B. and Leslie S. We first consider the case in which the sentencer imposed the death penalty, namely, <em>Breton III. </em>In <em>Breton III, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 336, the sentencer found that the defendant had committed each of the two murders in an especially cruel manner and rejected all of his claimed mitigating factors, including the statutory mitigating factors raised by the defendant in the present case. We perceive no gross disparity between the conduct underlying this offense and the conduct underlying the defendant\u2019s murders of April B. and Leslie S. or in the sentencers\u2019 treatment of aggravating and mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">We next compare the defendant\u2019s sentences for the murders of Leslie S. and April B. to those cases involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>multiple murder in which a life sentence was imposed, namely, <em>Steiger, Roseboro, Wood, Griffin </em>and <em>Day. </em>We conclude that there exists a meaningful difference between each of these cases and the murders of Leslie S. and April B. Specifically, in <em>Steiger, </em>the defendant claimed, inter alia, that he had suffered from severe paranoid schizophrenia, and two members of the three judge panel concluded that he suffered from a significant mental impairment; in <em>Roseboro, </em>the three judge panel found the mitigating factor that the defendant had adjusted well to incarceration;<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> in <em>Wood, </em>the defendant presented evidence that he suffered from severe personality disorders, atypical psychosis and paranoid schizophrenic process, and the juiy determined that he had established the statutory mitigating factor of mental impairment; in <em>Griffin, </em>the defendant presented evidence that the role of her codefendant in the murders remained uncertain, that she had no record of criminal activity, that she was unlikely ever to be a violent threat in the future and other mitigating circumstances not claimed by the defendant in the present case, and the jury found an unspecified mitigating factor; and in <em>Day, </em>the trial court found that the state had not established a prima facie case in support of the aggravating factor. We conclude that the differences between each of these cases and the sentences for the murders of Leslie S. and April B. meaningfully account for the difference in result.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u201cOn the basis of this analysis, of our scrupulous examination of all of the material presented to us regarding the imposition of the death penalty in the present case, and of our careful review of the material presented to us regarding the imposition of the sentences in the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>[twenty-three] similar cases,<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> we conclude that the death sentence is not \u2018excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant.\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3). There is nothing freakish, arbitrary, wanton or aberrational about the sentence in this case. There is no pattern or trend evident in similar cases with respect to which this sentence is inconsistent. This case is not an outlier. The various sentencers\u2019 evaluations of similar aggravants and claimed mitigants in the other similar cases is reasonably consistent with the [panel\u2019s] evaluation of the aggravants and claimed mitigants in this case. The death sentence in this case is reasonably consistent with the sentences of death imposed in the [three cases] in which that sentence was imposed, considering the aggravants found and the mitigants claimed. The death sentence in this case is reasonably consistent with the sentences of life imprisonment in the [twenty] similar cases in which that sentence was imposed, considering the aggravants found and the miti-gants claimed; there is nothing freakish, aberrational or arbitrary in [the jury\u2019s] having imposed the death penalty in this case and [the sentencers\u2019] having declined to do so in the other [twenty] cases. The sentence in this case is reasonably consistent with the sentences imposed in the pool of similar cases.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 550-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">In this opinion VERTEFEUILLE, ZARELLA, LAVERY, FOTI and DRANGINIS, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\"> The cases were consolidated for trial.

The voir dire process is designed to weed out those who are unfit to serve because of prejudicial notions.\u201d Id. We agree with this analysis of <em>Brown </em>and, accordingly, conclude that <em>Brown </em>did not supersede <em>Ziel.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b268-8\"> See footnotes 8, 9, 19 and 20 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\"> We emphasize that the defendant\u2019s claim involves an attempt to question venirepersons on their views of a <em>nonstatutory </em>mitigating factor. In determining whether such a factor exists, the jury must make both a factual finding and a moral decision whether a proved fact is mitigating in light of all of the facts and circumstances of the case. If a defendant claims, for example, that the fact that he graduated from college is mitigating, the law does not require that a juror who finds that fact must also find that the fact is mitigating. <em>Morgan </em>does not require the trial court to allow a defendant to stack the jury with jurors who would be sympathetic to such a claim. Nor does <em>Morgan </em>require the trial court to permit the defendant to ascertain the specific claims to which the jury would be sympathetic.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">In contrast, jurors must consider the mitigating nature of statutory mitigating factors. Although we conclude in this case that the defendant is not entitled to ask jurors about their views on specific nonstatutory mitigating factors, the defendant may ask jurors whether they would be able to follow the law requiring them to give effect to statutorily mitigating facts. This distinction may explain the \u201cparadox\u201d pointed to by the defendant that the trial court in the present case allowed him to ask venirepersons about psychiatric evidence supporting his claimed statutory mitigating factor but not about other mitigating claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\"> The defendant concedes that the specific issue before us has not been addressed previously by this court, but states that Connecticut law malees clear that \u201cparties must be allowed adequate exploration of subjects which could uncover bias relevant to the particular case.\u201d That, of course, is undisputed. The cases cited by the defendant do not, however, support the proposition that parties should be able to ascertain prospective jurors\u2019 opinions of any and all evidence in advance of the trial. For example, in <em>State </em>v. Barnes, 16 Conn. App. 333, 547 A.2d 584 (1988), the defendant was charged with stealing Christmas gifts from under a Christmas tree. The trial court prohibited voir dire on the venirepersons\u2019 views of Christmas. The defendant then asked the court to bar the state from mentioning Christmas at trial. The court denied the request. Id., 337. During trial, the state repeatedly referred to Christmas. Id., 337 n.l. On appeal, the Appellate Court held that, because there was a real risk that the fact that the defendant was charged with stealing Christmas presents could impair a juror\u2019s ability to be impartial, the trial court improperly had prohibited the line of questioning. Id., 337-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">In <em>Barnes, </em>however, unlike the present case, the defendant sought to question prospective jurors on evidence that the <em>state </em>was certain to introduce at trial and that could have affected the jurors\u2019 ability to be impartial. There was no concern in that case that the defendant could have used the voir dire responses to develop his trial strategy or to obtain a commitment from a venireperson to vote a certain way if the defendant presented specific evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b276-10\"> Indeed, the defendant states that \u201cmany citizens believe that taxpayers should not be burdened with the cost of supporting criminals for life, and that nothing such people can contribute from prison would justify the cost of their incarceration.\u201d To the extent that the defendant claims that this characterization is true of Connecticut citizenry, it would appear to undermine, not support, the defendant\u2019s position.

It further argues that because the defendant made the tactical choice not to do so, he cannot now complain that he was prevented from confronting Miller with the letter. The defendant counters that he could not have predicted at that time that this court would order a new penalty phase or that Miller would have died before the second proceeding could be held and, therefore, that he should not be deemed to have waived forever his right to examine Miller on the letter. Because we have concluded that the issues at the guilt phase and at the second penalty phase were substantially similar and that the defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine Miller at the guilt phase so as to endow the testimony with sufficient indicia of reliability, the defendant\u2019s decision not to call Miller as a witness at the first penalty phase has no bearing on our resolution of this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\"> The defendant also argues that Miller\u2019s testimony was prejudicial because it was the only evidence \u201cenabling the state to argue that the defendant\u2019s ability to control himself was not impaired, even if he is a sexual sadist.\u201d Specifically, he points to the state\u2019s statement during closing arguments that \u201csexual sadism doesn\u2019t prevent people from controlling their behavior.\u201d Thus, the state did not argue that the defendant\u2019s ability to control himself was not <em>impaired, </em>but that, in general, sexual sadism does not <em>prevent </em>people and, by implication, the defendant, from controlling their behavior. We have already concluded that Miller\u2019s testimony was admissible for the purpose of raising this inference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b303-8\"> The court charged the jury that \u201cthis case was a little bit unusual, because we had statements that came before you . . .

The defendant makes no claim, however, that Zonana\u2019s promise of confidentiality was anything more than an enunciation of the statutory psychiatrist-patient privilege which, like the fifth amendment privilege at issue in <em>Steiger, </em>is waived when the defendant places his mental status in issue. See <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 214.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\"> The defendant does claim that he was never told that the videotapes could be used \u201cagainst\u201d him.

To the extent that the defendant claims that his counsel could not have known that the videotapes could be used in rebuttal until the trial court ruled that they were admissible, we conclude, on the basis of <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 483 U.S. 402, <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 183, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Steiger, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 349, and in light of the court-ordered disclosure of the videotapes to the state at the first penalty phase, that defense counsel presumptively was aware that there was a substantial likelihood that the videotapes would be subject to disclosure at the second penalty phase if the defendant claimed mental impairment. See <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 438 U.S. 425 (counsel was on notice that, if he put on mental status defense, he would have to anticipate use of psychological evidence by prosecution in rebuttal).

Grayson also testified at the penalty phase that the defendant had told him about a rape, an attempted rape and a rape-murder that he had committed while at Cornell. With respect to the attempted rape and the rape, Grayson testified that the defendant had told him that he had grabbed a woman from behind, dragged her into the woods and let her go when he heard voices, and that he had grabbed another woman, dragged her into some bushes, forced her to perform oral sex, raped her and let her go.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\"> There is no evidence in the record that the defendant believed at the time of his arrest in Connecticut that his chances of being put to death as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>soon as possible were greater in Connecticut than in New York, the other jurisdiction in which he had committed murders. Indeed, the jury viewed a videotape of an interview between the defendant and one of his expert psychiatrists that occurred in 1985 in which he stated that he had concealed the New York crimes from his psychiatrists and attorneys because he \u201cstill hope[d] to someday, maybe if [he was] really lucky, [to] be out of this slum hole.\u201d It also viewed a videotape of a July, 1994 interview given by the defendant to a British journalist in which he stated, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to have to be transferred to New York and go through all that shit in New York.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\"> For example, the defendant stated with respect to the murder of Wendy B. that, after he had raped her, he killed her because he \u201cwas scared and . . . didn\u2019t know what to do because . . .

With respect to April B., the defendant stated that he killed her because she was very \u201cmouthy\u201d and had told him that she had a relative who was a policeman and, therefore, he believed that it would not be an unreported rape.

The episodes which resulted in his imprisonment generally would happen in the context of depression and would consist of an irresistible impulse in the context of a dissociative state ....

A reasonable jury could have understood the trial court\u2019s instructions on the aggravating factor to mean only that it must find that each <em>murder </em>was cruel, heinous or depraved. For example, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201ca <em>murder </em>committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner which has been proven with regard to the defendant\u2014and this is what the state is going to have to prove\u2014that the defendant inflicted upon each victim extreme physical or psychological pain or torture above and beyond that necessarily accompanying the <em>death </em>of that victim, of each victim. . . .

In any event, to the extent that the defendant claims this instruction, taken in isolation, suggested that the defendant had to prove that he could not control his behavior <em>at all, </em>we conclude that any such suggestion was corrected when the trial court instructed the jury that he had to prove that his \u201cability to control his conduct to the requirements of the law was significantly impaired, but not so impaired as to constitute a defense to the prosecution.\u201d To the extent that the defendant claims that this instruction improperly required the jury to find a causal link between his impairment and the offenses, we address that claim in part VII P of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"72\">\n<p id=\"b358-8\"> The jury had received evidence that the defendant already had been sentenced to two consecutive life sentences totaling 120 years in connection with his plea of nolo contendere in the Windham murder cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"73\">\n<p id=\"b358-9\"> At the time that the defendant committed the offenses, \u201clife imprisonment\u201d as used in \u00a7 53a-46a (f) meant \u201ca definite sentence of sixty years.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-35b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"74\">\n<p id=\"b359-10\"> The defendant submitted a request that the trial court instruct the jury that \u201c[o]ur law does not require that the defendant prove that the significant mental impairment caused the defendant to commit the offense(s).

Under the circumstances of this case, if the jury determined that the defendant suffered from sexual sadism, it could not reasonably have found that that condition had <em>no </em>causal relation to the commission of the offenses.

As the legislative histoiy of \u00a7 53a-46a reflects, our death penalty statute was enacted in 1973; Public Acts 1973, No. 73-137; in response to <em>Furman </em>v. Georgia, supra, 408 U.S. 239-40. See, e.g., 16 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1973 Sess., p. 2928, remarks of Representative James F. Bingham (\u201c[t]his bill was drafted very carefully to comply with <em>[Furman]\u201d'). </em>In <em>Furman, </em>the United States Supreme Court effectively invalidated death penalty statutes throughout the country, including this state\u2019s death penalty statute, on the ground that the death penalty constitutionally \u201ccould not be imposed under sentencing procedures that created a substantial risk that it would be inflicted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\u201d <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 188, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 49 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1976). The legislative history of \u00a7 53a-46a establishes that the legislature\u2019s overriding concern in enacting the statute was to meet this minimum constitutional requirement, i.e., to ensure that the statute provided a \u201cmeaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which [the death penalty] is imposed from the many cases in which it is not.\u201d <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>supra, 313 (White, J., concurring). In this context, we find it likely that, in establishing the category of death-eligible cases in which the death penalty could not be imposed, the legislature was concerned with identifying the specific factual circumstances under which a reasonable person would find the imposition of the death penalty to be <em>inherently </em>unfair or disproportionate, not those that <em>might </em>be found to merit mercy in light of the specific circumstances of the case. It is also likely that the legislature understood, as has subsequently been recognized in the case law, that the death penalty is inherently inappropriate only in cases where the defendant\u2019s moral culpability for the offense is reduced. Compare <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>supra, 536 U.S. 319 (identifying \u201cdiminished ability to understand and process information, to learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, or to control impulses\u201d as circumstances that inherently reduce moral culpability and make imposition of death penalty constitutionally suspect) with <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 438 U.S. 604 (sentencer cannot be precluded from considering, but is not constitutionally required to give effect to, any evidence proffered by defendant as basis for sentence less than death).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"78\">\n<p id=\"b362-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13 (a) provides: \u201cIn any prosecution for an offense, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant, at the time he committed the proscribed act or acts, lacked substantial capacity, as a result of mental disease or defect, either to appreciate the -wrongfulness of his conduct or to control his conduct within the requirements of the law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"79\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\"> Under current law, the defendant may, of course, present mitigating evidence that does not reduce his moral culpability for the offense, hi 1985, the legislature amended the statute to include subsection (d) of the applicable version of the statute, which provides guidance to the fact finder in its determination of whether a nonstatutory mitigating factor exists and defines mitigating factors to be \u201csuch as do not constitute a defense or excuse for the capital felony of which the defendant has been convicted, but which, in fairness and mercy, may be considered as tending either to extenuate or reduce the degree of his culpability or blame for the offense <em>or to otherwise constitute a basis for a sentence less than death.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)

See Public Acts 1995, No. 95-19, \u00a7 1, codified in part, at General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (g). Subsection (d) of the 1995 statute is the same as the provision that applies to the defendant in the present case, however, and, therefore, our constitutional analysis of that subsection in <em>Rizzo </em>is controlling here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"82\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\"> The defendant also relies on testimony by one of his expert witnesses, James Merikangas, a physician who is board certified in neurology and psychiatry, that the defendant had congenital developmental brain abnormalities that were a substantial contributing factor to his sexual sadism and impulse control disorders. In addition, he cites an article from a psychiatric journal in support of the general proposition that disorders such as the defendant\u2019s are the result of genetics and physical abnormalities. Merikangas gave the testimony at a pretrial hearing, however, and it was never presented to the jury. Nor was the article referred to by the defendant ever placed into evidence. Instead, the defendant presented the jury with Grayson\u2019s secondhand account of Merikangas\u2019 written report and Grayson\u2019s testimony that, although he did not have the expertise to evaluate Merikangas\u2019 physical findings, he was bothered by his uncritical acceptance of everything that the defendant told him. Because Merikangas\u2019 testimony and the journal article were not before the jury, we do not consider them here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"83\">\n<p id=\"b369-7\"> We have determined as a matter of statutory interpretation that \u00a7 53a-46a (g) (2) requires the defendant to establish that, at the time of the offense, he had a volitional or cognitive impairment that reduced his moral culpability for tire crime. See part VII F of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"84\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\"> The defendant does point out that our constitution prohibits discrimination against persons with mental disabilities. See Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 20. He provides no authority, however, for the proposition that a person with a mental disorder that amounts to a controllable desire to engage in conduct that violates established social norms falls within the protected class.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"85\">\n<p id=\"b371-8\"> The defendant, also urges this court to overrule our interpretation of the statute in <em>Ross II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 262, that it does not require the state to prove that the defendant intentionally inflicted extreme physical or psychological pain, but evidence of the defendant\u2019s callousness or indifference to his victim\u2019s suffering would suffice. We declined in <em>Cobb II, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 445, to reconsider this holding, and we see no reason to do so here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"86\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\"> \u201cIn <em>[State </em>v. <em>Webb], </em>supra, 238 Conn. 389, we explained that comparative proportionality review can be performed in one of two ways: the frequency method, pursuant to which a reviewing court uses a complicated method of statistical analysis that purports to quantify, with something like mathematical precision, the various factors leading to the imposition, or nonimposition, of the death penalty, and the frequency with which the death penalty is imposed in certain circumstances; id., 511; and the precedent seeking approach, pursuant to which a reviewing court compares the case before it to other cases in which defendants were convicted of the same or similar crimes, by examining the facts of the crimes, the defendants, and the aggravating and mitigating factors involved. Id., 511-12. We concluded in <em>Webb . . </em>. that our statute contemplates the precedent seeking method of comparative proportionality review. Id., 513; see also <em>[State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>234 Conn. 735, 741, 663 A.2d 948 (1995)] (proportionality review does not contemplate detailed statistical analysis of pool of comparable cases). Thereafter, in <em>Cobb II, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 506, we reaffirmed our adherence to the precedent seeking approach to comparative proportionality review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 238 n.213. The defendant in the present case, like the defendant in <em>Reynolds, </em>urges us to reconsider, once again, our use of the precedent seeking mode of analysis. \u201cWe decline to do so because we are satisfied that that method is the correct one.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">The defendant also argues that this court should not merely consider the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the mitigating and aggravating factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>in this case, but should independently compare that evidence with evidence presented in other cases in order to determine whether capital sentencers have treated such evidence consistently. Otherwise, he argues, arbitrariness in the imposition of the death penalty will be unchecked and no death sentence can ever be held to be disproportionate. This is, in essence, the same argument raised by the defendant and rejected by this court in <em>Cobb 11, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 504-508. We decline to reconsider that decision here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"87\">\n<p id=\"b375-9\"> \u201cWe note that neither the state nor the defendant has the burden of persuasion on the ultimate issue of disproportionaJity under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>(3). See <em>[State </em>v. <em>Webb], </em>supra, 238 Conn. 508.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 239 n.214.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"88\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 67-6 provides: \u201c(a) When a sentence of death has been imposed upon a defendant, following a conviction of a capital felony in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b and the hearing upon imposition of the death penalty pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a, the briefs of the parties shall include a discussion of the issues set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46b (b), to wit, whether (1) the sentence was the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor; (2) the evidence fails to support the finding of an aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (h) of \u00a7 53a-46a; and (3) the sentence is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">\u201c(b) For the purpose of reviewing the issue of disproportionality pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46b (b), the briefs of the parties shall contain appendices setting forth the circumstances of the crimes that are claimed to be similar to that of which the defendant has been convicted and the characters and records of the defendants involved therein so far as these are ascertainable from the transcripts of those trials and hearings on the imposition of the death penalty or may be judicially noticed.

Any such application shall identify the additional case or cases claimed to be similar and set forth, in addition to the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant involved, the provisions of the applicable statutes pertaining to the imposition of the death penalty with citations of pertinent decisions interpreting such provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">\u201cAny such application shall be filed within thirty days after the delivery date of the transcript ordered by the appellant, or, if no transcript is required or the transcript has been received by the appellant prior to the filing of the appeal, such application shall be filed within thirty days after filing the appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">\u201cThe text of Practice Book \u00a7 67-6, with the exception of some technical alterations, was adopted in 1990, and appeared in Practice Book, 1978-97, \u00a7 4066A. Section 4066A effectively was transferred to Practice Book, 1978-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>97, \u00a7 4064E, in 1996. In 1998, \u00a7 4064E was transferred to Practice Book \u00a7 67-6.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 240 n.215.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"89\">\n<p id=\"b378-7\"> We decline the state\u2019s invitation to reconsider our holding in <em>Breton III </em>here. Although we recognize the tension between that holding and our holding in <em>Webb </em>that reversed sentences may \u201cprovide valuable insight to this court in aid of our task of determining whether a particular death sentence is aberrational\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 521; we continue to believe that, in providing for proportionality review, the legislature did not envision that a defendant\u2019s death sentence would be compared to his own previously reversed death sentence in order to determine whether the second sentence was an outlier. The fact that the reversed sentence is sufficiently <em>reliable </em>to be used for comparison purposes in <em>other </em>cases does not establish that it meaningfully can be used for comparison in the same case. Similar things can be meaningfully compared; identical things cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Moreover, we are not persuaded by the state\u2019s argument that the second penalty phase was not \u201cthe same\u201d as the first penalty phase because different evidence was presented to a different jury. The question is not whether the evidence or the identities of the sentencers were identical, but whether the basic underlying facts are identical. If ten separate juries impose the death sentence on the basis of ten slightly different presentations of evidence pertaining to the same facts, that might suggest that the sentence \u201c 'reflect[s] the conscience of the community\u2019 \u201d; id.; but it does not mean that there are ten \u201csimilar cases.\u201d Finally, we note that the logical extension of the state\u2019s argument is that prior reversed death sentences in other cases should also be used for comparison purposes. In other words, because two different sentencers imposed the death penalty on the defendant in <em>Breton III, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 425, we should consider that case twice for proportionality purposes. Although the state includes <em>Breton II </em>in its list of \u201csimilar cases,\u201d it does not suggest that we should consider the sentence imposed on the defendant in that case twice, and we do not believe that the legislature had any such intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">We also take this opportunity to point out that, in this case, the defendant was sentenced at the second penalty phase to six separate death sentences on six capital felony counts and that it would be theoretically possible to compare the conduct underlying each of those sentences to the conduct underlying the others. In light of the identical aggravating factor and mitigating factors claimed in connection with each offense, the extreme similarity of the conduct underlying each offense, and the relatively large pool of other similar cases that we cull from the universe of similar cases, we conclude that such a procedure would provide extremely little, if any, additional insight into the ultimate question before us. That question is whether imposing the death penalty on this defendant, in light of all of the facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>circumstances of the case, is disproportionate with the sentences meted out to other defendants who have engaged in similar conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"90\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\"> In <em>Ross I, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 563, we denied the defendant\u2019s request to expand the universe of similar cases to include those cases prosecuted in Connecticut after October 1, 1973, in which the state clearly could have, but did not, charge the accused with a capital felony and which resulted in a conviction of not less than manslaughter in the first degree following a plea or trial. The defendant now urges us to reconsider that, ruling. For the reasons set forth in our decision in <em>Ross I, </em>we decline to do so. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 241-42 n.216 (rejecting defendant\u2019s request to reconsider denial of similar request to expand universe of similar cases); <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 514-18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"91\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\"> The defendant in <em>Daniels </em>was convicted of multiple murder capital felony, not sexual assault-murder. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 377. Because he sexually assaulted one of the victims, however, <em>Daniels </em>is similar to three of the convictions under review in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"92\">\n<p id=\"b382-6\"> The defendant argues that <em>Ortiz </em>and <em>Diaz-Marrero </em>should be treated as two cases because there were two victims. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 539 n.93 (treating <em>Ross </em>cases as four cases for purposes of proportionality review because there were four victims). We agree. Because the defendants in <em>Ortiz </em>and <em>Diaz-Marrero </em>each were convicted of two counts of kidnap-murder, each case should be treated as two separate cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"93\">\n<p id=\"b382-7\"> The defendant argues that <em>Steiger </em>and <em>Wood </em>are similar cases because the defendants in each case presented evidence of the statutory mitigating factor that he suffered from a significant mental impairment. As we discuss later in this opinion, that is not a valid basis for finding a case to be similar. We conclude, however, that the cases are similar in that they involve multiple murders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"94\">\n<p id=\"b382-8\"> We note that the defendant appears to assume that other cases are similar to this case only to the extent that those cases involve conduct for which the defendant was charged in this case. In other words, he believes, for example, that other cases involving sexual assault-murders are similar only to his convictions for the sexual assault-murders of Wendy B. and Robyn S., not to his convictions for the kidnap-murder of April B., even though he sexually assaulted her. Similarly, he appears to believe that cases involving multiple murders are not similar to the double murder of Leslie S. and April B. We disagree. Although the charges against the defendant for the sexual assault-murder of April B. and the double murder of Leslie S. and April B. were dismissed for lack of territorial jurisdiction, evidence of the conduct underlying those charges was before the jury and could have been considered as part of the \u201cfacts and circumstances of the case\u201d in determining whether there was a mitigating factor. We conclude that the effect of similar conduct on the determination of sentencers in other cases is relevant to our review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"95\">\n<p id=\"b383-7\"> The state concedes that <em>Usry </em>and <em>Daniels </em>are in the universe of similar cases, but suggests that this court should be reluctant to include them in the ultimate pool because life sentences were imposed in those cases only because the sentencer in each case was deadlocked on the mitigating factor. Whether a life sentence may be imposed when the sentencer is deadlocked or, instead, a mistrial must be declared is one of the issues in the state\u2019s appeal in <em>Peeler </em>that is currently pending before this court. The fact that the jury was deadlocked on the mitigating factor in those cases provides some insight into the conscience of the community, however, regardless of whether a life sentence should be imposed or a mistrial declared. Accordingly, we decline to exclude them from the pool of similar cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"96\">\n<p id=\"b390-9\"> The rule states that \u201ca <em>naked </em>extrajudicial confession of guilt by one accused of crime is not sufficient to sustain a conviction when unsupported by <em>any </em>corroborative evidence. . . .
