After the defendant began serving his sentence, the state filed a request for a standing criminal restraining order (restraining order) pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40e,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> against the defendant with respect to one of the victims. The defendant objected on the ground that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the state\u2019s request after his sentence had already been put into effect. The court held a hearing and imposed the restraining order. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We affirm the ruling of the trial court imposing the restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The following facts and procedural history are pertinent to our resolution of this appeal. The defendant\u2019s convictions arose from two separate incidents of domestic violence. The victim in the first incident had been romantically involved with the defendant and they had a son together. After an argument on May 4, 2001, the defendant punched the victim in the face, rendering her unconscious, and then dragged her down a flight of stairs to the basement of their residence. When the victim regained consciousness, she had duct tape wrapped around her head, hair and mouth. Her mouth was filled with blood, her face was cut and she had a black eye. She went to a hospital, where she received forty-seven stitches to close the wounds on her face. She reported the incident to the police five days later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>when she was well enough to go to the police station on her own. The defendant was charged with assault in the first degree with respect to this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The victim in the second incident is the couple\u2019s son. On May 9, 2001, the defendant asked his son to pick up some items in the living room. When the boy refused, the defendant grabbed him by the throat, forced him to the floor, and banged his head on the floor at least twice. The second victim reported the incident to an adult at school who contacted the department of children and families. The defendant was subsequently charged with unlawful restraint in the first degree and assault in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The defendant pleaded guilty pursuant to the <em>Alford </em>doctrine to assault in the first degree with respect to the first incident and assault in the third degree and unlawful restraint with respect to the second incident. At his sentencing hearing, the defendant made several remarks that the court found offensive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>court indicated that it was inclined to impose a higher sentence because of the defendant\u2019s remarks, it sentenced the defendant to fourteen years imprisonment, execution suspended after three years, with probation for five years with conditions in accordance with his plea agreement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">After the defendant began serving his sentence, the state requested that the court impose a restraining order pursuant to \u00a7 53a-40e<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to protect the first victim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The state sought the restraining order because it was concerned about the victim\u2019s safety. That concern was based in part on the hostile comments made by the defendant during his sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The defendant argued that the restraining order was an additional penalty and that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such a penalty after the defendant had begun serving his sentence. The court concluded that the restraining order was not punitive, that it was for the protection of the victim, and, therefore, that it had jurisdiction to impose it. The court entered a restraining order that prohibited the defendant from imposing any restraint upon the person or liberty of the victim; entering the family dwelling or the dwelling of the victim; threatening, harassing, assaulting, molesting, or sexually assaulting the victim; having any contact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>in any manner with the victim; coming within 100 yards of the victim; stalking the victim; and entering the victim\u2019s place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The defendant argues on appeal that: (1) the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to impose the restraining order because the defendant already had started serving his sentence and \u00a7 53a-40e provides that criminal restraining orders may be imposed only at sentencing; (2) the court violated the terms and conditions of the plea agreement by imposing the additional punishment of the restraining order; and (3) the court violated the defendant\u2019s substantive and procedural due process rights and the prohibition against double jeopardy by imposing an additional penalty after sentencing. The state responds by claiming, inter alia, that the court had subject matter jurisdiction because the restraining order was not punitive in nature and because the court\u2019s authority to impose a restraining order under \u00a7 53a-40e is not time limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">We first set forth our standard of review. \u201cWe have long held that because [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alliance Energy Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board, </em>262 Conn. 393, 398, 815 A.2d 105 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of a court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. ... A court does not truly lack subject matter jurisdiction if it has competence to entertain the action before it. . . . Once it is determined that a tribunal has authority or competence to decide the class of cases to which the action belongs, the issue of subject matter jurisdiction is resolved in favor of entertaining the action. ... It is well established that, in determining whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction, every presumption favoring juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>diction should be indulged.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>247 Conn. 724, 727-28, 724 A.2d 1084 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u201cThis court has held that the jurisdiction of the sentencing court terminates once a defendant\u2019s sentence has begun, and, therefore, that court may no longer take any action <em>affecting a defendant\u2019s sentence </em>unless it expressly has been authorized to act.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Cobham </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>258 Conn. 30, 37, 779 A.2d 80 (2001). The defendant claims that the court\u2019s imposition of the restraining order affected his sentence and that \u00a7 53a-40e did not authorize the court to modify his sentence. We conclude that the imposition of the restraining order did not constitute punishment. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>264 Conn. 484, 485-87, 825 A.2d 63 (2003), this court considered whether a trial court had jurisdiction to hold a hearing, to make a factual finding and to advise the defendant, who had been convicted of one count of public indecency, with respect to the mandatory sex offender registration requirements mandated by General Statutes \u00a7 54-251, after he had begun serving his sentence. The defendant argued that \u201cthe registration requirement was a punitive sanction constitu\u00ed [ing] a substantive change in the judgment, and that, in the absence of an express legislative grant of continuing jurisdiction, once he had begun serving his sentence the court no longer could make the factual finding that subjected him to the sex offender registration requirements pursuant to \u00a7 54-251.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>supra, 489. The state argued that \u201cthe trial court did not open or correct the defendant\u2019s sentence; it merely effectuated the regulatory purpose of [the statute]. . . . [T]he defendant\u2019s sentence was not affected by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>court\u2019s determination that he must comply with the statute.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Our analysis hinged upon whether \u00a7 54-251 was punitive in nature, and thus an additional punishment. Id., 492. In deciding that the statute was not punitive, we used the two part test set forth in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Pataki, </em>120 F.3d 1263, 1274-76 (2d Cir. 1997), which concerned whether New York\u2019s sex offender registration statute was punitive. <em>State </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 492. The test was adopted by this court, with respect to \u00a7 54-251, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>256 Conn. 23, 92-94, 770 A.2d 908 (2001), wherein this court considered whether \u00a7 54-251 is punitive in nature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>supra, 492. \u201c[UJnder the first part of the test, the court examined whether the legislature had intended the statute to be criminal or civil, in other words, \u2018punitive in law.\u2019 . . . Under the second part of the test, the . . . court considered whether, even if not punitive in law, the statute was nevertheless \u2018punitive in fact,\u2019 that is, whether the statute was so punitive in fact that it could not be seen as civil in nature.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 492-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">In <em>Waterman, </em>we concluded that \u00a7 54-251 was not punitive. Id. We also determined that \u201c[b]ecause these regulatory requirements [of the sex offender registry] are ministerial, the trial court did not have to revisit the sentence in order to inform the defendant of his obligations. Indeed, making the factual finding and informing the defendant of these requirements pursuant to \u00a7 54-251 did not necessitate any modification, opening or correction of the sentence. In short, the defendant\u2019s sentence was not affected by the trial court\u2019s factual finding and advisement that he must comply with the statute. Rather, the court merely was effectuating the regulatory purpose of [the statute]. As the Appellate Court noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>[69 Conn. App. 516, 529, 794 A.2d 1123 (2002), cert. granted, 261 Conn. 914, 806 A.2d 1056 (2002)], \u2018[i]n this case, we are not dealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>with a sentencing factor or a sentencing enhancement, but with a finding to be made after conviction that has no effect until after a defendant\u2019s sentence has been served.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 497-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">As in <em>Waterman, </em>our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim that the court lacked jurisdiction to impose the restraining order after he had started serving his sentence turns on whether imposition of a restraining order pursuant to \u00a7 53a-40e is punitive. Applying the two part test used in <em>Waterman, </em>we first consider whether the legislature intended \u00a7 53a-40e to be \u201cpunitive in law.\u201d Id., 492. Under Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we must determine as a threshold question whether the text of \u00a7 53a-40e is plain and unambiguous.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The statute allows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the trial court to impose a restraining order \u201cin addition to imposing the sentence authorized . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40e (a). This reasonably may be read as suggesting that the restraining order is an additional punitive measure. The statute also provides, however, that in deciding whether to issue a restraining order the court must consider whether such an order \u201cwill best serve the interest of the victim and the public . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40e (a). This reasonably may be read as suggesting that the primary focus of the statute is protection of the victim and the public rather than increased punishment of the offender. Because the language of the statute is subject to two reasonable interpretations, it is not plain and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Accordingly, we trun to the legislative history underlying \u00a7 53a-40e. Numerous legislators who rose in support of the law spoke about its purpose of protecting victims of domestic abuse. For example, Representative Andrew W. Roraback stated: \u201c[T]his amendment will enable us to do all that we can as a legislature and to allow the courts to do all that they can to protect people that have been abused in circumstances where they are fairly entitled to know, going forward, that they will never again have to encounter the perpetuators of the abuse.\u201d 39 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1996 Sess., p. 3328. Representative Brian E. Mattiello stated, \u201cI too rise in support of the amendment. It makes it clear that judges have the power to provide peace of mind to victims of domestic violence and that never will their attackers lawfully be permitted to stalk them at their will.\u201d Id. Representative Dale W. Radcliffe stated: \u201c[This amendment] is a welcome addition and follow through to what this Chamber did the other evening concerning the rights of crime victims and the protection of those who have been victimized and . . . brutalized by crimes of violence.\u201d Id., p. 3331.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>The following exchange between Representative Radcliffe and Representative Ellen Scalettar provides further evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent that these restraining orders not be considered punitive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">\u201c[Representative Radcliffe]: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Of course, any sentence that a sentencing court might issue could be modified by the court in the interim, if that were necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">\u201cI am thinking of a situation [in] which additional evidence might come to the attention of a court. An individual was incarcerated; was particularly violent during incarceration; made threats against an individual while incarcerated; information that might not necessarily involve the underlying offense or had been brought to the attention of the court at the time of the sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">\u201cI take it, it is not the purpose of this amendment to preclude a sentencing court from later modifying this, any sentence, to include such an order at that time, based upon those additional facts. Is that correct? . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">\u201c[Representative Scalettar]: ... I think I misunderstood the original question. It would have to be the criminal court, but it would not have to be exactly at the time of sentencing, as this is written. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">\u201c[Representative Radcliffe]: Through you, again, Mr. Speaker and for purposes of legislative intent. It is not to preclude a court, at a later time, based upon additional evidence of violence or additional threats which might themselves constitute a crime, to allow a court to issue such an order? . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-11\">\u201c[Representative Scalettar]: . . . That is correct.\u201d Id., pp. 3333-34. This legislative history supports the state\u2019s position that the purpose of the law is to protect victims from further abuse and not to punish the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Under the second part of the test, we consider whether \u00a7 53a-40e is \u201cpunitive in fact.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 493. The following factors set forth in <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 168-69, 83 S. Ct. 554, 9 L. Ed. 2d 644 (1963), guide our inquiry: \u201c[W]hether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment\u2014retribution and deterrence, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 92-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">We recognize that \u00a7 53a-40e involves a restraint upon the defendant. As the trial court aptly noted, however, to the extent that the restraining order prohibits the defendant from doing that which is already illegal, i.e., unlawful restraint and assault, it is clearly not punitive. Moreover, to the extent that the restraining order prohibits the defendant from doing something that would otherwise be legal, i.e., being in the vicinity of the victim, we have concluded that such a restriction is not punitive or for the purpose of retribution, but rather, serves the purpose of protecting the victim. We further note that \u00a7 53a-40e neither increases the term of imprisonment already imposed upon the defendant nor imposes an additional fine. Further, as we stated in <em>Waterman, </em>\u201cwe are not dealing with a sentencing factor or a sentencing enhancement, but with [an order] to be made after conviction that has no effect until after a defendant\u2019s sentence has been served.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 498. The restraining order subjects the defendant to punishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>only if he violates it and it does not require a finding of scienter. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40e (c). Moreover, the restraining order is not excessive given its purpose of protecting the victim. Accordingly, we conclude that the statute is not punitive in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Because \u00a7 53a-40e is not punitive in law or in fact, we conclude that the court\u2019s imposition of a standing criminal restraining order upon the defendant did not affect his sentence. Accordingly, the court had jurisdiction to impose the restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The defendant\u2019s remaining arguments, that the restraining order violated the plea agreement by imper-missibly enhancing his sentence, and that imposition of the restraining order deprived him of his substantive and procedural due process rights and violated the double jeopardy clause, are based on the defendant\u2019s assertion that the restraining order constituted a punitive measure that impermissibly enhanced his sentence. We already have determined that restraining orders pursuant to \u00a7 53a-40e are not punitive in nature. Nevertheless, we briefly address each claim in turn to clarify the consequences of this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The defendant correctly states that plea agreements are matters of contract law pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>256 Conn. 494, 517, 775 A.2d 260, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1052, 122 S. Ct. 639, 151 L. Ed. 2d 558 (2001). We do not see, however, any nexus between the sentence to which the defendant agreed in the plea agreement and the subsequent restraining order. We have concluded that the court\u2019s imposition of the restraining order did not impermissibly enhance the defendant\u2019s punishment and, therefore, did not breach the defendant\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">The defendant next argues that the court violated his rights to procedural and substantive due process by imposing the restraining order. The defendant claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>that the court, by granting the restraining order, imper-missibly added punitive measures to the defendant\u2019s sentence after he had relinquished his constitutionally protected rights by pleading guilty. Once again, the defendant\u2019s claims are dependent upon his argument that the restraining order was an enhancement of his punishment. Accordingly, we reject these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The defendant\u2019s remaining double jeopardy claim likewise fails because double jeopardy concerns the imposition of multiple punishments. \u201cThe prohibition of double jeopardy prevents not only multiple trials, but also multiple punishments for the same offense in a single trial. ... In the context of a single trial, the threshold issue [in determining whether the double jeopardy clause is implicated is] whether multiple <em>punishments </em>have been imposed.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>212 Conn. 31, 35, 561 A.2d 897 (1989). Because we already have determined that the restraining order was not punitive, the court did not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy by entering the order after the defendant had begun serving his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-11\"> <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37, 91 S.
