Colonari, for the entire misappropriation of the estate\u2019s funds by the former conservator, Gregoire R. Sideleau, or whether it is hable only for those misappropriated funds relating to the sale of real property. We conclude that Hartford Fire Insurance is hable only for the deficiency relating to the sale of real property and, therefore, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">We set forth the following relevant facts. On May 10, 1994, the Bridgeport Probate Court appointed Sideleau as conservator of Colonari\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The appointment decree provided that \u201c[Sideleau] has accepted the position of trust, and . . . the court dispenses with the requirement of a bond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Thereafter, on September 4,1996, Sideleau petitioned the Probate Court for permission to sell Colonari\u2019s real property. At this time, the Probate Court required Side-leau to post a bond in the amount of $20,000, with sufficient surety. The bond was executed on a standard bond form, as required by rule 2.1.02 of the Connecticut Probate Practice Book.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The form contains three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>options, with accompanying boxes to be marked, indicating the nature of the principal\u2019s (Sideleau\u2019s) authority. The form provides in relevant part: \u201cAs appears in the records of this court, the . . . principal has been:</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">\u201c[Option 1] appointed to the POSITION OF TRUST above indicated and appeared in court and accepted said trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\u201c[Option 2] authorized and empowered by order of the court to sell and convey or mortgage certain real property belonging to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">\u201c[Option 3] authorized to compromise a doubtful and disputed claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Below these options, the bond form provides in relevant part: \u201cThe CONDITION OF THIS OBLIGATION is that said principal and any co-fiduciary of whom probate bond is required shall faithfully perform the duties of this trust and administer and account for all monies and other property coming into his or her hands, as fiduciary, according to law . . . .\u201d Of the three options, only option 2, relating to the sale and conveyance of real property, had been marked.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Both Sideleau, as principal, and Hartford Fire Insurance, as surety, signed the bond, and the Probate Court thereafter granted Sideleau\u2019s petition for sale, having determined that \u201c[t]he fiduciary . . . presented a bond in the amount fixed by the court, and with sufficient surety . . . .\u201d The sale of Colonari\u2019s real property closed on November 18, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">Thereafter, as a result of Sideleau\u2019s misappropriation of the estate\u2019s funds,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Probate Court ordered his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>removal as conservator and directed him to submit a final accounting, which he presented in January, 2000. The Probate Court subsequently appointed the plaintiff as successor conservative of Colonari\u2019s estate. The court required the plaintiff to post a $10,000 bond with sufficient surety, which she did.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court accepted Sideleau\u2019s final accounting with exceptions, noting numerous deficiencies, including a discrepancy of $250 relating to Sideleau\u2019s sale of Colonaxi\u2019s real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The plaintiff thereafter brought this action on the bond against Sideleau and Hartford Fire Insurance to recover the deficiencies. The case was referred to an attorney trial referee, who issued his findings of fact and decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The attorney trial referee found that Sideleau had \u201cfailed to properly account for $12,017.92 withdrawn from the assets of the estate and owes this sum to the plaintiff.\u201d The attorney trial referee recommended that \u201c[judgment should enter in favor of the plaintiff against [Hartford Fire Insurance and Sideleau in that amount].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Hartford Fire Insurance filed an objection to the report of the attorney trial referee, challenging his legal conclusions regarding its liability for the entire deficiency. The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the attorney trial referee\u2019s report, thereby overruling Hartford Fire Insurance\u2019s objection. The trial court reasoned that \u201c[t]he language of the standard bond form is clear and unambiguous with regard to the duties of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>the fiduciary, who must administer and account for all monies and other property coming into his or her hands as fiduciary according to law. ... As to the boxes on the bond form, it is unclear as to whether all which could apply should be marked, whether there was an omission in failing to mark box number one, whether the [box] marked specifically define [d] the surety\u2019s obligations, or whether the boxes are merely explanatory. Hence, there is an ambiguity in the standard probate bond form. . . . [S]uch ambiguity must be construed against the surety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">With respect to the Hartford Fire Insurance\u2019s claim that General Statutes \u00a7 45a-164<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provides for a specific, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>rather than a global, bond for the sale of real property, the trial court concluded that \u00a7 45a-164 \u201crequires a bond in accordance with [General Statutes] \u00a7 45a-139<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for the sale of property by a principal, unless dispensed with by statute.\u201d The court further concluded that, \u201c[w]hile \u00a7 45a-164 requires a probate bond for the sale of property, it cannot be read as limiting the surety\u2019s liability to [the] same when read in [conjunction with \u00a7 45a-139 (a). The bond issued by [Hartford Fire Insurance] was to secure the faithful performance by [Sideleau] of the duties of his trust, not just the sale of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Hartford Fire Insurance appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Hartford Fire Insurance claims that the trial court improperly determined that the October, 1996 bond subjected it to liability for all deficiencies, including those unrelated to the sale of Colonari\u2019s real property. It argues that we must determine the scope of its obligation under the bond through the text of the bond and the governing statute, \u00a7 45a-164 (b), and that an analysis of these provisions compels the conclusion that the bond subjects it only to limited liability for Sideleau\u2019s misappropriation of $250 in connection with the sale of Colonari\u2019s real property. Hartford Fire Insurance also contends that the trial court\u2019s determination runs contrary to the text of the bond and the standard bond form, and further renders certain provisions of title 45a of the General Statutes inoperable.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The plaintiff maintains that the trial court correctly concluded that, on the basis of \u00a7 45a-139 and the plain language of the bond, Hartford Fire Insurance is liable for the entire deficiency of $12,017.92. Specifically, the plaintiff maintains that \u201c[t]he court correctly concluded that \u00a7 45a-139 ... is the operative statute with respect to [Hartford Fire Insurance\u2019s] liability under the bond . . . .\u2019\u2019In support of her claim of the statute\u2019s applicability, the plaintiff highlights the similar language contained in both \u00a7 45a-139 and the bond, namely, that the principal shall account \u201cfor all monies and other property coming into [his] hands . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 45a-139. The plaintiff also contends that the plain language of the bond reflects that it is a general or \u201cglobal\u201d bond, rather than a specific bond, and that the trial court properly construed the bond strictly against the surety, Hartford Fire Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The issues presented in the present case require us to determine the intent of the parties to the suretyship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>contract and the Probate Court in ordering the $20,000 bond, which we ascertain by examining the language of the bond form and the circumstances surrounding the transaction. See, e.g., <em>Poole </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>266 Conn. 68, 87-88, 831 A.2d 211 (2003). The circumstances surrounding the transaction include the relevant proceedings in the Probate Court, both prior to and contemporaneously with Sideleau\u2019s petition for permission to sell Colonari\u2019s real property. If the terms of the contract and circumstances of the transaction reveal that the parties intended to be bound by a global bond, then Hartford Fire Insurance will be liable for the entire deficiency of $12,017.92; in contrast, if the parties intended to execute a specific bond, then Hartford Fire Insurance will be liable only for the $250 deficiency<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> relating to the sale of Colonari\u2019s real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">When we are called upon to review a trial court\u2019s conclusions of law, our review is plenary. E.g., <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Mottolese, </em>267 Conn. 1, 25, 835 A.2d 998 (2003). We therefore \u201cmust decide whether [the trial court\u2019s] conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Accessory Controls &amp; Equipment Corp., </em>254 Conn. 145, 156, 757 A.2d 14 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">We previously have recognized that \u201c[t]he liability of sureties is to be determined by the specified conditions of the bond .... [W]hen a bond is required by statute, a court will read the statute into the contract between the principal, surety and obligee.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southington </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>254 Conn. 348, 358-59, 757 A.2d 549 (2000); accord <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>267 Conn. 524, 530, 839 A.2d 1250 (2004). More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>over, as with the interpretation of all contracts, we must construe the instrument \u201cto effectuate the intent of the parties, which is determined from the language used interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction. . . . [T]he intent of the parties is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words and . . . the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract.. . . . Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Poole </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 87-88, quoting Ni<em>chaus </em>v. <em>Cowles Business Media, Inc., </em>263 Conn. 178, 188, 819 A.2d 765 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">\u201cA court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity ... . Similarly, any ambiguity . . . must emanate from the language used in the contract rather than from one party\u2019s subjective perception of the terms.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Poole </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 88, quoting <em>Niehaus </em>v. <em>Cowles Business Media, Inc., </em>supra, 263 Conn. 188-89. Moreover, \u201c[t]he mere fact that the parties advance different interpretations of the language in question does not necessitate a conclusion that the language is ambiguous. . . . If the language of the contract is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, the contract is ambiguous. ... By contrast, language is unambiguous when it has a definite and precise meaning . . . concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Poole </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\u201cAlthough ordinarily the question of contract interpretation, being a question of the parties\u2019 intent, is a question of fact . . . [wjhere there is definitive con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>tract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southeastern Connecticut Regional Resources Recovery Authority </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>244 Conn. 280, 290, 709 A.2d 549 (1998); accord <em>Poole </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">An examination of the bond form reveals that the box corresponding to the second option, which \u201cauthorize[d] and empower[ed]\u201d Sideleau to sell and to convey Colonari\u2019s real property, clearly was marked, thereby indicating the restricted nature of the bond. Furthermore, the circumstances surrounding the transaction indicate the bond\u2019s limited scope. We note that the Probate Court waived the requirement of a bond to cover Sideleau\u2019s actions when it appointed him as conservator in May, 1994. Moreover, no evidence was presented to the court, either prior to or in conjunction with the filing of the application for permission to sell Colonari\u2019s property, to suggest the need for a global bond covering all of Sideleau\u2019s duties as conservator. The only bond deemed necessary was the $20,000 bond required by the court in conjunction with Sideleau\u2019s application for permission to sell Colonari\u2019s real property. Although not dispositive, these facts further support the conclusion that the bond was limited in scope. Accordingly, we conclude that both the parties to the suretyship contract, namely, Sideleau and Hartford Fire Insurance, as well as the Probate Court in requiring the bond, intended the bond to cover only Sideleau\u2019s actions in connection with the sale of Colonari\u2019s real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Having determined the nature of the parties\u2019 intent, namely, to secure a bond covering only Sideleau\u2019s actions relating to the sale of real property, we note that the Probate Court\u2019s authority to require such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>bond stems from the provisions of \u00a7 45a-164 (b),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which govern such transactions, rather than the provisions of \u00a7 45a-139 (b),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as the plaintiff contends. General Statutes \u00a7 45a-164 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court may empower the conservator ... to execute a conveyance of such property . . . upon giving a probate bond faithfully <em>to administer and account for the proceeds of the sale . . </em>. according to law, unless the court finds that there is in force, for such fiduciary, a probate bond in an amount and with security determined in accordance with section 45a-139 or unless the bond is dispensed with in accordance with section 45a-169. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the Probate Court properly acted in accordance with its authority under \u00a7 45a-164 (b), and, therefore, we reject the plaintiffs claim that \u00a7 45a-139 rather than \u00a7 45a-164 (b) controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In claiming that the bond is global, the plaintiff fastens upon language in the bond form that provides that \u201c[t]he CONDITION OF THIS OBLIGATION is that said principal and any co-fiduciary of whom probate bond is required shall faithfully perform the duties of this trust and administer and account for <em>all monies and, other property coming into his or her hands, </em>as fiduciary, according to law . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This language, the plaintiff argues, imposes liability upon the surety for all of Sideleau\u2019s misappropriations and not just for those relating to the sale of Colonari\u2019s real property. In relying on this language, however, the plaintiff ignores the limiting portion of the excerpted phrase, which refers specifically to the principal\u2019s obligation \u201c[to] faithfully perform the duties of <em>this trust </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) We believe that \u201cthis trust\u201d logically refers to the box appending to the second of the three options that had been marked, namely, the option indicating the conservator\u2019s power to sell real property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>The Probate Court\u2019s decree, in which the Probate Court approved only Sideleau\u2019s \u201capplication for authority to sell certain real property,\u201d supports this interpretation of the limited scope of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Moreover, to read the terms, \u201cthis trust,\u201d out of the bond form would render them superfluous, in contravention of well established principles of contract interpretation. Furthermore, to construe \u201cthis trust\u201d as encompassing all of the conservator\u2019s duties would render meaningless the three distinct options and accompanying boxes expressly set forth in the bond form. See, e.g., <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Wisvest-Connecticut, LLC, </em>259 Conn. 665, 674, 791 A.2d 546 (2002) (\u201c[t]he law of contract interpretation militates against interpreting a contract in a way that renders a provision superfluous\u201d). We decline to reduce these provisions to effective nullities.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The plaintiff nonetheless contends that the trial court properly construed the bond strictly against the surety, in line with applicable rules of construction. We disagree because, even if it is assumed that some ambiguity existed in the language of the bond form that would warrant strict construction against the drafter, in the present case, Hartford Fire Insurance did not draft the language of the bond form. Therefore, we see no persuasive reason to construe the language of the bond form against Hartford Fire Insurance under the circumstances of this case. See, e.g., <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Advest, </em>Inc., 244 Conn. 732, 755-56, 714 A.2d 649 (1998) (\u201c[A]mbiguous contractual language should be construed against the interest of the party that drafted it. . . . The plaintiffs did not draft . . . the parties\u2019 agreement, and consequently, to the extent that the defendant drafted ambiguous contracts, it cannot now claim the benefit of the doubt regarding the ambiguity.\u201d [Citations omitted.]); see also <em>Hartford Electric Applicators of Thermalux, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alden, </em>169 Conn. 177, 182, 363 A.2d 135 (1975) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>(\u201c[T]he contract was prepared by the defendants. When there is ambiguity, we must construe contractual terms against the drafter.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $250.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\"> Gregoire R.
