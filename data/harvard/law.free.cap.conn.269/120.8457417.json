The plaintiff, Carmel Hollow Associates Limited Partnership, filed an appeal in the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-117a<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>12-119<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from the decision of the board of assessment appeals of the defendant town of Bethlehem denying the plaintiffs appeal from the decision of the board of assessors (assessor) to deny the plaintiffs application for forest land and farm land classification so as to reduce the assessment of its property. Following a hearing, the trial court found for the defendant as to the farm land classification and for the plaintiff as to the forest land classification. The court ordered a reduction in the assessment of the property for which the forest land classification had been sought and a refund to the plaintiff of any overpayment of taxes, with interest and costs, with respect to that property. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court from that portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment that was rendered in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>of the plaintiff, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The parties have stipulated to the following facts. In 1986, the town planning commission approved subdivision p] ans filed by the plaintiff for fourteen<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> building lots on approximately 91.5 acres of land and approximately 13.6 acres of open space. In 1988, the planning commission approved subdivision plans filed by the plaintiff for seven building lots on approximately 39.7 acres of land and approximately 5.9 acres of open space. The two subdivisions are adjacent to each other and are known as Carmel Hollow I and Carmel Hollow II, respectively.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">On October 18,1990, the state forester<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> approved the plaintiffs application for the designation of approximately 106.2 acres within Carmel Hollow I and Carmel Hollow II as forest land pursuant to \u00a7 12-107d (a). The record reveals that the defendant did not appeal from the state forester\u2019s decision to designate the property as forest land as it was permitted to do under \u00a7 12-107d (f). Shortly thereafter, the assessor approved the plaintiffs application for the classification of approximately twenty-five acres of Carmel Hollow I as farm land pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-107c (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>result, all of the land within the two subdivisions was classified as either forest land or farm land on the defendant\u2019s 1990 grand list.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The plaintiff sold lots in the two subdivisions in 1994, 1997 and each subsequent year until 2002. At the time of trial in July, 2002, the plaintiff continued to own four lots in Carmel Hollow I and six lots in Carmel Hollow II.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> All of the lots that the plaintiff still owned remained in a natural state and unchanged in actual use from their use in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In August, 1998, the assessor sent a letter to all of the owners of land classified as farm land or forest land pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 12-107c and 12-107d, respectively. The letter stated that the assessor was in the process of conducting a revaluation of property throughout the town and that the owners of property previously classified as farm land or forest land must complete a new application, as \u201can informational update only,\u201d indicat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>ing the current status of the classified property. The letter also requested that the owners complete a brief questionnaire indicating whether they had subdivi4ed or sold any such property subsequent to its classification. Thereafter, the plaintiff completed the questionnaire and the application and returned them to the assessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In January, 1999, the assessor sent a second letter to the owners describing a new policy with respect to property classified as farm land or forest land within a subdivision. Under that policy, subdivided land on which no lot had been sold would be considered an inactive subdivision and would continue to be classified as farm land or forest land. Correspondingly, subdivided land on which lots had been sold would be considered an active subdivision and would be eligible for farm land or forest land classification subject to certain conditions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The plaintiff applied to continue the classification of its unsold lots on the 1999 grand list as farm land or forest land. The assessor denied the plaintiffs application, and the unsold lots were assessed on the basis of their highest and best use as of October, 1999,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> despite the fact that the state forester had not cancelled its designation of those lots or portions thereof as forest land. The record does not indicate that the defendant ever sought, or that the plaintiff paid, a conveyance tax because of the purported change in use of the property at the time the assessor denied the plaintiffs application to continue the classification. The plaintiff appealed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the board of assessment appeals from the assessor\u2019s decision to deny the plaintiffs application. The board of assessment appeals denied the appeal. The plaintiff then appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 12-117a and 12-119.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The trial court sustained the plaintiffs appeal as to the forest land classification, but dismissed the appeal as to the farm land classification.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> With respect to the property classified as forest land, the trial court determined that, under the \u201cclear language\u201d of \u00a7 12-107d (c), \u201cunless the [state] forester has cancelled the designation of forest land, the assessor \u2018shall\u2019 classify the land as such. There is nothing ... to suggest that the state forester cancelled the forest land designation as to any of the property owned by the plaintiff on October 1, 1999.\u201d Consequently, the trial court concluded that the \u201cactions [of the assessor] in declassifying the forest land and computing an assessment based on that declassification resulted in an excessive assessment and disregarded the statutory provision for determining valuation, specifically, \u00a7 12-107d.\u201d The court thus ordered the defendant to classify all of the property still owned by the plaintiff in Carmel Hollow II and 34.34 acres of the remaining property in Carmel Hollow I as forest land for purposes of the particular assessments under appeal<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and to assess the property accordingly. This appeal by the defendant followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The defendant argues that the trial court improperly sustained the plaintiffs appeal with respect to the continued classification of the unsold lots as forest land because the assessor was entitled to terminate the clas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>sification pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-504h<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> without seeking prior approval from the state forester. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Because this issue raises a question of statutory interpretation, our review is plenary. E.g., <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>266 Conn. 338, 345, 832 A.2d 611 (2003). \u201cA fundamental tenet of statutory construction is that statutes are to be considered to give effect to the apparent intention of the lawmaking body.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Winchester Woods Associates </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>219 Conn. 303, 309, 592 A.2d 953 (1991). \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>the present case, the defendant relies on \u00a7 12-504h, a provision contained in the real estate conveyance tax scheme. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-494 et seq. The provisions that govern our resolution of the issue, however, are contained in the property tax assessment scheme, specifically, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a through 12-107e, which pertain to the assessment and classification of property as farm land, forest land and open space land. It is clear from the plain and unambiguous language of the relevant statutory provisions and from the statutory scheme itself that the assessor was not empowered to deny the application of the plaintiff to continue the classification of its property as forest land without the cancellation of the forest land designation. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The statutory scheme relating to the designation and classification of forest land for tax assessment purposes is contained in chapter 203 of the General Statutes, entitled \u201cProperty Tax Assessment,\u201d and begins with a declaration of policy that encourages conservation of the state\u2019s natural resources when threatened by local development pressures. General Statutes \u00a7 12-107a provides in relevant part: \u201cIt is hereby declared (a) that it is in the public interest to encourage the preservation of farm land, forest land and open space land in order to maintain a readily available source of food and farm products ... to conserve the state\u2019s natural resources and to provide for the welfare and happiness of the inhabitants of the state, (b) that it is in the public interest to prevent the forced conversion of farm land, forest land and open space land to more intensive uses as the result of economic pressures caused by the assessment thereof for purposes of properly taxation at values incompatible with their preservation as such farm land, forest land and open space land, and (c) that the neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>sity in the public interest of the enactment of the provisions of sections 12-107b to 12-107e, inclusive, is a matter of legislative determination.\u201d Thus, the purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a through 12-107e is to encourage the preservation of property designated as farm land, forest land or open space land \u201cby ensuring against the conversion of such land to more intensive uses as the result of higher property tax assessments. \u201d <em>Rustici </em>v. <em>Stonington, </em>174 Conn. 10, 13, 381 A.2d 532 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 12-107b (b) assigns the state forester a central role in implementing the portion of the statutory scheme regarding the conservation of forest land by defining forest land as \u201cany tract or tracts of land . . . bearing tree growth in such quantity and so spaced as to constitute <em>in the opinion of the State Forester </em>a forest area and maintained <em>in the opinion of the State Forester </em>in a state of proper forest condition . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 12-107d (a) further underscores the state forester\u2019s significant role in the conservation of forest land by providing in relevant part: <em>\u201cAn owner of land may file a written application with the State Forester for its designation by the State Forester as forest land. </em>When such application has been made, the State Forester shall examine such application and, <em>if the State Forester determines that it is forest land, said forester shall issue a triplicate certificate designating it as such, </em>and file one copy of such certificate in the State Forester\u2019s office, furnish one to the owner of the land and file one in the office of the assessor of the municipality in which the land is located.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Thereafter, if the landowner so elects, designated land may be classified<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> as forest land on the grand list <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>of a municipality pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-107d (c), which provides in relevant part: \u201cAn owner of land designated as forest land by the State Forester may apply for its classification as forest land on any grand list of a municipality by filing a written application for such classification with the assessor thereof . . . and, <em>if the State Forester has not cancelled the designation of such land as forest land </em>. . . <em>such assessor shall classify such land as forest land </em>and include it as such on the grand list . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Subsection (c) of General Statutes \u00a7 12-107d thus underscores the state forester\u2019s preeminent role, not only in the designation of property as forest land, but also in the classification of property as forest land, by plainly stating that the town assessor <em>\u201cshall\" </em>grant an application for the classification of property as forest land if the property has been so designated by the state forester. (Emphasis added.) Subsection (d) of General Statutes \u00a7 12-107d reaffirms the state forester\u2019s preeminent role by providing in relevant part: \u201cAn application to an assessor for classification of land as forest land . . . shall set forth a description of the land and the date of the issuance by the State Forester of the certificate designating it as forest land . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">With respect to the cancellation of the forest land designation, General Statutes \u00a7 12-107d (b) provides: <em>\u201cWhen the State Forester finds that it is no longer forest land, the State Forester shall issue a triplicate certificate cancelling the designation of such land as forest land, </em>and file one copy of such certificate in the State Forester\u2019s office, furnish one to the owner of the land and file one in the office of such assessor.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>The statutory scheme is silent regarding the role of an assessor in the declassification of property that the state forester has designated as forest land. The fact that the relevant statutory provisions are silent, however, does not mean that they are ambiguous. It is well established that, \u201c[i]n construing a statute, common sense must be used and courts must assume that a reasonable and rational result was intended.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Modern Cigarette, Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>256 Conn. 105, 120, 774 A.2d 969 (2001). The statutory scheme clearly provides that the classification of property as forest land is dependent upon its designation as forest land. The statutory scheme also establishes a procedure to cancel the designation. As we previously explained, this procedure requires that the state forester reexamine the status of the property to determine whether the property continues to warrant the forest land designation. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-107d (b). Unless the state forester receives notice that the use of the property has changed, there is no reason for the state forester to cancel the designation. Cf. <em>Timber Trails Associates </em>v. <em>New Fairfield, </em>226 Conn. 407, 409, 627 A.2d 932 (1993) (state forester issued to plaintiff certificate continuing designation of property as forest land upon notification that owner of record had changed). The statutory language thus suggests that the state forester must be notified of a possible change in use that would trigger the cancellation procedure.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Accordingly, in light of the fact that General Statutes \u00a7 12-107d (c) provides that an assessor <em>\u201cshall\u201d </em>approve an application for the classification of property as forest land if the property has been so designated, and because there is no other provision that gives an assessor discretionary authority to deny such an application, the only reasonable construction of the statutory scheme is that an assessor who believes that the use of the land has changed must request a reexamination of the forest land designation pursuant to \u00a7 12-107d (b). (Emphasis added.) Thereafter, if the state forester cancels the forest land designation because the property no longer qualifies, the assessor may deny the owner\u2019s application to classify the property as forest land. If the state forester does not cancel the forest land designation, the assessor must continue to classify the property as forest land pursuant to \u00a7 12-107d (c). The statutory scheme does not, and need not, specifically identify all of those officials, including the town assessor, <em>who may not declassify property as forest land, </em>because the statutory scheme affirmatively provides that the state forester is the only government official authorized to designate property as forest land and that property so designated <em>\u201cshall\u201d </em>be classified as forest land by the town assessor.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 12-107d (c); see <em>Timber Trails Associates </em>v. <em>New Fairfield, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 417-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">To interpret the statutory scheme as permitting an assessor to deny an application for the continued classification of property designated as forest land would be in direct conflict with \u00a7 12-107d (c). Furthermore, it would defy common sense to grant discretionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>authority to assessors to deny such applications because assessors may be motivated by local financial considerations that are at odds with the underlying purpose of the statutory scheme to conserve the state\u2019s natural resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Such an interpretation also would render meaningless \u00a7 12-107d (b). \u201cIt is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature did not intend to enact meaningless provisions. . . . [Statutes must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Segal </em>v. <em>Segal, </em>264 Conn. 498, 507, 823 A.2d 1208 (2003). If the legislature had intended to permit assessors to deny applications for the continued classification of property designated as forest land, there would have been no need to enact \u00a7 12-107d (b), which permits the state forester to cancel the forest land designation, because the effect in both situations is to preclude landowners from receiving the preferential tax treatment for which the forest land designation is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Furthermore, if the legislature had wanted to grant a municipality or town assessors discretionary authority with respect to the classification of property as forest land it could have done so, as it did with the classification of property as farm land and open space land in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-107c<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and 12-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>107e,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> respectively. Those statutory provisions, unlike the statutory provision pertaining to forest land, grant to the town assessor and the municipality, respectively, discretion to classify land as farm land and open space land upon the application of the landowner. The provision relating to forest land also is distinguishable from the provisions regarding farm land and open space land in that an appeal can be taken directly to the Superior Court from the state forester\u2019s decision regarding the designation of property as forest land; see General Statutes \u00a7 12-107d (f); but there are no corresponding provisions for direct appeals to the Superior Court from the decisions of local officials regarding the classification of property as farm land or open space land. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-107c (d) (contemplating appeal from town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>assessor\u2019s denial of application for classification of property as farm land to board of assessment appeals and subsequent appeal from board\u2019s decision to Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a); General Statutes \u00a7 12-107e (d) (same with respect to municipality\u2019s denial of application for classification of property as open space land). The fact that the state forester\u2019s actions are not reviewable by local authorities underscores the state forester\u2019s crucial role in protecting forest land. Accordingly, we conclude that an assessor may not deny an application to continue the forest land classification unless the state forester has cancelled the forest land designation. This conclusion is consistent with the public policy underlying the statutory scheme and with other statutes regarding the valuation and assessment of forest land.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Section 12-107a, the declaration of policy, expressly recognizes the incompatibility of conserving forest land and the power of municipalities to increase the valuation of property for the purpose of increasing tax revenues. The statutory scheme addresses this problem by (1) declaring the conservation of forest land a public necessity, (2) delegating to the state forester, as opposed to local officials, the authority to designate and to cancel the designation of property as forest land, and (3) <em>requiring </em>assessors to classify designated land as forest land upon application by the property owner. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a and 12-107d. The balance between the two competing interests would be upset if assessors had the authority to deny applications for the classification of forest land because of a perceived change in use. Accordingly, public policy considerations are consistent with our conclusion that the assessor improperly denied the application of the plaintiff to continue the classification of its property as forest land following the assessor\u2019s independent determination that the use of the property had changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Our conclusion is in accord with other statutes governing the classification of property as forest land. See, e.g., <em>Cardenas </em>v. <em>Mixcus, </em>264 Conn. 314, 326, 823 A.2d 321 (2003) (\u201c[i]n cases in which more than one [statutory provision] is involved, we presume that the legislature intended [those provisions] to be read together to create a harmonious body of law\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). General Statutes \u00a7 12-96 permits owners of woodland areas or land suitable for tree plantations to apply to the state forester for classification of such property as forest land if the value of the property is less than $100 per acre. General Statutes \u00a7 12-99 of the statutory scheme discusses the grounds for the cancellation of the forest land classification and provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen any tract has been classified as forest land for purposes of taxation . . . the classification shall be continued as long as proper forest conditions are maintained thereon except as herein provided. . . . [A]ny changed condition which, in the opinion of the State Forester, indicates that the requirements of [the classification] are not being fulfilled, shall be sufficient ground for cancellation of such classification. <em>When requested to do so by the assessors, or whenever he deems it necessary, the State Forester shall examine classified forest land and, if he finds the provisions of said sections are not complied with, he shall forthwith cancel the classification of such land, </em>sending notice of such cancellation to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, the assessor of the town in which the land is located and the owner of such land. Such land shall thereafter be taxed as other land. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 12-99 thus makes clear that an assessor or the state forester may initiate a proceeding to reexamine property classified as forest land if there is reason to believe that the property no longer qualifies, but that the authority to cancel the classification lies solely with the state forester.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>We recognize that the forest planting statutes<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> are distinguishable from the forest conservation statute<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> in certain procedural respects. The forest planting statutes provide for a one step process that requires the state forester\u2019s approval of the forest land classification, whereas the forest land conservation statute sets forth a two step process that begins with the state forester\u2019s designation of property as forest land and ends with the mandatory classification of the property as forest land upon the owner\u2019s submission of an application to the town assessor. The statutory schemes are similar, however, in that both vest the state forester with ultimate authority to determine whether the land in any given case qualifies as forest land for tax assessment purposes. Thus, the forest planting statutory scheme is consistent with our interpretation of \u00a7 12-107d, which requires action by the state forester before an assessor may classify property as forest land, by reaffirming the key role of the state forester in preserving forest land.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Nevertheless, the defendant argues that the assessor properly denied the plaintiffs application pursuant to \u00a7 12-504h, without first seeking the state forester\u2019s approval, because that statute does not expressly require that the state forester determine whether the use of the land has changed or whether the land has been sold, either of which may warrant the termination of the forest land classification. We are not persuaded that \u00a7 12-504h overcomes the plain language of the statutory scheme regarding the assessment of property for tax assessment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u201cWe are constrained to read a statute as written . . . and we may not read into clearly expressed legislation provisions which do not find expression in its words . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>omitted.) <em>Giaimo </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>257 Conn. 481, 494, 778 A.2d 33 (2001).

The statute thus provides that property may retain its classified status until the occurrence of certain events that terminate the classification and require the filing of a new application, these events being the sale of the property or a change in its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In interpreting the statute, we first note that, although \u00a7 12-504h is part of the real estate conveyance tax scheme, there is nothing in its language to suggest that it does not apply to the termination of a classification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>for the purpose of property tax assessments as well. Indeed, General Statutes \u00a7 12-504h directly refers to land that has been classified <em>\u201cpursuant to\u201d </em>\u00a7\u00a7 12-107c, 12-107d or 12-107e of the property tax assessment scheme. (Emphasis added.) Furthermore, General Statutes \u00a7 12-504h provides that those classifications remain valid <em>\u201cuntil\u201d </em>the occurrence of the disqualifying events described therein. (Emphasis added.) Moreover, it would make no sense to construe \u00a7 12-504h as requiring the termination of a classification for the purpose of imposing a real estate conveyance tax, but not for the puipose of revaluing property on the grand list of a municipality. See <em>Cardenas </em>v. <em>Mixcus, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 326 (we presume legislature intended statutory provisions to be read together to create harmonious body of law). We therefore interpret \u00a7 12-504h in the context of both the conveyance tax statutes and the tax assessment statutes, in particular, General Statutes \u00a7 12-107d (a), which provides that, when a landowner files an application with the state forester for the designation of property as forest land, \u201cthe State Forester shall examine such application and, <em>if the State Forester determines that it is forest land, </em>said forester shall issue a triplicate certificate designating it as such . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Under the tax assessment scheme, the state forester is the only official to whom authority is expressly granted to determine whether property qualifies as forest land. We thus conclude that, for purposes of \u00a7 12-504h, property designated and classified as forest land cannot be deemed to have changed in use until the state forester makes the requisite determination that the land no longer qualifies as forest land.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">We also rely on <em>Timber Trails Associates </em>v. <em>New Fairfield, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 407, for guidance in interpreting \u00a7 12-504h. The issue on appeal in <em>Timber Trails Associates </em>was \u201cwhether municipal tax assessors may declassify property as forest land upon the transfer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the property, pursuant to a corporate dissolution, from a corporation to its sole shareholder without consideration.\u201d Id., 408. Following the dissolution of the corporation and the transfer of the property, the state forester, upon notification of the change of the owner of record, issued to the plaintiff, Timber Trails Associates, a certificate continuing the designation of the property as forest land. Id., 409. No conveyance tax was collected and Timber Trails Associates did not apply to continue the classification of the property as forest land. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The defendants, the towns of New Fairfield and Sherman, argued that, under \u00a7 12-504h, the transfer of the property had terminated its classification as forest land, and that, consequently, the assessors were justified in declassifying the property and reassessing it at a higher value. Id., 410. Timber Trails Associates appealed to the Superior Corut, which sustained the appeals,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> concluding that the property retained its designation as forest land and that the assessors lacked the authority to declassify it. Id., 410-11. In affirming the trial court\u2019s decision, we concluded, inter alia, that, under the \u201cplain language of \u00a7 12-504h\u201d; id., 417; because the state forester had continued the designation of the property as forest land following its transfer to Timber Trails Associates, the assessors were required to continue the property\u2019s classification as forest land for tax assessment purposes pursuant to \u00a7 12-107d (c). Id., 417-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In the present case, the defendant claims that the plaintiffs unsold lots have changed in use, but the underlying argument is the same as the towns\u2019 argument in <em>Timber Trails Associates, </em>namely, that the assessors had the authority under \u00a7 12-504h to terminate the classification of the property because one of the two speci-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>fled events allegedly had occurred. See id., 413. Although the state forester in <em>Timber Trails Associates </em>continued the forest land designation after the potentially disqualifying event; id., 409; an event that did not occur in the present case because the state forester was never notified of a possible change in use, the significant common element is that the properties at issue in both cases were designated as forest land when the assessors sought to revoke their classifications. Accordingly, under our holding in <em>Timber Trails Associates, </em>the assessor in the present case lacked authority to deny the application of the plaintiff to continue the classification of its property as forest land because there had been no change in the status of the forest land designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The defendant makes three additional arguments, all of which are unpersuasive. The defendant first contends that it is impractical to require the input of the state forester in decisions as to the continued classification of property as forest land because assessors have direct access to information regarding changes in the condition or use of property that is not immediately available to the state forester. This argument fails, however, because assessors may notify the state forester of any newly acquired information under \u00a7 12-107d (b) and seek the cancellation of the forest land designation as soon as such information comes to light. See id., 409 (state forester, upon notification that owner of record had changed, examined status of property and issued to new owner certificate continuing designation of property as forest land). Accordingly, it is not impractical to require the state forester\u2019s input with respect to decisions as to the continued classification of property as forest land.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The defendant also argues that the change in use of classified property contemplated in \u00a7 12-504h is a limitation on the landowner\u2019s right to maintain the for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>est land classification that does not require further action on the part of the state forester once the disqualifying event occurs. We disagree. Section 12-504h does not suggest that property automatically will lose its classified status when it changes in use. The principal purpose of the statute is to eliminate the need for the filing of annual applications for classification by requiring the filing of a new application only upon the occurrence of one of the two specified events. See <em>Stepney Pond Estates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 431 n.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Furthermore, there is no support in the statutory scheme for the defendant\u2019s assertion that a 1974 amendment to \u00a7 12-107d (a),<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> which purportedly allowed the state forester, in designating property as forest land, to rely on information conveyed to him by an assessor, rather than having to inspect the land in person,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> can be interpreted as precluding the state forester\u2019s direct involvement in decisions to continue the classification of property as forest land when a claim is made that the use of the property has changed. Even if \u00a7 12-107d (a) could be construed to permit the state forester to rely on such information, that provision nonetheless requires that the state forester designate the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>as forest land <em>before </em>it may be classified as forest land by an assessor. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-107d (c) and (d). Accordingly, the 1974 amendment, as interpreted by the defendant, provides no basis for permitting an assessor to deny an application to continue the classification of property as forest land without the cancellation of the forest land designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The defendant also asserts that the assessor properly denied the plaintiffs application because the state forester had no legal authority to designate the plaintiffs property as forest land in 1990. The defendant notes that (1) the property did not meet the statutory criteria for designation as forest land under \u00a7 12-107b (b), and (2) the plaintiff provided inaccurate and misleading information in its application to designate the property as forest land. That argument is irrelevant in the present context, however, because it has no bearing on the issue of whether the assessor had the requisite authority to deny the application of the plaintiff to continue the classification of its property as forest land.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Moreover, claims regarding the erroneous designation of property as forest land must be directed to the state forester, or to the Superior Court, pursuant to the express provisions of \u00a7 12-107d (f),<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> which authorize the landowner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>or municipality to appeal to the Superior Court from the state forester\u2019s approval or disapproval of an application to designate property as forest land <em>within thirty days </em>of such decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The defendant finally maintains that the trial court improperly relied on <em>Timber Trails Associates </em>v. <em>New Fairfield, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 407, in concluding that claims of a misleading application to designate property as forest land, an erroneous designation, or a change of use under \u00a7 12-504h, must be directed to the state forester rather than to the assessor. The defendant contends that <em>Timber Trails Associates </em>did not involve a claim that the state forester was misled by an application, that he exceeded his statutory authority when he initially designated the property in question as forest land, that the land did not meet the statutory definition of forest land or that the use of the land had changed. The defendant misconstrues the trial court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The defendant correctly observes that <em>Timber Trails Associates </em>did not involve a misleading application, the state forester\u2019s authority to designate property initially as forest land, a failure to satisfy the statutory criteria for the definition of forest land or a change in the use of forest land. See generally id., 408-10. The trial court in the present case, however, properly cited <em>Timber Trails Associates </em>v. <em>New Fairfield, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 417, for the proposition that \u201c[t]he clear language of [\u00a7 12-107d] provides that as to forest land, the state forester and not the assessor, determines the designation.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court properly relied on <em>Timber Trails Associates </em>in concluding that the state forester is the only official authorized under the statutory scheme to designate property as forest land.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The defendant next argues that, even if this court concludes that the assessor improperly denied the plaintiffs application, the trial court accepted unreliable testimony as to the amount of land designated as forest land in Carmel Hollow I, thereby producing inconsistent factual results. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">According to the parties\u2019 stipulation of facts, the state forester, in 1990, designated approximately 106.2 acres of land in Carmel Hollow I and Carmel Hollow II as forest land. The state forester did not break down the acreage by lot within each subdivision. The map approved by the state forester, however, shows that eight of the fifteen lots at issue in this appeal consist entirely of forest land and that seven lots consist of both farm land and forest land.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The record discloses that the seven lots containing both farm land and forest land constitute 47.47 acres. Of this amount, the assessor classified 22.53 acres as farm land. The plaintiff contended, however, that the seven lots contained only 13.13 acres of farm land, with the balance of 34.34 acres consisting of forest land.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">At trial, there was considerable discussion as to the amount of forest land in each of the seven lots. The plaintiffs president, H. Sean Mathis, who did not claim to be a land surveyor or engineer, testified that he had calculated the percentage of forest land in each of the lots by using a grid that he had created and placed over the map approved by the state forester showing the areas designated as forest land. The trial court initially sustained the defendant\u2019s repeated objections to Mathis\u2019 testimony on the ground that the plaintiff had not established that Mathis was qualified to make such calculations. When the plaintiff persisted in attempting to introduce the calculations, however, the defendant ultimately agreed to allow the court to accept as full exhibits a map showing the grid that Mathis had used in making the calculations and a document indicating the percentage of forest land and farm land that Mathis had calculated for each of the seven lots. The exhibits indicated that the seven lots contained 34.34 acres of forest land.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court first addressed the farm land issue. The court did not conclude that the assessor\u2019s calculation of the amount of farm land on the seven lots was correct but only that \u201c[t]he evidence did not persuade the court that, in light of the lots sold containing farm land, there should have been <em>more than </em>22.53 acres classified as farm land.\u201d (Emphasis added.) After determining that the assessor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>should not have declassified the forest land, the court then calculated how much acreage in each of the seven lots consisted of forest land. The court concluded that 34.34 acres in the seven lots consisted of forest land, a figure identical to the amount of forest land calculated by Mathis and entered into evidence by means of the contested exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous because, when the 34.34 acres of forest land found by the court is added to the 22.53 acres of land classified as farm land by the assessor, the total acreage for the seven lots is 56.87 acres, more than nine acres greater than the actual total of 47.47 acres. The defendant\u2019s claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cThe scope of our appellate review depends upon the proper characterization of the rulings made by the trial court. To the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it . . . or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>264 Conn. 266, 277, 823 A.2d 1172 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In the present case, the evidence in the record supports the trial court\u2019s factual finding as to the forest land acreage within the seven lots. It was entirely within the court\u2019s discretion to rely upon the testimony of Mathis and the exhibit that was entered into evidence reflecting his calculations. Indeed, the defendant knew that the information provided by Mathis might be used by the court when the court declared during the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ceeding that it had not yet decided, but would consider at some future time, how much weight such evidence should be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The trial court\u2019s findings as to the amount of forest land and farm land within the seven lots also were consistent. The court did not find that 22.53 acres consisted of farm land, but concluded that \u201c[t]he evidence did not persuade the court that, in light of the lots sold containing farm land, there should have been <em>more than </em>22.53 acres classified as farm land.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, because the trial court did not make a finding regarding the actual amount of farm land within the seven lots, the court\u2019s subsequent finding that the unsold lots consisted of 34.34 acres of forest land was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">In this opinion SULLIVAN, C. J., and PARKER, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-9\"> Although the plaintiffs appeal is from the denial of its application for the classification of property as forest land, the underlying claim is that the plaintiffs property wrongfully was assessed according to its highest and best use and, accordingly, that the resulting valuation was manifestly excessive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b140-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-107d provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) An owner of land may file a written application with the State Forester for its designation by the State Forester as forest land.

I disagree. The principles embodied in P.A. 03-154 are applicable in <em>all </em>cases of statutory interpretation, but the act provides for differing approaches to ascertaining the meaning of any given statute depending on the clarity of the statutory scheme of which it is a part. When the meaning of a statute initially may be determined from the text of the statute and its relationship to other statutes, the act clearly provides that extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1. When the meaning of a provision cannot be gleaned from examining the text of the statute and other related statutes without yielding an absurd or unworkable result, extratextual evidence may be consulted. See id. Thus, in every case of statutory interpretation, P.A. 03-154 requires a threshold determination as to whether the provision under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>consideration is plain and unambiguous. This threshold determination then governs whether extratextual sources can be used as an interpretive tool.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b149-7\"> The terms \u201cdesignation\u201d and \u201cclassification,\u201d as used in the statutory scheme, refer to specific actions of the state forester and town assessors, respectively. The \u201cdesignation\u201d of property as forest land requires the property owner to file a written application seeking the designation and a determination by the state forester that the property is so qualified. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\u201cclassification\u201d of designated property as forest land on the grand list of a municipality requires the property owner to file an application with the town assessor to obtain the preferential tax treatment afforded to such classified property.

Subsection (b) of \u00a7 12-107d originally provided: <em>\u201cWhen requested to do so by such assessor or whenever he deems it necessary, </em>the state forester shall reexamine land designated by him as forest land and, if he finds that it is no longer forest land, he shall issue a triplicate certificate cancelling his designation of such land as forest land . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 12-107d (b).

The concurrence asserts that P.A. 03-154 applies only in cases in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>which the statutory text at issue, when read in conjunction with other statutes, is plain and unambiguous. The concurrence then asserts that \u00a7 12-504h, when read in conjunction with \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a through 12-107e, cannot reasonably be regarded as plain and unambiguous because there is another competing interpretation of \u00a7 12-504h offered by the defendant that is not as persuasive as the majority\u2019s, but that is nonetheless \u201cplausible.\u201d The competing interpretation, however, is based entirely on the language of \u00a7 12-504h, without consideration of its relationship to other statutes and, thus, is in direct contradiction to the theory espoused in the concurring opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The concurrence adopts this approach on the basis of the majority\u2019s conclusion that the statutory scheme, namely, \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a through 12-107e, is \u201csilent\u201d regarding the authority of an assessor to declassify property. The concurrence, however, selectively quotes from the majority opinion, which goes on to state that, despite the absence of express language addressing the authority of an assessor to declassify property designated as forest land, the relevant statutory provisions, namely, \u00a7 12-107d (a) through (e), are not ambiguous because the only reasonable interpretation of the entire statutory scheme is that an assessor does not have the authority to declassify property solely on the basis of the assessor\u2019s determination that the use of the land has changed. Accordingly, the concurrence incorrectly represents the majority opinion and then compounds the error by describing as \u201cplausible\u201d an alternative interpretation of \u00a7 12-504h that does not lake into account any of the other statutory provisions that bear on the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b165-8\"> In its memorandum of decision, the trial court identified lots 13 and 14 in Carmel Hollow I and lots 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 in Carmel Hollow II as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>consisting entirely of forest land.

I agree with the result reached in the majority opinion, and with most of the statutory analysis contained therein. I write separately, however, because I do not agree with the majority that Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 03-154), governs the question of statutory interpretation presented by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Public Act 03-154, \u00a7 1, provides: \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d It is no secret that P.A. 03-154 was enacted in order legislatively to overrule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>that part of <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 570, 577, 816 A.2d 562 (2003),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> wherein this court abandoned the \u201cplain meaning rule\u201d as requiring that, in interpreting legislative language, we must first surmount a threshold of ambiguity of the language before considering other sources of its meaning. See <em>Paul Dinto Electrical Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>266 Conn. 706, 715 n.10, 785 A.2d 1181 (2003). Thus, in order for P.A. 03-154 to apply to a particular legislative text, we must first determine that, considering that text along with other statutes, \u201cthe meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results . . . .\u201d Furthermore, in this context, we have defined the term \u201c \u2018ambiguous\u2019 \u201d to mean that the text is susceptible of more than one plausible meaning. <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>supra, 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In my view, this is not an appropriate case for the application of P.A. 03-154, because the statutory text at issue, namely, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a through 12-107e, when read in connection with other statutes, as P.A. 03-154 requires, is not plain and unambiguous. Put another way, the statutory text at issue is ambiguous because the competing interpretation offered by the defendant, the town of Bethlehem, albeit not as persuasive as that offered by the plaintiff, Carmel Hollow Associates Limited Partnership, is nonetheless <em>plausible. </em>Therefore, the text is not plain and unambiguous, and P.A. 03-154 does not govern our resolution of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument rests primarily on General Statutes \u00a7 12-504h, which is entitled, \u201cTermination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>classification as farm, forest or open space land.\u201d Section 12-504h provides: \u201cAny land which has been classified by the record owner as farm land pursuant to section 12-107c, as forest land pursuant to section 12-107d, or as open space land pursuant to section 12-107e shall remain so classified without the filing of any new application subsequent to such classification, notwithstanding the provisions of said subsections 12-107c, 12-107d and 12-107e, <em>until either of the following shall occur: (1) The use of such land is changed to a use other than that described in the application for the existing classification by said record owner, </em>or <em>(2) such land is sold by said record owner.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Several factors indicate to me that, based on this statutory text, the defendant\u2019s interpretation is plausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">First, as the majority acknowledges, \u201c[t]he statutory scheme [of \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a through 12-107e] is silent regarding the role of an assessor in the declassification of property that the state forester has designated as forest land.\u201d Thus, if the statutory scheme is silent regarding a particular scenario, it seems to me that we are required to look to something beyond its text in order to ascertain its meaning <em>as it applies to that scenario.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Second, the title of \u00a7 12-504h indicates that it addresses situations involving the termination of the classification of forest land, which is the factual scenario of this case. We have often relied in part on the title of legislation in ascertaining its meaning. <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Fleet National Bank, </em>252 Conn. 1, 13, 742 A.2d 293 (1999) (\u201c [although the title of a statute is not determinative of its meaning, we often have looked to a statute\u2019s title as some evidence of that meaning\u201d); see <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pondi-Salik, </em>262 Conn. 746, 755, 817 A.2d 663 (2003) (\u201c[t]he title of legislation when it is acted upon by the legislature is significant and often a valu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>able aid to construction\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Third, both subdivisions (1) and (2) of \u00a7 12-504h are cast in the passive voice: \u201c(1) The use of such land <em>is changed to a use other than that described in\u201d </em>its existing classification, \u201cor (2) such land <em>is sold by said record owner.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) It does not say, for example, regarding subdivision (1), \u201cwhen the <em>state forester changes </em>the classification based on its change to a different use.\u201d It is aplausible contention, therefore, that, by employing the passive voice in this manner and by <em>not </em>referring to the state forester as an active reclassifier, the legislature intended to permit the defendant to reclassify land when its current use has changed. Thus, this use of the passive voice is susceptible of a plausible inteipretationthat, under the entire legislative scheme regarding the reclassification of forest land, the local tax assessor, who is the official likely to learn of a changed use, can take official cognizance of that change and tax the property accordingly. The plausibility of this interpretation is buttressed by reference to subdivision (2) of \u00a7 12-504h, which provides that the classification may be changed when \u201c(2) such land <em>is sold by said record owner. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) It would be the local tax assessor who would know when the property has been sold and, therefore, the argument is plausible that the tax assessor may reclassify the land under <em>either </em>subdivision (1) or (2) of \u00a7 12-504h.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">I reiterate that I do not agree with the defendant\u2019s contentions, and that I do agree with most of the majority\u2019s statutory analysis and with its ultimate conclusion that, based on the entire statutory scheme, the local tax assessor does not have the authority to reclassify forest land based solely on the assessor\u2019s determination that its use has changed. I disagree only with the premise of the majority that P.A. 03-154 governs this case because, in my view, the statutory text at issue cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>reasonably be regarded as plain and unambiguous. Therefore, despite the recent enactment of P.A. 03-154, a proper statutory analysis in the present case ought \u201cto consider <em>all </em>of the relevant evidence bearing on the meaning of the language at issue.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 575.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\"> It Is ironic that the legislative debate surrounding P.A. 03-154 specifically indicated that its purpose was to overrule that part of <em>Courchesne. </em>See 46 S. Proc., Pt. 10, 2003 Sess., p. 3193; 46 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 2003 Sess., p. 3326. If we were to read P.A. 03-154 literally, and assume that it is not ambiguous in any way, we would be barred by it from consulting that very legislative history in order to determine that its purpose was to overrule <em>Courchesne.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
