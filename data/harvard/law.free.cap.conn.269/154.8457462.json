Cohen, a physician, and his employer, Associated Women\u2019s Health Specialists, P.C. (Associated Women\u2019s Health),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiff, Linda Maher, following a jury trial. The defendants claim that the trial court improperly: (1) permitted the plaintiffs expert witness to testify regarding the issue of causation in violation of \u00a7 7-4 (b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and our opinion in <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>Porter, </em>241 Conn. 57, 698 A.2d 739 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1058, 118 S. Ct. 1384, 140 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1998); (2) concluded that the evidence presented by the plaintiff at trial was sufficient to support a juiy verdict that the defendants had breached the applicable standard of care; and (3) failed to instruct the juiy that its disbelief of a witness\u2019 testimony did not peimit it to conclude the opposite of that testimony to be true in the absence of other evidence to support the finding of fact. We conclude that the trial court, on this record, improperly admitted the causation testimony of the plaintiffs expert witness. We further conclude, however, that the plaintiff offered sufficient evidence from which the jury reasonably could have found that the defendants had breached the applicable standard of care. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The plaintiff commenced this medical malpractice action in 1997, alleging that the defendants\u2019 negligence caused a delay in the diagnosis and treatment of her cervical cancer such that her condition deteriorated, her treatment options were altered negatively, and her likelihood of recovery was impacted adversely.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the trial court, after denying the defendants\u2019 motions to set aside the verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> rendered judgment thereon. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Cohen had become the plaintiffs gynecologist in 1978, and he had seen her professionally at various times until January, 1996. The plaintiff visited Cohen for routine annual examinations and also consulted with him periodically regarding various other issues involving her gynecological health. During the plaintiffs annual examinations, Cohen generally performed both a Papanicolau test (Pap smear), a test commonly used to screen females for cancer of the cervix and endome-trium, and a pelvic examination. As a matter of course, during her years of consultation with Cohen, the plaintiff had not been provided with the results of her Pap smears and her \u201cunderstanding [with regard to such a practice] was [that] no news is good news.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>On January 6,1995, during the plaintiffs annual examination, Cohen performed a Pap smear and pelvic examination. In his notes detailing this examination, Cohen described the appearance of the plaintiffs cervix as \u201cfriable.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The January, 1995 examination was the first time in his years of treating the plaintiff that Cohen had used the term \u201cfriable\u201d to describe the appearance of her cervix.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is undisputed that Cohen did not perform a colposcopic examination of the plaintiffs cervix during this January, 1995 visit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Cohen subsequently forwarded the Pap smear specimen taken from the plaintiff to Quest Diagnostics, Inc. (Quest), for analysis and interpretation. Quest thereafter informed Cohen that the plaintiffs test results were within normal limits. In accordance with his past practice regarding the plaintiffs Pap smear results, Cohen did not inform her as to the normal findings of her Pap smear screening.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">During the remaining months of 1995, the plaintiff visited Cohen on several occasions in order to discuss and treat various health-related issues. On January 16, 1996, the plaintiff returned to Cohen for her annual gynecological examination. While conducting this examination, Cohen removed a polyp that he discovered in the plaintiffs cervix and ordered a biopsy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the growth. In his notes from this examination, Cohen stated the following: \u201cFriable exocervicai polyp with moderate menstrual flow. Unable to Pap today. Cervical polyp removed.\u201d After having received the results of the biopsy, Cohen diagnosed the plaintiff with cervical cancer<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and he made a notation in the plaintiffs records regarding an \u201cenlarged barrel lesion\u201d in the plaintiffs cervix. Cohen informed the plaintiff of the diagnosis on January 24, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The plaintiff then was referred by Cohen to Peter E. Schwartz, a physician associated with the Yale University Gynecologic Oncology Center. After examining the plaintiff, Schwartz confirmed the plaintiffs diagnosis and recommended that she undergo a radical hysterectomy. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff underwent a type III radical hysterectomy, an appendectomy, and a pelvic lymphadenectomy to remove a cancerous lymph node. Following her surgery, the plaintiff underwent a long process of therapy, which involved chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and she also suffered from sundry complications arising out of her surgery, including a significant wound infection and prolonged numbness of her lower extremities, which impacted her ability to walk.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Subsequently, the Pap smear specimen taken from the plaintiff in January, 1995, was reanalyzed by Quest, and it was discovered that the specimen had been misinterpreted and, in fact, the specimen did reveal the suspicious presence of abnormal cells. The plaintiff then commenced this medical malpractice action, alleging that her cervical cancer should have been diagnosed in January, 1995, and that the one year delay in diagnosis and treatment required that she undergo a far more serious course of surgery and treatment with increased complications.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>At trial, the plaintiff argued that, notwithstanding Quest\u2019s indication to Cohen that her January, 1995 Pap smear had not suggested the unacceptable presence of cellular abnormalities, Cohen should have diagnosed the plaintiffs cervical cancer in January, 1995. In advancing this claim, the plaintiff relied principally upon Cohen\u2019s use of the term \u201cfriable\u201d in describing the appearance of her cervix in January, 1995, a term that he again used in January, 1996, when the plaintiffs cancer was diagnosed. The plaintiff claimed that Cohen\u2019s use of this term, for the first time in his eighteen year professional relationship with her, indicated that he had observed a clinical change in the plaintiffs cervical appearance in January, 1995. Once such a clinical change was observed, the plaintiff claimed, the applicable standard of care required that Cohen investigate further by means of a colposcopic examination. See footnote 9 of this opinion. Although Cohen determinedly disagreed with the plaintiffs assertion that he had observed a clinical change in her cervical appearance on January 6, 1995, at trial Cohen conceded that, had he performed a colposcopy at that time, he likely would have been able to recognize the abnormality present in the plaintiffs cervical cells and may have been able to diagnose her cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. The trial court accepted the jury\u2019s verdict, denied the defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The defendants first claim that the trial court improperly admitted the plaintiffs expert witness testimony of Robert Swan, a board certified gynecologic oncologist, on the issue of causation. Specifically, the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>dants contend that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) pursuant to \u00a7 7-4 (b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, the plaintiff had met her burden of demonstrating that the facts forming the basis of Swan\u2019s testimony were \u201cof a type customarily relied on by experts in the particular field in forming opinions on the subject\u201d; and (2) Swan\u2019s testimony satisfied the threshold requirements for the admissibility of scientific evidence as set forth in \u00a7 7-2 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and as articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The plaintiff claims, to the contrary, that the trial court properly admitted Swan\u2019s testimony because: (1) as an expert qualified in the field of gynecology and oncology, Swan reviewed the relevant medical literature on the subject of cancer growth rates, as well as the plaintiffs medical records, drew conclusions therefrom regarding the evolution of the plaintiffs cancer, and that the facts underlying Swan\u2019s opinion testimony were therefore \u201cof a type customarily relied on by experts in the particular field in forming opinions on the subject\u201d and satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 7-4 (b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence; (2) Swan\u2019s testimony did not implicate the standard in <em>Porter </em>for the admissibility of certain scientific evidence because the testimony was not based on novel or innovative scientific methodology and, therefore, was admissible upon a showing of relevance; and (3) even if a <em>Porter </em>analysis was required prior to the admission of Swan\u2019s testimony, the trial court properly admitted the evidence after its consideration of the various factors articulated in <em>Porter </em>as bearing on the admissibility of scientific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>evidence. We conclude that Swan\u2019s testimony is the type of scientific evidence that requires an individualized <em>Porter </em>inquiry as to its underlying scientific validity prior to being admitted into evidence. We further conclude that, on the basis of the record before it at the time that it ruled upon the admissibility of the testimony, the trial court abused its discretion in admitting Swan\u2019s testimony into evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The following additional facts guide our resolution of the defendants\u2019 claim. At trial, the plaintiff presented, as her sole witness on the issue of causation, the expert testimony of Swan.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In summary, Swan testified as to the degree of difference between the nature of the plaintiffs cancer in January, 1996, when her cancer ultimately was diagnosed, and her cancer as it would have been in January, 1995, when the plaintiff claimed that her cancer should have been diagnosed. When the plaintiffs cancer was diagnosed in January, 1996, it was categorized at the level of stage IB, meaning the most severe form of malignancy was confined to the cervix. See footnote 5 of this opinion. According to Swan, the plaintiffs medical records also demonstrated that the growth rate of her cancer was particularly aggressive.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Swan farther indicated that the starting point for his calculations as to the size of the plaintiffs cancer in January, 1995, was Schwartz\u2019 clinical estimate, taken just prior to her hysterectomy in early 1996, of the plaintiffs cervical lesion as approximately 3 centimeters by 2.5 centimeters in size.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">On the basis of these characteristics of the plaintiffs cancer as it existed in January, 1996, Swan testified that he could determine the relevant \u201cdoubling time\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the her cancer and formulate an expert opinion as to the likely stage of the cancer in January, 1995. In this instance, given the aggressive nature of the plaintiffs cancer, Swan stated that the relevant doubling time period for her cancer was either thirty or sixty days. This period meant simply that the plaintiffs cancer would double in volume once every thirty or sixty days or, when working backwards in time, would have been one half its volume for each prior thirty or sixty day period. On the basis of these calculations, Swan opined that the plaintiffs cancer as of January, 1995, would have been either preinvasive, ranging from mild to severe dysplasia, or, at worst, would have been a stage IA1 invasive cancer with \u201cvery, very early microinvasion, [consisting of] maybe one or two cells at most invading under [the stromal] lining.\u201d See footnote 5 of this opinion. The appropriate surgical response for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>stage IA1 cancer, Swan opined, would have been a conservative hysterectomy, far less serious and with fewer concomitant potential complications than the radical hysterectomy that the plaintiff ultimately underwent in early 1996. During his direct examination, Swan testified that his conclusion was based generally on his education, his experience and his review of the plaintiffs medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">On cross-examination, the defendants vigorously contested the reliability of Swan\u2019s scientific evidence. In particular, Swan testified that he had not performed a literature search for scientific texts on the subject of doubling time in connection with the formulation of his opinion regarding the plaintiffs cancer, and that he previously had not published scientific articles on the subject of doubling times.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In point of fact, Swan made it clear in his testimony that the entire basis for his knowledge on the issue of doubling time was acquired during his prior, noncase specific review of the medical literature on the subject while keeping informed of various issues related to gynecology. Specifically, Swan indicated that: (1) at some point in the past, he had seen articles related to cervical cancer doubling time periods but that he was unaware of \u201cgood\u201d doubling time statistical analyses on cervical cancer growth; (2) the relevant medical literature did not indicate that there is a quantifiable difference among doubling time periods for cancers located in different organs; (3) his opinion as to the growth rate of the plaintiffs cervical cancer was based on the \u201cmore established\u201d statistics regarding breast cancer doubling time; (4) he had not performed any independent analysis as to the reliability of breast can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>cer doubling time when applied to cervical cancer growth rate; and (5) all of his knowledge regarding breast cancer doubling time came from his general review of the relevant medical literature over the course of his career. Although at various points in his testimony Swan indicated that the support for these propositions could be found in the relevant medical literature, he was unable to reference a particular journal, article or author in support of his statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">At the conclusion of Swan\u2019s testimony, the defendants filed written objections to the admission of the evidence, claiming in part that the testimony failed to meet the basic threshold admissibility test for scientific evidence under State v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 57. The defendants also objected to the admission of Swan\u2019s testimony on the grounds that his calculations were inaccurate and his opinions, which were drawn from his reliance on unidentified scientific sources, constituted inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">After conducting a Porter hearing, the trial court overruled the defendants\u2019 objections and admitted Swan\u2019s testimony into evidence. In so doing, the trial court concluded that Swan was qualified in the field of gynecology and oncology and that such expertise afforded Swan the ability to survey the relevant scientific literature, review the pertinent medical records of the plaintiff, apply the principles derived from the literature to the specific facts presented in the plaintiff\u2019s case, and formulate conclusions from such application. After concluding that Swan was qualified as an expert, the trial court found that: (1) other jurisdictions had determined scientific evidence regarding doubling time to be admissible; (2) this use of doubling time by other courts, as well as the \u201cthousands\u201d of scientific articles that use the term, demonstrated that doubling time widely was regarded as scientifically reliable;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (3) Swan\u2019s testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>mony indicated that breast cancer statistics were a reliable indicator of cervical cancer doubling time and that doubling time in general was reliable scientifically; (4) Swan presented his opinion in a reasonably understandable manner that would be of assistance to the jury; and (5) the concept of doubling time had not been developed solely for the purposes of litigation. Consequently, the trial court concluded that Swan\u2019s testimony regarding doubling time was admissible scientific evidence.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u201c[W]e set forth the standard by which we review the trial court\u2019s determinations concerning the [admissibility] of [expert testimonial] evidence. . . . [T]he trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony and, unless that discretion has been abused or the ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, the trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed. . . . Expert testimony should be admitted when: (1) the witness has a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue, (2) that skill or knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>edge is not common to the average person, and (3) the testimony would be helpful to the court or jury in considering the issues.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Decker, </em>263 Conn. 677, 683, 822 A.2d 228 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Beyond these general requirements regarding the admissibility of expert testimony, \u201c[t]here is a further hurdle to the admissibility of expert testimony when that testimony is based on . . . scientific [evidence]. In those situations, the scientific evidence that forms the basis for the expert\u2019s opinion must undergo a validity assessment to ensure reliability. <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 68-69. In <em>Porter, </em>this court followed the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993), and held that scientific evidence should be subjected to a flexible test, with differing factors that are applied on a case-by-case basis, to determine the reliability of the scientific evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Decker, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 683-84.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Following <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 81-84, scientific evidence, and expert testimony based thereon, usually is to be evaluated under a threshold admissibility standard assessing the reliability of the methodology underlying the evidence and whether the evidence at issue \u201cis, in fact, derived from and based upon that methodology\u201d; id., 83; which has been referred to as the \u201c \u2018fit\u2019 \u201d requirement.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The mere fact that \u201cscientific evidence\u201d is sought to be admitted into evidence, however, does not require necessarily that a <em>Porter </em>inquiry be conducted as to the threshold admissibility of the evidence. As we have recognized, \u201csome scientific principles have become so well established that [a threshold admissibility] analysis is not necessary for admission of evidence thereunder. . . . Evidence derived from such principles would clearly withstand [such an] analysis, and thus may be admitted simply on a showing of relevance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>254 Conn. 540, 546, 757 A.2d 482 (2000). Thus, we exclude from the <em>Porter </em>standard the \u201cvery few scientific principles [that] ar e so firmly established as to have attained the status of scientific law . . . [and] properly are subject to judicial notice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Porter, supra, 241 Conn. 85 n.30. Consequently, our initial inquiry is whether \u201cthe [evidence] at issue in the present case ... is the <em>type </em>of evidence contemplated <em>by Porter.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirsch, </em>263 Conn. 390, 403, 820 A.2d 236 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The plaintiff claims that Swan\u2019s testimony does not implicate our <em>Porter </em>standard, and is admissible simply upon a showing of relevance, because: (1) the phrase \u201cdoubling time\u201d has been used in multitudinous scientific articles, as revealed by a search of the Medline database that resulted in \u201cthousands of medical journal articles containing the words \u2018doubling times\u2019 \u201d;<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>doubling time evidence has been admitted in a number of cancer cases from other jurisdictions; and (3) the doubling time methodology is neither illogical nor unscientific. We disagree with the plaintiff and conclude that the principles underlying Swan\u2019s testimony are not so well established as to obviate the need for a reliability assessment pursuant to <em>Porter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">A review of the recent cases in which we have concluded that certain forms of scientific evidence have become so well established that a formal <em>Porter </em>inquiry is rendered unnecessary is particularly instructive in our consideration of the plaintiffs suggestion that doubling time fits within this jurisprudence.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>Kirsch, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 398, 403-404, we concluded that no <em>Porter </em>hearing was required with regard to the results of a hospital blood test performed in order to screen for the presence of alcohol in a patient\u2019s bloodstream. As a basis for our decision, we recognized that the scientific evidence at issue, a blood alcohol test using an enzyme method of alcohol dehydrogenase,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> was universally recognized as reliable and was actually the predominate method of blood alcohol testing in the clinical setting. Id., 403-405. After reviewing leading treatises on scientific evidence, certain state regulations, and the treatment of such evidence in other jurisdictions, we concluded that this degree of acceptance rendered unnecessary a <em>Porter </em>inquiry into the reliability of the evidence. Id., 404-405.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">More recently, in <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Decker, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 687-89, we concluded that scientific evidence regarding the effects of the discontinuation of blood pressure medication should have been admitted at trial upon a showing of relevance, without the need for a separate <em>Porter </em>inquiry into reliability. At trial, the plaintiff in <em>Hayes </em>had attempted to introduce the testimony of a physician who was to testify that, although the defendant physician\u2019s decision that the plaintiff discontinue use of his blood pressure medication did not cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>the plaintiffs subsequent heart attack, the defendant\u2019s decision did cause the plaintiffs blood pressure to rise and resulted in more tissue damage when the plaintiff did suffer a heart attack than otherwise would have occurred if the plaintiff had not discontinued use of his blood pressure medication. Id., 680. We determined that this scientific evidence essentially reduced to three basic principles, \u201cnamely that (1) an increase in blood pressure causes an increase in the heart\u2019s demand for oxygen; (2) oxygen deprivation to the heart causes heart tissue death; and (3) increased blood pressure during a heart attack causes increased heart tissue damage.\u201d Id., 688-89. With no serious debate within the medical community as to their scientific reliability, we concluded that the principles were \u201cwell established principles of the scientific community to which <em>Porter </em>simply does not apply\u201d and should have been admitted into evidence upon a showing of relevance. Id., 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">As these cases demonstrate, our exclusion of scientific evidence from the ambit of <em>Porter </em>when such evidence, and its underlying methodology, is \u201cwell established\u201d is reserved for those scientific principles that are considered so reliable within the relevant medical community that there is little or no real debate as to their validity and it may be presumed as a matter of judicial notice. As we stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 85 n.30, \u201c[w]e . . . acknowledge . . . that <em>a very few scientific principles </em>\u2018are so firmly established as to have attained the status of scientific law, such as the laws of thermodynamics, [and that such principles] properly are subject to judicial notice <em>9 99</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">With this background in mind, we conclude that the concept of doubling time, within the context of cervical cancer, has not been so well accepted within the relevant scientific communities that reliability may be pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>sumed.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Our conclusion does not mean that cervical cancer doubling time evidence is unreliable per se; it simply means that the reliability of cervical cancer doubling time evidence must be assessed on a case-by-case basis in accordance with our <em>Porter </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The methodology of doubling time, far from being well accepted in the relevant scientific field, did not pass through even this litigation unchallenged. The defendants\u2019 expert witness, Stephen L. Curry, a physician board certified in obstetrics and gynecology as well as gynecologic oncology, testified that, in his years of experience, he had never seen any article or study that provided a doubling time period for cancer of the cervix. To the contrary, Curry testified that, because individual cancers grow at vastly different rates ranging from slow to exceedingly fast, the concept of doubling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>time has no clinical application with regard to any one patient or any one cancer. This debate, we believe, indicates that doubling time has not been accepted as a well established principle within the relevant community of gynecology or oncology.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The plaintiff, however, advances three bases for her suggestion that doubling time is a principle so well established in the relevant scientific community that a <em>Porter </em>hearing was unnecessary. First, the plaintiff suggests that a Medline database search revealed \u201cthousands of medical journal articles containing the words \u2018doubling times.\u2019 \u201d On this record, this justification is without merit. The plaintiff has not proffered, either before the trial court or this court, any evidence whatsoever as to the <em>substance </em>of the articles purportedly contained within the Medline database. More specifically, the record reveals no basis on which to conclude either that these articles substantively focus on doubling time, as opposed to a mere passing reference to the term, or, most importantly, that these articles evince that doubling time is well established within the relevant scientific community. Reliance merely on the existence of scientific texts containing certain terms cannot, by itself, establish that a particular principle is well established, in the absence of a showing that the <em>substance </em>of such texts supports the proposition. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirsch, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 398, 403-404 (reviewing substance of various leading treatises on issue of scientific evidence and blood testing).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Second, the plaintiff relies upon case law from several jurisdictions in which doubling time evidence has been admitted at trial. We similarly are not persuaded that these authorities support the plaintiffs suggestion that doubling time is a well established scientific principle in the relevant scientific communities such that individualized reliability inquiries are unnecessary. In her brief, the plaintiff cites, as examples in which courts have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>admitted doubling time evidence, the following: <em>Short </em>v. <em>United States, </em>908 F. Sup. 227, 233-34 (D.

All of these cases involved the use of doubling time in connection with mesothelioma or breast, lung, or prostate cancer; none of these cases involved the application of doubling time to cervical cancer. Moreover, in each of these cases, the scientific evidence regarding doubling time was presented with regard to the same organ that was involved in the litigation; none of the cases involved the application of doubling time statistics derived from analyses of cancer located in one organ to the growth rate of cancer in another organ. Finally, these cases demonstrate a wide variety of doubling time periods; none of the cases indicate the use of the same doubling time period as that employed by Swan, namely, thirty or sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In addition, we also note a number of other cases from other jurisdictions in which the reliability of doubling time, in the context of its application to a particular patient or a particular cancer, has been assailed. See <em>Keir </em>v. <em>United States, </em>853 F.2d 398, 403 (6th Cir. 1988) (expert witness testimony that doubling time for intraocular cancer is \u201celusive, as some grow quickly and others grow slowly\u201d); <em>Waffen v. United States Dept. of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>799 F.2d 911, 922 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Cir. 1986) (plaintiffs expert conceded that lung cancer doubling time was not recognized generally by medical community as method for determining prognosis or modality of treatment; defendant\u2019s expert indicated that doubling time was \u201cwidely unaccepted for prognosis because it was speculative and had essentially no clinical data to validate its application to any one individual\u201d); <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Scribner, </em>369 Md. 369, 381-82, 800 A.2d 727 (2002) (plaintiffs expert testified that doubling times could be used to give theoretical estimate as to date tumor begins growth but that such estimate was not \u201cexact science\u201d because \u201cmany cancers are not truly spherical and . . . doubling times may not be constant throughout the process\u201d); <em>Hebert </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>796 So. 2d 19, 31 (La. App. 2001) (plaintiffs expert testified that doubling time theory is problematic in that it presupposes that tumors are all homogenous cell type with same growth rate while in reality tumors are heterogeneous with different growth propensities); <em>Thor </em>v. <em>Boska, </em>38 Cal. App. 3d 558, 562-63, 113 Cal. Rptr. 296 (1974) (expert witness testimony that doubling time theory for plaintiffs breast cancer was unreliable \u201cin any single human case\u201d because many different factors affect growth rate of cancer). Again, this internal debate within the relevant scientific community buttresses our conclusion that the reliability of doubling time has not been so well accepted that an individualized <em>Porter </em>inquiry is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The plaintiffs third claim, namely, that doubling time is neither illogical nor unscientific, may be rejected summarily as it has little bearing on the question as to whether doubling time is a well established principle of the scientific community. On the basis of these considerations, we therefore conclude that doubling time is not a well established principle of the scientific community such that an individualized <em>Porter </em>inquiry was rendered unnecessary. We reiterate, however, that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>conclusion does not foreclose the possibility that, within the context of a <em>Porter </em>inquiry, doubling time may be demonstrated to be sufficiently rehable such that it may be admitted into evidence upon satisfaction of the <em>Porter </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Having concluded that Swan\u2019s testimony is the type of scientific evidence that triggers the need for a <em>Porter </em>inquiry into its threshold admissibility, we now turn to an analysis of Swan\u2019s testimony under <em>Porter. </em>The defendants claim that the trial court improperly admitted Swan\u2019s testimony because the plaintiff presented no evidence on any of the various factors articulated in <em>Porter </em>as bearing upon the reliability, and threshold admissibility, of scientific evidence. Specifically, the defendants claim that the plaintiff adduced no evidence on whether Swan\u2019s methodology: (1) can be, and has been, tested; (2) has been subjected to peer review; (3) has a known or potential rate of error; and (4) has garnered general acceptance in the relevant scientific community.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">In response, the plaintiff contends that the trial court properly considered various <em>Porter </em>factors and concluded that such considerations weighed in favor of the threshold admissibility of Swan\u2019s testimony. In particular, the plaintiff claims that the trial court properly admitted Swan\u2019s testimony because the evidence satisfied the threshold admissibility standard set forth in <em>Porter </em>in that: (1) the number of scientific articles using the term doubling time and the number of cases from other jurisdictions in which doubling time evidence has been considered demonstrate that doubling time is generally accepted in the relevant scientific community; (2) the methodology of doubling time has not been developed solely for litigation purposes; and (3) Swan possessed sufficient background and prestige in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>area of gynecologic oncology such that he appropriately was permitted to express an opinion as to the use of doubling time within that field. We conclude that, on this record, there was an insufficient evidentiary basis as to Swan\u2019s methodology such that the trial court could assess properly the reliability and threshold admissibility of the scientific evidence at issue. Accordingly, in the absence of a sufficient demonstration of the methodology underlying the scientific evidence, the trial court improperly admitted the testimony of Swan.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Again, we note that \u201c[t]he trial court [generally] has wide discretion in ruling on the . . . admissibility of [expert witness] opinions. . . . [Furthermore] [t]he court\u2019s decision is not to be disturbed unless [its] discretion has been abused, or the error is clear and involves a misconception of the law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Grondin </em>v. <em>Curi, </em>262 Conn. 637, 648, 817 A.2d 61 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 78-80, we expressly recognized that, because the term \u201cscientific evidence\u201d houses such a large and diverse variety of topics, the formulation of a mechanical evidentiary standard of admissibility designed to apply universally to the many forms scientific evidence may take is an unworkable concept. Rather, the better formulation is a \u201cgeneral, overarching approach to the threshold admissibility of scientific evidence . . . .\u201d Id., 80. In accordance with this philosophy, we set forth in <em>Porter </em>a number of different factors, nonexclusive and whose application to a particular set of circumstances could vary, as relevant in the determination of the threshold admissibility of scientific evidence. Id., 84-86. In particular, we recognized the following considerations: general acceptance in the relevant scientific community;<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>whether the methodology underlying the scientific evidence has been tested and subjected to peer review; the known or potential rate of error; the prestige and background of the expert witness supporting the evidence; the extent to which the technique at issue relies upon subjective judgments made by the expert rather than on objectively verifiable criteria; whether the expert can present and explain the data and methodology underlying the testimony in a manner that assists the jury in drawing conclusions therefrom; and whether the technique or methodology was developed solely for puiposes of litigation. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Moreover, <em>Porter </em>also set forth, as did <em>Daubert, </em>a \u201c \u2018fit\u2019 \u201d requirement for scientific evidence. Id., 65, 83. We stated that \u201cproposed scientific testimony must be demonstrably relevant to the facts of the particular case in which it is offered, and not simply be valid in the abstract.\u201d Id., 65. Put another way, the proponent of scientific evidence must \u201cestablish that the specific scientific testimony at issue is, in fact, derived from and based upon [the scientifically reliable] methodology.\u201d Id., 83. \u201c[Although some conclusions can be reasonably inferred from the methodology employed, others cannot.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Thereafter, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirsch, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 407, we indicated that \u201c[t]his [fit] inquiry considers whether the methodology is being utilized in a novel way for which it was not developed originally ... or whether it is scientifically reliable for one purpose, but not another.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Additionally, we recognized in <em>Porter </em>that, \u201c[t]he actual operation of each <em>[Porter] </em>factor, as is the determination of which factors should be considered at all, depends greatly on the specific context of each case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>in which each particular [threshold admissibility] analysis is conducted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 86-87. There is, however, a critical postulate that underlies the <em>Porter </em>factors and indeed underlies the entire <em>Porter </em>analysis: in order for the trial court, in the performance of its role as the gatekeeper for scientific evidence, properly to assess the threshold admissibility of scientific evidence, the proponent of the evidence must provide a sufficient articulation of the methodology underlying the scientific evidence. Without such an articulation, the trial court is entirely ill-equipped to determine if the scientific evidence is reliable upon consideration of the various <em>Porter </em>factors. Furthermore, without a clear understanding as to the methodology and its workings, the trial court also cannot properly undertake its analysis under the \u201cfit\u201d requirement of <em>Porter, </em>ensuring that the proffered scientific evidence, in fact, is based upon the reliable methodology articulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In this matter, the record reveals an inadequate articulation as to the methodology that formed the basis for Swan\u2019s testimony as to doubling time. In essence, Swan\u2019s testimony was based on at least three principles, namely, that: (1) cervical cancer grows in an exponential, structured and calculable fashion; (2) the doubling time of a particular cancer in a particular organ is a fungible statistic in that the same doubling time may be applied in evaluating the growth rate of a cancer located in another organ; and (3) the appropriate doubling time for an aggressive cervical cancer like the plaintiffs, based upon statistics derived from breast cancer studies, is thirty or sixty days. Beyond a vague statement that the relevant \u201cliterature\u201d supported these propositions, no evidence was produced as to the reliability of these propositions or, indeed, to confirm that these propositions have any support in the scientific community whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>The trial court, however, in admitting Swan\u2019s testimony, expressly stated that it had credited his testimony that doubling time is scientifically reliable and that breast cancer growth statistics are reliable indicators as to the growth rates of cervical cancer. Moreover, by admitting the evidence, the trial court also implicitly credited Swan\u2019s testimony that the appropriate doubling time for the plaintiffs form of cancer was thirty or sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The construction of the gatekeeper function in <em>Porter </em>was, in part, a conclusion that trial courts have a role in assessing the reliability of scientific evidence beyond mere reliance on an expert witness\u2019 belief that a methodology is reliable. Here, Swan testified that the sole foundation for his opinion was his review of the literature, but he was unable to support this opinion with confirmatory references. The trial court therefore was unable to conduct an independent analysis of the reliability of Swan\u2019s methodology and was left with bare reliance on his testimony that the literature confirmed his opinion as to the plaintiffs doubling time.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">We note that this is not an instance in which an expert witness seeks to express an opinion, based on practical experience, a review of the relevant literature or otherwise, in which the trial court is able to probe the methodology underlying the opinion in a manner that affords the trial court the ability to make an independent assessment of the reliability of the methodology and the threshold admissibility of the evidence. Here, there was no independent assessment as to reliability because the trial court was presented with nothing more than Swan\u2019s testimony on the subject.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We conclude, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>fore, that, on this record, the trial court abused its discretion in admitting Swan\u2019s testimony into evidence. This conclusion requires a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The defendants next claim that the trial court improperly denied their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the plaintiff failed to adduce sufficient evidence at trial that Cohen had deviated from the standard of care in connection with his January, 1995 examination of the plaintiff. More specifically, the defendants contend that the only evidence presented that Cohen had failed to investigate a clinically observable change in the plaintiffs cervical appearance on January 6, 1995, was Cohen\u2019s use of the term \u201cfriable\u201d in his notes detailing that visit. The defendants claim that Cohen had used the term \u201cfriable\u201d to convey that the plaintiffs cervix had \u201cbled easily\u201d during her Pap smear, not, as the plaintiff claimed, an observed abnormality. In the defendants\u2019 view, to define the term \u201cfriable\u201d as an indication of an abnormal appearance was rank speculation and an insufficient basis from which the jury could have concluded that the relevant standard of care had been breached.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">In response, the plaintiff contends that the evidence presented at trial as to the breach of the standard of care was sufficient. In particular, the plaintiff points to the testimony of Joseph Finkelstein, the plaintiffs expert witness on the issue of the standard of care and qualified as an expert in the field of gynecology, and claims that, as a qualified expert, Finkelstein was entitled to testify that, in his experience, the term \u201cfriable\u201d is used to describe abnormal appearing tissue with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>necrotic component that may break off easily. Further, as a qualified expert, Finkelstein also could testify that the applicable standard of care for gynecologists demanded that, once such an abnormal observation was made, a physician perform a colposcopy. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u201c[0]ur review of a trial court\u2019s refusal to direct a verdict or to render judgment notwithstanding the verdict takes place within carefully defined parameters. We must consider the evidence, including reasonable inferences which may be drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the parties who were successful at trial . . . giving particular weight to the concurrence of the judgments of the judge and the jury, who saw the witnesses and heard the testimony .... The verdict will be set aside and judgment directed only if we find that the jury could not reasonably and legally have reached their conclusion.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven </em>Hospital, 260 Conn. 747, 761, 800 A.2d 499 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">We set forth the following additional facts as relevant to our resolution of this claim. At trial, the plaintiff presented the expert testimony of Finkelstein, a physician board certified in both obstetrics and gynecology. Finkelstein testified that the plaintiffs medical records revealed that Cohen consistently had noted that the plaintiffs cervix presented an ectropion or eversion during his prior examinations, and that such a finding is indicative of a normal cervix. See footnote 8 of this opinion. A finding of \u201cfriability,\u201d however, was abnormal and especially irregular given Cohen\u2019s long history with the plaintiff and the fact that such a finding represented a substantial change in the appearance of her cervix. In the field of gynecology, Finkelstein indicated that the term \u201cfriable\u201d is used to refer to tissue with a necrotic appearance in which components of the tissue may crumble or break apart. In Finkelstein\u2019s expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>opinion, the gynecological standard of care required, in this situation, that Cohen perform a colposcopy and that his failure to do so constituted a breach of that standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In rebutting the plaintiffs allegation of negligence, Cohen testified that he had not observed such a clinical change in the appearance of the plaintiffs cervix during his January, 1995 examination. Moreover, Cohen testified that he did not use the term \u201cfriable\u201d in his January, 1995 notes to express a finding of an abnormal or necrotic cervical appearance, but instead used the term to convey that the plaintiffs columnar epithelium had \u201cbled easily\u201d when her Pap smear was performed. Cohen further indicated that this finding of \u201cfriability,\u201d in the sense that he had used the term, was not unusual either for the plaintiff specifically or for individuals with ectropions or eversions in general. See footnote 8 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In addition, the defendants also presented the expert testimony of Curry on the issue of the standard of care. Curry testified that the relevant standard of care for gynecologists requires that a colposcopy be performed only if Pap smear results are abnormal or when a clinical observer becomes suspicious at the appear ance of a cervix. Curry also testified that, on the basis of his review of the plaintiffs medical records, there was no reason for Cohen to perform a colposcopy in January, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">We conclude that the plaintiff presented sufficient, although not overwhelming, evidence at trial from which the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendants had breached the applicable standard of care. In particular, we are not persuaded that Fin-kelstein\u2019s testimony regarding Cohen\u2019s initial notation regarding friability, which was made years after his professional involvement with the plaintiff had begun, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>and Finkelstein\u2019s testimony as to the common meaning assigned to the term \u201cfriable\u201d in the field of gynecology, was speculative evidence that the standard of care had been breached. In addition to Finkelstein\u2019s testimony, the jury also was aware that Cohen used the term \u201cfriable\u201d a second time in the plaintiffs records: in his notes from the plaintiffs January, 1996 examination, in which Cohen had removed the exocervical polyp from the plaintiff, that ultimately led to her cancer diagnosis. From such evidence, the jury reasonably could have found that Cohen had observed a cervical abnormality in January, 1995. Furthermore, as experts for both the plaintiff and the defendants testified, if such an abnormality had been observed and no further investigation had been conducted, such a failure would constitute a breach of the relevant standard of care. The verdict of the jury as to the breach of the standard of care therefore had both logical and legal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">We disagree with the defendants\u2019 contention that the plaintiffs evidence regarding the meaning of the term \u201cfriable\u201d is speculative because it was not based upon the standard dictionary definition of the term. As the defendant points out, medical dictionaries define the term \u201cfriable\u201d as \u201ceasily pulverized or crumbled\u201d or \u201cbleeds easily.\u201d R. Sloane, Sloane-Dorland Annotated Medical-Legal Dictionary (1987) p. 302; see footnote 7 of this opinion. Finkelstein, however, when asked for his opinion as to the meaning of the term \u201cfriable,\u201d testified, \u201c[w]ell, I\u2019m not gonna give you a dictionary definition, but as a gynecologist, when we talk about friable tissue, we\u2019re talking about tissue that\u2014that has sort of a necrotic component to it, so that, when you touch it, it can literally break off. . . . This is an abnormal type of presentation . . . that is\u2014the adjective friable, as used, at least, in . . . gynecological terms.\u201d Finkelstein further indicated that \u201can ectropion, which can be a very delicate-appearing tissue, is not friable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>It doesn\u2019t, when you touch it, have components where it can crumble or fall off, which is what friability means, from the point of view of . . . when a gynecologist evaluates tissue.\u201d We do not view this evidence as speculative given Finkelstein\u2019s unchallenged qualifications in the field of gynecology and his express qualification that his definition of the term was not its \u201cdictionary definition,\u201d but was how the term is used in practice amongst gynecologists. The defendants were entitled to cross-examine Flnkelstein regarding the dictionary meaning of the term, but it was the province of the jury to weigh the competing definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-9\"> In her original complaint, the plaintiff, Linda Maher, also had named as defendants Quest Diagnostics, Inc.

Seger, Dictionary of Modern Medicine (1992) p. 179. Put simply, the \u201cdoubling time\u201d of a tumor is the amount of time it takes a tumor, through the process of cell division and propagation, to double in volume. In this instance, Swan used the notion of doubling time, not to project the evolution of the plaintiffs cancer after January, 1996, but instead to use reverse chronology in order to estimate the state of the plaintiffs cancer on January 6,1995. In so doing, Swan applied the relevant \u201cdoubling time\u201d for the plaintiffs cancer and halved the size of her cancer in January, 1996, for each such period until arriving at his conclusion regarding the size of the tumor in January, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\"> Swan, however, did acknowledge prior personal participation, in the form of forwarding information culled from his gynecological practice, in the research of others involving tumor doubling time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b184-7\"> See footnote 21 of this opinion and the accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\"> On appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court may have misapplied the burden of proof regarding the admissibility of Swan\u2019s testimony. On two occasions during the <em>Porter </em>hearing, the trial court made a statement in which the court appeared to have placed a burden on the defendants, the opponent of the evidence, to demonstrate the <em>unreliability </em>of Swan\u2019s testimony, instead of placing the burden on the plaintiff, the proponent of the evidence, to demonstrate its reliability and, therefore, its admissibility. Specifically, the trial court, during the <em>Porter </em>hearing, posited: \u201cWell, where in the transcript [of Swan\u2019s testimony] would I see some evidence, some testimony, that [doubling time] is not customarily relied upon [by experts in the field when forming opinions]?\u201d Thereafter, in concluding that Swan\u2019s testimony was admissible, the court indicated that it \u201cfinds that it has not been demonstrated that Ihe methodology underlying [the] evidence is sufficiently invalid to render the evidence incapable of assisting the trier of fact to determine the issues in dispute.\u201d Notwithstanding these isolated statements that appear to advance an incorrect proposition of law, our review of the entire record of the <em>Porter </em>hearing persuades us that the trial court properly placed the burden of demonstrating admissibility upon the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\"> As noted, one of the plaintiffs claims on appeal is that a <em>Porter </em>analysis of Swan\u2019s testimony was unnecessary because that evidence was not based on novel or innovative scientific methodology and, therefore, was admissible on a demonstration of relevance. Although we have used, on occasion, loose language that could be read as supporting that claim; see, e.g., <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Decker, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 683-84; we take this opportunity to clarify that <em>Porter </em>is not so circumscribed and that the standard articulated in <em>Porter </em>applies generally to scientific evidence, unless that scientific evidence is so well established that a threshold admissibility analysis is rendered unnecessary.

Hasan, </em>205 Conn. 485, 490, 534 A.2d 877 (1987) (concluding that testimony of podiatrist as to likelihood that certain pair of sneakers would fit on defendant\u2019s feet was not \u201cscientific\u201d evidence). This line of cases indicates that evidence, neither scientifically obscure nor instilled with \u201can aura of mystic infallibility\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hasan, </em>supra, 490; which merely places a \u201cjury ... in a position to weigh the probative value of the testimony without abandoning common sense and sacrificing independent judgment to the expert\u2019s assertions based on his special skill or knowledge\u201d; id., 491; is not the type of scientific evidence within the contemplation of <em>Porter, </em>and similarly was not within the ambit of our standard for assessing scientific evidence prior to <em>Porter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Although the plaintiffs brief relies in part upon our decision in <em>Reid, </em>we view this reliance as a mistaken conflation of our distinct lines of cases, namely, when evidence properly is not to be considered \u201cscientific\u201d and when the scientific evidence at issue is so well established that further inquiry into reliability is unnecessary. To the extent, however, that the plaintiff does claim that Swan\u2019s testimony is not \u201cscientific\u201d for <em>Porter </em>purposes, we are not persuaded. <em>Hasan </em>and <em>Reid </em>stand for the proposition that evidence, even evidence with its roots in scientific principles, which is within the comprehension of the average juror and which allows the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>lo malee its own conclusions based on its independent powers of observation and physical comparison, and without heavy reliance upon the testimony of an expert witness, need not be considered \u201cscientific\u201d in nature for the purposes of evidentiary admissibility. In the present case, Swan\u2019s testimony involved reasoning, including the level of aggression of the plaintiffs cancer, the appropriate doubling time period for the cancer and the degree of difference between the plaintiffs cancer as diagnosed in January, 1996, and what it would have been one year earlier, that far exceeded the bounds of independent jury observation and comparison. The rationale of <em>Hasan </em>and <em>Reid </em>does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b189-7\"> This particular variety of blood alcohol test involves a process by which an enzyme is added to a patient\u2019s blood serum, producing a colorimetric change that is then measured in order to determine the level of alcohol present in the serum. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirsch, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 403-404.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\"><em> </em>We recognize the disagreement between the parties as to the \u201cmethodology\u201d at issue in this case. In her brief, the plaintiff appears to focus on the \u201cmethodology\u201d of \u201cdoubling time\u201d in a generally broad sense that transcends specific varieties of cancer and particular doubling time periods. To the contrary, the defendants contend that \u201cdoubling time\u201d is simply a label used to express the rate of growth for a cancer, and that the \u201cmethodology\u201d at issue in Swan\u2019s testimony revolves around the determinations he made with regard to the appropriate number of days in the plaintiffs doubling time period and the use of breast cancer statistics in a cervical cancer case. We agree with the defendants. \u201cMethodology\u201d is defined as \u201ca body of methods, procedures, working concepts, rules, and postulates employed by a science, art, or discipline\u201d and \u201cthe processes, techniques or approaches employed in the solution of a problem or in doing something.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1993). As we recognized in <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 63-64, 81-82, the \u201cmethodology\u201d of scientific evidence refers to the reasoning and principles that underlie a particular scientific opinion or conclusion. Accordingly, in this instance, Swan\u2019s methodology refers to the array of principles he employed in reaching his ultimate conclusion that the plaintiffs cancer was at a level of stage IA1 in January, 1995. Included within this methodology are the reasons related to: (1) Swan\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs cancer was aggressive; (2) Swan\u2019s determination as to the size of the plaintiffs cancer in January, 1996; (3) Swan\u2019s conclusion that the appropriate doubling time for the plaintiffs cancer was thirty or sixty days and, connectedly, his rejection of a ninety day doubling time; and (4) Swan\u2019s utilization of mathematics in order to determine the volume of the plaintiffs tumor in January, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b193-5\"> Our own research has revealed several other cases in which courts have admitted expert witness testimony regarding cancer doubling time.
