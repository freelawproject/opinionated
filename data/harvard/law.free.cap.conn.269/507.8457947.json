We conclude that it does not and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The facts are not in dispute. On August 8, 1995, the plaintiff, William Goodyear, sustained injuries in an automobile accident when a truck operated by Tony Gavilanes, the tortfeasor, struck the plaintiffs automobile. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff and Gavi-lanes both were acting in their capacities as employees of the intervening plaintiff, the city of Norwalk (city).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The plaintiff retained the legal services of the defendants, Francis J, Discala and Francis J. Discala, Jr., of Discala and Associates,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to represent him in connection with personal injury claims arising from the accident. The defendants successfully recovered workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a). Section 31-293 (a), however, also authorizes an employee to bring an action against any third person who causes the injury that forms the basis of the workers\u2019 compensation award, and the defendants failed to pursue such a claim against Gavilanes on behalf of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">After becoming aware of the defendants\u2019 inaction and subsequent to the expiration of the two year statute of limitations for negligence claims,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiff filed a legal malpractice action against the defendants seeking to recover monetary damages for breach of contract and negligence. Thereafter, the trial court granted the city\u2019s motion to intervene in the plaintiffs legal malpractice action to obtain reimbursement of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits that it had paid to the plaintiff from any future damages awarded to the plaintiff in his action against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The trial court subsequently granted the plaintiffs motion to dismiss the city\u2019s intervening complaint for lack of standing. The city appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>The standard of review for a motion to dismiss is well settled. We often have recognized that \u201c[a] motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dyous </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>264 Conn. 766, 773, 826 A.2d 138 (2003); accord <em>Blumenthal </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>261 Conn. 434, 442, 804 A.2d 152 (2002); <em>Brookridge District Assn. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>259 Conn. 607, 611, 793 A.2d 215 (2002). Because such a determination involves \u201ca question of law, our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dyous </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>supra, 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">With respect to the issue of standing, we previously have noted that, \u201c[w]hen standing is put in issue, the question is whether the person whose standing is challenged is a proper party to request an adjudication of the issue . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>256 Conn. 557, 568, 775 A.2d 284 (2001). \u201cStanding is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 567-68; and \u201cimplicates this court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 567. A party \u201ccannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless he [or she] has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title or interest in the subject matter of the controversy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 568. The burden rests with \u201cthe party who seeks the exercise of jurisdiction in his favor . . . clearly to allege facts demonstrating that he is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>St. George </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>264 Conn. 538, 544-45, 825 A.2d 90 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The city claims that it has standing to intervene in the plaintiffs legal malpractice action against the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>dants. Specifically, the city claims that, although \u00a7 31-293 (a) does not expressly address the employer\u2019s right to intervene in such an action, the failure of the defendants to file a timely negligence action, on behalf of the plaintiff, against the direct tortfeasor leaves the defendants as substitute third parties. The city thus claims that \u201cthe defendants, as third parties . . . have a legal liability to pay damages for the [plaintiffs] injury\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-293 (a). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The city\u2019s claim raises a question of statutory interpretation. \u201cIn matters requiring interpretation of statutes our review is plenary.\u201d <em>West Haven </em>v. <em>Norback, </em>263 Conn. 155, 162, 819 A.2d 235 (2003). We therefore begin with an examination of the words of the statute itself, as directed by Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 03-154), which provides that \u201c[t]he meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The applicable statutory provision in this case is \u00a7 31-293 (a) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, which addresses the liability of \u201cthird persons\u201d to employees and employers when an employee suffers an injury caused by such persons. General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 31-293 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen any injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>for which compensation is payable under the provisions of [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] has been sustained under circumstances creating in a third person other than the employer a legal liability to pay damages for the injury, the injured employee may claim compensation . . . but the payment or award of compensation shall not affect the claim or right of action of the injured employee against the third person, but the injured employee may proceed at law against the third person to recover damages for the injury; and any employer having paid, or having become obligated to pay, compensation . . . may bring an action against the third person to recover any amount that he has paid or has become obligated to pay as compensation to the injured employee. . . .\u2019\u2019In addition, when an injured employee brings an action against the third person directly, General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 31-293 (a) gives the employer the right to intervene in such action by providing: \u201cIf . . . the employee . . . brings an action against the third person, he shall immediately notify the [employer] ... of the action . . . and the [employer] may join as a party plaintiff in the action within thirty days after such notification, and, if the [employer] fails to join as a party plaintiff, his right of action against the third person shall abate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The issue presented in this appeal requires us to determine whether the term \u201cinjury,\u201d as used in \u00a7 31-293 (a), encompasses the harm alleged by the plaintiff in his legal malpractice action against the defendants. Having undertaken the required review, we conclude that the meaning of \u201cinjury,\u201d as used in \u00a7 31-293 (a), precludes the city from intervening in the plaintiffs legal malpractice action against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In determining the meaning of the term \u201cinjury,\u201d we look to General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>defines \u201cinjury\u201d as \u201cinclud[ing], in addition to accidental injury which may be definitely located as to the time when and the place where the accident occurred, an injury to an employee which is causally connected with his employment and is the direct result of repetitive trauma or repetitive acts incident to such employment, and occupational disease.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the term \u201cinjury,\u201d as used in \u00a7 31-293 (a), refers to a work-related harm. <em>See Doucette v. Pomes, </em>247 Conn. 442, 445-46, 724 A.2d 481 (1999) (\u201c\u00a7 31-293 . . . authorizes an injured employee to seek recovery from a third party, other than the employer, for work-related injuries caused by that third party\u201d); <em>Durrschmidt </em>v. <em>Loux, </em>230 Conn. 100, 103 n.3, 644 A.2d 343 (1994) (\u201c\u00a7 31-293 . . . provides that the employer shall notify the employee of any action brought by the employer against a third party with a legal liability to pay damages for the employee\u2019s work-related injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In his complaint against the defendants, the plaintiff described his injury as the loss of his right of action against Gavilanes based on the defendants\u2019 failure to prosecute his claim against Gavilanes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The injury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>the plaintiff alleged in his malpractice action thus does not qualify as the type of injury contemplated by \u00a7 31-293 (a) because it is unrelated to the plaintiffs work. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 31-293 (a). Furthermore, there can be no mistake that the legal injury that the plaintiff alleged in his legal malpractice action is separate and distinct from the plaintiffs work-related injury because the complaint itself describes and distinguishes the underlying work-related injury for which the defendants were retained to bring an action against Gavilanes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the legal injury that formed the basis of the plaintiffs legal malpractice claim was not a work-related injury under \u00a7 31-293 (a) and, therefore, is not compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Our determination that the \u201cinjury\u201d contemplated by the statute does not encompass the injury alleged by the plaintiff in his legal malpractice action against the defendants is further supported by our construction of the term \u201cthird persons\u201d contained in \u00a7 31-293 (a). General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 31-293 (a) allows an employee to claim workers\u2019 compensation benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>when the employee sustains an injury for which compensation is payable \u201cunder circumstances creating in <em>a third person </em>other than the employer <em>a legal liability to pay damages for the injury </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute further permits an employer, who has paid or has become obligated to pay compensation, to \u201cbring an action against the <em>third person </em>to recover any amount that he has paid or has become obligated to pay as compensation to the injured employee. . . . If . . . the employee . . . brings an action against the <em>third person, </em>he shall immediately notify the [employer] . . . and the [employer] may join as a party plaintiff in the action within thirty days after such notification, and, if the [employer] fails to join as party plaintiff, his right of action against the <em>third person </em>shall abate.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 31-293 (a). As the language of \u00a7 31-293 (a) indicates, the \u201cthird person\u201d to which the statute refers is the person in whom a legal liability has been created to pay damages for the employee\u2019s work-related injury. In the present case, the injury alleged in the plaintiffs legal malpractice action did not arise out of the plaintiffs employment but, rather, out of the defendants\u2019 failure, long after the work-related injury occurred, to prosecute a claim against Gavilanes. Accordingly, the defendants did not cause the plaintiffs work-related injury and, therefore, do not qualify as \u201cthird persons\u201d who have a legal liability to pay for the injuries sustained by the plaintiff in his accident with Gavilanes.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Our case law, particularly Dodd v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>242 Conn. 375, 698 A.2d 859 (1997), supports the view that the terms \u201cthird party\u201d and \u201cthird person,\u201d in the context of \u00a7 31-293 (a), refer to the <em>actual </em>tortfeasor who caused the work-related injury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>See id., 383, citing <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 533, 537, 582 A.2d 1174 (1990) (construing \u00a7 31-293 to allow employers to intervene in actions against tortfeasors); <em>Stavola </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>136 Conn. 670, 677, 73 A.2d 831 (1950) (employer\u2019s right of reimbursement under predecessor statute to \u00a7 31-293 based on theory that employer \u201chas satisfied an obligation to his employee which was primarily the obligation of the tort feasor\u201d); <em>Stulginski </em>v. <em>Cizauskas, </em>125 Conn. 293, 298, 5 A.2d 10 (1939) (predecessor to \u00a7 31-293 allowed employer to seek reimbursement from \u201cthird party who commits . . . tort\u201d); <em>Geraty </em>v. <em>Kaufman, </em>115 Conn. 563, 568, 162 A. 33 (1932) (referring to third person in predecessor to \u00a7 31-293 as \u201cwrongdoer\u201d). In <em>Dodd, </em>we also noted that \u201cthe legislature [has] failed to amend \u00a7 31-293 (a) despite past decisions by this court using the terms \u2018third party\u2019 and \u2018tortfeasor\u2019 interchangeably.\u201d <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">We further note that, if we were to accept the city\u2019s interpretation of the statute, not only would the city be permitted to <em>intervene </em>in the plaintiffs legal malpractice action against the defendants, but it also necessarily would be permitted to bring an action against the defendants <em>directly. </em>See General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 31-293 (a) (permitting employer to intervene in employee\u2019s action against third person in whom legal liability has been created or to bring direct action against such person). Such an interpretation would require us to ignore our precedent that, \u201c[a]s a general rule, attorneys are not liable to persons other than their clients for the negligent rendering of services.\u201d <em>Krawczyk </em>v. <em>Stingle, </em>208 Conn. 239, 244, 543 A.2d 733 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>We also bear in mind that, because the provisions of \u00a7 31-293 (a) allowing an employer \u201cto bring or to intervene in an action against a third party is a clear deviation from the common law\u201d; <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 242 Conn. 383; this statute, as with other statutes in derogation of the common law, \u201cshould receive a strict construction and is not to be extended, modified, repealed or enlarged in its scope by the mechanics of [statutory] construction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 379-80. Thus, \u201c[the] statutory grant of right must be . . . limited to those matters clearly within its scope.\u201d Id., 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The city concedes that, although the plaintiffs claim for damages against the defendants includes compensation for all of the personal injuries and damages caused by the motor vehicle accident, \u201cthe malpractice defendants were not directly or immediately hable for the injuries suffered by [the plaintiff] . . . .\u201d The city nonetheless asserts that, because the measure of damages arising from the legal malpractice action is similar to the measure of damages stemming from the work-related injury caused by Gavilanes, the defendants are third persons within the meaning of \u00a7 31-293 (a) and \u201chave a legal liability to pay damages for the [work-related] injury.\u201d The concept of \u201cdamages,\u201d however, is distinct from the legal injury<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> from which damages arise. E.g., <em>Oklahoma City </em>v. <em>Hopcus, </em>174 Okla. 186, 187-88, 50 P.2d 216 (1935) (\u201c[t]here is a clear distinction between injury and damages\u201d); <em>North Vernon </em>v. <em>Voegler, </em>103 Ind. 314, 319, 2 N.E. 821 (1885) (\u201c[\u2018Injury\u2019 and \u2018damages\u2019] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>are . . . words of widely different meaning .... [T]hey describe essentially different things.\u201d). \u201c \u2018The word \u201cinjury\u201d denotes the illegal act; the term \u201cdamages\u201d means the sum recoverable as amends for the wrong. The one is the legal wrong to be redressed, the other the scale or measure of recovery.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oklahoma City </em>v. <em>Hopcus, </em>supra, 188; see also <em>American Stevedores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Porello, </em>330 U.S. 446, 450 n.6, 67 S. Ct. 847, 91 L. Ed. 1011 (1947) (term \u201cdamages\u201d connotes \u201ca compensation in money for a loss or damage\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). \u201cDamages flow from an injury\u201d; 4 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 902, comment (a), p. 453 (1979); and the mere fact that a similar measure of damages may flow from two different injuries, as in the present case, does not convert liability for damages stemming from one injury into liability for damages stemming from the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Because the injury alleged by the plaintiff in his legal malpractice action is distinct from the injury that the plaintiff had sustained in the motor vehicle accident, the damages resulting from the former cannot be equated with the damages stemming from the latter, even though the measure of the damages may be similar. Consequently, we reject the city\u2019s argument that the defendants qualify as \u201cthird persons\u201d other than the employer who are legally liable for the plaintiffs work-related injury pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The city further argues that, \u201c[t]he defendants, in effect, are surrogates for the [third person], stepping into [such person\u2019s] shoes insofar as liability for damages from the injury [is] concerned.\u201d We reject this argument; because, as this court previously has observed in a similar context, \u201cthe mere fact that the [defendant\u2019s] obligation to the [plaintiff] is measured by the damages caused by the tortfeasor does not, of itself, transform the [defendant] into a surrogate for the tortfeasor for the purposes of \u00a7 31-293 (a).\u201d <em>Dodd </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 242 Conn. 385. Accordingly, the \u201cinjury\u201d that formed the basis of the plaintiffs legal malpractice action and the \u201cthird persons\u201d allegedly responsible for that injury do not fall within the ambit of \u00a7 31-293 (a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The city thus has not sustained its burden of demonstrating that it has standing under \u00a7 31-293 (a) to intervene in the plaintiffs legal malpractice action against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The city also argues that a construction of \u00a7 31-293 (a) precluding it from intervening in the plaintiffs malpractice action would entitle the plaintiff to a double recovery in contravention of public policy. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">As we previously have noted, General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 31-293 (a) provides that \u201cany employer having paid, or having become obligated to pay, compensation . . . may bring an action against the third person to recover any amount that he has paid or has become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>obligated to pay as compensation to the injured employee.\u201d Furthermore, the employer generally must bring such an action within two years. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-584. We repeatedly have recognized that a goal of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is to prevent an injured employee\u2019s double recoveiy for the same injury. E.g., <em>Cardenas </em>v. <em>Mixcus, </em>264 Conn. 314, 326, 823 A.2d 321 (2003); <em>King </em>v. <em>Sultar, </em>253 Conn. 429, 445, 754 A.2d 782 (2000); <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 242 Conn. 387. Notwithstanding this goal and the employer\u2019s corresponding right of action, however, we also have held that, \u201c[ajlthough one purpose of \u00a7 31-293 is to avoid double recovery, it does not protect those who are less than vigilant in safeguarding their own legal rights.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Skitromo </em>v. <em>Meriden Yellow Cab Co., </em>204 Conn. 485, 490, 528 A.2d 826 (1987). Thus, those employers who refrain from exercising their rights under \u00a7 31-293 (a) within the applicable time period and \u201cwho fail to avail themselves of [the statute\u2019s] benefits for no justifiable reason\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id.; cannot invoke the policy against double recoveiy as justification for reimbursement after their rights have expired through inaction. See <em>Pokorny </em>v. <em>Getta\u2019s Garage, </em>219 Conn. 439, 461-62, 594 A.2d 446 (1991). In such cases, we have maintained that \u201cthe employee [is] permitted to insulate himself from his employer\u2019s untimely claim for reimbursement out of his third party recovery\u201d; id., 462; and that \u201c[a]ny unfairness . . . [effectuated by a double recovery] is due to the [party\u2019s] own failure to comply with the statutory timetable.\u201d <em>Skitromo </em>v. <em>Meriden Yellow Cab Co., </em>supra, 490.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>In the present case, the city, by its own admission, voluntarily elected to forgo bringing a direct action against Gavilanes. Had the city desired to recover directly from Gavilanes for its payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the plaintiff, it could have, and should have, done so within the time prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations. As the city elected to forfeit this right, thereby creating the circumstance under which a double recovery could become possible, it cannot now seek a backdoor entry to the recovery of th\u00e9 compensation benefits it has paid to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We therefore reject the city\u2019s argument that a construction of \u00a7 31-293 (a) barring its intervention in the plaintiffs malpractice case would result in an impermissible double recovery in contravention of the policies underlying the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The city relies on <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Lighthouse Restaurant, </em>246 Conn. 156, 169, 716 A.2d 71 (1998), for the proposition that \u201cthis court has previously rejected the argument that an employer should not be permitted to intervene in an employee\u2019s third party action after the running of the two year statute of limitations because the employer could have timely filed its own independent action but did not.\u201d We find the facts of <em>Nichols </em>inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In <em>Nichols, </em>the employer appealed from the judgment of the Appellate Court; see id., 161; which concluded that \u201can employer\u2019s timely intervention under \u00a7 31-293 (a) does not extend or toll the applicable [two year] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>statute of limitations.\u201d Id., 159, citing <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Lighthouse Restaurant, Inc., 46 </em>Conn. App. 712, 718, 700 A.2d 114 (1997). The employee fell and sustained injuries in the course of employment on August 20, 1991, at a restaurant operated by the third party tortfeasor. <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Lighthouse Restaurant, Inc., </em>supra, 246 Conn. 159. Thereafter, the employee brought a negligence action against the third party tortfeasor on August 4, 1993, pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a); id.; sixteen days prior to the expiration of the two year statute of limitations applicable to such actions. See id., citing General Statutes \u00a7 52-584. Upon proper notice from the employee, the employer intervened in the employee\u2019s negligence action on September 1,1993. Id. Although the employer intervened within thirty days of the employee\u2019s notice of the action, as \u00a7 31-293 (a) requires, it nevertheless did so after the expiration of the two year statute of limitations. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Upon these facts, we reversed the judgment of Appellate Court; id., 170; and held that \u201can intervening employer\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 31-293 (a) tolls the statute of limitations if an employee had timely filed a claim against a third party tortfeasor.\u201d Id., 165. We found it \u201csignificant\u201d that allowing the employer to intervene under the facts of that case would result in \u201ctollfing] the statute of limitations for, at most, thirty days.\u201d Id., 166-67. Moreover, we stated that \u201cthe strong public policy against double recovery outweighs any remote possibility of prejudice to a third party tortfeasor that could arise from a thirty day tolling of the applicable statute of limitations.\u201d Id., 168. Thus, we concluded that \u00a7 31-293 (a) permits an employer to intervene in an employee\u2019s timely action against the tortfeasor when the employer intervenes within thirty days of timely notice by the employee, as required by \u00a7 31-293 (a), regardless of whether the employer\u2019s intervention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>occurs after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. See id., 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Our holding in <em>Nichols </em>presupposes the existence of certain facts that do not exist in the present case, specifically, that: (1) the injured employee has filed an action against the <em>third person, </em>who caused a <em>compen-sable injury </em>under \u00a7 31-293 (a), within the time period prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations; and (2) the employer timely has intervened in such action pursuant to the thirty day timetable set forth in \u00a7 31-293 (a). As neither of these circumstances exists in the present case, our holding in <em>Nichols </em>is inapposite. Accordingly, we reject the city\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The city also relies on <em>Paternostro </em>v. <em>Edward Coon Co., </em>217 Conn. 42, 583 A.2d 1293 (1991), <em>Enquist </em>v. <em>General Datacom, </em>218 Conn. 19, 587 A.2d 1029 (1991), and <em>Schiano </em>v. <em>Bliss Exterminating Co., </em>260 Conn. 21, 792 A.2d 835 (2002), for the propositions that, \u201c [historically this court has accepted the underlying legislative purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act as compelling evidence in construing the act,\u201d and that \u201c[tjhese earlier decisions support that our act should be liberally construed to serve the legislative intent.\u201d Although we agree with the city that we previously have considered the goal of preventing double recovery when construing legislation in these and other cases; e.g., <em>King </em>v. <em>Sultar, </em>253 Conn. 429, 444-45, 754 A.2d 782 (2000); <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 242 Conn. 387; <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>218 Conn. 531, 570, 590 A.2d 914 (1991); <em>Enquist </em>v. <em>General Datacom, </em>supra, 26; <em>Paternostro </em>v. <em>Edward Coon Co., </em>supra, 49; see also <em>Schiano </em>v. <em>Bliss Exterminating Co., </em>supra, 45; we do not agree that this means that the policy against double recovery compels us to recognize the city\u2019s right to intervene in the plaintiffs legal malpractice action in light of the city\u2019s failure to exercise its rights under \u00a7 31-293 (a). The city, unlike the intervening plaintiffs in <em>Paternostro, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number><em>Enquist </em>and <em>Schiano, </em>sat on its rights by electing not to avail itself of the opportunity to bring an action directly against Gavilanes, the tortfeasor, within the time period prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations. Thus, while we seek to give effect to the goal of preventing double recovery, we cannot do so when an employer allows the very right that is designed to advance this goal to abate. Accordingly, we reject the city\u2019s double recovery argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The city also argues that our holding in <em>Dodd </em>\u201cis not controlling precedent for affirming the trial court ruling.\u201d The city contends that <em>Dodd </em>does not support the denial of intervention in the plaintiffs legal malpractice action because the court in <em>Dodd </em>\u201crelied, not on the pure language of ... [\u00a7 31-293 (a)], but instead examined: (1) the basis for the workers\u2019 compensation benefit system, (2) the policy reasons for permitting an employer to recover compensation payments made, and (3) the contractual nature of an uninsured motorist action.\u201d Thus, the city asserts that the court in <em>Dodd </em>\u201cwent beyond the language [of \u00a7 31-293 (a)] to determine [its] meaning\u201d and argues that, contrary to the facts in <em>Dodd, </em>in the present case, \u201c[n]o statute or regulation exists to limit a recovery by the plaintiff in a legal malpractice action because of workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid, other than \u00a7 31-293 (a) . . . .\u201d Accordingly, the city maintains that, barring its intervention, the plaintiff will obtain a double recovery for his injuries. This argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 31-293 (a) correctly relies on both the text of the statute itself and on <em>Dodd </em>for the proposition that the term \u201cthird person,\u201d as used in \u00a7 31-293 (a), refers to the actual tortfeasor who caused the work-related injury. See <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 242 Conn. 383. The employer in <em>Dodd </em>appealed from the judgment of the trial court granting the motion of the defendant insurance com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>pany to strike the employer\u2019s intervening complaint in an action brought by the plaintiff employee against the defendant to recover uninsured motorist benefits for injuries sustained in an automobile accident. See id., 378. The principal issue in <em>Dodd </em>was whether the employer could obtain reimbursement for workers\u2019 compensation benefits it had paid to the employee pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a) from benefits awarded to the employee under his uninsured motorist policy. Id., 376-77. Although the plaintiffs legal malpractice action does not raise issues involving contractual liability, the present case is similar to <em>Dodd </em>in that the employers in both cases attempted to obtain reimbursement for benefits awarded to the injured employee from sources other than the tortfeasor. Moreover, the fact that the uninsured motorist policy in <em>Dodd </em>may have contained a setoff provision to prevent the plaintiff from receiving a double recovery is irrelevant in the present context, which is not governed by all of the statutory and regulatory provisions that were operative in <em>Dodd. </em>Accordingly, <em>Dodd </em>properly serves as precedent for our conclusion in the present case that the term \u201cthird person,\u201d as used in \u00a7 31-293 (a), must be construed to mean the actual tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The city further urges us to follow decisions in other jurisdictions. The city specifically argues that, although courts in other jurisdictions have addressed the issue of granting the employer\u2019s subrogation rights with conflicting results, \u201cthe better reasoned decisions have upheld the policy against a double recovery, rejecting an overly literalistic interpretation of the statutes.\u201d We decline the city\u2019s invitation to follow decisions in other jurisdictions with contrary holdings, however, when our own statutes and case law are clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-12\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 31-293 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen any ii\\jury for which compensation is payable under the provisions of this chapter has been sustained under circumstances creating in a third person other than the employer a legal liability to pay damages for the injury, the injured employee may claim compensation under the provisions of this chapter, but the payment or award of compensation shall not affect the claim or right of action of the injured employee against the third person, but the injured employee may proceed at law against the third person to recover damages for the injury; and any employer having paid, or having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>become obligated to pay, compensation under the provisions of this chapter may bring an action against the third person to recover any amount that he has paid or has become obligated to pay as compensation to the iryured employee. If either the employee or the employer brings an action against the third person, he shall immediately notify the other, in writing, by personal presentation or by registered or certified mail, of the action and of the name of the court to which the writ is returnable, and the other may join as a party plaintiff in the action within thirty days after such notification, and, if the other fails to join as a party plaintiff, his right of action against 1he third person shall abate. In any case in which an employee brings an action against a third party in accordance with the provisions of this section, and the employer is a party defendant in the action, the employer may join as a party plaintiff in the action. The bringing of any action against an employer shall not constitute not ice to the employer within the meaning of this section. If the employer and the employee join as parties plaintiff in the action and any damages are recovered, the damages shall be so apportioned that the claim of the employer, as defined in this section, shall take precedence over that of the injured employee in the proceeds of the recovery, after the deduction of reasonable and necessary expenditures, including attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred by the employee in effecting the recovery. The rendition of a judgment in favor of the employee or the employer against the third party shall not terminate the employer\u2019s obligation to make further compensation which the commissioner thereafter deems payable to the iryured employee. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">All future references in this opinion to \u00a7 31-293 (a) are to the statute as revised to 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\"> The plaintiffs complaint also refers to the defendants\u2019 law firm as the Law Office of Francis J.
