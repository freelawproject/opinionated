Following a hearing, the trial court concluded that, because the parties finalized the agreement at issue in this case after October 1,1999, General Statutes \u00a7 42-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>158l (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which nullifies lien waiver provisions in construction contracts created on or after October 1,1999, applied to nullify the mechanic\u2019s lien waiver signed by the defendant. On appeal to this court, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly: (1) shifted the burden of proof to the plaintiff in derogation of General Statutes \u00a7 49-37 (b) (5)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by not requiring the defendant first to show probable cause to sustain the mechanic\u2019s lien; and (2) applied the parol evidence rale to exclude extrinsic evidence of conduct that would have established that the parties\u2019 agreement had been formed prior to October 1, 1999, and therefore was within the purview of \u00a7 42-158l (a). The defendant maintains that the plaintiff explicitly waived its right to have the defendant proceed first at trial and further contends that the trial court properly excluded the extrinsic evidence pursuant to the parol evidence rale.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree with the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>dant on both claims, and we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. On July 5, 1998, ABB Power Generation, Ltd., a Swiss corporation and the predecessor in interest of the plaintiff, entered into a long-term supply agreement (supply agreement) with Balcke-Durr GmbH, a German corporation and the predecessor in interest of the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The supply agreement functioned as an umbrella agreement; it created no project-specific contractual obligations, but set certain standards and parameters relating to equipment that the defendant, as the supplier, would manufacture and supply to the plaintiff for use in several power plant construction projects that the plaintiff was to undertake. The supply agreement did not obligate the plaintiff to purchase any equipment from the defendant. Section 6.1 of the supply agreement provided that an obligation to purchase equipment would be established by a purchase order issued by the plaintiff that was to be signed and returned by the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 1 of the supply agreement also defined the following terms specifically: \u201c[1] \u2018Acknowledgement\u2019 shall mean the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>[defendant\u2019s] final acceptance of the Purchase Order(s). [2] \u2018Agreement\u2019 shall mean the Long Term Supply Agreement and Purchase Order(s) setting forth the Works,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> including all Documents incoiporated therein by reference . . . [and] [3] \u2018Purchase Order\u2019 shall mean the Document issued by [the plaintiff] and entitled \u2018Order\u2019, by which the Agreement come[s] into effect and force.\u201d The supply agreement also contained the following lien waiver provision, setforthin \u00a7 19.2: \u201c[The defendant] hereby waives for himself, his successors in interest and assigns, and for all subcontractors, vendors, suppliers, etc., their successors in interest and assigns for all claim or right of lien upon [the plaintiff s] or [its] Employer\u2019s property or any part thereof as a result of the furnishing of labour and/or material under the terms of the Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Pursuant to the supply agreement, the parties ultimately entered into five purchase orders for five power plant projects, including the project on Lake Road in the town of Killingly (Lake Road project). On September 27, 1999, the plaintiff issued a signed, proposed purchase order for the Lake Road project (Lake Road purchase order), to the defendant. The Lake Road purchase order provided: \u201cPlease indicate your acceptance of this order subject to the terms and conditions as shown on the face and reverse side and the required shipping schedule by signing after the words \u2018accepted by\u2019 and returning this acknowledgement . . . .\u201d The plaintiff also appended purchase order notes and plant-related purchase conditions to the Lake Road purchase order. The purchase order notes specifically provided that, \u201c [the Lake Road purchase order] and its integrated specifications and documents constitute the entire agreement between [the plaintiff] and [the defendant] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>and replaces all previous and actual verbal or written communications and agreements.\u201d The defendant received the Lake Road purchase order and accompanying documents on October 7, 1999. The defendant thereafter modified the terms of the Lake Road purchase order, and returned a signed, acknowledged copy to the plaintiff on October 15, 1999.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">By the summer of 2000, the parties had commenced arbitration to resolve a dispute regarding the Lake Road project. Thereafter, on February 12,2002, the defendant recorded a mechanic\u2019s lien against the property on which the Lake Road project was to be constructed to secure payment for labor, material and services in the amount of $17,004,142.82. The plaintiff then posted a surety bond in the amount of $20,400,000 as a substitute for the lien and, pursuant to \u00a7 49-37 (b) (1),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> filed an application in the Superior Court to dissolve or reduce the bond. The defendant moved to stay the plaintiffs application to dissolve or reduce the bond pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-409,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> until resolution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>pending arbitration. The trial court granted the stay as to the claim for reduction, but denied the stay as to the requested dissolution of the bond.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court also ordered further memoranda and oral argument regarding whether the defendant effectively had waived its right to assert a mechanic\u2019s lien through the lien waiver provision contained in \u00a7 19.2 of the supply agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">At oral argument before the trial court, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant, by the express terms of the lien waiver provision, had waived its right to irle a mechanic\u2019s lien. The defendant maintained that \u00a7 42-158/ (a), which applies to construction contracts entered into on or after October 1, 1999, rendered the lien waiver provision \u201cvoid and of no effect.\u201d The trial court concluded that, because the agreement between the parties was established on October 15, 1999, when the defendant returned the acknowledged Lake Road purchase order, \u00a7 42-158l (a) did apply and rendered the lien waiver provision \u201cvoid and of no effect.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the trial court refused to admit evidence of conduct that had occurred prior to the defendant\u2019s acceptance of the Lake Road purchase order pursuant to the parol evidence rule. Accordingly, the trial court denied the plaintiffs application to dissolve the bond and rendered judgment in favor of the defendant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The plaintiff appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court. We thereafter transferred the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The plaintiffs first claim on appeal is that the trial court applied an incorrect burden of proof to its application to dissolve the bond substituted for the mechanic\u2019s lien. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly bypassed the threshold inquiry into whether the defendant, as the obligee of the bond, could establish probable cause to sustain the validity of the lien as required by \u00a7 49-37 (b) (5),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and instead proceeded directly to the merits of the plaintiffs case, that is, whether the plaintiff could prove by clear and convincing evidence that the bond should be dissolved. The defendant claims that the plaintiff cannot raise this issue on appeal because it waived the probable cause inquiry before the trial court. We agree with the defendant and therefore do not consider the merits of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Section 49-37 (b) (5) provides in relevant part: \u201cUpon the hearing held on the application or motion set forth in this subsection, <em>the obligee on the bond shall first be required to establish that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the lien. </em>Any person entitled to notice under subdivision (1) of this section may appear, be heard and prove by clear and convincing evidence that the validity of the lien should not be sustained . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In the present case, the plaintiff expressly waived the probable cause showing when, through counsel, it made the following statement to the trial court: \u201cI think that [\u00a7 49-37 (b) (5)] requires that [the defendant] would have the burden of proof in a hearing like this, since they would have to show probable cause for the validity of the lien. <em>I </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>don\u2019t think that that\u2019s necessary to go through that formality.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Moreover, when evidence was presented to the trial court on the plaintiffs application to dissolve the bond, the plaintiff presented its witnesses first, before the defendant. Had the burden to establish probable cause been an issue at that point in the proceeding, the defendant would have presented evidence first to establish probable cause to sustain the mechanic\u2019s lien before the plaintiff presented its evidence challenging its validity. Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiff waived the probable cause showing required under \u00a7 49-37 (b) (5), and we therefore decline to review the plaintiffs first claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly applied the parol evidence rule by excluding evidence that would have established, by clear and convincing evidence, that the parties\u2019 contract became effective prior to October 1,1999. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that, because the parties\u2019 agreement was ambiguous as to its effective date, the trial court improperly failed to consider extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 conduct preceding the defendant\u2019s acceptance<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of the Lake Road purchase order on October 15,1999.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant contends that both the supply agreement and Lake Road purchase order unambiguously estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>lished that a contract was formed when the defendant accepted the Lake Road purchase order on October 15, 1999, and, therefore, in the absence of any ambiguity, extrinsic evidence of conduct is inadmissible. We agree with the defendant that there was no ambiguity as to the effective date of the contract, and that the trial court properly excluded extrinsic evidence concerning the date when the contract was formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The following additional facts are necessary to resolve this issue. At trial, the plaintiff offered the following documents as evidence of conduct between the parties during August and September, 1999, as proof that a contract was formed prior to October 1, 1999.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On August 27,1999, the plaintiff issued to the defendant a limited notice to proceed, a notice specifically contemplated in the supply agreement. This document directed the defendant \u201cto commence immediately with engineering, design and procurement of long lead time items and assignment of production slots . . . for the . . . Lake Road project.\u201d The parties subsequently conducted a \u201ckick-off meeting,\u201d the minutes of which were entered into evidence, at which they discussed the start of engineering, as well as related technical issues. Following the meeting, the plaintiff issued a second limited notice to proceed. The defendant then issued a progress report on the Lake Road project covering the months of September and October, 1999. Finally, on October 12, 1999, the defendant submitted an invoice to the plaintiff for work completed in the amount of $1,886,550. Upon reviewing these proffers after the hearing, the trial court concluded that \u201c[t]his evidence of conduct is contrary to the terms of [the] parties\u2019 written agreement. Accordingly, it is inadmissible under the parol evidence rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>\u201cOrdinarily, [o]n appeal, the trial court\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of evidence are accorded great deference. . . . Rulings on such matters will be disturbed only upon a showing of clear abuse of discretion. . . . Because the parol evidence rule is not an exclusionary rule of evidence, however, but a rule of substantive contract law . . . the [defendant\u2019s] claim involves a question of law to which we afford plenary review.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Harold Cohn &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Harco International, LLC, </em>72 Conn. App. 43, 48, 804 A.2d 218, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 903, 810 A.2d 269 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The parol evidence rule \u201cis premised upon the idea that when the parties have deliberately put their engagements into writing, in such terms as import a legal obligation, without any uncertainty as to the object or extent of such engagement, it is conclusively presumed, that the whole engagement of the parties, and the extent and manner of their understanding, was reduced to writing. After this, to permit oral testimony, or prior or contemporaneous conversations, or circumstances, or usages [etc.], in order to learn what was intended, or to contradict what is written, would be dangerous and unjust in the extreme. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">\u201cThe parol evidence rule does not of itself, therefore, forbid the presentation of parol evidence, that is, evidence outside the four comers of the contract concerning matters governed by an integrated contract, but forbids only the use of such evidence to vary or contradict the terms of such a contract. Parol evidence offered solely to vary or contradict the written terms of an integrated contract is, therefore, legally irrelevant. When offered for that purpose, it is inadmissible not because it is parol evidence, but because it is irrelevant. By implication, such evidence may still be admissible if relevant (1) to explain an ambiguity appearing in the instrument; (2) to prove a collateral oral agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>which does not vary the terms of the writing; (3) to add a missing term in a writing which indicates on its face that it does not set forth the complete agreement; or (4) to show mistake or fraud. . . . These recognized exceptions are, of course, only examples of situations where the evidence (1) does not vary or contradict the contract\u2019s terms, or (2) may be considered because the contract has been shown not to be integrated; or (3) tends to show that the contract should be defeated or altered on the equitable ground that relief can be had against any deed or contract in writing founded in mistake or fraud.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Heyman Associates No. 1 </em>v. <em>Ins. Co. of Pennsylvania, </em>231 Conn. 756, 780-81, 653 A.2d 122 (1995). Generally, however, \u201cwe continue to adhere to the general principle that the unambiguous terms of a written contract containing a merger clause may not be varied or contradicted by extrinsic evidence.\u201d <em>Tallmadge Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., </em>252 Conn. 479, 503, 746 A.2d 1277 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the question of whether the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant was in fact ambiguous with regard to the date when the contract was formed. \u201cA contract must be construed to effectuate the intent of the parties, which is determined from the language used interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction. . . . [T]he intent of the parties is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words and . . . the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract. . . . Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms. A court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>no room for ambiguity .... Similarly, any ambiguity in a contract must emanate from the language used in the contract rather than from one party\u2019s subjective perception of the terms.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Our review of the supply agreement and the Lake Road purchase order leads us to conclude that there was no ambiguity as to the effective date of the contract. The supply agreement sets forth the procedures necessary to consummate a binding contract, and unambiguously indicated that the parties did not intend to enter into a contract for the plaintiff to purchase equipment from the defendant until the defendant accepted a purchase order issued by the plaintiff. This is evident from \u00a76.1 of the supply agreement, which provides that \u201c[t]his Agreement <em>shall not imply or create an obligation </em>for both Parties to enter into any Purchase Order(s).\u201d (Emphasis added.) Moreover, \u00a7 6.1 establishes that, in the future, the plaintiff \u201cshall have the light to accept or reject any proposal made by the [defendant] . . . .\u201d Additionally, the supply agreement precisely defines each relevant term used in \u00a7 6.1 as they relate to each other. The definitions of both \u201c \u2018[agreement\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018[acknowledgement\u2019 \u201d in \u00a7 1 of the supply agreement reference \u201c[p]urchase [o]rder(s).\u201d Significantly, \u201c[p]urchase [o]rder\u201d is defined in \u00a7 1 as \u201c <em>the Document . . . by which the Agreement come[s] into effect and force.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Finally, \u00a7 5.1 of the supply agreement establishes the priority of documents in the event of an inconsistency with regar d to their terms. Notably, that section provides that the purchase order takes precedence over all other documents, including the supply agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Thus, it is apparent from the terms of the supply agreement that both parties intended that a subsequent purchase order, and not the supply agreement, would form the legally binding contract between them. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>other words, the supply agreement unequivocally indicates that the parties did not intend to enter into a binding contract until such time as the plaintiff issued a purchase order and the defendant accepted that purchase order.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">We turn next to the specific language of the Lake Road purchase order issued by the plaintiff and accepted by the defendant on October 15, 1999. The Lake Road purchase order explicitly directed the defendant to \u201cindicate your <em>acceptance </em>of this order ... by signing after the words \u2018accepted by\u2019 and returning this acknowledgement . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) We reiterate that the defendant unequivocally accepted the Lake Road purchase order issued by the plaintiff in its letter of October 15, 1999. It is axiomatic that acceptance of an offer creates a valid contract. <em>Bridgeport Pipe Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>DeMatteo Construction Co., </em>159 Conn. 242, 246, 268 A.2d 391 (1970). Thus, we agree with the trial court that the parties formed an agreement on October 15, 1999, when the defendant accepted the Lake Road purchase order.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">We further agree with the trial court that the Lake Road purchase order as accepted by the defendant on October 15, 1999, constituted the entire agreement between the parties. The purchase order notes provided that, \u201c[the Lake Road purchase order] and its integrated specifications and documents constitute the <em>entire agreement between </em>[the parties] and <em>replaces all previous and actual verbal or written communications and agreements.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, we conclude that the language of this merger clause is conclusive evidence of the parties\u2019 intent to create a fully integrated agreement. Therefore, because we determine that the integrated agreement contains no ambiguity, we further conclude that the trial court properly deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>mined that extrinsic evidence of conduct was inadmissible to vary the effective date of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-1581 (a) provides: \u201cAny provision in a construction contract or any periodic lien waiver issued pursuant to a construction contract that purports to waive or release the right of a contractor, subcontractor or supplier engaged to perform services, perform labor or furnish materials under the construction contract to (1) claim a mechanic\u2019s lien, or (2) make a claim against a payment bond, for services, labor or materials which have not yet been performed and paid for shall be void and of no effect.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b619-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-37 (b) (5) provides: \u201cUpon the hearing held on the application or motion set forth in tills subsection, the obligee on the bond shall first be required to establish that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the lien. Any person entitled to notice under subdivision (1) of this section may appear, be heard and prove by clear and convincing evidence that the validity of the lien should not be sustained or that the amount of the lien claimed is excessive and should be reduced. Upon consideration of the facts before it, the court or judge may: (A) Deny the application or motion if probable cause to sustain the validity of the lien is established; or (B) order that the bond is void if (i) probable cause to sustain the validity of the lien is not established, or (ii) by clear and convincing evidence, the invalidity of the lien is established; or (C) order the amount of the bond reduced if the amount of the lien is found to be excessive by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b619-12\"> The defendant also raises the following alternate grounds for affirmance: (1) that \u00a7 49 of the pari ies\u2019 long-term supply agreement provided that Swiss law exclusively governs their agreement and, under Swiss law, a prospective lien waiver made in a construction contract is not enforceable; (2) that the lien waiver provision contained in \u00a7 19.2 of the supply agreement is defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>in that it does not identify specifically the property to which it applies; and (3) that the lien waiver provision does not bar the defendant\u2019s lien rights against the owners of the property on which the plaintiffs project was to be constructed. Because we affirm the judgment of the trial court, we do not need to consider these alternate grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b620-9\"> Although the supply agreement was executed by the parties\u2019 predecessors in interest, references herein to the parties\u2019 obligations under the supply agreement are to the plaintiff and the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b620-11\"> Section 6.1 of the supply agreement provides in relevant part: \u201cIn any event, [the plaintiff] shall have the right to accept or reject any proposal made by the [defendant] in response to [the plaintiffs] request for quotation without incurring any liability whatever to the [defendant].

See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\"> At the hearing on the application, the trial court admitted as full exhibits for consideration by the court all of the documents offered by the plaintiff. The trial court subsequently determined in its memorandum of decision that the documents were inadmissible under the parol evidence rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
