App. 32, 44, 811 A.2d 727 (2002). We conclude that the Appellate Court improperly determined that a social guest in a personal residence is immune from liability for negligently caused fire damages in a subrogation action brought by the homeowner\u2019s insurance carrier. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following relevant facts and procedural history of this case. \u201cIn 1993, Brian Wasko and Phyllis Wasko, residents of Weston, owned a house on Shore Road in Goshen that they used primarily on weekends and vacations. [The defendant, James] Manella was a friend and business associate of the Waskos who had recently moved to New York City. The Waskos offered to let [the defendant] stay at their house in Goshen on the weekend of February 5, 1993, with the proffered hope that he might be interested in renting or buying it in the future. [The defendant] accepted that offer. While at the house in Goshen, he lit a fire in the fireplace, and, when he was ready to return to New York, he emptied the ashes and embers into a paper bag, which he placed outside on the porch. After he departed, the house caught fire and was substantially destroyed. The fire mar shal of the town of Goshen determined that the ashes and embers in the paper bag had caused the blaze.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\u201cThe house was insured under a homeowners policy from Middlesex. Pursuant to the insurance policy, Mid-dlesex paid the Waskos $48,500 for the lost personal property and $84,005 for the lost dwelling for a total of $132,505. In October, 1993, the Waskos brought an action against [the defendant] sounding in negligence, recklessness and res ipsa loquitur. In March, 1997, Mid-dlesex was substituted as the real party in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\u201cOn April 14, 2000, [the defendant] filed a motion for summary judgment on all counts, of which only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>negligence count survived. At that time, [the defendant] argued that Middlesex had no right of subrogation and that a social houseguest should be considered an \u2018implied co-insured\u2019 under the policy. The [trial] court was unpersuaded. On October 13, 2000, it held, in a memorandum of decision, that Middlesex could subro-gate the Waskos\u2019 claim because the homeowners policy did not specify coverage for social guests. In short, [the defendant] was not an insured under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u201cIn the subsequent trial to the court on July 24 and 25, 2001, the court found that [the defendant] had been negligent and that his negligence had caused the destruction of the Waskos\u2019 house and personal property. The court awarded Middlesex $132,505 in damages.\u201d Id., 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court: (1) improperly had found that Middlesex had a right of subrogation against a social guest; (2) improperly had precluded Brian Wasko from testifying as to his understanding of the scope of coverage of his insurance policy; and (3) inaccurately had calculated the replacement value of the personal property. Id., 34-35. Addressing the defendant\u2019s first claim, the Appellate Court determined initially that Mid-dlesex\u2019s right of subrogation was equitable, and not contractual, in nature. Id., 38. Accordingly, the Appellate Court reviewed <em>DiLullo </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>259 Conn. 847, 848, 792 A.2d 819 (2002), in which this court concluded that a landlord\u2019s insurer did not have a right of subrogation against a tenant who negligently had damaged the insured property. Applying the reasoning of <em>DiLullo </em>to the present case, the Appellate Court determined that allowing the insurer to pursue a subrogation action against a houseguest would lead to economic waste and would place an even greater \u201cstrain on the limits of equity\u201d than the factual situation presented in <em>DiLullo. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number><em>Wasko </em>v. <em>Manella, </em>supra, 74 Conn. App. 39. Accordingly, the Appellate Court concluded, with one judge dissenting, that \u201cin keeping with <em>DiLullo, </em>subrogation should not be allowed against a houseguest whose negligence causes damage to the property of an insured homeowner.\u201d Id., 44.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">We thereafter granted the Middlesex\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly reverse the decision of the trial court, and extend this court\u2019s opinion in <em>DiLullo </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>[supra, 259 Conn. 847], in the context of landlord/tenant, by holding that a guest in a personal residence is immune from liability for negligently caused damages in a subrogation action brought by the homeowner\u2019s insurance earner?\u201d <em>Wasko </em>v. <em>Manella, </em>262 Conn. 942, 942-43, 815 A.2d 674 (2003). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">On appeal, Middlesex claims that the Appellate Court\u2019s reversal of the judgment of the trial court was improper because the Appellate Court: (1) failed to recognize that the subrogation right being enforced was granted by statute, and not by principles of equity; (2) confused the concept of third party liability coverage protecting an insured from damages caused to another with the concept of first party coverage protecting an insured from damage to their own property; and (3) improperly expanded the analytical framework of <em>DiLullo </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 847, to the facts of the present case. In response, the defendant contends that: (1) Middlesex does not have a statutory right of subrogation; (2) the Appellate Court properly applied <em>DiLullo </em>to the facts of this case; and (3) the Appellate Court properly determined that premiums for temporary fire insurance policies that covered guests during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>their stay would be difficult to calculate. We agree with the defendant that the Appellate Court properly concluded that Middlesex\u2019s right of subrogation was equitable, and not statutory, in nature. We also agree with Middlesex, however, that under the doctrine of equitable subrogation, the Appellate Court improperly extended the analytical framework of <em>DiLullo </em>to the facts of the present case. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Middlesex first claims that the Appellate Court improperly failed to recognize that the subrogation right being enforced was granted by statute, and not by principles of equity. The defendant contends that the Appellate Court properly concluded that Middlesex\u2019s right of subrogation was equitable, and not statutory, in nature. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">\u201cThe law has recognized two types of subrogation: conventional; and legal or equitable. 73 Am. Jur. 2d 599, Subrogation \u00a7 2 (1974 and 1995 Sup.) .... Conventional subrogation can take effect only by agreement and has been said to be synonymous with assignment. It occurs where one having no interest or any relation to the matter pays the debt of another, and by agreement is entitled to the rights and securities of the creditor so paid. ... By contrast, [t]he right of [legal or equitable] subrogation is not a matter of contract; it does not arise from any contractual relationship between the parties, but takes place as a matter of equity, with or without an agreement to that effect. . . . The object of [legal or equitable] subrogation is the prevention of injustice. It is designed to promote and to accomplish justice, and is the mode which equity adopts to compel the ultimate payment of a debt by one who, in justice, equity, and good conscience, should pay it. ... As now applied, the doctrine of [legal or] equitable subro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>gation is broad enough to include every instance in which one person, not acting as a mere volunteer or intruder, pays a debt for which another is primarily liable, and which in equity and good conscience should have been discharged by the latter.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 362, 370-71, 672 A.2d 939 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Under this legal framework, the Appellate Court noted that \u201c[a]t first blush,\u201d this case would appear to involve conventional subrogation, due to the insurance contract between the Waskos and Middlesex. <em>Wasko </em>v. <em>Manella, </em>supra, 74 Conn. App. 36-37. Upon further analysis, however, the Appellate Court concluded that \u201c[t]he contract ... is not the source of the right, but rather is a reference to those rights that may exist at law or in equity.\u201d Id., 37. We agree with this conclusion. As we stated in <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 372, insurers that are obligated by a <em>preexisting </em>contract to pay the losses of an insured proceed in a subsequent action against the responsible party under the theory of equitable subrogation, and not conventional subrogation. See also <em>DiLullo </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 853 (equitable principles used to address fire insurance company\u2019s claimed right of sub-rogation against negligent tenant); <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>217 Conn. 340, 344, 586 A.2d 567 (1991) (affirming trial court\u2019s finding that equitable subrogation action by insurance company was untimely). This is because the insurer, as well as the insured, has a preexisting financial interest in the outcome of the litigation. <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 372; <em>Berlinski </em>v. <em>Ovellette, </em>164 Conn. 482, 496, 325 A.2d 239 (1973) <em>(MacDonald, J., </em>dissenting), overruled, <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 364. In sum, while \u201c[a] right of true [equitable] subrogation may be provided for in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>contract . . . the exercise of the right will . . . have its basis in general principles of equity rather than in the contract, which will be treated as being merely a declaration of principles of law already existing.\u201d 83 C.J.S., Subrogation \u00a7 3 Ob) (1953).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Middlesex attempts to distinguish the subrogation clause in the present contract by noting that \u201c[t]he legislature, in the context of fire insurance policies, has specifically granted a right of subrogation to a fire insurance company for all rights of recovery that the insured has against the tortfeasor.\u201d Moreover, Middle-sex contends that this \u201cstatutory right of assignment for its loss is <em>inviolate </em>. . . [and] the court may not substitute its judgment for a grant of statutory recovery given by the legislature . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u201cIssues of statutory construction raise questions of law, over which we exercise plenary review.\u201d <em>Celentano </em>v. <em>Oaks Condominium Assn., </em>265 Conn. 579, 588, 830 A.2d 164 (2003). \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutoiy language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>267 Conn. 336, 343, 838 A.2d 170 (2004).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The Connecticut legislature has enacted a standard form of fire insurance, with which all fire insurance policies issued in this state must conform. See General Statutes \u00a7 38a-308.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In regard to the insurer\u2019s subrogation rights, the standard foim includes a subrogation provision stating: \u201cThis Company may require from the insured an assignment of all right of recovery against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>any party for loss to the extent that payment therefor is made by this Company.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-307. We conclude that this provision, when incorporated into a contract for fire insurance issued in this state, does not provide the insurer with an inviolate statutory right of subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\u201cAs with any issue of statutory construction, we begin with the pertinent language of the statute.\u201d <em>Lombardo\u2019s Ravioli Kitchen, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>268 Conn. 222, 232, 842 A.2d 1089 (2004). The subrogation clause set forth in \u00a7 38a-307 fails to provide an insurer with a direct, and inviolate, right of subrogation. To the contrary, it merely provides that an insurer \u201cmay require\u201d an insured to assign any rights <em>he or she </em>has to the insurer. Thus, under this clear language, the right of recovery belongs to the insured, and the insurer only obtains that right when the insured grants it. This is true because it is axiomatic that \u201ca subrogee merely succeeds to the legal rights or claims of a subrogor.\u201d 73 Am. Jur. 2d 542, Subrogation \u00a7 1 (2001); see also <em>Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp. </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>123 Conn. 232, 238, 193 A. 769 (1937). Indeed, as the contract in the present case demonstrates, the insured had the ability to waive any rights of recovery prior to the occurrence of a loss. See footnote 6 of this opinion. Contrary to the claim set forth by Middlesex, therefore, the language of \u00a7 38a-307 does not expressly provide an insurer with an inviolate right to bring a subrogation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">This conclusion is buttressed by a comparison of the treatment of subrogation under the standard form of fire insurance and under our workers\u2019 compensation scheme. <em>Hatt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>263 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>279, 310, 819 A.2d 260 (2003) (\u201cthe legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). More specifically, General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a), addressing the liability of third parties for payments of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, provides that the employer\u2019s claim \u201cshall take precedence over that of the injured employee in [distribution of] the proceeds of the recovery . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The standard form of fire insurance lacks such a provision, and, under traditional principles of subrogation, if an insured brings an action against a negligent party, an insurer generally is entitled to recover the amount it paid to the insured only if the amount of damages awarded exceeds the difference between the amount the insurer paid and the insured\u2019s actual damages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">More importantly, in \u00a7 31-293 the legislature specifically granted employers an independent right to bring an action against the tortfeasor to recover any amount paid to their injured employee. <em>Doucette </em>v. <em>Pomes, </em>247 Conn. 442, 468, 724 A.2d 481 (1999). Section 31-293 (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>provides in relevant part that \u201cany employer or the custodian of the Second Injury Fund, having paid, or having become obligated to pay, compensation under the provisions of this chapter <em>may bring an action against such person </em>to recover any amount that he has paid or has become obligated to pay as compensation to the injured employee. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) Such explicit statutory language simply is not present in the standard form of fire insurance set forth in the subrogation provision of \u00a7 38a-307, which provides only that an insurer \u201cmay require\u201d from an insured any \u201cright of recovery\u201d that the insured has against any responsible party. If, as Middlesex contends, \u00a7 38a-307 grants an insurer an inviolate statutory right to subrogation against a negligent tortfeasor, it would be reasonable to expect to see language similar to that found in \u00a7 31-293. <em>Hatt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 310 (\u201cthe legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Indeed, the subrogation provision of \u00a7 38a-307 does not even automatically subro-gate an insurer to any rights held by its insured, but rather provides merely that it <em>\u201cmay </em>require\u201d those rights. (Emphasis added.) Compare 52 Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 500.2833 (1) (r) (2001) (any fire insurance policy shall contain provision stating \u201c[t]hat the insurer <em>is subrogated </em>to the insured\u2019s right of recovery from other parties\u201d [emphasis added]). Thus, in \u00a7 38a-307, the legislature has not explicitly granted the insurer either: (1) an automatic right to be subrogated to any rights held by the insured, as have other states; or (2) an independent right to bring an action, as our legislature has granted under \u00a7 31-293 (a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>In addition to conflicting with the actual language of the standard form of fire insurance, the interpretation proposed by Middlesex conflicts with this court\u2019s prior interpretations of other provisions of that standard form. More specifically, rather than inteipret the standard form of fire insurance as providing statutory rights, we consistently have interpreted it as merely setting forth legislatively mandated contractual terms, which, once incorporated into an insurance policy, are contractual terms that may be \u201ctrumped\u201d by principles of equity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Boyce </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 375, 377, 673 A.2d 77 (1996), the defendant insurance company claimed that because it did not expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>waive, pursuant to the statutorily mandated nonwaiver provision,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the statutorily mandated provision that required the plaintiff insurer to initiate an action on the policy within one year from the date of loss,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it was entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict. To the contrary, the plaintiff claimed that the doctrine of equitable estoppel precluded the defendant from asserting as a defense the provision limiting the time for the plaintiff to commence an action to one year from the date of loss. Id., 383. Although we agreed that the plaintiff could challenge the defendant\u2019s reliance on that provision under the doctrine of equitable estop-pel, we found the plaintiffs particular challenge to be deficient. Id. In so doing, however, we emphasized that: \u201cThis court [does not intend] to advance the cause of the unscrupulous . . . and, therefore, we decline to adopt the defendant\u2019s argument that the legislatively mandated nonwaiver provision precludes an insured from asserting equitable estoppel whenever the insured fails to obtain a written waiver, no matter what the insurer does or does not do that might mislead the insured. Accordingly, we conclude that the principle that no one shall be permitted to found any claim upon his own inequity or take advantage of his own wrong . . . <em>trumps </em>the defendant\u2019s position that the non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>waiver provision of \u00a7 38a-307 precludes the plaintiffs estoppel argument.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 384-85; see also <em>Bocchino </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>246 Conn. 378, 381, 716 A.2d 883 (1998) (rejecting plaintiffs contention that defendant\u2019s \u201cinsurance policy provision requiring that an action be brought within one year of the date of the loss was mandated by the standard fire insurance policy form delineated in \u00a7\u00a7 38a-308 [a] and 38a-307, and was, therefore, a \u2018time limited by law\u2019 within the meaning of the savings provision of [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-592 (a),\u201d the accidental failure of suit statute); <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>supra, 217 Conn. 350 (addressing, yet rejecting, plaintiff insurer\u2019s claim that defendant insurer was estopped by its actions from enforcing one year limitation set forth in \u00a7 38a-307 and relevant insurance policy).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, this court continually has declined to interpret the provisions of the standard form in the manner urged by Middlesex, and we can find no compelling reason to do otherwise in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Finally, we note that our conclusion in the present case accords with the approach taken by other jurisdictions. See, e.g., <em>Sapiano v. Williamsburg National Ins. Co., </em>28 Cal. App. 4th 533, 538, 33 Cal. Rptr. 2d 659 (1994) (\u201c[although insurers may place subrogation clauses in their policies [such as California standard form of fire insurance] . . . those provisions typically are general and add nothing to the rights of subrogation arising by law\u201d); <em>Dunton </em>v. <em>Westchester Fire Ins.

Moreover, we are mindful that \u201c[s]ubrogation is a highly favored doctrine . . . which courts should be inclined to extend rather than restrict.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Before the trial court, the defendant claimed that equitable considerations should prevent him from being held liable in Middlesex\u2019s subrogation action.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant claimed that, because landlords\u2019 insurance companies are precluded from bringing sub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>rogation actions against tenants, and a social houseguest is akin to a tenant, insurance companies similarly should be precluded from bringing subrogation actions against social houseguests. The trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument. On appeal, however, the Appellate Court noted that \u201cthe actual relationship between the insured and the defendant is more compelling than whether the defendant fits into a category of coinsureds, as contractually defined.\u201d <em>Wasko </em>v. <em>Manella, </em>supra, 74 Conn. App. 40. Analyzing the defendant\u2019s claim further, the Appellate Court concluded that a social guest is akin to a tenant, not for purposes of being a coinsured party under the host\u2019s policy,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but rather for the purposes of the equity of the situation. Id., 38. More specifically, relying upon the principles of equitable subrogation set forth in <em>DiLullo </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 853-54, the Appellate Court concluded that it would be \u201cinequitable to permit the homeowner\u2019s insurer to have a right of subrogation against the homeowner\u2019s guest.\u201d <em>Wasko </em>v. <em>Manella, </em>supra, 41. This reliance on <em>DiLullo </em>was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In <em>DiLullo, </em>the issue before this court was whether, in the absence of a specific agreement between the landlord and the tenant, the landlord\u2019s fire insurer had a right of subrogation against a tenant for negligently causing a fire that damaged the insured\u2019s property. <em>DiLullo </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 848. We answered that question in the negative, and affirmed the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>rendered by the trial court in favor of the tenant. Id., 850. Two rationales supported our conclusion: (1) \u201c[o]ur strong public policy against economic waste,\u201d which would not be served by requiring multiple insurance policies on the same piece of property; and (2) \u201cthe likely lack of expectations regarding a tenant\u2019s obligation to subrogate his landlord\u2019s insurer . . . .\u201d Id., 851. Neither of those two rationales are found in a situation where, as in the present case, a social houseguest negligently causes a fire that damages a host\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In regard to our first rationale in <em>DiLullo, </em>we noted that forcing a tenant to carry insurance for the full cost of the building would create economic waste, as it would be duplicative of the insurance carried by the landlord; further, this economic waste would be compounded by the number of tenants in a particular building. Id., 854. In a situation such as the one found in the present case, the insured has a fire insurance policy covering the home. Therefore, if the insured, or another individual covered by the policy, negligently were to bum the home down, that fire insurance policy would cover the loss.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Appellate Court was concerned that giving an insurer a right of subrogation against a negligent guest, who was not covered by the terms of the insured\u2019s fire insurance policy, would be \u201cwasteful [in that it would] require that every individual carry insurance on every building he or she enters, if only briefly, to avoid the consequences of a subrogation suit.\u201d <em>Wasko </em>v. <em>Manella, </em>supra, 74 Conn. App. 39. This concern is unwarranted, however, because the negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>gent acts of a social houseguest would already be covered by his or her existing third party liability coverage, such as provided by a homeowner\u2019s or renter\u2019s insurance policy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, there is no need for a social houseguest to purchase an additional traveling or temporary first party fire insurance policy on the host\u2019s property. The social guest will be covered in the same manner as he or she would be in any other situation where he or she negligently caused injury to another\u2014 through traditional third party liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Furthermore, as the Appellate Court noted in its opinion, rather than submitting a claim to the insurer, an insured host could proceed directly against the houseguest in an action for negligently caused damages to the insured property. Id., 42. Indeed, that is the exact situation found in the present case\u2014the Waskos instituted the original action against the defendant, and Mid-dlesex was substituted as the plaintiff after paying for the damage to the Waskos\u2019 home. If the insured property owner can bring an action to recover for negligently caused damages against the defendant, we see no reason why an insurer that pays for the property owner\u2019s loss cannot also bring an action against the defendant. Put another way, we see no reason why it is equitable to permit a property owner to proceed against a negligent houseguest\u2019s current insurance policy, yet it is inequitable to permit an insurance company that has paid out to its insured to proceed against that same policy. See <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 372 (\u201ccourts should be inclined to extend rather than restrict\u201d subrogation). In either situation, the houseguest\u2019s current third party liability insurance coverage will protect against liability, and there is no need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>for houseguests to obtain the additional policies envisioned by the Appellate Court. Accordingly, there is no significant concern of economic waste in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Our second rationale in <em>DiLullo </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 851, namely, the lack of expectation of subrogation on the part of a tenant, also is not found in the present situation. In <em>DiLullo, </em>we endorsed the statement that: \u201cThe possibility that a lessor\u2019s insurer may proceed against a lessee almost certainly is not within the expectations of most landlords and tenants unless they have been forewarned by expert counseling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 852; R. Keeton &amp; A. Widiss, Insurance Law (1988) \u00a7 4.4 (b), pp. 340-41. Contrary to the protestations of the defendant\u2019s counsel at oral argument before this court, we are convinced that social houseguests do not proceed with the same lack of expectations regarding personal responsibility for negligent conduct as do tenants. Put another way, we believe that most social <em>gaests fully expect </em>to be held hable for their negligent conduct in another\u2019s home\u2014 whether that conduct constitutes breaking the television, causing physical injury, or burning the house down. Unlike tenants, social guests have not signed a contract with the host, they have not paid the host any set amount of money for rent, and, accordingly, they do not have the same expectations regarding insurance coverage for the property as do tenants. In sum, the equitable concerns that led this court to preclude subro-gation in the context of landlord and tenant simply are not present in the context of houseguest and host.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">A more appropriate source of guidance on the equity involved in allowing subrogation in the present situation is our decision in <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 362. In that case, the plaintiff insurance company became obligated to pay uninsured motorist benefits to its insured when the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>insurance company of the tortfeasor denied coverage. Id., 367. Subsequently, the plaintiff brought an action against the defendant to recover the money that it had paid to its insured. Id. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs complaint, and the plaintiff appealed. Id., 363-64. As an initial matter, this court determined that the plaintiff was proceeding under the theory of legal or equitable subrogation, because it was \u201cstepping into the shoes of the party it paid in order to recover the payments that it made, and thus to prevent the unjust enrichment of the party whose debt it paid.\u201d Id., 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">We explained further that in an equitable subrogation matter, \u201c[t]he insurer was not acting as a mere volunteer; rather, it was obligated by a preexisting contract of insurance to pay the losses of its insured. Upon such payment, the insurer became subrogated to any rights that its insured might have had against the party who had caused the loss. The tortfeasor, who was the party primarily hable for the losses sustained by the insured, benefited by the insurer\u2019s payment of a debt truly owed by the tortfeasor. We see no logical reason to permit a tortfeasor to be unjustly enriched by virtue of having its debt paid by the insurance company of a party who had the foresight to obtain insurance coverage, and thus to escape all liability for its wrongdoing, simply because the insurance company was not permitted to participate in a suit against the tortfeasor in order to recover the money that it had paid to its insured but which was properly payable by the tortfeasor.\u201d Id., 372-73. Accordingly, we overruled <em>Berlinski </em>v. <em>Ovellette, </em>supra, 164 Conn. 482, which had precluded providers of uninsured motorist coverage from bringing subrogation actions against uninsured tortfeasors, and we reversed the judgment of the trial corut. <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>We find the reasoning of <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>to be particularly instructive to the present case. As discussed previously in this opinion, the Waskos could have pursued their own negligence action against the defendant, rather than submitting and settling their claim with Middlesex. Indeed, as the Appellate Court noted, \u201cone of the benefits of purchasing homeowners insurance is that the insureds need <em>not </em>sue their guests who negligently cause damage, even though they would be within their rights to do so.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Wasko </em>v. <em>Manella, </em>supra, 74 Conn. App. 42; see also <em>Reeder </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>217 Neb. 120, 129, 348 N.W.2d 832 (1984) (\u201c[i]t may be presumed that the insured bought this policy so that he would not have to look to his guest for payment in the event of damage caused by the negligent act of the guest\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, in the present case, just as in <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co., </em>the defendant benefited by an insurance company\u2019s payment of a debt truly owed by him. Furthermore, just as in <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co., </em>we see no logical reason for the defendant to be unjustly enriched merely because he burned down the home of a party that had the foresight to purchase fire insurance, and subsequently chose to submit a claim to that insurance company rather than to proceed directly against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Precluding an insurer from bringing a subrogation action against a social houseguest who negligently-caused a fire that damaged the insured\u2019s property could also lead to unjust results. First, it is contrary to the main principle behind equitable subrogation because it \u201cdenies the [insurer] the opportunity to compel the ultimate payment of a debt by one who, in justice, equity, and good conscience, should pay it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 373. Second, it may also encourage insurers to attempt to deny coverage for losses to property they insure, given that the insured party would maintain the right to proceed against the responsible party, while the insurer would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to consider the defendant\u2019s remaining claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-12\"> Middlesex is the substitute plaintiff subrogee for the subrogors, Brian Wasko and Phyllis Wasko, the insured homeowners who no longer are parties in interest in this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\"> This conclusion made it unnecessary for the Appellate Court to address the defendant\u2019s two remaining claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\"> See also <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>37 Conn.

The common law did not permit the assignment of personal injury actions, and thus the legislature specifically, and explicitly, had to abrogate the common law in order to allow an employer to subrogate against a tortfeasor. <em>Westchester </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number><em>Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. </em>Co., supra, 236 Conn. 373. This was accomplished with the enactment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and specifically \u00a7 31-293. In the area of insurance contracts, however, equitable principles traditionally allowed subrogation against the responsible party when an insurer paid for damages pursuant to an indemnity agreement. Thus, when enacting a standard form of insurance, the legislature did not need to create a new right of subrogation for insurers because they were already provided with one through equitable principles. <em>Orvis </em>v. <em>Newell, </em>17 Conn. 97, 101 (1845) (\u201c[i]t is, however, to be remarked, that his right of substitution or subrogation rests upon the basis of mere equity and benevolence\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\"> The legislative history of the current standard form of fire insurance, while not extensive, does provide some evidence of two primary motivations behind the adoption of the current form: (1) to reduce an agent\u2019s workload; and (2) to provide consumers with a consistent and easily understandable 1'orm of insurance. In 1945, the legislature adopted a new standard form of fire insurance based upon the 1943 New York standard fire insurance policy. See Public Acts 1945, No. 266 (P.A. 266).
