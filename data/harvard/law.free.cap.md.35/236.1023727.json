The indictment in this case contains three counts: The first charges the defendant with unlawfully selling spirituous liquors in quantities not less than a pint, viz: One barrel of whiskey, without a license so to do. The second count charges like selling, in quantities not less than a pint, five gallons of whiskey, without a license so to do; and the third count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>charges a like selling one gallon of wine, without license. Plea, \u201cnot guilty\u201d \u2014 and issue tried before the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-5\">The agreed statement of facts admitted the selling, as charged; and that the defendant had no traders\u2019 license to sell spirituous liquors, at the time of the sales, but had a license to sell spirituous liquors, commonly called \u201c an oyster house license.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-6\">Upon this statement, the Court found the defendant \u201c not guilty\u201d \u2014 and rendered judgment accordingly. The State thereupon applied for a writ of error, which was granted.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-7\">The cause was submitted to Bartol, C. J., Stewart, Brent, Alvey and Robinson, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-8\"><em>Isaac I). Jones, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-9\"><em>Herman Stump, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b247-10\">Robinson, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A2k\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">The question in this appeal is whether a party under <em>an oyster or eating house license </em>is authorized to sell <em>spirituous </em>or <em>fermented </em>liquors by the barrel, or in quantities <em>greater than a pint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">This must depend upon the construction of sections 58 to 90, inclusive, of Article 56, of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">Sections 58 to 70 provide for the granting of what is commonly called a <em>trader\u2019s license, </em>for the sale of spirituous or fermented liquors in <em>quantities not less than a pint, </em>upon the payment of eighteen to one hundred and fifty dollars, according to the value of the applicant\u2019s <em>stock in trade.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">Sections 70 to 84 provide for the granting of licenses to <em>ordinary keepers, </em>to sell in quantities <em>less than a pint, </em>upon the payment of twenty-five to four hundred dollars, according to the <em>rental value </em>of the house or place where the business is carried on.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">Section 85 provides for the issuing of an oyster or eating house license, for the sale of spirituous or fermented liquors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>in quantities <em>less than a pint, </em>upon the payment of <em>fifty dollars.</em></p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b248-6\">(Decided 20th February, 1872.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In thus providing for three classes of licenses, it is clear the law did not intend that a party paying for a license of one class, should exercise the rights and enjoy the privileges conferred by the other two. If an oyster or eating house license, to sell in quantities less than a pint, authorizes a party to sell by the barrel, or in quantities greater than a pint, it would be altogether .unnecessary to take out a trader\u2019s license. A license to sell in quantities less than a pint cannot be construed as authorizing a sale in quantities greater than a pint. Such a construction is not warranted either by the letter or spirit of the law, and would in a great measure, deprive the State of the revenue which it was the object of these laws to secure.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">\n<em>new trial awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
