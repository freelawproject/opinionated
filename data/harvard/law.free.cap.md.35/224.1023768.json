The power to condemn land or materials, does not extend to an encroachment like this, upon an incorporeal right. And as the Act does not provide for compensation, the railroad company cannot exercise its powers in such manner as to interfere with the Turnpike Company\u2019s franchise, without first obtaining the consent of the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>company. <em>Boston and Lowell R.

Nothing was necessary except to fix the termini, and the appellee' could then select its route between the given points. 1 <em>Amer. R, W.

But, if it were nec\u00e9ssary, the power is expressly confined to cross all roads, by the 16th section of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Charter, made part of that of the appellee. <em>White River </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number><em>T.

The appellant has merely an easement, and that and the easement of the appellee can well coexist. <em>Peirce on Railw., </em>178, 216; 11 <em>Leigh, </em>81.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-7\">The only remaining proposition is in regard to the power of the appellee, under the terms of the charter, to build the switch across to the Baltimore, Philadelphia and Wilmington Railroad. The 10th section of the Act of 1870, ch. 412, authorizes all railroads to run their cars and locomotives over the railroad of the appellee, when constructed. The road was to be a trunk road, as all roads so built through a city should be, for all railroad companies that might wish to use it. The-roads which it would cross and connect with at present, and which were more immediately in the contemplation of the Legislature, were the Baltimore, Philadelphia and Wilmington Railroad, the Northern Central Railway, the Baltimore and Potomac Railway, and the Western Maryland Railway \u2022, but the Legislature thought best to make use of language which would be applicable as well to those as all other railroad companies which might in the future come in contact with the Union Railroad. There could be no doubt that, had the 10th section expressly provided that the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Company, should have the right to run its cars and locomotives on the tracks of the Union Railroad, that language, with that of the 9th section, would have fully authorized the construction of such a switch, and it is difficult to see how the grant of a power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>use the tracks for its locomotives and cars, by the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, in connection with other companies, could be less effectual. <em>State vs. Mansfield, </em>3 <em>Zabr., (N.

Whatever force there may be in this view, it is sufficient to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>say, that no attempt has been made on the part of the State, nor. by the appellee, to condemn the franchise of the appellant. In authorizing the appellee to build a railroad between the termini fixed by its charter, the Legislature did not intend to condemn or revoke the franchise of the appellant, nor is such the effect and operation of the grant. If in the construction of the road of the appellee to tide-water at Canton, it is necessary to cross the turnpike road of the appellant, such a crossing cannot in any proper legal sense be considered as a condemnation of the franchise of the latter. On the contrary, its franchise \u2014 its corporate existence \u2014 its use of the turnpike road, with the right to collect tolls thereon \u2014 still remain, and the grant to the appellee is but an appropriation of the land, over which the franchise of the former is used, to another distinct public \u00fase, not inconsistent with the user and easement of the appellant. This subsequent appropriation, it is true, may interfere with the travel on the road of the appellant to the extent of diminishing the tolls received on account thereof, but the injury and damages accruing therefrom, be they ever so great, are matters for the consideration of the jury in awarding compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Whether adequate compensation has been awarded in this case, is not a question before us in this appeal. We deem it unnecessary to extend this opinion by a review of the many eases in which these questions have arisen, or of the principles upon which they have been decided. It is sufficient to say, that- after an examination of all the cases referred to, we are of opinion that the Legislature, in the exercise of the right of eminent domain, can authorize and empower a railroad corporation to cross another railroad or turnpike road, on making compensation, and whatever damage may result therefrom, the exercise of such a right cannot be considered as a condemnation of a franchise, nor the impairment of a contract, within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States. <em>Boston Water Bower Co. vs. Boston and Worcester R.

R., 3 Ind., </em>468; <em>Peirce on Railways, </em>152, <em>note </em>1.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">But in addition to the viaduct crossing, intended for the railroad termination at Canton, the appellee claims the power under its charter, to build a lateral road connecting with the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, and as incident thereto, the right to condemn a grade crossing over the turnpike road of the appellant. The grant of a right to take private property for a public use, or to subject property already appropriated to a public easement, to other and distinct easements and uses, is the highest exercise of legislative power, and such a grant ought to be conferred in language clear and unequivocal. The authority in this case to build a lateral road, we do not understand as being claimed under an express grant, but is said to arise by necessary implication under the 10th section of the Act of 1870, chapter 412, which authorizes <em>all railroad companies upon equal terms, to run their locomotives and cars over the tracks of the appellee. </em>It may be true, that every grant is intended to be beneficial, and carries with it such incidental powers as may be necessary to its exercise or enjoyment. If the exercise of the power granted draw's after it some other right <em>necessarily incident, </em>the law may be said to contemplate and sanction the exercise of that right. Now, what is the right granted by the 10th section of the Act of 1870? It is, that all <em>railroad companies </em>shall have the right upon equal terms to run their locomotives or cars over the railroad of the appellee. By its original charter, Act of 1866, chapter 119, this right was conferred only upon the Northern Central and the Western Maryland Railroad Companies, but the charter was amended by the Act of 1870, and all railroad companies were autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>rized.to use its tracks. The question is not whether these railroads are authorized to build lateral roads connecting with the railroad of the appellee, as incident and necessary to the beneficial enjoyment of the right to use the tracks of the appellee, but whether this section confers upon the latter the power to build lateral roads in every direction, connecting with all railroads running to Baltimore city. We are of opinion that it does not. No such power is expressly conferred, nor does it arise by necessary implication from the exercise of the right and privilege granted to the railroad companies \u2014 nor from the application of this section to the purposes and objects for which the appellee was chartered.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b242-8\">(Decided 16th February, 1872.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We are of opinion, therefore, that the injunction ought to have been granted, so far as respects the condemnation of the grade crossing on the lateral road connecting with the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, and the decree of the Court must be reversed and the cause remanded, in order that another decree may be passed in conformity with the opinion of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\n<em>Decree reversed and</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\n<em>cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
