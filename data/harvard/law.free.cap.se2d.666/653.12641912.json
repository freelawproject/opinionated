We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff and defendant were married on or about 14 June 1964 and separated on 30 July 2001. On 13 April 2006, plaintiff filed a verified complaint in which he sought \"the bonds of matrimony heretofore existing between [p]laintiff and [d]efendant be dissolved, and that [p]laintiff and [d]efendant be granted an absolute divorce from each other.\" Plaintiff failed to achieve service of process on defendant after the issuance of summonses on 13 April 2006, 24 May 2006, 11 September 2006, 5 December 2006, 28 February 2007, and 24 April 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 1 August 2007, plaintiff alleged service of process was accomplished on 22 May 2007 and moved for summary judgment. The hearing for summary judgment was held 20 August 2007. The district court granted plaintiff an absolute divorce from defendant and filed its judgment on 23 August 2007. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant argues the district court erred when it entered its judgment because: (1) defendant was not given proper notice of the summary judgment hearing and (2) the trial court lacked jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    III. Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that a party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. On appeal of a trial court's allowance of a motion for summary judgment, we consider whether, on the basis of materials supplied to the trial court, there was a genuine issue of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Evidence presented by the parties is viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Summey v.
