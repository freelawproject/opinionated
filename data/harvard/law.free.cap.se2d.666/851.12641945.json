(\"Technibilt\") and Hartford Insurance (\"Hartford\") appeal from the Opinion and Award of the Full Commission of the North Carolina Industrial Commission (\"the Commission\"), which held Hartford to be liable for Lue Sinda Browning Mann's (\"plaintiff\") occupational disease resulting from her employment with Technibilt. We affirm in part and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff has been employed as a press welder at Technibilt since 1989. On or about 2 October 2003, plaintiff alleged she sustained an injury and occupational disease. Technibilt and its insurance carrier at the time, St. Paul-Travelers Insurance Company/Charter\n   Oak Fire Insurance Company (\"Travelers\"), denied liability pending receipt of plaintiff's medical records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's claim for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome was later accepted, while plaintiff's claim of injury to her back, hip, and feet was denied. Travelers referred plaintiff to Dr. William M. Pekman (\"Dr. Pekman\"). On 12 February 2004, Dr. Pekman recommended \"a trial of non[-]operative treatment\" and advised plaintiff that if the non-operative treatment did not relieve her symptoms, she may need to consider surgical decompression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 23 March 2005, plaintiff requested Travelers approve additional medical treatment. On 1 April 2005, Hartford became Technibilt's carrier \"on the risk.\" On 13 April 2005, plaintiff returned to Dr. Pekman at the request of Technibilt and Travelers for re-evaluation of both hands. Dr. Pekman administered another \"trial of non[-]operative treatment\" at plaintiff's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 10 January 2006, plaintiff requested the Commission to order a second medical opinion with a hand specialist selected by plaintiff. Technibilt and Travelers requested the Commission to deny plaintiff's motion for a second opinion and stated \"[t]here is no valid, reasonable reason for a change in treating physicians.\" On 14 February 2006, the special deputy commissioner granted plaintiff's motion for a second opinion and ordered Technibilt and Travelers to provide plaintiff with a \"one-time evaluation with a hand specialist of plaintiff's choice for evaluation and treatment recommendations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On or about 27 February 2006, Technibilt and Travelers appealed the special deputy commissioner's Order and requested plaintiff's claim be assigned for hearing. Technibilt and Travelers alleged that \"[Travelers] was not on the risk when [p]laintiff was last injuriously exposed to the alleged hazards of her disease.\" Hartford was added as a party on 21 April 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 31 May 2007, the deputy commissioner entered an Opinion and Award, which found \"Hartford ... responsible for [p]laintiff's condition beginning April 1, 2005[]\" because \"[p]laintiff continued to be injuriously exposed and her condition continued to worsen while Hartford ... provided coverage....\" Technibilt and Hartford appealed the Opinion and Award to the Full Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Commission entered its unanimous Opinion and Award on 14 December 2007. The Commission found Hartford to be liable for plaintiff's occupational disease and ordered Technibilt and Hartford to pay \"all medical expenses incurred or to be incurred by plaintiff as a result of the compensable disease....\" Technibilt and Hartford appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Technibilt and Hartford argue the Commission erred when it: (1) found that plaintiff's last injurious exposure occurred when Hartford was the carrier \"on the risk\" and (2) failed to make any findings on whether Travelers was estopped from denying the compensability of plaintiff's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    III. Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Our Supreme Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   when reviewing Industrial Commission decisions, appellate courts must examine \"whether any competent evidence supports the Commission's findings of fact and whether [those] findings ... support the Commission's conclusions of law.\" The Commission's findings of fact are conclusive on appeal when supported by such competent evidence, \"even though there [is] evidence that would support findings to the contrary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    McRae v.

Last Injurious Exposure\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Technibilt and Hartford argue that the Commission erred when it entered findings of fact \"regarding the last injurious exposure issue....\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Technibilt and Hartford assign error to findings of fact numbered 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23, which state:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   16. Dr. Caulfield testified that plaintiff's press welder job with defendant is a substantial causative factor of plaintiff's bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, and that persons who do that job have a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome than members of the population not similarly exposed. Dr. Caulfield recommended surgery on plaintiff's right hand first and then perhaps the left hand. Dr. Caulfield indicated that plaintiff's condition had gotten worse from 2003 to 2006 as plaintiff continued to work for defendant and that a delay in surgery creates a risk of permanent muscle weakness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   19. Since April 1, 2005, plaintiff's condition has continued to worsen as she continued working in her same position for defendant. Plaintiff testified that the numbness and pain is worse and is a nine or ten on a one to ten scale. The more baby seats plaintiff welds in a day, the worse her symptoms are. Plaintiff testified that due to the numbness in her hands she had difficulty combing her hair, talking on the telephone, and driving to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   20. Due to the worsening and severity of her pain from continued employment with defendant since April 1, 2005, plaintiff wishes to proceed with carpal tunnel surgery. However, plaintiff has been unable to get her group insurance to approve the surgery even though defendants have refused responsibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   21. Prior to April 1, 2005, plaintiff's condition was not such that surgery was a necessity, nor did it cause plaintiff any incapacity from work. Plaintiff's condition progressed and was augmented due to her continued employment with defendant following April 1, 2005. Since then, plaintiff has been diagnosed with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome as opposed to only right carpal tunnel syndrome which has progressed to the point of necessitating operative treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   22. Dr. Peltzer, Dr. Pekman, and Dr. Caulfield are of the opinion that plaintiff's employment with defendant caused her condition and that if plaintiff continues such employment her condition is likely to worsen or be aggravated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   23. The undersigned find that plaintiff's occupational disease was caused by her employment with defendant. Based upon the greater weight of the evidence, the undersigned find that plaintiff's occupational disease was augmented and worsened by her employment with defendant following April 1, 2005 when defendant Hartford Insurance came on the risk for defendant. Therefore, defendant Hartford Insurance was on the risk at the time of plaintiff's last injurious exposure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Technibilt and Hartford also assign error to the Commission's conclusion of law numbered 2, which states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   2. Pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 97-57 where an occupational disease is compensable \"the employer in whose employment the employee was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of such disease, and the insurance carrier, if any, which was on the risk when the employee was last exposed under such employer, shall be liable\".
