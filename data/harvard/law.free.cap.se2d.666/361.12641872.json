STEVEN AGEE.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Lynchburg Division of Social Services (\"LDSS\") appeals from the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of Lynchburg awarding custody of a minor child to James and Sandra Cook. For the reasons set forth below, we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. RELEVANT FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Amy Cook lived in the City of Lynchburg with her husband, Jimmy Cook, and their seventeen-month-old daughter, BC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 26, 2004, Amy presented to Lynchburg General Hospital with severe depression and alleged that Jimmy had caused her condition by taking pornographic pictures of BC and viewing pornography with BC sitting in his lap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response to Amy's allegations, Lisa Parks, a Child Protective Service worker with the LDSS, and investigators from the Lynchburg Police Department interviewed the Cooks and obtained a search warrant, under which they seized computer equipment and approximately 300 images from the Cooks' home. In an affidavit in support of an emergency removal petition under Code \u00a7 16.1-251, Parks stated that most of the seized images were pornographic and depicted participants under the age of 18. According to Parks' affidavit, Jimmy denied taking pornographic pictures of his daughter and no objectionable pictures of BC were found. However, Jimmy admitted that he took photographs of his daughter for entry into photography contests and used the other pictures for ideas of how to pose BC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In addition to Amy's accusations and the seized images, the LDSS investigation revealed Jimmy had a criminal conviction for assault against a six-year-old child in 1994. Amy admitted that she and Jimmy's family were aware of the earlier charges and that Jimmy used pornography prior to BC's birth. Though BC was unable to verbalize or respond to interview questions, Parks observed her engaging in sexual mimicry during a visit to the Cooks' home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 6, 2004, Jimmy was arrested on two counts of possession of child pornography in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   That day, Amy took BC to Amy's aunt's home in accordance with a safety plan developed by Parks. However, Amy returned with BC to their home in Lynchburg that night, in violation of the safety plan. On the afternoon of April 7, following Jimmy's release from custody and Amy's violation of the safety plan, the LDSS placed BC in protective custody. Amy, Jimmy, and Jimmy's mother, Sandra Cook,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   each filed petitions for custody of BC in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court of the City of Lynchburg (\"Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B. FOSTER CARE PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 8, 2004, the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court entered an emergency removal order under Code \u00a7 16.1-251 transferring temporary custody of BC to the LDSS based upon findings that she \"would be subjected to an imminent threat to life or health to the extent that severe or irremediable injury would be likely to result if she were returned to or left in the custody of ... her parents\" and that reasonable efforts had been made to prevent her removal from the home. The Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court then entered a preliminary removal order under Code \u00a7 16.1-252 confirming the LDSS as BC's temporary legal custodian \"pending the entry of a dispositional order pursuant to Virginia Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2\" and directing the LDSS to complete the investigation required by that section. At a subsequent hearing under Code \u00a7 16.1-252(G), the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court made the specific finding that BC \"is abused or neglected.\" The court set the date for the Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2 dispositional hearing and directed the LDSS to file a foster care plan under Code \u00a7 16.1-281.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The LDSS foster care plan recommended placing BC in a foster home with the goal of later returning her home. The Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court adopted the foster care plan submitted by the LDSS and entered a July 1, 2004, order transferring custody of BC to the LDSS and setting a foster care review hearing under Code \u00a7 16.1-282 for January 4, 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The LDSS submitted a revised foster care plan, substituting a goal of continuing foster care for the earlier goal of returning BC to her parents' home. The Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court adopted that foster care plan at the January 4, 2005, foster care review hearing and set a permanency planning hearing under Code \u00a7 16.1-282.1 for May 27, 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   C. CUSTODY PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   While the foregoing proceedings were in progress, the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court conducted hearings regarding the three competing petitions for custody filed by Amy, Jimmy, and the Grandparents, and ordered the court service unit to conduct an investigation of them. Subsequent to the January 4, 2005, foster care plan review order, but prior to the scheduled May 27, 2005, permanency planning hearing, the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court entered a final custody order on March 11, 2005, awarding custody of BC to the Grandparents. Amy, Jimmy, and the LDSS separately appealed to the Circuit Court for the City of Lynchburg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   D. APPELLATE PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Prior to trial de novo on the appeals in the circuit court, a motion by the LDSS to suspend the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court's March 11, 2005, custody order was denied. The circuit court also determined in an interlocutory order that \"there is no requirement for or need for a permanency planning hearing in the Juvenile Court on May 27, 2005.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In October 2005, at the conclusion of a two-day trial, the circuit court awarded custody of BC to the Grandparents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court's final order of November 22, 2005, stated that \"[u]pon consideration of the evidence and all of the statutory factors set forth in Virginia Code \u00a7 20-124.3 ... the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the best interests of [BC] require that her custody be awarded to James and Sandra Cook, her paternal grandparents, and it is so ORDERED.\" Additionally, the court's order set forth that \"[u]pon consideration of all the evidence adduced at the hearing, this Court finds that no further provision of social services to the child are required.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The LDSS timely objected to the circuit court's order, noting the circuit court failed to make the findings required in foster care proceedings under Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-281(C1), 16.1-282(D1), and 16.1-282.1(A1) (collectively, \"the foster care statutes\"). The LDSS also objected on the basis that the evidence was insufficient to support transfer of custody\n   to the Grandparents as being in the best interests of the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On appeal to the Court of Appeals, a divided panel of that court reversed the judgment of the circuit court in an unpublished opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Lynchburg Div.

The panel majority determined that the circuit court erred in awarding custody of BC to the Grandparents because the specific fact-finding requirements under the applicable foster care statutes were not made.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%20325748\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The panel majority also held that the circuit court erred in awarding custody without conducting the permanency planning hearing and terminating the LDSS's involvement in the case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%20325748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Upon rehearing en banc, the en banc majority of the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Servs. v. Cook,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    50 Va.App. 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 228,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    648 S.E.2d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 333 (2007). The en banc majority noted the provision of Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A) stating that \"[t]he authority of the juvenile court to consider a petition involving the custody of a child\n   <em>\n    shall not be proscribed or limited\n   </em>\n   where the child has previously been awarded to the custody of a local board of social services\" and then referenced the provision in Code \u00a7 16.1-278.15 authorizing the court in a custody case under Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3) to \"make\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   order of disposition ... as may be made by the circuit court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    at 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    648 S.E.2d at 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). Observing that the Grandparents had filed their custody petition under Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3), the majority concluded the \"any order\" language of Code \u00a7 16.1-278.15 authorized the juvenile and domestic relations district courts and circuit courts to award custody of BC without meeting any of the finding requirements in the foster care statutes:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-241(A) and 16.1-278.15(B), the General Assembly has stated unequivocally that the JDR court's authority to consider such a petition is not \"proscribed or limited\" by the fact that \"custody of the child has previously been awarded to [DSS].\" Consequently, through these provisions, the General Assembly has made the foster care plan statutes subordinate to the statutes under which the Cooks were awarded custody of their granddaughter, and did not conflate the two statutory schemes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Given that the courts below had the authority to adjudicate the Cooks' petition and award them custody apart from the foster care plan, the courts also correctly applied the \"best interest of the child\" standard in making that award, pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-278.15(F), 20-124.2(B), and 20-124.3, rather than the standard for approving foster care parents, which did not apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    at 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    648 S.E.2d at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thus, in the en banc majority's view, the general \"best interests of the child\" determination required under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-124.2 and 20-124.3 (collectively, the \"general custody statutes\") supersedes and replaces the findings required under the foster care statutes when a Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3) custody petition is before the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    at 226-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    648 S.E.2d at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Echoing their panel majority opinion, the two en banc dissenting judges observed that the specific foster care statutes applicable to a child who, like BC, was statutorily subject to a foster care plan, do not reference the general custody statutes. The en banc dissent noted that each of the foster care statutes require that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Any\n   </em>\n   order transferring custody of the child to a relative other than the child's prior family shall be entered only upon a finding, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, that the relative is one who, after an investigation as directed by the court, (i) is found by the court to be willing and qualified to receive and care for the child; (ii) is willing to have a positive, continuous relationship with the child; (iii) is committed to providing a permanent, suitable home for the child; and (iv) is willing and has the ability to protect the child from abuse and neglect;\n   <em>\n    and the order shall so state.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-281(C1), 16.1-282(D1), 16.1-282.1(A1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The dissent observed that the majority opinion failed to harmonize the general custody and foster care statutory schemes. The dissent saw those schemes, correctly read, as not in conflict; thus the majority's conclusion that the foster care statutes were \"subordinate\" to the general custody statutes was erroneous. Rejecting the majority's construction of Code \u00a7 16.1-278.15(B), the dissent noted \"placement with DSS does not proscribe or limit the circuit court's ability to\n   <em>\n    consider\n   </em>\n   a petition for custody. In other words, the child's placement does not remove the trial court's jurisdiction over issues such as custody.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    50 Va.App. at 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    648 S.E.2d at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Humphreys, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Concluding, the en banc dissent observed: Code \u00a7 16.1-281 was not intended to \"divest\" the trial court of jurisdiction over the custody matter, nor was it intended to limit or proscribe the trial court's authority to\n   <em>\n    entertain\n   </em>\n   the custody matter. Nor does Code \u00a7 16.1-281 limit the trial court to considering just the foster care plan or the objectives set forth by DSS. In fact, Code \u00a7 16.1-241 makes it perfectly clear that the trial court has jurisdiction over custody matters.... [W]hen read in conjunction with the other pertinent statutes, Code \u00a7 16.1-281 simply requires that when the custody of an abused and neglected child is at issue, the trial court must make specific written findings of fact, designed to protect the child from the dangers for which he or she was removed from the home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-281, 16.1-282, 16.1-282.1. In other words, the trial court is free to decide the issue of custody as it sees fit, so long as it incorporates into the record [the required findings of the foster care statutes].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    50 Va.App. at 235-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    648 S.E.2d at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Humphreys, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The en banc Court of Appeals denied the Grandparents' request of an award under Code \u00a7 16.1-278.19 for the attorney's fees and costs incurred by them in that court: \"[W]e cannot say DSS's position in this case was unreasonable ... because the litigation addressed appropriate and substantial issues. ...\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    648 S.E.2d at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We awarded the LDSS an appeal and also awarded the Grandparents an appeal on their assignment of cross-error regarding the denial of attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The LDSS makes two assignments of error to the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Initially, the LDSS contends the Court of Appeals erred by \"holding that the detailed statutory scheme for custody of abused or neglected children ... is `subordinate' to the general custody and visitation provisions of Title 20, and in declining to enforce the requirements\n   of Title 16.1.\" Because we find this assignment of error dispositive, we do not address the second assignment of error by the LDSS challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support the award of custody to the Grandparents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A. THE FOSTER CARE AND GENERAL CUSTODY STATUTORY SCHEMES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The LDSS argues that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that \"the General Assembly has made the foster care plan statutes subordinate to the statutes under which the Cooks were awarded custody of their granddaughter,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    50 Va.App. at 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    648 S.E.2d at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a child subject to a foster care plan and who had been found to have been abused or neglected. The LDSS contends the Court of Appeals failed to harmonize the two statutory schemes, the foster care statutes and the general custody statutes, which the court saw as conflicting, and ignored the plain language of the more specific statutory scheme in unwarranted deference to statutes of general application. As a result of the Court of Appeals' opinion, the LDSS argues any \"person with a legitimate interest\" under Code \u00a7 20-124.1 entitled to file a petition for custody of a child subject to a foster care plan could effectively circumvent the foster care statutes by simply filing a petition for custody. Consequently, the LDSS contends the Court of Appeals' decision eliminates the statutory safeguards embedded in the foster care statutes intended to protect vulnerable children like BC. The LDSS concludes the General Assembly did not intend such \"far-reaching and deleterious consequences\" when it created the two statutory frameworks. We agree with the LDSS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The statutes governing foster care proceedings are detailed and require specific findings by the court at each stage of the process whether involving a child, like BC, found to be abused or neglected, or a child who is abandoned or otherwise within the statutory ambit. In emergency situations, an allegedly abused or neglected child may be removed upon an order entered after an ex parte emergency removal hearing. The petitioning party must prove that \"[t]he child would be subjected to an imminent threat to life or health to the extent that severe or irremediable injury would be likely to result\" without the removal and that \"[r]easonable efforts have been made to prevent removal ... and there are no alternatives less drastic than removal ... which could reasonably protect the child's life or health pending a final hearing on the petition.\" Code \u00a7 16.1-251(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   A juvenile and domestic relations district court may also order the removal of an allegedly abused or neglected child by entering a preliminary removal order under Code \u00a7 16.1-252(A). The party petitioning for removal must prove the same facts as required for an emergency removal order. Code \u00a7 16.1-252(E). Following the preliminary removal hearing, the juvenile and domestic relations district court may place the child in the custody of a suitable agency or of a suitable person under the supervision of the local department of social services. Code \u00a7 16.1-252(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The court must conduct a dispositional hearing within seventy-five days of the initial preliminary removal hearing. Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-252(H), 16.1-278.2(A). As a result of the dispositional hearing, \"[i]f the child is found to be ... abused or neglected,\" the court may transfer custody subject to a foster care plan under Code \u00a7 16.1-281 \"[a]fter a finding that there is no less drastic alternative.\" Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2(A). This statute also requires that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Any\n   </em>\n   order transferring custody of a child to a relative ... shall be entered only upon a finding, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, that the relative ... is one who, after an investigation as directed by the court, (i) is found by the court to be willing and qualified to receive and care for the child; (ii) is willing to have a positive, continuous relationship with the child; (iii) is committed to providing a permanent, suitable home for the child; and (iv) is willing and has the ability to protect the child from abuse and neglect;\n   <em>\n    and the order shall so state.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2(A1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The juvenile and domestic relations district court must conduct a foster care plan hearing\n   within seventy-five days of the dispositional hearing. Code \u00a7 16.1-281(C). While the court may revise the foster care plan, \"\n   <em>\n    [a]ny\n   </em>\n   order transferring custody of the child to a relative other than the child's prior family shall be entered only upon a finding, based upon a preponderance of the evidence\" of the same facts required to be found under Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2(A1),\n   <em>\n    \"and the order shall so state.\"\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 16.1-281(C1) (emphasis added). Within six months of the foster care plan hearing, the court must conduct a foster care review hearing under Code \u00a7 16.1-282(A).

Those findings, under the plain terms of the statutes, must be stated in the order transferring custody. Neither the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court nor the circuit court did so in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   By comparison, the statutes of general application governing custody of a child are much less specific than the foster care statutory scheme. For example, under Code \u00a7 16.1-278.15, titled \"Custody or visitation, child or spousal support generally,\" subsection F requires \"[i]n any case ... the court shall consider the best interests of the child\" and references Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-124.1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 20-124.2(B) also states that \"the court shall give primary consideration to the best interests of the child\" and Code \u00a7 20-124.3 sets forth ten nonexclusive factors the court \"shall consider.\" However, in contrast to the findings required under Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2(A1) and the foster care statutes, there is no statutory requirement that a court's findings on the child's best interests under the general custody statutes be stated in the resulting custody order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 20-124.3 (\"In determining best interests of a child for purposes of determining custody ...

The Court of Appeals failed to apply the plain language of the more specific statutory requirements of the foster care statutes and give those provisions effect in a custody proceeding involving a child subject to a foster care plan. When the Court of Appeals concluded the foster care statutes were \"subordinate\" to the general custody statutes in that circumstance, it also erred by not reading those statutes in harmonious effect with the general custody statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court of Appeals mistakenly read certain language in Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-241(A) and 16.1-278.15(B) as subordinating the foster care statutes to the general custody statutes. Both Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A) and 16.1-278.15(B) contain the following language: \"The authority of the juvenile court to consider a petition involving the custody of a child shall not be proscribed or limited where the child has previously been awarded to the custody of a local board of social services.\" The Court of Appeals read this statutory provision in conjunction with the Code \u00a7 16.1-278.15(A) provision that \"the court may make\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   order of disposition\" in a Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3) custody case as eliminating any application of the foster care statutes to the custody determination of BC. However, the \"shall not be proscribed or limited\" language merely confirms the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court's authority to exercise its jurisdiction, granted by Code \u00a7 16.1-241, in a custody case involving a child subject to a foster care plan. Nothing in that language reflects any curtailment of the application of the foster care statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The en banc dissent succinctly described the interrelation of these statutory schemes, and why the Court of Appeals conclusion was erroneous, when it noted that the foster care statutes do not\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   limit the trial court to considering just the foster care plan or the objectives set forth by DSS. In fact, Code \u00a7 16.1-241 makes it perfectly clear that the trial court has jurisdiction over custody matters.... [W]hen read in conjunction with the other pertinent statutes, Code \u00a7 16.1-281 simply requires that when the custody of an abused and neglected child is at issue, the trial court must make specific written findings of fact, designed to protect the child from the dangers for which he or she was removed from the home. See Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-281, 16.1-282, 16.1-282.1. In other words, the trial court is free to decide the issue of custody as it sees fit, so long as it incorporates into the record a finding that [states the requirements of the foster care statutes].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    50 Va.App. at 235-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    648 S.E.2d at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Humphreys, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The requirement that the trial court make the findings mandated by the foster care statutes in no way \"proscribe[s] or limit[s]\" the\n   <em>\n    authority\n   </em>\n   of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court to exercise its subject matter jurisdiction over child custody cases. To the contrary, the statutory schemes of the foster care and general custody statutes are harmonized, and the plain meaning of the more specific foster care statutes is applied, when the trial court adjudicates a custody case involving a child subject to a foster care plan by making the required foster care statutory findings and stating those findings in its order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court of Appeals' reliance on the Code \u00a7 16.1-278.15(A) provision that the \"court may make any order\" as a form of plenary authority to ignore the foster care statutes is also misplaced. Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A) is the statutory grant of jurisdiction to the Juvenile\n   and Domestic Relations Court in custody cases. The Code \u00a7 16.1-278.15(A) language only applies in the Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3) subset of custody cases which are of general application: \"of controversy or requires determination.\" The Code \u00a7 16.1-278.15(A) language merely provides that the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court's authority in Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3) custody cases is as extensive as that of the circuit court: it in no way applies any limitation on the applicability of the foster care statutes. Moreover, the jurisdictional basis in BC's case was more appropriately Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(1), which is the specific jurisdictional statute applicable to custody of a child \"who is alleged to be abused [or] neglected.\" As the en banc dissent noted, the Court of Appeals' expansive reading of Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3) through Code \u00a7 16.1-278.15(A) \"renders Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(1) meaningless.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    50 Va.App. at 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187074\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/218/#p228\">\n    648 S.E.2d at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The only interpretation of the relevant provisions of Title 16.1 and Title 20 that gives effect to both statutory schemes, and the intent of the General Assembly, is that a trial court must make the specific factual findings required by the foster care statutes in a custody case involving a child subject to a foster care plan. The interpretation offered by the Court of Appeals would permit any \"[p]erson with a legitimate interest\" under Code \u00a7 20-124.1 entitled to file a petition for custody to circumvent a pending foster care proceeding. Such a general custody exception to the statutory provisions governing foster care proceedings would eviscerate the General Assembly's detailed framework intended to safeguard a child, like BC, who was subject to a foster care plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Once a child has become subject to proceedings under the foster care statutes, a court may not transfer custody without the specific, written factual findings required by the foster care statutes. This statutory mandate holds true whether the custody order is entered upon a petition for custody, a petition for a foster care review hearing, or a petition for a permanency planning hearing. An award of custody without such findings, as in the case at bar, is error as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Moreover, it is contrary to the clear and plain language of the foster care statutes to conclude those specific statutory findings are subsumed by findings under the best interests of the child standard. For example, each of the foster care statutes requires a finding that the child's relative seeking custody \"is willing and has the ability to protect the child from abuse and neglect.\" That distinct and required finding is not within any mandated parameter of the best interests of the child inquiry and such a finding was clearly not made in the case at bar. Allowing the best interests of the child standard to subsume these explicit statutory requirements would render those requirements meaningless and write out of the foster care statutes the mandatory directive that \"the order shall so state.\" We avoid such interpretations. \"The rules of statutory interpretation argue against reading any legislative enactment in a manner that will make a portion of it useless, repetitious, or absurd.

We will also reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals denying the attorney's fees claim of the Grandparents. We will remand the case to the Court of Appeals with instructions to remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. Such proceedings include the application of the proper statutory standards for the determination of the custody of BC and whether attorney's fees should be awarded the Grandparents with regard to the appellate proceedings in the Court of Appeals and this Court. Pending such hearing and further order of the circuit court, custody of BC shall remain with the Grandparents with visitation to Amy Cook and Jimmy Cook, respectively, as set forth in the circuit court's order of November 22, 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2.\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Except where otherwise noted, we refer to the adult parties sharing a surname by their given names.
