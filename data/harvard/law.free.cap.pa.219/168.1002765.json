Considering the word as it appears in the contract in suit, in relation to the subject-matter of the contract, the nature of the transaction and the connection in which it is used, the defendant contends that its meaning is exclusive. Especially does he so contend when it is considered in connection with the word \u201c by \u201d as it stands in the second clause above quoted, from the contract in suit. Primarily the word \u201c until \u201d is one of exclusion: Rex v. Stevens, 5 East, 243; Webster v. French, 12 Ill. 302; Corbin v. Ketcham, 87 Ind. 138; Bemis v. Leonard, 118 Mass. 502; People v.

It was not required to be in writing and the manifest meaning and understanding of the parties in the words \u201c the party of the second part shall have until the 10th day of July to accept\u201d were that they should have that day. The findings of the judge were upon sufficient evidence and his conclusions therefrom were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
