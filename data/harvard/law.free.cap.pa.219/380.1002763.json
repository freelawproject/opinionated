F. John the said sum of $8,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-15\">To be followed by proof that at the time the mortgage was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>given it was agreed between the parties that the question of damages to the mine under this lease and the question of payment of the $8,000 under the agreement between the same parties, should be adjusted between the parties when the payments of the mortgage fell due, and that at the time the mortgage was given the question of damages to the mine and the claim of John for $8,000 for failure to erect the mining plant, or mining improvements provided for, were discussed, and it was agreed between them that the matter should be left open till the payment of the mortgage fell due, and the matters then adjusted between the parties in connection with the payment \u2014 this agreement being in parol.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-4\">Mr. Kooser: These offers of evidence are objected to as irrelevant, immaterial and incompetent; all matters arising under the lease or agreement offered are closed by the sale and mortgage in suit; it is not competent to prove by parol any such purpose as evidence \u2014 any matters to alter or contradict the written instrument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-5\">The agreement is further objected to for the reason that copies have not been furnished with the pleadings, as required by rule of court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-6\">Mr. Ruppel: In reply we wish to state that an affidavit of defense was filed and copies of the agreement given with it.

Hohman, 207 Pa. 289. But in any event there was nothing to show, and no allegation even made, that the defendant had released his rights or claims as to either of these items, and by agreement between the parties it was perfectly legitimate to refer the matter for adjustment in connection with the collection of the mortgage. The mortgagees were nonresidents of the county. To settle the disputed question in connection with the payment of the mortgage would have insured the defendant against any possible hardship or inconvenience of seeking the mortgagors in another, forum. Again, in the absence of a special agreement it might be argued, as was done in this case in the objection to the offer, that all matters between the parties relating to this subject-matter were merged in the mortgage. This, however, would be a mere presumption or inference, which can be rebutted by oral testimony.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-7\"><em>Ernest O.

On the trial defendant offered to set off against plaintiff\u2019s demand two distinct claims held in his own right against the mortgagee. Part of the offer was to show that at the time the mortgage was given, these claims being then in existence, it was agreed between the parties that they should be adjusted when the mortgage fell due and in connection with its payment. The offer was rejected on the ground that it tended to contradict or change by parol the written instrument on which the plaintiff relied. This was a misapplication of the rule. In no sense would the evidence under the offer contradict or vary the terms of the mortgage. If the claims embraced in the offer were such as could be properly used by way of set-off under our defalcation act, the agreement between the parties that they might be so used, was of no consequence whatever. The question was, were they such claims ? If they were, the evidence supporting them should have been admitted, leaving it to the jury to decide as to its sufficiency, under proper instructions. Mortgages are not excepted out of the general defalcation act, and they may be reduced by way of set-off just as other evidences of indebtedness. Defendant\u2019s offer was to prove two distinct claims by way of set-off, first, a liquidated indebtedness of $8,000 arising on written articles of agreement by which the appellee became bound to pay to the appellant this specific sum upon a certain default, which appellant proposed to prove had occurred ; and second, a claim for unliquidated damages for failure on part of appellant to operate certain leased coal mines according to the terms of its agreement. With respect to the first, defendant\u2019s right to set it off, providing his proof be adequate and the claim a liqui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>dated one, is not open to doubt. This right he would have under the statute. The second being a claim for unliquidated damages, and therefore not of equal dignity with the mortgage, his right of set-off with respect to it, if any such right exists, must be derived from the agreement he alleges with respect to it. The law denies the right of set-off where the claim is for damages arising ex contractu, and the damages are not capable of liquidation by any known legal standard. \u201c A debt or the damages which can be set off as an independent counterclaim must be such as a jury can find and liquidate in the ordinary way just as if the defendant were a plaintiff suing in debt, assumpsit or covenant:\u201d Russell v. Miller, 54 Pa. 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Our cases are quite consistent, however, in holding that even such claims may be applied as a credit or set-off where the parties have so agreed. It is only necessary to refer to Hopkins v. Stockdale, 117 Pa. 365. The only assignment of error relates to the rejection of defendant\u2019s offer, and it is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Judgment reversed, and venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
