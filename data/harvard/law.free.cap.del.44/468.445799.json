Moreover, in many cases it operates as a hardship upon the Defendant. I am of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>opinion that, upon application in a proper case, the Court in which the judgment is entered, should have the inherent power to order it opened for the purpose of ascertaining the correct amount due.
