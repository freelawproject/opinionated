He appeals the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 4\">*Supp. 4</page-number>judgment of conviction following a jury trial of soliciting another person to engage in an act of prostitution (Pen. Code, \u00a7 647, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">Defendant contends the judgment should be reversed because (1) there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction; (2) the court erred in failing to instruct the jury with CALCRIM No. 358; (3) the court incorrectly answered a jury question; (4) the prosecutor committed misconduct during closing argument; (5) irrelevant and inflammatory testimony was erroneously admitted at trial; (6) the combination of errors rendered his trial fundamentally unfair; and (7) two of his probation conditions were invalid and should be stricken. As discussed below, we reject each of the contentions, and affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">II. <em>FACTS</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">III. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-7\">A.-R*</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-8\">G. <em>Probation Conditions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-9\">The trial court suspended imposition of sentence, and placed defendant on probation for 36 months on various conditions. Defendant contends the following two conditions were invalid: \u201cDo not engage or offer to engage in sexual activity in a public place or a place open to the public or exposed to public view. [][] Do not rent, register, occupy, or be present in any motel or hotel room unless it is your actual residence and registered or rented to you in your true name.\u201d Defendant contends the conditions are unreasonable under <em>People </em>v. <em>Lent </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 481, 486 [124 Cal.Rptr. 905, 541 P.2d 545] <em>(Lent), </em>the former condition is unconstitutionally vague, and the latter violates his constitutional right to travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-10\">We agree with defendant the vagueness and right to travel contentions are not forfeited by failure to object in the trial court because they involve pure questions of law, undisputed facts, and facial constitutional challenges. (See <em>In re Sheena K. </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 875, 889 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 716, 153 P.3d 282]; <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 388, 394 [149 Cal.Rptr. 375, 584 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 5\">*Supp. 5</page-number>512].) We decide constitutional issues de nova <em>(Vo v. City of Garden Grove </em>(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 425, 433 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 257]). The contention that the court abused its discretion under <em>Lent </em>by imposing unreasonable conditions of probation is forfeited because defendant\u2019s attorney did not object to the conditions in the trial court. <em>(People v. Welch </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 228, 237 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 520, 851 P.2d 802]; <em>People v. Rodriguez </em>(2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 578, 585 [166 Cal.Rptr.3d 187].) We analyze the constitutionality of each of the conditions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">\n<em>Sexual activity in public</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-6\">The court barred defendant as a condition of probation from engaging or offering to engage in sexual activity in a public place, or a place open to the public, or exposed to public view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-7\">Regarding the constitutionality of the condition, \u201c[a] probation condition \u2018must be sufficiently precise for the probationer to know what is required of him, and for the court to determine whether the condition has been violated,\u2019 if it is to withstand a challenge on the ground of vagueness. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Sheena K., supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 890.) The \u201cunderpinning of a vagueness challenge is the due process concept of \u2018fair warning.\u2019 [Citation.] The rule of fair warning consists of \u2018the due process concepts of preventing arbitrary law enforcement and providing adequate notice to potential offenders\u2019 [citation] . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1307-8\">Defendant maintains the condition was vague because the term \u201csexual activity\u201d can be broadly defined to encompass, according to a Wikipedia entry cited by defendant, a wide variety of behavior, such as conduct intended to arouse the sexual interest of another, like holding hands and kissing in public. We do not consider Wikipedia to be a sufficiently reliable source of authority. (See <em>In re Marriage of LaMoure </em>(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 807, 826 [132 Cal.Rptr.3d 1]; see also <em>Crispin </em>v. <em>Christian Audigier, Inc. </em>(C.D.Cal. 2010) 717 F.Supp.2d 965, 977, fn. 19 [collecting cases questioning the reliability of Wikipedia entries].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-9\">\u201cWhen attempting to ascertain the ordinary, usual meaning of a word, courts appropriately refer to the dictionary definition of that word. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Wasatch Property Management v. Degrate </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1111, 1121-1122 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 262, 112 P.3d 647].) While the words \u201csex,\u201d \u201csexual,\u201d and \u201cactivity\u201d are defined in the dictionary, there is no definition for the term \u201csexual activity.\u201d (See, e.g., Oxford Dictionaries Online (2014) &lt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/sex&gt;; &lt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/sexual&gt;; &lt;http://www. oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/activity&gt; [as of Nov. 5, 2014].) Instead of the dictionary, we rely on the definition of the conduct underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 6\">*Supp. 6</page-number>prostitution, i.e., engaging in sexual intercourse or any lewd act between persons. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 525, 534 [163 Cal.Rptr. 99].) Defining \u201csexual activity\u201d in this manner is appropriate because it pertains to the same crime for which defendant was placed on probation\u2014 soliciting another person to engage in an act of prostitution (Pen. Code, \u00a7 647, subd. (b)). It is also appropriate because the definition is \u201c \u2018sufficiently precise for the probationer to know what is required of him, and for the court to determine whether the condition has been violated [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Sheena K., supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 890.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">The term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d has a specific meaning which clearly communicates to defendant what is proscribed: \u201cSexual intercourse means any penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or genitalia by the penis.\u201d (CALCRIM No. 1000, italics omitted [defining term for purposes of rape; Pen. Code, \u00a7 261]; accord, <em>People v. Dunn </em>(2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1086, 1097 [141 Cal.Rptr.3d 193]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Karsai </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 224, 232 [182 Cal.Rptr. 406], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People v. Jones </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 585, 600, fn. 8 [250 Cal.Rptr. 635, 758 P.2d 1165].) \u201cLewd\u201d has been defined both for purposes of prostitution-related crimes and for the offense of committing a lewd act in public (Pen. Code, \u00a7 647, subd. (a)) as \u201c \u2018the touching of the genitals, buttocks, or female breast for the purpose of sexual arousal [or] gratification . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Hill, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.3d at p. 534, fn. omitted.) Using this definition preserves the constitutionality of the probation condition because, as explained by the Court of Appeal, the definition delineates the term \u201clewd\u201d \u201cin a well defined, limited manner so as to make the . . . [term] satisfy constitutional standards of specificity\u201d and prevent the condition of probation \u201cfrom being unconstitutionally vague.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>This definition also allays defendant\u2019s concern regarding the sweep of the probation condition because the definition recognizes that \u201cthe varieties of sexual expression are almost infinite . . . ,\u201d and avoids banning \u201call sexually motivated public conduct, for such a sweeping prohibition would encompass much innocent and nonoffensive behavior.\u201d <em>(Pryor </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 238, 256 [158 Cal.Rptr. 330, 599 P.2d 636].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">Defendant was thus provided \u201cfair warning\u201d not to engage in, or offer to engage in, \u201csexual activity,\u201d meaning sexual intercourse or any lewd act between persons, in a public place or a place open to the public, or exposed to public view. A court could readily determine whether defendant violated this condition of probation. In sum, the \u201ccore due process requirement of adequate notice\u201d <em>(In re H.C. </em>(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1067, 1071-1072 [96 Cal.Rptr.3d 793]) was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 7\">*Supp. 7</page-number>\n<em>Hotel and motel room occupancy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">The court barred defendant as a condition of probation from renting, registering, occupying, or being present in any motel or hotel room \u201cunless it is his actual residence\u201d and it is registered or rented by him in his name.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument that \u201cactual residence\u201d means a place where defendant is domiciled or where he permanently lives. We construe the condition in a way that comports with the language it uses and which renders it valid. (See <em>People v. Turner </em>(2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1432, 1436 [66 Cal.Rptr.3d 803]; <em>In re Justin S. </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 811, 816 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 466].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">We are guided by the definition of \u201cresidence\u201d used in connection with the registration of sex offenders living as transients: \u201c \u2018[Residence\u2019 means one or more addresses at which a person regularly resides, regardless of the number of days or nights spent there . . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 290.011, subd. (g).) Use of this definition is appropriate because it specifically includes hotels and motels (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 290.011, subd. (g)), and it has been held to not be unconstitutionally vague (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzales </em>(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 24, 37-38 [107 Cal.Rptr.3d 11]). Also, the definition accounts for the specific behavior the court in this case sought to regulate \u2014 use of hotels or motels to engage in sexual activity with street-walking prostitutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-8\">With respect to the constitutionality of the probation condition, a person has the constitutional right to interstate and intrastate travel. <em>(Tobe v. City of Santa Ana </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1069, 1100 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 402, 892 P.2d 1145]; <em>In re White </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 141, 148 [158 Cal.Rptr. 562].) A person\u2019s right to travel, \u201calthough not absolute, may be restricted only as reasonably necessary to further a legitimate governmental interest [citation].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1245, 1250 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 316].) \u201cA probation condition that imposes limitations on a person\u2019s constitutional rights must closely tailor those limitations to the purpose of the condition to avoid being invalidated as unconstitutionally overbroad. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Sheena K., </em>supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 890.) \u201c[W]here an otherwise valid condition of probation impinges on constitutional rights, such conditions must be carefully tailored, \u2018 \u201creasonably related to the compelling state interest in reformation and rehabilitation ....\u2019\u201d [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Bauer </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 937, 942 [260 Cal.Rptr. 62].) \u201cThe essential question in an overbreadth challenge is the closeness of the fit between the legitimate purpose of the restriction and the burden it imposes on the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights \u2014 bearing in mind, of course, that perfection in such matters is impossible, and that practical necessity will justify some infringement.\u201d <em>(In re E.O. </em>(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153 [115 Cal.Rptr.3d 869].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 8\">*Supp. 8</page-number>The hotel/motel room condition is directly related and closely tailored to defendent\u2019s rehabilitation because it limits the places where he can engage in sexual activity with prostitutes. Further, the burden the condition imposes on defendant\u2019s right to travel is not severe. He may travel and stay at hotels and motels, so long as he regularly resides therein, and the location is registered or rented to him using his true name. He may be present at other people\u2019s houses and apartments when he travels, even without regularly residing there. Moreover, the condition places no restrictions on the vacation rental of apartments or houses. In sum, limiting a defendant\u2019s use of a motel or hotel in order to make it more difficult for him to engage in prostitution-related sex acts is a legitimate governmental interest, and the present condition is reasonably necessary to further the interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">IV. <em>DISPOSITION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">Kumar, Acting P.
