It is then alleged in said complaint that no notice of defendant\u2019s application to be appointed guardian of plaintiff\u2019s estate was ever served upon plaintiff, and that defendant procured her appointment as such guardian upon a false affidavit, but said complaint fails to show the contents of such affidavit, or the particulars in which it was false. A further allegation of said complaint sets forth that defendant had presented her final account as such guardian and the same had been approved by the court, and defendant discharged as guardian of plaintiff\u2019s estate. No question is made but that the defendant has paid and delivered to plaintiff all money or other property shown to belong to him by the order approving said final account. We are at a loss to understand upon what ground the plaintiff bases his claim for damages. None is set forth in his brief, and we discover none from an examination of said complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Preston, J., and Seawell, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
