The Findings of Fact and Opinion of the Tax Court, 28 T.C. 728, that petitioner failed to establish that he was an employee are adequately supported by substantial evidence. Hence we consider only the claim by the petitioner that the Tax Court erred by placing upon him the burden of proving that he was an \u201cemployee\u201d and not a \u201csubcontractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Rule 32 of the Rules of Practice Before the Tax Court of the United States, 26 U.S.C.A. (I.R.C.1954) \u00a7 7453 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">\u201cThe burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner, except as otherwise provided by statute, and except that in respect of any new matter pleaded in his answer, it shall be upon the respondent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The petitioner urges that inasmuch as Section 108 of the Renegotiation Act, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 1218, provides that review by the Tax Court of a determination by the Renegotiation Board \u201cshall be treated as a proceeding de novo\u201d the burden of proof is upon the respondent. A similar argument was raised before the Tax Court in Cohen v. Secretary of War, 1946, 7 T.C. 1002, and was rejected on the ground that the provision for a <em>de novo </em>proceeding had no relevance to a determination of where the burden of proof should lie before the Tax Court. The Congressional history of the Tax Court remedy is in full accord with the view that Congress intended the Tax Court to provide for rules governing the burden of proof. See H. Rep.No.871, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 77, and see H.Rep.No. 1079, 78th Cong., 2nd Sess. p. 83, with reference to the predecessor to Section 108, Section 403(e) of the Renegotiation Act of 1943. In the absence of any intimation that Rule 32 is arbitrary or capricious there is no basis for disturbing the Tax Court\u2019s allocation of the burden. The determination that the burden is upon the petitioner is not contrary to Congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">The unsoundness of appellant\u2019s position before us is evident. The sole issue of fact before the Tax Court was created by petitioner\u2019s allegation \u201cthat he was a full-time employee and hence not subject to the provisions of the Renegotiation Act of 1951\u201d; and at the hearing petitioner\u2019s counsel upon being queried by the court unequivocally stated it to be completely clear that the taxpayer had the burden of proof in this <em>de novo </em>proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
