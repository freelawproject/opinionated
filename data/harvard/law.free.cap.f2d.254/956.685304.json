If final disposition of the proceedings results unfavorably to the plaintiff, the plaintiff will still have a right to review the question either by an appeal from the final decision of the Patent Office to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, or by an action de novo in this court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-13\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
