Section 81.11 of Treasury Regulation 105 provides that \u201cIn no case may the election be exercised, or a previous election changed, after the expiration of the time for the filing of the return.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b994-20\">The administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. in this case seeks a refund of additional estate tax assessed by the Commissioner. The additional tax was the result of the original executor\u2019s apparent election manifested on the estate\u2019s return to have the assets valued one year from date of death. It is the administrator\u2019s argument here that the apparent election was not binding and irrevocable because it was made upon a mistake as to the consequences of that election.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-21\">The district court entered judgment for defendant, relying on Section 81.11 of Treasury Regulation 105 and analogous tax cases denying the right to change the election after date for filing has passed. D.C.E.D.Pa.1957, 156 F.Supp. 780. The election here was made upon a full disclosure of facts. It is therefore binding, and we can add nothing to the opinion of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-22\">\u2022 The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
