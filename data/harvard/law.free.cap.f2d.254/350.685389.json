While the object which caused the injury, the pipe, was known, the precise cause of the accident was unknown, and there were several plausible alternative possibilities, some of which were not within the exclusive control of the crane operator. The pipe, 20 feet long, which had been lying flat on the ground, was being raised at one end by means of an ordinary crane hook slipped over the top of the mouth of the pipe. Appellant himself had chosen this method and set the hook in place. True, it is possible and even plausible that the crane operator misapplied the controls. On the other hand, it is also plausible that the grounded end of the pipe slipped backward as the pipe was raised, or that when the end of the pipe rose, the hook simply slipped upward and off the pipe. It was appellant\u2019s burden \u201cto exclude the operation of such causes.\u201d Brown v. Capital Transit Co., 1942, 75 U.S.App.D.C. 337, 127 F.2d 329, 330, certiorari denied 317 U.S. 632, 63 S.Ct. 61, 87 L.Ed. 510. On the evidence-adduced, it would be sheer speculation to conclude that the cause of the accident was one within defendant\u2019s exclusive control; the record does not present a case within the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur..
