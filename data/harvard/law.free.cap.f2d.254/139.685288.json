The registrations are for the words \u201cYankee\u201d and \u201cClipper\u201d respectively, while the specimens submitted with the affidavits show a sailing vessel, surrounded by a circular border bearing two stars and the words \u201cYankee Clipper Blended Whisky.\u201d The affidavits were refused on the ground the specimens did not show trademark use of either \u201cYankee\u201d or \u201cClipper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-17\">This is the first case to come before us involving section 8 of the Lanham Act. That section provides that the Commissioner shall cancel any certificate of trademark registration on the principal register at the end of six years following its date unless there is filed, within one year next preceding such expiration, an affidavit \u201cshowing that said mark is still in use or showing that its nonuse is due to special circumstances which excuse such nonuse and is not due to any intention to abandon the mark.\u201d The section further provides that the Commissioner shall notify the registrant who files such an affidavit of his acceptance or refusal thereof and, if the latter, the reasons therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-18\">The Assistant Commissioner, pointing out that a specimen identical with those here had been filed and accepted as showing continuing use of appellant\u2019s trademark \u201cYankee Clipper,\u201d for which registration No. 531,054 had been granted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>held that such specimens did not show individual trademark use of \u201cYankee\u201d or \u201cClipper\u201d alone. We are in agreement with that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">It is evident that the words \u201cYankee\u201d and' \u201cClipper\u201d are not used separately as trademarks on the specimens, but convey the single unitary meaning of an American ship of the clipper type. The illustration of such a ship forms a prominent feature of the specimen and, as above notedi appellant has registered \u201cYankee Clipper\u201d \u00e1s a unitary trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The instant situation is clearly distinguishable from that in In re Standard' Underground Cable Co., 27 App.D.C. 320, relied on by appellant. There the mark sought to be registered was the word \u201cEclipse\u201d which had been used on a label in conjunction with the words \u201cBlack Core\u201d and certain background material illustrating an eclipse. It was held the applicant had the-right to select and designate what he considered the essential feature of the mark. It is to be noted that \u201cEclipse\u201d was a distinct and separable feature of the label. It did not modify another word and was not modified by other words, and it seems likely that'the merchandise to which it was applied would have been asked for by the name \u201cEclipse.\u201d The decision is not authority for the proposition that one of two or more words which combine to give a unitary meaning may be arbitrarily selected as a trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">On the- other hand, the situation is closely similar to that in Quaker City Flour Mills Co. v. Quaker Oats Co., 43 App.D.C. 260, in which an attempt was made to register \u201cQuaker\u201d as a trademark on the basis of use of the words \u201cQuaker City.\u201d In refusing registration the court pointed out that \u201cQuaker\u201d alone had a meaning distinct from that of \u201cQuaker City,\u201d and that the \u201cmark as claimed\u201d (Quaker) had not been used. That ease was expressly distinguished from the Standard Underground Cable case on that basis, the court pointing out that if the word \u201cQuaker\u201d had merely been associated with separable or illustrative matter, such as a scroll or a picture of a man in Quaker dress, it could presumably have been registered alone. So in the instant case, the words \u201cYankee Clipper\u201d as a unit may have been used as a trademark distinct from the words \u201cBlended Whisky\u201d or the picture of a ship; but neither \u201cYankee\u201d nor \u201cClipper\u201d has been so used separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">The cases of Graves v. Gunder, 1908 C.D. 201; Tip Top Bottling Co. v. Jones, 1927 C.D. 1; and In re Servel, Inc., 181 F.2d 192, 37 C.C.P.A., Patents, 977, also relied on by appellant, are similar to the Standard Underground Cable case in that they involve the selection of a trademark as a word or words which were distinct and separable from those with which they had been associated in use. Thus in the Servel case, for example, it was held that \u201cServel\u201d had been used as a trademark even though its only use had been as part of the term \u201cServel Inklings.\u201d In so holding, the court noted that \u201cSer-vel\u201d was \u201cappellant\u2019s primary and technical trademark\u201d and that \u201cthe word \u2018Inkling\u2019 is descriptive and in the public domain.\u201d The words, therefore, were clearly separable and the applicant had the right to eliminate the descriptive term \u201cInklings\u201d in designating its mark. That is not the case here, since neither \u201cYankee\u201d nor \u201cClipper\u201d is descriptive as applied to whisky and neither has more trademark significance than the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Appellant contends that it is well settled that a registration affords prima facie evidence of continuing use of the registered mark and that, therefore, the Commissioner cannot question its use of the marks involved. However, section 8 of the Lanham Act clearly requires the filing of an affidavit \u201cshowing that said mark is still in use,\u201d and imposes upon the Commissioner the duty of deciding whether such an affidavit is sufficient and of cancelling the registration if it is not. It is evident those express requirements cannot be superseded by any presumption that the mark is in use.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Appellant further contends that if its affidavits do not show trademark use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>its registered marks they should be accepted as excusing its nonuse. We are unable to see, however, how the fact that a word has been used as an essential part of a composite trademark excuses the failure to use it alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In our opinion, the specimens submitted by appellant disclose the use of \u201cYankee Clipper\u201d as an integral mark and do not show that either \u201cYankee\u201d or \u201cClipper\u201d alone has ever been used as a trademark. The Assistant Commissioner, therefore, properly refused to accept appellant\u2019s affidavits and ordered cancellation of the registrations involved in the instant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The decisions of the Assistant Commissioner are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">JACKSON, J., retired, recalled to participate was present at the hearing of this appeal but did not participate in the decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
