It is now too late to do so. He now appeals from denial of a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-24\">His present counsel, appointed by the District Court, contends that because trial counsel did not appeal, trial counsel did not give the defendant the \u201ceffective assistance\u201d to which he was entitled. The defendant says his trial counsel refused to appeal because the defendant could not pay him a fee. But such a refusal, in the circumstances of this case, is not a ground for vacating the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-25\">It has been said that \u201cfailure to appeal may not be excused upon a mere showing of neglect of counsel.\u201d Dennis v <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>United States, 4 Cir., 177 F.2d 195. Perhaps that statement is too broad. We need not now decide whether failure to appeal would be a denial of effective assistance, and would open a conviction to \u201ccollateral attack\u201d under \u00a7 2255, if there were plain reversible error in the trial. There was no such plain error in this trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
