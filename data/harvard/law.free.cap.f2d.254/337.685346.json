Appellant in his appeal alleges error in the District Court\u2019s order of consolidation, which apparently was entered without objection, on motion of the Government. The offenses involved the same series of acts alleged to have been committed practically simultaneously. We are satisfied that the order of consolidation was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-23\">Were we required to rule, we would reject appellant\u2019s claim that the District Judge abused his discretion in his denial of appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial,</p>\n<p id=\"AV2\">We have considered the other points ably urged by this court\u2019s appointed counsel and find no error affecting substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
