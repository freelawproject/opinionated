They argue that this trust for the benefit of children carried into effect only a provision of a separation agreement between him and his wife which, indeed, called for the trust, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>but without power of revocation. As District Judge Palmieri points out, however, in his well reasoned opinion, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 156 F.Supp. 99, it is both good sense and good law that these closely integrated and nearly contemporaneous documents be construed together, thus showing a retained power which makes the corpus taxable under I.R.C.1939, \u00a7 811(d)(2). We affirm on the opinion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
