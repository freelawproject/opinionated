S. Loch Gowan in the Los Angeles Harbor area. The vessel was owned by Royal Mail Lines, Ltd., one of Appellees herein (hereafter Royal).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The complaint, invoking the jurisdiction of the Court upon the ground of diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, was in two counts. The first count alleged that his injuries occurred by reason of the negligence of Royal in failing to provide plaintiff with a safe, proper and seaworthy place in which to work, and in negligently failing to maintain, control, operate and keep said vessel, its equipment, gear and appliances in a safe, proper and seaworthy condition. The second count alleged that plaintiff\u2019s injuries occurred by reason of the failure of Royal to provide him with a seaworthy vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Prior to trial Appellee Royal brought a third party action against Appellee Associated alleging that if the vessel was unseaworthy, such unseaworthiness was caused by Associated, and praying that in such event Royal recover full indemnity against Associated.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">By stipulation of the parties, the first cause of action was tried to a jury, and the second cause of action based upon unseaworthiness was tried to the Court on the evidence adduced at the trial of the first cause of action. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Royal upon the first cause of action, from which verdict and judgment plaintiff has taken no appeal. Upon the second cause of action, the Court made findings of fact and concluded that the vessel, her gear, appliances and equipment were seaworthy and reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were intended, and rendered a judgment for Royal on this issue and dismissed the third party complaint. Plaintiff appeals from this judgment alone, which appeal was timely taken. Jurisdiction to this Court rests upon Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2107.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The evidence discloses that the plaintiff was one of a gang of longshoremen who commenced work at No. 3 hatch upon the vessel in question about 7 P.M. and that he was injured about 9 P.M. when a wooden platform,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> called by seamen an \u201cO\u2019Brien\u201d, which was in the vicinity of a No. 3 starboard winch, fell and struck the plaintiff and caused certain claimed injuries to him. The Court found that before the accident fellow servants of the plaintiff employed by Associated had rigged the O\u2019Brien in an upended position, and that it was being employed as a windbreak. The O\u2019Brien was ' designed to protect the wooden deck surface of the vessel during loading and unloading operations, and was not designed to be used as a windbreak. The evidence shows that the O\u2019Brien was secured by a rope tied at one upper corner and running to the No. 3 hatch. While the hatch gang, including the Appellant, were engaged in putting the hatch covers on the-No. 3 hatch, the Court found that the O\u2019Brien fell upon plaintiff \u201cafter either plaintiff himself or a rope he was pulling which led to a portion of a hatch cover he was then helping to move, collided with either or both the O\u2019Brien itself and the rope securing it to the after starboard corner of the hatch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\"> The right of a seaman to recover damages from the owner of a ship by reason of the unseaworthiness of the ship has been extended to stevedores while doing work upon the ship. Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 1946, 328 U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099. The shipowner\u2019s implied warranty of seaworthiness is \u201cessentially a species of liability without fault, analogous to the other well known instances in our law.\u201d Id., 328 U.S. at page 94, 66 S.Ct. at page 877. The shipowner\u2019s liability for unseaworthiness is imposed by law regardless of whether or not the shipowner was negligent. Ibid.; Read v. United States, 3 Cir., 1953, 201 F.2d 758, 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">This warranty of seaworthiness, however, is not that the ship, or gear, or equipment is absolutely seaworthy and safe in all events, but only reasonably so, and then only when employed or used for some purpose for which it is intended. Nunes v. Farrell Lines, 1 Cir., 1955, 227 F.2d 619; Berti v. Compagnie De Navigation Cyprien Fabre, 2 Cir., 1954, 213-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>F.2d 397; The Tawmie, 5 Cir., 1936, 80 F.2d 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Appellant contends that the evidence clearly indicated that there was an un-seaworthy condition and that the findings of the Court below with respect to unseaworthiness are without support in the evidence, and for this reason the judgment of the Court below should be reversed. While the witnesses generally agreed upon the general <em>location of </em>the O\u2019Brien, there were differences in the testimony as to its exact location,\u2014 whether it was standing on its long end or on the wide side, just where it was with respect to the corner of the hatch, just exactly where the rope supporting it was tied, whether the plaintiff had seen the O\u2019Brien before the accident or not, whether it was the rope which supported the O\u2019Brien or the O\u2019Brien itself which was struck, whether the O\u2019Brien was parallel or cater-corner to the winch. Some seven photographs were introduced in evidence, five of them showing the location on the vessel where the accident occurred and two of them showing pictures of an O\u2019Brien which was similar to, if not the precise O\u2019Brien involved in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-16\">The learned judge who tried the case had the opportunity to see and hear all of the witnesses, to see the pictures introduced in evidence, and to listen to the explanation of the witnesses in reference to these pictures. At the conclusion of the case, the trial judge made findings as set out in the footnote.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *****8 Thereafter, the Court concluded as a matter of law from these findings that the vessel, her gear, appliances and equipment were seaworthy and reasonably fit for the purpose for which each was intended to be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-17\">The burden of proof of unseaworthiness rested upon the Appellant. Freitas v. Pacific-Atlantic Steamship Co., 9 Cir., 1955, 218 F.2d 562.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-18\">\u201cOrdinarily, where there is a dispute as to fact which must be resolved from the conflicting testimony of witnesses, the findings, of the trial judge who had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the testifying witnesses and thus to judge their credibility, are conclusive upon appeal unless clearly erroneous.\u201d Overman v. Loesser, 9 Cir., 1953, 205 F.2d 521, 522.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ails\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>As indicated above, the trial Court found no unseaworthiness of the O\u2019Brien or of the deck of the ship in the vicinity of the accident. This Court cannot say that the findings of fact of the lower Court were clearly erroneous or that they were erroneous at all.
