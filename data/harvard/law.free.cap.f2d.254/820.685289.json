The only claim is waiver, because defendant first sought a dismissal for failure to state a claim and two days later moved for leave to amend his motion by adding the venue objection. When the court came to hear the motion nearly a month later, it granted the leave to amend and then dismissed because of the lack of venue. This was quite proper. The waiver provided in Fed.Rules Civ.Proc., rule 12(h), applies only where a waivable defense is not presented <em>either </em>by motion or by answer; it does not in any way prevent a judge in his discretion from permitting a party to expand the grounds of motion well in advance of a hearing. Plaintiff\u2019s application here to strike portions of defendant\u2019s brief is denied as wholly frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
