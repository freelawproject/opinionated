Specht, seeks review of an order of the Civil Aeronautics Board which revoked his airline transport pilot rating. The effect of the Board\u2019s order was to require petitioner to cease flying as pilot in command. He is permitted to act as co-pilot and was issued such license. In the proceedings before the Civil Aeronautics Board, the Board found that the petitioner violated certain Civil Air Regulations. The original complaint charges that on January 29, 1957, Captain Specht, who was pilot in command of TWA Flight 19 Constellation operating between New York, N. Y., and St. Louis, Mo., while proceeding under instrument flight rules, failed to adhere to his air traffic control clearance to maintain 14,000 feet and climbed to 18,000 feet; that Captain Specht had been instructed by the air traffic control to maintain 14,000 feet on account of traffic at 16,000 feet; that the 16,000-foot level was occupied by Capital Airlines Flight 31 proceeding in the same direction; that Captain Specht climbed through the 16,000-foot level without clearance and despite advice that 16,000 feet was occupied. The complaint alleges that by his actions Captain Specht violated the following Civil Air Regulations: (a) \u00a7 60.19,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in that he operated an aircraft contrary to air traffic control instructions in \u00e1reas where air traffic control was being exercised; (b) \u00a7 60.21,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in that he deviated from the provisions of an air traffic control clearance; (c) \u00a7 60.-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>12,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in that he operated an aircraft in a careless manner so as to endanger the lives and property of others. The complaint charges that Captain Specht \u201c * * -x- pis actions as heretofore alleged, demonstrated a lack of the degree of responsibility, care and judgment required of the holder of an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Captain Specht\u2019s answer was to the effect that the actions complained of \u201c * * * were necessary and proper, and were taken only after the declaration of an emergency in accordance with his right and duty under Civil Air Regulations Part 40, Section 40.360 entitled \u2018Emergency Declarations; Pilot-in-Command and Air Traffic Dispatcher\u2019, which said declaration of emergency by Respondent was acknowledged by Air Traffic Control.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *\u2019 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For an affirmative defense, Captain Specht alleged that he encountered an icing condition which in his best judgment imperiled his aircraft and the passengers and crew thereof and that m accordance with his right and duty he declared an emergency, left his assigned altitude of 14,000 feet and climbed to 18,-000 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">In a hearing before an Examiner, petitioner was found to have violated the three Civil Air Regulations referred to\u00bb and his airline transport rating was ordered suspended for a period of six months.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Administrator, seeking, revocation rather than suspension, filed! notice of appeal from the ruling of the Examiner because of the Examiner\u2019s failure to find lack of qualification to hold an airline transport pilot rating. Petitioner likewise appealed and the matter came on for hearing before the Civil Aeronautics Board. The Board reviewed the entire case, adopted the findings and conclusions of the Examiner except as modified and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-15\">\u201cUpon consideration of the entire record and in view of all the forego<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>ing we find respondent violated Sections 60.19, 60.21, and 60.12 of the Civil Air Regulations in the respects hereinabove set forth, that respondent lacks the qualifications required of the holder of an airline transport pilot certificate in the respects indicated above, and that such lack of qualifications constitutes cause which would presently justify the Administrator in refusing to issue to respondent a like certificate, and that the order of revocation set forth below is required in the interest of the public in the proper discharge of the Board\u2019s statutory duty to assure the highest degree of safety in air transportation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aaf-dedup-0\">Whereupon, petitioner\u2019s pilot rating was revoked. The findings of the Board were unanimous. ^ Three of the members, constituting a majority, held that the Examiner\u2019s order of suspension should be cancelled and Captain Specht\u2019s airline transport rating revoked and so ordered; whereas, two concurring and dissenting members of the Board believed that suspension of Captain Specht\u2019s airline transport- pilot rating for a reasonable time would constitute an appropriate remedial and corrective action.</p>\n<p id=\"aux-dedup-0\">The record indicates that on the flight in question the TWA Constellation captained by the petitioner took off from La-Guardia Airport, New York, at 9:55 a. m. on January 29, 1957, for St. Louis, Missouri, under instrument flight rules, Pour minutes later, also under instrument flight rules, a Capital Viscount, a faster plane, left LaGuardia for Chicago, The two craft were to fly the same airway as far as Erie, Pennsylvania. Both had requested a flying altitude of 16,000 feet but were initially directed to fly at lower altitudes. TWA at 14,000 and Capital at 12,000 feet. Shortly after leaving LaGuardia Capital was authorized to fly at 16,000 feet and went to that altitude, Shortly thereafter\u2019, at 10:25 a. m. petitioner called TWA radio and asked the company to find out \u201cwhy Capital F31 ouf after us and off after us was assigned our preferred altitude\u201d. At 10.27% a. m. petitioner asked the control tower for an aititude of 18,000 feet. He was advised fkaf there was traffic above him and was asked if he could fly under visual flight rules, to which he gave a negative re-gponse. A transcript of the recorded conversations thereafter among the petitioner, as captain of TWA-19, the control tower and the captain of Capital-31, and which is not questioned, follows;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-21\">\u201c1027\u00bd NY ARTCC: Roger 19, unable <em>to </em>approve 18,000 over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-22\">1027\u00bd TWA-19 : We\u2019re going to leave 14,000 in about 3 minutes you get Mm out of the way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-23\">1027\u00be NY ARTCC: TWA-19 will you say again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-24\">1027\u00be TWA-19 : I said we\u2019re going to vacate 14,000 to go up in about 3 minutes.

From the transcript, Captain Specht in fact assumed to take over the duty of directing the conduct of planes within the jurisdiction of the control tower operator, and not only gave directions but made angry demands. Captain Murphy, Capital\u2019s pilot, asked Captain Specht why TWA came right up through his altitude. Specht replied, \u201cTWA did it, because airways refused to vacate you out of it and advise you.\u201d In response to Captain Murphy\u2019s further question as to what the emergency was, Captain Specht replied, \u201cI gave him 8 minutes and he refused flatly to do it.\u201d In response to the watch supervisor\u2019s request for information as to the state of the emergency, Captain Specht replied, \u201cHe has it.\u201d It should be noted also that there is no mention in the record of icing until 10:48, at which time Captain Specht, in response to his company\u2019s request regarding the reasons for the emergency, transmitted via company radio the following message:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azz-dedup-0\">\u201cAccount ice Remiested from ATC change in altitude, 18,000, be-jng unavailable traffic at 16,000, unable to climb VFR after repeated requests with no change granted, airways fla\u00fcy refuged to moye Capital out of 16j00a 19 declared emergency vacated 14)000 at 1033 went through 16,000, 1034 on a heading perpendicular to and to left side of course. Reported all procedures to ATC \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"adq-dedup-0\">Captain Specht\u2019s flight log does show an entry, \u201cRequested altitude change 1025E account icing at 140\u201d. It is significant, however, that that entry is by interlineation only, from which the finders of the fact could conclude that the notation about the \u201cicing\u201d was an afterthought and inserted subsequent to the entry regarding the declaration of an emergency. Captain Specht, in his testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>ny, stated that he was quite sure that somewhere at the very,start of the conversation between the tower and himself he talked about ice.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">In testifying at the hearing, he stated he \u201cconsidered it <em>a </em>severe icing condition,\u201d and:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-5\">\u201cAt 10:32y2 our icing condition had become such that I. felt that I must do something and do it fast.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-6\">\u201cAt the time I declared the emergency, it appeared to me, through the previous radio contacts, that there was going to be no relief and that it was entirely up to me to take care of the situation. I begged and pleaded to get out of there, that is, asking for altitude, trying to. get out of 14,-000 feet. I made no headway whatsoever. I stated that I was going to declare an emergency. There was nothing done about that. The final answer, when it came, was just, maintain 14,000 feet. There -was nothing left for me to do, either sit there at 14,000 feet and let the airplane become uncontrollable or get it out of there. There was no other recourse. There was nothing to be ' gained by waiting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">The quoted portions of Captain Specht\u2019s testimony at the hearing find no corroboration in his declarations made at the time of the transaction here involved. That, record not only fails to corroborate, but in fact destroys, his oral testimony with reference to his declaration of an emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">In a report, Exhibit J, made the day following the incident herein, Captain Specht reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-9\">\u201c * * * j began to pick up ice quite rapidly at. 14,000'; * * *. At 10:25 I requested a higher altitude and advised that I would have to vacate 14,000' within 3 minutes. * *. * <em>I advised that </em>14,000' <em>was untenable account ice accumulation </em>and that I wanted-to know why Capital No. 31 off after me assigned 16,-000' could not be moved so I could vacate 14,000' and again advised ATC that I could not stay at 140 and intended leaving it.\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">We have examined the entire record but find no good purpose would be served in a detailed statement of all of the evidence here. As to whether or not there was a severe icing condition at 14,000 feet there is conflict. In general, the testimony of the co-pilot corroborates the testimony of Captain Specht. From other, testimony, a contrary conclusion could be drawn. Additionally, the rate at which the aircraft climbed from 14,000 feet to 18,000 feet would indicate that it was not burdened with ice.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">Petitioner\u2019s first contention is that there is no substantial evidence that he violated 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.19 and 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.21, supra. There is no question but what Captain Specht operated his aircraft \u201c * * * contrary to air traffic control instructions in- areas where air traffic control is exercised,\u201d 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.19, and that he did deviate from the provisions of an air traffic clearance without obtaining an amended clearance, a violation of 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.21. Petitioner admits that he did vacate 14,000 feet and that he went to 18,000 feet but contends that this deviation resulted from a declared emergency and was for the safety of his passengers and his aircraft, as authorized and provided by 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 40.-360 and 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.2, supra. If an emergency actually existed which justified Captain Specht\u2019s departure from his assigned altitude and he followed proper procedures in doing so, then there was no violation of the two sections referred to. The Board, however, had the right under the circumstances present here to consider all of the evidence and to determine whether an emergency had been established. The Examiner, in findings adopted by the Board, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-14\">\u201c * * * the preponderance of the evidence sustains a finding that the Respondent was not in an emergency situation, nor in a situation which reasonably would lead him to believe that, unless he took immediate action, the. safety .of his aircraft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>would be endangered. The evidence sustains a finding also that the Respondent exercised his emergency-authority irresponsibly and declared an emergency in order to obtain a preferred altitude. Under the circumstances, the defense of the Respondent based upon the provisions of Sections 60.2 and 40.360 of the regulations must fail and the deviations from the regulations found to be in violation of Sections 60.19 and 60.21 of the regulations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">The Board concurred and found that the emergency did not exist and that Captain Specht \u201cwas truculent and in an angry mood\u201d over not' receiving an altitude to which he regarded himself as entitled and that he improperly declared the emergency. If Captain Specht and the co-pilot who supported him are to be believed as against the findings of the Board, the declared emergency was justified and accordingly \u00a7\u00a7 60.19 and 60.21 were not in fact violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 646(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-6\">\u201cThe findings of facts by the Board, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-7\"> If there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s findings, this court must affirm, regardless of what its views might have been had it had the power of fact determination. As this court said in Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 8 Cir., 1940, 113 F.2d 698, 701, affirmed 313 U.S. 146, 61 S.Ct. 908, 85 L.Ed. 1251:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"avk-dedup-0\">\u201cIt must be remembered that, within the limits of the jurisdiction conferred upon it, the power of a court or an administrative board to decide questions is not confined to deciding them correctly. Thompson v. Terminal Shares, 8 Cir., 89 F.2d 652, 655. A jury may decide incorrectly issues of fact, but if its verdict is within the evidence its mistakes of fact cannot be corrected on review. Elzig v. Gudwangen, 8 Cir., 91 F.2d 434, <em>444. </em>And the determination by a legislative body of a debatable question which it has power to decide is not subject to judicial reexamination. United States v. Car-olene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 154, 58 S.Ct. 778, 82 L.Ed. 1234.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">The weight and credibility of the testimony is for the Board\u2019s determination. In National Labor Relations Board v. Link-Belt Co., 1941, 311 U.S. 584, 597, 61 S.Ct. 358, 365, 85 L.Ed. 368, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-11\">\u201cAs we stated in National Labor Relations Board v.

Not by accident, but in line with a general policy, Congress has deemed it wise to entrust the finding of facts to these specialized agencies. It is essential that courts regard this division of responsibility which Congress as a matter of policy has embodied in the very statute from which the Court of Appeals derived its jurisdiction to act.\u2019 Congress entrusted the Board, not the Courts, with the power to draw inferences from the facts. National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, 303 U.S. 261, 271, 58 S.Ct. 571, 576, 82 L.Ed. 831; National Labor Relations Board v. Falk Corp., 308 U.S. 453, 461, 60 S.Ct. 307, 311, 84 L.Ed. 396. The Board, like other expert agencies dealing with specialized fields (see Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, 307 U.S. 125, 146, 59 S.Ct. 754, 764, 83 L.Ed. 1147; Swayne &amp; Hoyt v. United States, 300 U.S. 297, 304, 57 S.Ct. 478, 481, 81 L.Ed. 659) has the function of appraising conflicting and circumstantial evidence, and the weight and credibility of testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-15\">The rule thus stated is applicable to the findings of the Civil Aeronautics Board. See Cameron v. Civil Aeronautics Board, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>7 Cir., 1944, 140 F.2d 482, 483, certiorari denied 323 U.S. 716, 65 S.Ct. 43, 89 L.Ed. 576; Kuhn v.

In finding that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIR\">\u201c * * * in performing his emergency maneuvers, respondent not only failed to exercise the highest degree of care as expected of an airline transport pilot but did not use even ordinary care and was thereby \u2018careless\u2019 within the meaning of Section 60.12 of the Civil Air Regulations; * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFQ\">the Board stated in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aaf-dedup-1\">\u201cThus, in obvious anger over not receiving an altitude to which he regarded himself as entitled, respondent deliberately and unjustifiably climbed his aircraft through space known by him to be occupied by another airliner, and, as the Examiner found, without exercising even ordinary care in the conduct of such a dangerous maneuver.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a5e-dedup-0\">The Examiner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArA\">\u201cRegardless of the motives which prompted him to leave his assigned altitude, he not only did not exercise \u2018the highest degree of care\u2019, but evinced a lack of even ordinary care jn executing his emergency maneuvers. He left his altitude without informing either air traffic control or Captain Murphy (pilot in charge of Capital-31) of his intentions. He left his altitude without taking precautionary measures which were known and available to him. He left his altitude without finding out the weather and visibility conditions at the altitude to which he was going. He left his altitude without adequate exploration of the feasibility of alternative courses of action. He left his altitude and climbed through the altitude of another passenger-carrying aircraft and consciously accepted a \u2018calculated risk\u2019 based upon a number of assumptions which were in themselves unreasonable and when jn ^he exercise of ordinary care and judgment, he could have obviated or minimized the risk involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"atw-dedup-0\">The Examiner further found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ary-dedup-0\">\u201cEven though Captain Specht\u2019s emergency declaration had been found reasonable and the violations of the regulations thereby excused, the record would still support the finding that in exercising his emergency procedures he had failed to exercise the degree of responsibility, care and judgment required of an airline transport pilot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An0\">We think it clear from what has already been Pointed out that substantial testimony in the record supports the finding of the Examiner and the Board that petitioner violated 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.12.</p>\n<p id=\"ARtz\">Petitioner\u2019s third contention is that the Board erroneously placed the burden of proof on him to show that there was in fact an emergency situation on the oceasion in question and that the burden of proof should have been upon the Admin-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>isUator to establish the contrary. The complaint herein charged the petitioner with a violation of three of the Civil Air Regulations, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\">In his answer, petitioner did not deny the occurrence of the acts complained of. He sought to avoid their consequences by affirmatively pleading that those acts, which would ordinarily constitute violations of safety regulations, were justified under a declared state of emergency existing at that time. Such form of pleading was not only proper but necessary under the Rules of Practice in Air Safety Proceedings. 14 C.F.R., Part 301, \u00a7\u00a7 301.7, 301.37, Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. rule 8(c), 28 U.S.C.A. Cohen v. United States, 8 Cir., 1942, 129 F.2d 733; Schmidtke v. Conesa, 1 Cir., 1944, 141 F.2d 634; Syracuse Broadcasting Corp. v. Newhouse, D.C.N.Y.1953, 14 F.R.D. 168, 170. Having pleaded an exception as an affirmative defense to the alleged violations, petitioner assumed the burden of proving the existence of an emergency within the meaning of the exception. Walling v. General Industries Co., 1947, 330 U.S. 545, 547-548, 67 S.Ct. 883, 91 L.Ed. 1088; United States v. Poland, 1920, 251 U.S. 221, 227-228, 40 S.Ct. 127, 64 L.Ed. 236; Mid-Continent Petroleum Corporation v. Keen, 8 Cir., 1946, 157 F.2d 310, 315. See Tendler v. Jaffe, 1953, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 2, 203 F.2d 14, 17, certiorari denied 346 U.S. 817, 74 S.Ct. 29, 98 L.Ed. 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">In addition thereto, the facts and circumstances of the claimed emergency were peculiarly within the knowledge of the pilot. It was not error to rest the burden of going forward with the proof of the emergency on the pilot who claimed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">Petitioner\u2019s Points 4 and 5 are interdependent and will be treated together. These points are based upon the following argument: That petitioner has satisfied all the technical requirements for an airline transport pilot rating (14 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 21.10-21.18); that there is no substantial evidence upon which a contrary finding in this regard could be made; and that petitioner is, therefore, qualified to hold that rating and certificate. Petitioner points out, then, that any revocation of an airline transport pilot certificate by the Board under 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 559 must be based upon a finding that the pilot in question could properly be refused issuance of such certificate, i. e., that such pilot was not qualified, from, which he then argues that the revocation of the certificate here of a qualified pilot is penal in nature and not within the Board\u2019s remedial powers under 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">Admittedly, petitioner possesses the technical skills required of the holder of an airline transport pilot rating, the Board having stated in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-10\">\u201cWe do not doubt respondent\u2019s technical ability to pilot an airplane, and believe that we can, consistently with our over-all duties and responsibilities, permit respondent to hold a commercial pilot certificate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">But the Board had found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-12\">\u201cThe chain of events leading up to respondent\u2019s action was such as to have insured the bringing into play of whatever degree of responsibility, care, and judgment respondent could muster. His preference for a higher assigned altitude than 14,000 feet existed prior to take-off. He encountered repeated denials of his repeated requests for a higher altitude, and the aggravation which this continuing frustration generated in him became evident long before his action. During the same time, he was continuously aware of the general proximity of the unseen Viscount flying the same course above him, and the specific notion of climbing through its altitude had entered his mind at least a full five minutes before he did so. Thus all the elements which would have evoked the qualities required to exercise command responsibility were full-blown well before respondent acted. He was not caught unaware by a sudden unanticipated situation, and these qualities had every opportunity and rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>son to assert themselves. The only conclusion is that such responsibility, care and judgment as respondent possessed proved insufficient under the pressure of his anger, and that his failure to exercise them in the required degree was due to deficiencies in these respects. The record is devoid of any other explanation of what' occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-4\">\u201cThus, in obvious anger over not receiving an altitude to which he regarded himself as entitled, respondent deliberately and unjustifiably climbed his aircraft through space known by him to be occupied by another airliner, and, as the Examiner found, without exercising even ordinary care in the conduct of such a dangerous maneuver. Respondent needlessly jeopardized the lives of approximately 40 persons aboard his plane, as well as of the .occupants of the other aircraft. That this conduct demonstrates a lack of judgment and care is plain, and it was irresponsible to the extreme. The pilot who can control his plane but cannot control himself is not a safe pilot. The Civil Aeronautics Act specifically enjoins the Board, in the furtherance of its air safety responsibilities, to act in such manner as \u25a0 to \u2018assure the highest degree of safety in air transportation.\u2019 (Section 2 (b) of the Act. See also Sections 2 (e) and 601(b) of the Act [49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 402(b,e), 551(b)].) The Board, in conformance with the Congressional mandate, has demanded that pilots who sit at the controls of p\u00e1ssenger-carrying airliners exercise \u2018th\u00e9 highest degree of care,\u2019 (Stead Airman Certificate, 1 C.A.A. 74, 84-5 (1939).) and we have consistently taken the view that this standard assumes a high degree of responsibility, care and judgment by the pilot. (Stead et al., 1 C.A.A. 74 (1939); Rentzel v. Sisto, 13 C.A.B. 125 (1948); Horne v. Bessey, 13 C.A.B. 550 (1952).) Respondent\u2019s conduct demonstrates that he does not measure up to this standard, and does not possess the attributes required of a pilot-in-command. . (Since the record contains no substantial evidence from which requalification can be inferred, the deficiency as of the time of the episode imports the finding of present deficiency.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">We agree with the Board that technical proficiency is not the only requirement upon which the issuance or retention of an airline transport pilot rating is conditioned. A successful applicant for or holder of such certificate should possess a demonstrated degree of judgment, unaffected by his temperament or disposition, which will enable him to consistently perform his technical skills in a manner conducive to the safety of his passengers, aircraft and crew. Implicit in the issuance of an airline transport pilot rating and certificate is 'the Administrator\u2019s finding that the holder thereof possesses the' degree of judg.ment required of a pilot in command. .Normally, an applicant\u2019s record in training and aeronautical experience in addition to his manner of executing the qualifying exercises required by 14 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 21.10-21.18 will provide a sound basis for finding of. sufficient judgment. However, the failure to exercise due care and the unjustified violations of safety regulations, whether in anger or truculence or not, by an otherwise qualified applicant ..should certainly form a substantial evi-dentiary basis for a finding that the applicant was not qualified to hold such certificate. Such a finding as to an applicant '\u25a0would, of course, have justified the Administrator of Civil Aeronautics in refusing to issue a certificate.-</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">We hold the Board acted well within its statutory authority in revoking petition-'\u00e9r\u2019s license upon its finding based on substantial evidence \u201c * * * that respondent lacks the qualifications required of the holder of an airline transport pilot certificate in the respects indicated above, \u201cand that such lack of qualifications constitutes cause which would presently jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>tify the Administrator in refusing to issue to respondent a like certificate, and that the order of revocation set forth below is required in the interest of the public in the proper discharge of the Board\u2019s statutory duty to assure the highest degree of safety in air transportation.\u201d Cf. Sisto v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 1949, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 31, 179 F.2d 47; Walker v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 2 Cir., 1958, 251 F.2d 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">Since the Board had statutory authority to revoke petitioner\u2019s certificate under 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 559, the primary effect of that revocation is remedial, in that a pilot not qualified to command an airline transport aircraft has been denied the authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Lastly, it is asserted that the Administrator, having asked for suspension or revocation in his original complaint, is not a proper party to appeal the order of the C.A.B.\u2019s Examiner, which granted the relief prayed for by suspending petitioner\u2019s airline transport pilot certificate for a period of six months. In support of his contention, petitioner cites Lee v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 1955, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 299, 225 F.2d 950. That case construes 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 646(a), which authorizes a review of any order of the Board by the Courts of Appeals of the United States, \u201c * * * upon petition, * * * by any person disclosing a substantial interest in such order.\u201d The Lee case merely holds that the Administrator is not \u201cany person disclosing a substantial interest\u201d in the Board\u2019s order and accordingly lacks standing to petition for review by a Court of Appeals. That is not our situation here. The Rules of Practice in Air Safety Proceedings, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.0, et seq., provide that the Administrator may initiate a proceeding for suspension or revocation. The Administrator is a \u201cparty\u201d to such proceedings. A hearing on the proceedings is to be held before an Examiner assigned by the Board. The Examiner has the power to make initial decisions which become final if there is no appeal to the Board from \u201ceither party\u201d. We think it perfectly clear from the regulations that the Administrator, being a \u201cparty\u201d to the proceedings before the Examiner, had the right to appeal to the Board. Additionally, the petitioner\u2019s own appeal from the Examiner\u2019s order placed the entire matter before the Board for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b960-10\">. \u201c\u00a7 60.19 <em>Air traffic control instructions. </em>No person shall operate an aircraft contrary to air traffic control instructions in areas where air traffic control is exercised.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b960-12\">. \u201c\u00a7 60.21 <em>Adherence to air traffic clearances. </em>When an air traffic clearance has been obtained under either the VFR or IFR rules, the pilot in command of the aircraft shall not deviate from the provisions thereof unless an amended clearance is obtained.
