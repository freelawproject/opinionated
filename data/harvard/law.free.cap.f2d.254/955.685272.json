D.C.Code (1951) \u00a7 47-801a(k). Section 47-801a(r) (1) exempts from taxation \u201cGrounds belonging to and reasonably required and actually used for the carrying on of the activities and purposes\u201d of these organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-12\">The Brookings Institution owns the house in which its President lives. He is expected to use the house for the Institution\u2019s purposes. He does some official work there, although his office is not there. He pays no rent. We think the District of Columbia Tax Court was right in ruling that the house and its yard are not subject to tax. Many cases, including e. g. Wheaton College v. Town of Norton, 232 Mass. 141, 122 N.E. 280, give support to this view. Cf. District of Columbia v. George Washington University, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 214, 221 F.2d 87; District of Columbia v. Church of the Pilgrims, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 68, 247 F.2d 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
