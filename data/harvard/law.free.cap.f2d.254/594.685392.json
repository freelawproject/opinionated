The trial was had to a jury which returned a verdict of guilty as charged. There was substantial evidence to sustain the verdict and we find no prejudicial error in the proceedings therein. While the appellant contends that the sentence of both fine and imprisonment was unusually harsh by comparison with other cases of sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>ilar nature, it was within the limits fixed by the Act and we have no power to modify it. Wherefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\"><em>The case is </em>affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
