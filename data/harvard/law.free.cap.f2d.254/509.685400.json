Sections 5174(a), 5606, 5216 and 5008(b), Title 26 U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-23\">Appellant\u2019s chief contention on this, appeal is that the Government\u2019s evidence was insufficient to identify him as the person engaged in such illegal operations. Although some of the evidence was circumstantial and not conclusive, we are of the opinion that the evidence-in its entirety was sufficient to take the ease to the jury on this issue and to sustain the verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-24\">We find no prejudicial error in the rulings of the District Judge complained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>of by appellant and no merit in appellant\u2019s further contention that the remarks o-f the District Judge to appellant\u2019s counsel in making certain rulings and in his instructions to the jury were unwarranted and prejudicial to the rights of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">It is ordered that the judgment be and is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
