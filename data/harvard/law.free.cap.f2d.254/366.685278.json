The -court entered the order granting appel-lees\u2019 motions upon its finding that, prior to the issuance of the subpoenas duces tecum under which the records were required to be produced before the Grand Jury, appellees had submitted to the Government for examination their books, records and files upon their understanding that they would not be used in connection with any criminal investigation or prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">The.trial court heard the testimony of three witnesses, Bruce Meador, a representative of the four corporations, T. J. McMahon, their attorney, and Ural E. Horton, Jr., Special Agent of the Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice. The testimony was in sharp conflict. Meador and McMahon testified that, when the government agent requested the right to examine the books, records and files of the four newspapers, he was informed that these records would be submitted to him on condition that they be not used in connection with any criminal investigation or prosecution, and he was requested to note this condition in his report to the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">Horton testified that no such condition was expressed or discussed, that he advised Meador and McMahon that they had a right to refuse to produce the records if they desired, and advised them further that the records could be used against them by the Government, stating further that he did not know the purpose of the investigation then in progress. He testified that he had no authority to promise any person that he would be \u201cfree from any prosecution\u201d concerning any statements made or records furnished. He introduced a long letter addressed to him by Meador which listed the documents furnished and gave certain requested information. This letter, which accompanied Meador\u2019s delivery of the corporate records to Horton, made no mention of the condition testified by Meador and McMahon as having been imposed upon <em>the </em>surrender of the records to the Government. The letter also offered to furnish further information if requested to do so. The court resolved the conflicts between the witnesses in favor of appellees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>We are not able to say that these findings of fact are clearly erroneous and we accept them as the predicate upon which our decision will rest. We recognize, however, as do the appellees, that there was no express agreement between the Government and appellees, and that the \u201cunderstanding\u201d grew out of the conditional furnishing of the records and was an understanding held by appellees alone, it being \u201cquite immaterial,\u201d in the court\u2019s mind, whether \u201cit was agreed to by the Government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The motions set forth the condition upon which the corporate records had been turned over to the Government,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and prayed solely that \u201cthe subpoenas be suppressed and * * * said condition fully respected.\u201d The motions did not allege that any of appellees\u2019 constitutional rights had been violated, but the court, in its memorandum opinion, held that \u201cconstitutional provisions\u201d would be violated if use of the records before the Grand Jury should be permitted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The order of the court did not quash or suppress the subpoenas, but commanded only that the restriction placed upon the use of the records by appellees be respected.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">What we have before us, therefore, is an order entered by the District Court at the beginning of a Grand Jury investigation which prohibited in advance the use before the Grand Jury of the information obtained by the government agent from appellees\u2019 records. In our opinion the order was without legal justification. Its language showed clearly that the denial of use of the records, and information before the Grand Jury was predicated solely upon its declaration that the restrictions and conditions should be respected and enforced. These restrictions were unilateral only. Appellees knew that Horton was not advised of the purpose of the investigation and that, as a mere field agent, he had no authority to agree to any restrictions. The most appellees contend is that they requested that he advise the Government of the restrictions when he made his report.2 **<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Appellees did not follow up their request or withhold the records until they learned whether it would be respected \u2014 even if it be assumed that some agent of the Government had the authority to enter into such an agreement. Cf. United States v. Ford (Whiskey Cases), 1878, 99 U.S. 594, 25 L.Ed. 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Appellees pitch their argument entirely upon the contention, not raised in their motions, that the evidence ought to be withheld from the Grand Jury on the ground that it was illegally obtained in violation of appellees\u2019 rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The Fifth Amendment, of course, does not apply to corporations,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and it is perfectly clear that the records were not obtained by any illegal search or seizure in contravention of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Horton entered the premises of appellees with the consent of Meador after having \u2019phoned for an engagement. Even under appellees\u2019 evidence, he made no threats or misrepresentations, employed no stratagems, practiced no concealment, coercion or fraud. He did not seize any records at all. They were delivered to him voluntarily by Meador two weeks after the request was made. Appellees and their attorney knew all the while that they had no assurance from the Government that any condition which might have been imposed would be honored. We find nothing in appellees\u2019 argument or in their authorities to justify the ruling of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">It is established law that suppression of evidence prior to an indictment should be considered only when there is a clear and definite showing that constitutional rights have been violated. Cf. United States v. Wallace &amp; Tiernan Co., supra, 336 U.S. 793, 796, 69 S.Ct. 824. And under our holding in Eastus v. Bradshaw, 1938, 94 F.2d 788, the validity of his entire proceeding is subject to serious doubt. In White v. United States, 1952, 194 F.2d 215, 217, certiorari denied 343 U.S. 930, 72 S.Ct. 760, 96 L.Ed. 1340, we held that one proceeding, as are appellees here, under Rule 41(e), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A., could not hold the Internal Revenue Bureau, as a matter of contract, to its declared policy of granting immunity to persons making voluntary disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">The office of the Grand Jury under our system is an important one, and its ability to function should not be limited by questions of propriety, Blair v. United States, 1919, 250 U.S. 273, 282, 39 S.Ct. 468, 63 L.Ed. 979, it being vital that it possess the power to conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>broad investigations<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> fettered only by the requirement that constitutional rights be not infringed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The order of the District Court granting the motions is reversed and the cause is remanded for the entry of an order denying them.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-16\">. \u201cAfter having heard the testimony, however, and using the Chancellor\u2019s power to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses who have testified, I am of the opinion and find that the Defendants, who and which were being exposed for the divul-gence of testimony which could be used before the Grand Jury in a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>investigation; that such admonition and pledge was exacted by the attorney for these respective publications, and that that understanding, whether it was agreed to by the Government or not is quite immaterial, was to the effect that such information, as, is and was furnished, should not be used in any criminal investigation or by the Grand Jury for such purpose. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"axn-dedup-0\">\u201c * * * This is a country of great liberty, gentlemen, and we must all stand for it. This information must not be used before the Grand Jury for criminal investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The court found further that the records covered by the subpoenas were to be used in connection with a projected criminal prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b422-8\">. \u201cThe request was made of one of the attorneys for one or more of the above named parties. Said attorney agreed to submit such letters, papers and records for examination by said representative upon the condition that none of them would be used in any manner in the prosecution of any action against any person or company or corporation named or referred to therein. Said papers were submitted to said representative of the Government upon the terms above stated. * * * The use of any of said papers in any attempted prosecution would be in violation of the conditions; and the Court should suppress-the subpoenas and order that the above-stated condition should be respected.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b422-15\">. \u201cIt seems quite unnecessary to cite authorities, because one of the fundamentals of a free government denies the right of the servants of the people to secure evidence, or testimony, in the manner indicated for use against the citizen. It would violate not only constitutional provisions, but the very thought of liberty and freedom itself.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b422-16\">. \u201cIt is, therefore, the order and judgment of the Court, <em>that said restrictions and conditions he respected and enforced, </em>and that any information obtained by the-Government Agents through the examination of said books, records, files and correspondence shall not be used before the-Grand Jury in any criminal investigation.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b422-17\">. Here is the way appellees deal with-this question in their brief: \u201cAppellees\u2019' attorney told Mr. Horton * * * that he \u2018wanted to know whether or not the-information that he was seeking was to be-used by him in furtherance of any crim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>inal prosecution.\u2019 The agent stated that ho did not know. Appellees\u2019 attorney then stated that he wanted the examination \u2018to be definitely on condition that what he learned or what he copied or the information that he got from our files, * * * were not to be used by him in furtherance of any criminal prosecution.\u2019 The agent said that lie did not know whether it * * * \u2018would be used in that manner or not;\u2019 and appellees\u2019 attorney then stated that he was sure the agent would file a report, and that he \u2018would appreciate it very much if you would incorporate in the report the substance of this conversation and the condition that I have attached to your going into these files.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">. Genecov v. Federal Petroleum Board, 5 Cir., 1944, 140 F.2d 596, 597, certiorari denied 324 U.S. 865, 65 S.Ct. 913, 89 L.Ed. 1420; United States v. Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co., 321 U.S. 707, 726, 64 S.Ct. 805, 88 L.Ed. 1024.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b423-15\">. Appellees cite in support of their Fourth Amendment contentions United States v. Wallace &amp; Tiernan Co., 1949, 336 U.S. 793, 69 S.Ct. 824, 93 L.Ed. 1042; Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 1920, 251 U.S. 385, 40 S.Ct. 182, 64 L.Ed. 319; Weeks v. United States, 1914, 232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652; McDonald v.

United States, 1951, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 64, 190 F.2d 649. Every one of the cases involved an actual forcible search of the premises of a litigant without warrant, and no case cited bears any resemblance on its facts or announces any principle which would support the action of the court below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b424-14\">.
