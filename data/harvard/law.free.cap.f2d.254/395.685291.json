The claim is that the seized devices are gambling devices under 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1171. It is agreed that the machines here are identical with those discussed by the Ninth Circuit in Hanni-fin v. United States, 1957, 248 F.2d 173. The Government having lost in that litigation is evidently endeavoring to create a conflict among the circuits by trying the same process elsewhere. We do not have anything to add to what the court said in the Hannifin case and in the district court in this Circuit where Judge Marsh discussed the question very thoroughly.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-16\">The judgment of the district court, 161 F.Supp. 5, will be affirmed on the authority of the Hannifin decision and the opinion of the district judge in the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
