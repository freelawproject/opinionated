The application was heard by a referee of the Social Security Administration, and the referee\u2019s adverse decision was carried to the Appeals Council which denied review. The present action was then brought. Judge Foley held that the evidence was clearly sufficient to support the decision of the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-18\">The appellant\u2019s attack upon this conclusion cannot be sustained. Section 405 (g) provides: \u201cThe findings of the Secretary as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, * * * \u201d As to the first ground of appeal we affirm on the opinion below, Ussi v. Folsom, 157 F.Supp. 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-19\">The appellant also asserts irregularities in the administrative procedure. He complains that he was not informed of his right to be represented by counsel at the hearing before the referee. The regulations provide that an applicant may be- represented by an attorney or other qualified representative approved by the Social Security Administration. 20 C.F.R. 403.713 (1949); C.F.R. 404.901 (1957 Supp.). We find no requirement that this privilege be brought to the applicant\u2019s attention. In the notice of the hearing appellant was informed that he might call at the Field Office of the Administration nearest his home for information and advice with respect to matters to be considered at the hearing. At no time before or during the hearing did he inquire about or request representation by counsel. Nor does he show that his case before the referee suffered in any respect from the absence of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-20\"> On his request for review by the Appeals Council, the appellant presented additional evidence consisting of 12 exhibits of medical reports.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These exhibits were received and made part of the record on September 6, 1956, and on the same date review of the referee\u2019s decision was denied. The appellant now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>.contends that the denial was made with.out considering this additional evidence. There is. no basis for .this contention. The exhibits were short and could be read in 10 or 15 minutes. It might well be that the Appeals Council considered the documents before they were officially stamped and made part of the record. In any event, we must indulge the well-recognized presumption of regularity in official action and assume that the officials considered the exhibits and denied review because they were not such as to change the result, as indeed they were not in our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-21\">.
