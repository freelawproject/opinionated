Their liens will not, in any event, be divested.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-9\">In these cases, which were several appendages to the case just above reported, and which came here on error or appeal from the .Circuit Court for the District of Louisiana, Marcuard, the Citizens\u2019 Bank of Louisiana, and the Merchants\u2019 Bank of New Orleans, alleged that at the time of filing the information mentioned in the foregoing case as the foundation of the sale which was made of the eight hundred and fort3'-four lots and ten squares of. ground in New Orleans, owned by Slidell, they respcctivety hold lions against the said propel^. And they were permitted by tlic courts below to intervene for the protection of their claims. Those courts, however \u2014 the District Court first, and the Circuit Court affirming its action \u2014 refused to let them take the proceeds of the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-10\">On the different writs of error or appeals the question was whether this action was right.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-11\"><em>Mr. Thomas Allen </em>Clarke, <em>for the parties appellant or plaintiffs in </em>error, .denied that it was.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-12\">\n<em>Mr. G.

But they ought' not to have been allowed to intervene. They had no interest, even if they were lien holders, in the confiscation proceedings. It was only the right of John Slidell, whatever that fight was, that could be condemned and sold, and the sale under the judgment of condemnation in no degree disturbed their liens. . By the decree of condemnation the United States succeeded to the position of Slidell, and the sale had no other purpose or effect than to make the thing confiscated available for the uses designated by the Confiscation Act. This was decided in <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Forrest,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and more recently in <em>Day </em>v.. <em>Micou </em><footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The District Court, therefore, acted correctly in rejecting the claims of the appellants and plaintiffs in error, even if. the reasons given for the rejection wore insufficient, and the Circuit Court was not in error in affirming what the District Court did.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The action of the Circuit Court in the premises'is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">Affirmed in each of the oases.</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-6\">Mr. Justice BRADLEY did not sit during the argument, and took no part in the decision of any of the above causes.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b139-11\"><em> </em>9 Wallace, 339.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b139-12\"> 18 Id. 1S6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
