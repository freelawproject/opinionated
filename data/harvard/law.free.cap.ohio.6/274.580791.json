The plaintiff in error was indicted for perjury. The offense was alleged to have been committed in making affidavit to a plea of <em>non est </em>factum, in a trial before a justice of the peace, in which the plaintiff in error was defendant. In the suit before the justice, a note was produced in the following terms :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-7\">\u201cEor value received, I promise to pay unto Henry Wheelbager, 275] *or crder, the amount of four dollars and fifty cents without defalcation for value received of him, as witness my hand and seal, this March 17, a. d. 1834.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-8\">His</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-9\">John -f K.

Pickens, <em>alias </em>John Pickens. In describing the note in question, the following terms were used: <em>\u201canote or writing obligatory purporting to have been executed by the said John K. </em>Pickens, alias <em>John Pickens, for the payment,\u201d </em>etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-15\">In describing the affidavit in support of the plea of <em>non est factum, </em>the indictment set forth that <em>\u201c the said John K. Pickens </em>alias <em>John Pickens, made a certain paper writing </em>purporting <em>to be an affidavit in writing of him, the said John K. </em>Pickens, alias <em>John Pickens,\u201d </em>etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>At the trial in the court of common pleas, the counsel for the accused, objected to the admission in evidence of the note on account of a variance from the note described in the indictment; the note presented being subscribed John K. Pickens only, no <em>alias, ov</em>other name, as John Pickens, appearing to it. The objection was overruled, and the note admitted in evidence. The counsel for the accused objected also to the admission in evidence of the affidavit, it being subscribed and <em>purporting </em>to be made by John Pick-ens only, no <em>alias </em>John K. Pickens appearing tobe connected with it. This objection was also overruled, and the affidavit admitted in evidence. The counsel for the accused excepted to these opinions of the court of eommou pleas, and the accused being convicted, this writ of error was brought, and the final execution of the sentence suspended.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-5\">*Brazee, for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-6\">Tbe first question for the consideration of the court, upon this record, is, were those papers properly admitted as evidence to the jury ? That part of the indictment which sets out the note and affidavit,sets them out as \u201cpurporting\u201d to be made by \u201cJohn K. Pickens, <em>alias </em>John Pickens.\u201d The note appears to have been signed \u201c John K. Pickens \u201d only, and the affidavit appears to be signed \u201cJohn Pickens\u201d and in its body it declares that it was made by John Pickens. The word \u201cpurport\u201d has a technical meaning, as fixed and settled as any term known to the law. In 2 East\u2019s Crown Law, 980, it is said that, \u201c in all eases the word-, <em>purport </em>imports what appears <em>on the face of the instrument; </em>for want of attending to which many indictments have been set aside.\u201d In 2 Russell, 1485, it is also defined, \u201c to import what appears on the face of the instrument.\u2019 \u2019 In the same book, page 364, it is. declared to be the <em>apparent </em>and not the <em>legal import. </em>In Jones\u2019 case, the instrument was laid in some of the counts to be <em>&amp; paper-writing purporting to be a bank note, </em>it was holden, as it did not. purport on the face of it to be a bank note, the counts could not. be supported. 2 Russell, 363 ; 2 East, 883.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-7\">In Reading\u2019s case, the indictment charged that the bill of exchange, the, subject of the forgery, <em>purported </em>to be directed to one-John King, by the name and description of John Ring; the bill-, was in faet directed to John Ring; the prisoner being convicted; the twelve judges held that judgment ought to be arrested, on th\u00abi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>ground that the bill did not in, fact, <em>purport to </em>be directed to one John King, as stated in the indictment. Buller, Justice, in delivering the opinion of the judges in that case, said, \u201cit is clear that where an instrument is to be set forth the description, that <em>it purports </em>a particular fact, necessarily means that what is stated as the purport of the instrument appears on the face of the instrument itself.\u201d 2 Russell, 363; 2 East, 981. In the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Kearses, 1 Virginia Cases, 109, the indictment alleged that a forged certificate <em>purported </em>to be signed by Bowling Starke, and the signature was B. Starke; the variance was held to be fatal. Does the note <em>purport, </em>or appear upon its face to be signed by \u201cJohn K. Pickens, <em>alias </em>John Pickens?\u201d Certaintly not, and if the \u201c <em>alias </em>John Pickens\u201d be regarded by the court as descriptive 277] of the note, the ^variance must be fatal. But should the court incline to the opinion, that John K. Pickens \u201d only is descriptive of the note, and that the <em>\u201c alias </em>John Pickens \u201d is descriptive of the person of the defendant, the note may have been properly admitted as evidence. But the affidavit can not be disposed of in the same way; if the <em>\u201calias </em>John Pickens,\u201d in that part of the indictment descriptive of the note, be regarded by the court as descriptive of the <em>person </em>of the defendant, and not of the \u00a1note, for the same reason, the court, to be consistent, must hold :tbat the \u201c <em>alias </em>John Pickens,\u201d in that part of the indictment \u2022which describes the affidavit, is also descriptive of the <em>person </em>of sthe -defendant, and not of the affidavit. And then it will appear \u2022/that the court below, under the allegation in the indictment that ithe affidavit <em>purported </em>to have been made and executed by \u201c John K. Pickens,\u201d adinitted in evidence an affidavit, which in the body, \u00a1as well as by the signature, <em>purported </em>and appeared upon its face ito have been executed by \u201c John Pickens.\u201d It appears to me \u25a0most clearly that the affidavit admitted in evidence is not the af:fidavit set out in the indictment, and that a paper signed \u201c John Pickens\u201d does not <em>purport </em>or appear upon its face to have been signed by \u201cJohn K. Pickens.\u201d The proposition needs only to be slated in its simplest form to elucidate the error.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-5\">H. H. Hunter, contra:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-6\">The first point made is that the note and affidavit set out in the bill of exceptions were improperly admitted in evidence to the jury. AndjjM'Sij.as to \u00a1the note; that it set out in the indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>as \u201cpurporting\u201d to have been executed by the said \u201cJohn IL Pickens, <em>alias </em>John Pickens;\u201d whereas the note offered in evidence <em>purports </em>to be signed or executed John his M mark IL Pickens, which is variant from the indictment. This part of the indictment is inartificially drawn, but is substantially good. The difficulty complained of by the plaintiff in error does not <em>in fact </em>exist, though <em>apparently </em>it does. It is to be observed that the defendant is named and described in the indictment, by the name of John K. Pickens, <em>alias </em>John Pickens. And the averment in the indictment is substantially that the note purported to be executed by the defendant; not that the name <em>signed to the note </em>was John IL Pickens, <em>'alias </em>John Pickens. The cases cited by counsel for ^plaintiff in error to show the legal effect of the word \u201c <em>pur- </em>[278 <em>port\u201d </em>are doubtless good law, but as we think- inapplicable to the case. As to the affidavit, we think clearly the same answer may be made. This averment of the indictment is, that the said John IL Pickens, <em>alias </em>John Pickens, made a certain paper <em>writing purporting </em>to be an affidavit of him the said John IL Pickens, <em>alias </em>John Pickens. Clearly this averment does not undertake to set out the name attached to the affidavit, but merely to aver (as in the case of the note) that the affidavit purported to be executed by the <em>defendant., </em>who, in the indictment, is presented by the name of John K. Pickens alias, John Pickens. The question recurs, do the papers set out in the bill of exceptions purport to be executed <em>by the defendant ? </em>For that is what we claim the averments of the indictment to be in substance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-5\">As before stated, the -name signed to the note is John his M mark IL Pickens, and the affidavit is signed John Pickens. The defendant is described in the indictment by both these names, or rather as being known by either of them. In fact, then, these papers do purport to be signed <em>by the defendant; </em>one under each of the names by which he is known and described in the indictment.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b279-6\">Held by the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">That, in this case, the indictment, by reciting that the note was executed by John IL Pickens, <em>alias </em>John Pickens, describes not the note itself) but the person executing it. Consequently there was no variance between the note described and the note presented in evidence. There was, therefore, no error in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Held, further, that the indictment, in describing the affidavit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>reciting that \u201c the said John IL Pickens, <em>alias </em>John Pickens, made a certain paper writing <em>purporting </em>tobe an affidavit in writing of him, the said John IL Pickens, <em>alias </em>John Pickens,\u201d in fact describes a paper subscribed \u201c John K. Pickens, <em>alias </em>John Pickens.\u201d The paper produced in evidence, being subscribed John Pickens only, was variant from that described in the indictment, and, therefore, inadmissible as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Judgment reversed, and the accused ordered to be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
