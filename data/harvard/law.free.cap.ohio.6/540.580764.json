The simple question before the court is, whether the following instrument is a promissory note, for no one claims it to be a bill of exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">\u201cThree months after date we promise to pay Samuel Foster, or order, one hundred and forty-three dollars and twenty-two cents; provided Samuel Foster delivers the crop of tobacco raised by him and Trockmiller; the said Foster is to have one-fourth of the above in hand, and in addition three dollars and fifty cents per hundred for that part yet to be delivered, payable one-fourth in hand and the balance in one hundred and twenty days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-12\">\u201c Thomas H. Cushing,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-13\">Ring &amp; Rice,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-14\">J. H. Harris, <em>per J. JJ. Gushing.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-15\">\u201c <em>April </em>28, 1827.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">A promissory not\u00e9is a \u201cwritten promise for the payment of money, absolutely, and at all events.\u201d Bayley on Bills, 1. Accord* ing to Blackstone, 2 B. C. 467, it is \u201c a plain and direct engagement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u25a0in writing to pay a sum specified, at the time therein limited, to a person therein named, or sometimes to his order, or oftener to the bearer at large.\u201d To my understanding the instrument before me \u25a0does not satisfy either definition, or the common acceptation of a promissory note. It is not an absolute promise to pay at all \u25a0events a certain sum, for part of the amount is dependent upon the contingencies of the delivery of a crop of tobacco, and the quantity estimated at three dollars and fifty cents per hundred. The time of payment is not on a day fixed and certain, but depend-\u2022541] ent the whole upon contingencies, and part upon ^double contingencies. If the crop of tobacco was delivered (at what time is uncertain), a fourth of the one hundred and forty-three dollars .and twenty-two cents was to be paid down, if not the whole in three months. If such an instrument was offered to a merchant, \u25a0or a bank, as a promissory note, would it not be rejected at once .as no promissory note?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">I think the court below erred in admitting the instrument in evidence without proof of its execution, because it is not a promissory note.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
