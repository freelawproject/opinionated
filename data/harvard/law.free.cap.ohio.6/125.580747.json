The plaintiff commenced his action in November, 1831. He declares upon a sealed bill, dated January 16, 1807, payable on demand. Plea, that the cause of action did not accrue within fifteen years next before suit brought. Replication, that when the note declared on was made, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate resided out of the State of Ohio, in Pennsylvania, and continued to reside there until June 1, 1823, when he moved into Ohio, which was within fifteen years next before the commencement of the suit.

That act limits the bringing debt upon \u201c specialty under hand and seal,\u201d to fifteen years after such cause of action; but it provides that if any person entitled to such action ^sh'.ill be \u201c beyond sea\u201d at the time such action accrues, he [126 shall have a right to bring his action within the time limited by the act, after such disability shall be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>The only question presented on this demurrer is, do the words, \u201cbeyond sea,\u201d in legal acceptation, describe persons without the jurisdiction of the state, though no sea intervene? The Supreme-Court, many years ago on the circuit, and frequently since that time, decided that persons without the jurisdiction of the state, were \u201cbeyond sea,\u201d within the meaning of this act. The terms, \u201c beyond sea,\u201d are borrowed from the act, 21 James I, which, in England, have been adjudged to have a meaning synonymous, with <em>beyond </em>or <em>out of the realm. </em>Like expressions have been held by the Supreme Court of the United States to be equivalent to <em>without the limits of the state. </em>3 Cranch, 174; 3 Wheat. 545; 8 Wheat. 366. Similar decisions have been made in other states. 1 Har. &amp; McH. 89; 1 Har. &amp; Johns. 350; 2 McCord, 331; 3 Mass. 271; 1 Pick. 263. With these constructions we are satisfied. The plaintiff, then, being within the exception of the statute, and the <em>disability </em>continuing until he removed into this state in 1823, less than nine years of the statute had run when the suit was brought,, and the replication avoids the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Leave was asked and obtained to amend the plea, on paying all the costs since they were filed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
