On the trial in the county, the plaintiff, in support of his title, offered a final certificate of purchase, issued for the land claimed by the United States land office, to his lessor\u2019s ancestor, upon which no patent had in fact been issued. He offered no other direct evidence of title, but proved that the ancestor had laid out a town upon the quarter section and recorded the plat of it under our law, and that he had paid the taxes of the tract. The defendant disclosed no title. The court instructed the jury that the certificate of purchase only furnished evidence of an equity in the lessor of the ^plaintiff, but not of a legal right [165 to possession avoidable in ejectment. The judge commented upon and explained to the jury the evidence as to the laying out and recording the town plat, as bearing upon the question of possession in the ancestor of the plaintiff\u2019s lessor, and concluded by instructing them, \u201cthat to enable the plaintiff to recover upon the prior possession of his ancestor alone, that possession must have been actual, notorious, and open.\u201d The jury found for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-8\">T.

Whether the laying out the town, paying the taxes, etc., satisfied the jury of an actual possession in the ancestor, was a question for the jury; and that, in a proper case, it was the duty of the court to explain the evidence given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">That, as to the other point, two of the judges were of opinion that the holder of a final certificate of purchase and payment from the United States land office, has a right of entry, upon which he may recover, against one showing no title, and relying upon a mere naked possession ; while the other two judges thought differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">This division of opinion operates to overrule the motion for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
