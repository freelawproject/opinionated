The plaintiff in error was indicted, in the court below, for house-breaking. The indictment contained three counts: 1. For breaking and entering the mansion-house of A. Mason, and committing an assault and battery upon Mary, his wife. 2. For breaking and entering the mansion-house of Mason, <em>in which he and his family then </em>lived, and attempting to assault, beat, ill-treat, and abuse Mary, his wife. 3. For an assault and battery upon Mary Mason. The jury found the defendant guilty generally, and the court sentenced him to imprisonment in the cell o*f the county jail, to be fed on bread and water, for fifteen days; to pay a fine of two hundred and fifty dollars, and the costs, amounting to eighty-three dollars and five cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-11\">The counsel engaged in the defense, during the progress of the trial, seem to have waged war upon the court, and to have exerted themselves to multiply the obstacles in the way of its advance. Exceptions were taken at every step of the trial, and to almost every word which fell from the court. The record is so lumbered up, and the case so involved in obscurity, as to leave it no easy matter to find out the true state of it. In the language of the record, counsel took, \u201cexception to all and every of the acts and opinions of the court, in overruling questions and testimony, and in its in-20] structions and charge to the *j ury; in its refusal to charge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>and generally in not permitting the defendant to make out hie defense, as he offered to do.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b17-5\">Eor alleged errors in the conduct of the trial, the plaintiff in error seeks to reverse the sentence against him.

I must, therefore, try to generalize.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-12\">The first objections taken in the court below were to the array. These were made after challenges for cause had been interposed and decided, and the jurymen had taken their seats. They were :</p>\n<p id=\"b17-13\">1. That the venire only contained the names of the petit jury, when it should have contained the names of the grand jury also. This was overruled. The defendant then moved to set aside the venire, and offered to prove, in support of his motion:</p>\n<p id=\"b17-14\">1. That the apportionment of jurors by the clerk was not in the ratio of the number of free white males in each township, as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-15\">2. That the clerk did not make a written statement of his doings, and give it to the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-16\">3. That the apportionment was not made on the first Monday of September.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-17\">The court refused to hear the motion, and overruled the evidence offered in support of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-18\">What is erroneous in this proceeding ? The venire should not have included the grand jury. They are distinct bodies, and should be separately summoned. The statute, as we understand it does not require the two juries to be included in *the same [21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>writ. The other objections to the jury, if all the party offered to prove be admitted as true, have no better foundation. The clerk is required by law, the first Monday of September, annually, to proportion the jurors for the year, among the free white males of twenty-one years old, in the respective townships, and give the \u25a0same to the sheriff in writing, who, when he proclaims the October elections, is required to annex a notification to the trustees of townships of the number of jurors apportioned to each township. The trustees are, on the day of the election, to select good, judicious men, to the number required, and transmit their names to the \u2022clerk. The names of the jurors thus selected, are written upon separate pieces of paper, and put into a box, from which the clerk, in the presence of the sheriff, thirty days before each court, draws \u25a0out twenty-seven ballots, the first fifteen of whom are to be summoned as grand jurors, and the remaining twelve as petit jurors. This statutory direction to the officers should be substantially followed, yet we are not prepared to say that unessential variations would be regarded as affecting the array. We have never known, \u25a0in this state, an objection of this kind before. The profession, by universal consent, refuse to notice such matters, as this in no way \u25a0endangers a fair trial. The objection at best was a mere technical one, and, in the opinion of the court below, was not made in technical time. Technicality is never more appropriately resorted to, than to meet and put down technical objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">The record shows that, during the trial, it was proven that the \u25a0defendant, about noon, hired Mason to go with his team about twelve miles, for a load of merchandise, and gave him money to pay his expenses for the night. Mason went for the load, but instead of staying over night, returned about dusk, came home the back way to avoid observation, and early went to bed with his wife. About ten o\u2019clock, footsteps were heard approaching. The \u25a0defendant came on to the porch, tried to enter by each of two doors, but finding both fastened, he approached the window and passed it. He soon turned again, raised the window six or eight inches, and let it down again. He again raised it, and fastened it up; then, partly entering, the blind hit his back, and he withdrew, stood erect a short time, and then slowly and gently crept through the window into the house. When in, he seized the bed \u2022clothes on Mrs. Mason\u2019s shoulder, and pulled'them down. At this 22] instant, *Mason sprung from the bed, seized the defendant by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the hair of his head, threw him down, and held him until he begged for quarter. He was then let up, and having got his hat and shoes from the porch, was taken into another room, and detained for a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">The. legal questions presented by the counsel for the defendant, for the decision of the court during the progress of the trial, as we gather them from the record, may be resolved into two propositions :</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">1. Whether, in case the defendant entered the house with <em>intent </em>to commit adultery, and is foiled in effecting his object, he can be convicted, under the indictment, of breaking and entering and. perpetrating any other unlawful act.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">2. Whether in such case, it is competent for the defendant to prove that he was in the habit of visiting the wife, in her husband\u2019s absence, for criminal intercourse, as a fact from which the jury may infer that he broke and entered the house, and laid hands \u25a0on the wife, with such intent only, at the time complained of?</p>\n<p id=\"b19-8\">The statute, 29 Ohio L. 144, prescribes the punishment for breaking and entering a mansion-house in the night season, <em>in which any person shall reside or dwell, </em>and committing, or attempting to commit, any personal <em>violence or abuse. </em>The <em>intent </em>with which the party enters forms no ingredient of the offense. The inquiries presented by the statute are.: Did the accused break and enter the house in the night season? If so, did he commit, or attempt to commit, any personal abuse or violence? In this case, there was no question before the common pleas as to the breaking and entering .the house with an illegal design \u2014 that of committing adultery. While prosecuting this unlawful purpose, the defendant rudely laid hands upon Mrs. Mason, and thus committed an act of violence or abuse, though of a less heinous character than he intended. Is he not answerable? If one strike another with intent to kill or maim, but fails of his object, that failure does not excuse him from liability for the assault and battery. If, then, the laying hold of Mrs. Mason was an attempt to commit adultery, it was an attempt at <em>abuse </em>of her; an attempt to do just what in fact was done, though not carried out to the full fruition of his hopes. What principle of law is violated in such case, by describing the act done in legal language? The first and third counts in the indictment charge the actual commission of an assault *and battery; the second, an attempt [23 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>\u2022to commit one, and otherwise to ill-treat and abuse Mrs. Mason. The court, in resolving the propositions in the affirmative, in our opinion fell into no substantial error. The party is liable for the act done, if it be one of personal violence or abuse. The law does not require that those precise words should be inserted in the indictment, but only that some act shall be charged to have been done or attempted of that character. If the terms were less general, and limited the offense to a breaking and entering, and the-committing or attempting to commit an assault and battery, that particular act would be essential to the offense, and would have to be described.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">The second general proposition, which conducts to the inquiries, how far the defendant had a right to protect himself, by reason of the consent of Mrs. Mason to his visiting her for criminal purposes, remains to be considered. The case made does not, in our opinion, require a very critical examination of this general proposition. We are not called upon to say whether one entering a house with the actual consent of the wife of the occupant, with a view to illicit intercourse, could be punished under the statute for breaking and entering the house. No such case is before us. The real question is: Would Mrs. Mason\u2019s consent that the accused should visit her in the absence of her husband, or proof of his being in the habit of visiting her when her husband was absent, even \u00edor a criminal purpose, conduce to prove her permission to him to break and enter the house for such purpose when the husband was present and by her side ? It is absurd to suppose so. The evidence rejected in that view, therefore, could not have benefited the defendant; and, if it could be of no advantage to him, he was not injured by its rejection. We incline to think a married woman incapable in law, by consent, to authorize a third person to break open and enter the house of her husband for an unlawful purpose. Such consent, though ever so formally given, could not justify or legalize an infraction of law, or sanctify an unlawful purpose, and will any one pretend that the entering a man\u2019s house with intent to commit adultery with his wife, with any consent, save only that of the husband, is a lawful entry? Be this, however, as it may, the evidence of the defendant\u2019s habit of visiting this woman, in this case, was properly rejected by the common pleas. The indictment does not charge the breaking and entering the house to 34] have been with <em>any particular *intent, </em>nor does the law re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>quire the intent to be set forth. The charge is for breaking and entering (without reference to the intent), and committing and attempting to commit an assault and battery upon Mrs. Mason, and to ill use her. The offense is complete without reference to the design of the party in entering. The objection urged, that if the accused had obtained the consent of the wife'to the unlawful interview, neither she nor her husband had power to withdraw it, because it would be a fraud upon the rights conferred upon him by the consent, is one that can meet no countenance where any just moral perception is found. The proposition is novel in our courts, and is supposed to have found its way into the temples of justice, for the first time, in this case. Does an agreement to disregard the decent proprieties which bind society together, and to-trample under foot the laws of G-od and man, impose upon the parties to it a legal obligation to be enforced in the judicial tribunals of a Christian community? Is it true that confederates in-crime are to escape punishment in order that their criminal engagements may be performed ? Not so. The law holds void and of no effect all contracts whose object is to violate its injunctions, or those of good morals. In providing punishment for criminal acts, while the <em>mere intention </em>to commit them is overlooked, the law holds out perpetual encouragement to the evil-disposed to abstain from crime; and it carries out the design in proffering absolution from legal obligation to perform unlawful agreements. The-wanton, immoral, and illegal conduct, charged upon the defendant below, in our opinion, is in no degree excused or palliated by any supposed violation of the alleged contract of Mrs. Mason to become a partner in his guilt. We see nothing in the conduct of the trial by the court below which requires of us to reverse the sentence against the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">We are called, however, to look to the indictment to ascertain if it charge an offense which warrants the conviction. The statute provides punishment for the breaking, etc., of any <em>mansion-house in which any person shall reside or dwell. </em>It is descriptive of the offense to allege that the house broken is the residence or dwelling-place of some one. The first count is defective in substance in omitting this allegation. The charge of committing an assault and battery upon a person <em>\u201c then and there in said house be</em>ing,\u201d can not, even after the verdict, be construed into an allegation that that person, or any other one, resided or *dwelt in [25&gt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the house. The second count of the indictment charges the offense as in the house \u201cin which the said Aurelius Mason and family then and there lived,\u201d and is in substantial conformity with the statute. This count affords a legal ground for the whole sentence without resorting to the first or third. The rule in criminal cases is the reverse of that which obtains in civil, and if there be good counts to authorize the conviction, the bad ones are held not to vitiate the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">The judgment is affirmed, and remanded back to the court of common pleas for execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">Note. \u2014 The bill of exceptions set forth in the record of the foregoing cause, is copied below as a legal curiosity, \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"100\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" width=\"557\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">\u201c In this case the counsel for the defendant moved to quash the venire for the petit jury, after the case was called and the jurymen had taken their seats in the box, for the reason, that it only contained the names of twelve persons, and because the venire for the grand and petit jury should have been made out together instead of separately (a copy of which venire is hereto attached and made part of this bill of exceptions), which motion was overruled. The counsel for the defendant then called on the clerk for the record of the proceedings under the act relating to juries, and no such record being produced, the defendant\u2019s counsel then offered to prove, by parol, by the clerk of this court, coupled with a motion to set the venire aside and quash the same : 1. That the apportionment, made by the clerk, of jurors, was not in the ratio of the number of free white male inhabitants in each township, contrary to the second section of the act relating to juries. 2. That the clerk did not make, in writ, ing, a statement of the number of jurors apportioned to each township, and deliver the same to the sheriff. 3. That if any apportionment of jurors was made by the clerk, it was not made on the first Monday of September. 4. The clerk has no record of his proceedings in the matter of the said apportionment of jurors. These motions were made after challenges for cause had been made on the part of the prosecution; which testimony, so offered by the defendant, the court overruled and refused to hear, and decided the motion \u2022against the defendant; to all which opinions and doings of the court the said defendant here excepts. And the jury being impaneled and sworn to try the issue joined, the state, in order to make out the issue on her part, produced as a witness, Aurelius Mason, who was sworn, and in his examination in chief, stated that on August 24, 1832, the defendant came to him and said he had a box of saddle-ware at the mouth of Huron, and wanted witness to go with his team and get it. Witness made excuse and said he could not go \u2014 this about ten o\u2019clock in the day \u2014 that defendant went out and was gone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>about an hour, and then returned, stating that he could get no other team, and he would not have it remain out on the dock for twenty dollars for that night. .The witness thought at length that he might possibly go, consented and got ready about twelve o\u2019clock, and went down to the mouth of river, and returned with *the box, and left some mill irons at Milan on his return; [26 that he got home a little after dark, eat his supper and went to bed. About ten o\u2019clock in the evening heard footsteps on the porch, and then the person went to the door and gently raised the latch; and that door being fastened he went to the other door, and that being' also fastened, he turned and went to the window, and went past it, and then turned back and raised the window six or eight inches, and then let it down, and then raised it again and put piece of broom handle under the window and partly entered; that the window paper struck his back, and he drew back and stood erect, and then after a little came in gently, some time in getting in, and when in seized hold of the bedclothes and pulled them part of the way down; then witness jumped out \u25a0of the bed and caught him by the hair of his head, and that the defendant \u2022sprang for the window, but witness pulled him back and pulled him down .and put his knee on him, and defendant cried for mercy; that witness held \u25a0the bed-room door while he put some clothes on, and then both defendant and witness went into the other room, and defendant asked to go out to shed and and get his shoes and hat. Witness\u2019 house in Huron county; this affair happened there. Defendant seized the bedclothes near his wife\u2019s shoulder; the person who did this was Frederick Forsythe, the defendant. [The defendant forbears his cross-examination for the present, not waiving the \u25a0right.]</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">\u201c Mrs. Mary Mason was then called on behalf of the state, and being sworn, she stated that the first she heard was a footstep on the porch; that the person went to the kitchen door, and then he went to the square room door\u2014 then he went to the window, and then he went to the bed-room window and made some noise on the window, and got in and took hold of the clothes and pulled them down from her shoulders; then her husband seized the defendant. About ten o\u2019clock.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">\u201cCross-examined: States that she had not fairly been asleep \u2014 in a doze; at first she heard step on the shed, then at the latch of kitchen; it was but little distance from bed-room. He then went to square room door, and then raised the latch of that door, lightly; then went to square room window and tried to raise it; no tapping at door; might have been on bedroom window; gentle taps; window not fastened, that is, bed-room window; the stick had been used under the window, but she did not know where it was then; the window was raised; did not come in, passed, then came in before letting window down; then went directly toward bed; was in his stocking feet on the porch, light step; no carpet in the bed-room; not a word was said; husband had been in bed an hour; she spoke to him in an undertone; said that some person on the porch; did not suspect who until he came; lay still: it was between half and three-fourths \u2022 of an hour between the time of his getting on the porch and getting into bed-room; her person not injured; saw Mr. Forsythe; said nothing to her husband; he would see him in morn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>ing; and the defendant went to the door; no conversation between the defendant and her; and after defendant went away, she asked her husband why he let him go. When she whispered to her husband that some one on porch, husband said, lie still, and we will see who it is; when he went to room window, she told her husband it was Forsythe; in whispers; the head of the-bed was west; saw defendant\u2019s face in window; she lay foreside of bed; there was a man by the name of Sarnia, and one by the name of Felt, boarding there at the time; they slept in another room; Mr. Forsythe lives just opposite; frequently saw defendant; the said boarders not waked that night that she knew; saw defendant that afternoon; just after husband was gone; he came in and handed paper for her husband to take to Milan; did not sit down as she remembered; stayed little while and then went; defendant was at her house twice before her husband went away, to get him to go; said the first time that be wanted her husband to go; not many words passed; nothing said 27] about his coming home, only she asked him when he \u00aewould come; her husband told her that Forsythe had given him one dollar to pay expenses for the night at mouth of Huron; returned a little after dark; was up; did not see the team; when letter brought by Forsythe, he did not say that her husband would stay all night; don\u2019t know but she asked defendant if her-husband could go and get back that night; nothing said about repairing wagon; married before she came here; five years since they went to live where they now live; families of her husband and defendant on good terms; never visited ; Mr. Forsythe was in there occasionally; defendant there frequently last summer; on friendly terms all last summer except one little spell; her husband did not deliver the box that night; next morning it was delivered; Mr. Forsythe occasionally held conversations with her in the absence of her husband at her house. This question was then put by defendant\u2019s attorney: Has-not Forsythe for four or five years past, in the absence of your husband, frequently called in at your house and held conversations with you, and have not you and your husband in all that time been on terms of neighborly and friendly understanding with Forsythe?

This question was then put by the defendant: Between the 11th of May last and the 24th of August following, was there not an interchange of neighborly acts between yourself and the defendant? Which question wa3 also objected to by the state, and overruled by the court. This question was then put by the defendant: Do you know of any other reason than that difficulty of the 11th May spoken of, that existed, orthat youhad given that evening, or immediately before, why the defendant should make an attack on your person?

State rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">\u201cDefendant called Mr. Horten, who was sworn,'and said that he remembered that Mason went to the mouth of Huron river; did not see Mason that night; witness slept in his shop, fifteen feet only from Mason\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">\u201cMrs. Peverwell was then called on behalf of the defendant, and was-sworn, and the defendant put this question: Do you know that for months-previous to the act complained of, there was a general license on the part of Mrs. Mason, for the defendant to visit her in a confidential manner ? Which question was objected to, and overruled by the court. This question was then-propounded to the witness by defendant: State what you have heard Mrs. Mason say respecting Forsythe\u2019s visiting her, in the absence of her husband, privately and confidentially; which is also objected to by the state, and overruled by the court. The defendant then put this question: Do you know, from Mrs. Mason, or otherwise, that previous to the time when this assault and battery was supposed to have been committed, that Mrs. Mason had given-Mr. Forsythe a general permission to visit her confidentially in the absence \u2022of her husband? Which question was objected to, and overruled by the-court, not because the question was a leading one, but because it was incompetent evidence. The defendant then offered to prove by this witness, that-Mr. Forsythe had been in the habit of visiting Mrs. Mary Mason, in the absence of her husband, with her consent, for illicit purposes \u2014 and this previous to the offense laid. Which testimony the court also precluded from going to the jury, and overruled. Whereupon the defendant rested his oause, and takes exception to all' and every of the acts and opinions of the court, in overruling the questions and testimony aforesaid, and in not permitting the defendant to make his defense as he offered to do as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"Atq9\">29] \u201cAfter the argument, the defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to *instruct the jury as follows, as applicable to all but the last count in the indictment: 1. That every assault and battery includes, as an integral part of it, a rude, wrongful, or angry manner; and in this case, if Mr. Forsythe had not a hostile intention \u2014 if he merely wished to have illicit intercourse with Mrs. Mary Mason, with her consent, then the intention on his part to commit an-assault and battery is barred. 2. That the specific intention of beating this woman must be proved; and that it matters not whether she consented or not, if he acted on the faith of any understanding, or supposition of any understanding, or license, it is sufficient for his justification. Her consent or dissent, at the time of the attempt made, constitutes no part of any crime that can be imputed to the defendant; it is only referable to what his intentions were, and if it had so happened that the wife had given encouragement to Mr. Forsythe before her husband had went away from home, and he came back contrary to her expectation, and she had withdrawn her assent after her hus* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>band\u2019s return, without the defendant\u2019s knowledge, it would operate as fraud on the defendant. 3. If Mr. Forsythe either entered the house, or pulled the clothes down from Mrs. Mason\u2019s person, with an intent of committing adultery with her consent, the defendant is not guilty, for his general illegal intentions, or intention to commit another crime than that charged, not amounting to a felony, can not be applied to this specific offense to make out the guilty intention \u2014 that rule only applies to felonies. 4. If the window was not fastened, but continued closed only by its own weight, the raising the window by defendant is no breaking open, within the words of the statute on which this indictment is predicated. 5. That it was -necessary that the defendant should have entered with an intent to commit an assault and battery, and that that intent should be carried into effect. Which instructions the court did refuse to give to the jury, and did instruct the jury, that each and every of said propositions to be unfounded in law, as applicable to this case. And the court did instruct and charge the jury, that if the wife, Mary Mason, had withdrawn her assent, by reason of the return of her husband, as contained in said second proposition submitted by defendant\u2019s counsel, though the defendant acted on the faith of a previous assignation, he was guilty. And the court did further instruct the jury, that if Mr. Forsythe had, previous to-the offense charged, a general license from Mrs. Mary Mason to visit her confidentially, in the absence of her husband, or if he visited Mrs. Mary Mason for illicit purposes, in pursuance of a previous license given him by her, that it still made out no justification for the defendant, unless the jury were satisfied that she assented at the time. And the court did also charge the jury, that no previous consent will justify a wrong-doer in presuming or attempting to commit adultery; that he proceeds at his own peril, and if consent is withdrawn, he is criminal if he uses violence. That if there was any unlawful touching of the person of Mrs. Mary Mason by the defendant, without her consent at the time, it was a personal violence, and the defendant was guilty in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u201cTo all which opinions, charges, and instructions, and to the refusal of tho court to charge the jury as desired by the defendant, the said defendant now excepts, and prays the court to sign and seal this, his bill of exceptions.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
