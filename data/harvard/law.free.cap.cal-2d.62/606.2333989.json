J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ3h\">Plaintiff April Robin Doyle, a minor, appeals from a judgment entered pursuant to an order confirming an arbitration award. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1287.4, 1294,1294.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s father entered into a contract for medical and surgical services with defendant Ross-Loos Medical Group obligating that group \u201cto provide the same care and service to dependents of the Subscriber [plaintiff\u2019s father] as is available for the Subscriber.\u201d The agreement also provided, \u201cIn the event of any controversy between a Subscriber or a dependent ... as the ease may be, and Ross-Loos, whether involving a claim in tort, contract or otherwise, the same shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>be settled by arbitration.\u201d The contract specified a method for initiating arbitration proceedings and selecting the arbitrators. It also stated that the decision of the arbitrators shall be binding upon the parties subject to the power of a court to confirm, modify, or vacate the award as provided in the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In 1961 plaintiff\u2019s father notified defendants of a malpractice claim against them in connection with services to plaintiff. He wrote that he wished to submit the claim to the American Arbitration Association instead of invoking the arbitration procedures of the health care agreement. Defendants consented, but stated that they did not waive their right to arbitrate under the contractual procedures if the American Arbitration Association proceedings were abandoned or terminated without an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">In late 1961 the board of arbitrators issued a written statement that pointed out that plaintiff\u2019s parents had reserved the right to be appointed guardians ad litem for the child and to bring a civil action against defendants if the results of the arbitration were not satisfactory to them. It also recommended that a guardian ad litem be appointed for the arbitration proceedings and that the parents and the child have competent counsel to represent them.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">In early 1962, before the arbitrators reached a decision, counsel retained by plaintiff\u2019s father filed a malpractice action in the superior court. The court granted the father\u2019s petition to be appointed guardian ad litem. Defendants moved for an order staying further proceedings and submitting the matter to arbitration. The court granted this motion over the objection that plaintiff was a minor and therefore not bound by the agreement to arbitrate. Plaintiff attempted to appeal from the order, but the appeal was properly dismissed. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1294; <em>Laufman </em>v. <em>Hall-Mack Co., </em>215 Cal.App.2d 87, 88 [29 Cal.Rptr. 829, 94 A.L.R.2d 1068].) Later in the year plaintiff\u2019s father and the attorney who filed the action in the superior court signed a form of the American Arbitration Association entitled \u201cstipulation,\u201d stating that plaintiff\u2019s father \u201chereby ratifies the Demand for Arbitration. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The board of arbitrators, consisting of the same persons who had previously undertaken to arbitrate the controversy, then held a hearing at which plaintiff\u2019s evidence was presented by counsel. The board granted defendants\u2019 motion to deny plaintiff\u2019s claim on the basis of that evidence. Plaintiff then petitioned the superior court to vacate the award. (Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1285.) Defendants moved for an order confirming it. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a71285.2.) The court granted defendants\u2019 motion and entered judgment in conformity with the award. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1287.4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The authority of a parent to bind Ms child to arbitrate claims arising under a health care contract of which the cMld is a beneficiary has not been decided in this state,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and there is no statute expressly applicable. (Cf. N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 1448.) Plaintiff contends, however, that section 35 of the Civil Code and section 1287.6 of the Code of Civil Procedure establish her right to disaffirm the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">With exceptions not relevant here, section 35 of the Civil Code provides, \u201cIn all cases... the contract of a minor, if made whilst he is under the age of eighteen, may be dis-affirmed by the minor himself....\u201d This section applies to contracts of minors and protects them from their own improvidence in assuming contractual obligations. It does not apply to contracts between adults and is therefore not controlling on the question of a parent\u2019s power to bind Ms child to arbitrate by entering into a contract of which the child is a third party beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Section 1287.6 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that an arbitration \u201caward that has not been confirmed or vacated has the same force and effect as a contract in writing between the parties to the arbitration.\u201d The purpose of this section is not to afford minors an opportumty to dis-affirm arbitration awards, but to strengthen all such awards by making clear that they are binding as contracts even after the time for seeking judicial confirmation has expired. (See 3 Cal. Law Revision Com., Recommendation and Study Relating to Arbitration G-9; 9 U.C.L.A.L.Rev. 422, 436-437.)  Since the Legislature could easily have provided expressly for such disaffirmance (cf. Civ. Code, \u00a7 35), we cannot reasonably infer it from the general provisions of section 1287.6. Moreover, section 42 of the Civil Code authorizes a minor to \u2018 \u2018 enforce his rights by civil action, or other legal proceedings, in the same manner as a person of full age ...\u201d except that a guardian or guardian ad litem (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 372) must conduct the proceedings. The Legislature has not excepted arbitration proceedings from tMs section. If minors were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>always free to disaffirm arbitration awards, however, they would be effectively denied the benefits of arbitration, for few adults would agree to submit minors\u2019 claims to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">It thus appears that no statute expressly determines the outcome of this ease. The crucial question therefore is whether the power to enter into a contract for medical care that binds the child to arbitrate any dispute arising thereunder is implicit in a parent\u2019s right and duty to provide for the care of his child (Civ. Code, \u00a7 196; <em>Slaughter </em>v. <em>Zimman, </em>105 Cal.App.2d 623, 625 [234 P.2d 94]; Pen. Code, \u00a7 270). There are compelling reasons for recognizing that power. Since minors can usually disaffirm their own contracts to pay for medical services (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 35, 36), it is unlikely that medical groups would contract directly with them. They can be assured the benefits of group medical service only if parents can contract on their behalf. Unless such contracts unreasonably restrict minors\u2019 rights, they should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The arbitration provision in such contracts is a reasonable restriction, for it does no more than specify a forum for the settlement of disputes. It invests parents and guardians with considerably less power over causes of action than the Legislature has authorized by permitting them to compromise minors\u2019 claims. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 372; Prob. Code, \u00a7 1431.)  It is true that the statutes require court approval of any compromise, but commensurate safeguards surround arbitration: The issues are not compromised but are adjudicated by the arbitrators; a guardian or guardian ad litem must conduct the proceedings on behalf of the child (Civ. Code, \u00a7 42; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 372) ; and both the issue of arbitrability and the award are subject to judicial review (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1281.2, 1286.2, 1287, 1294).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Accordingly, the trial court correctly bold that the contract between plaintiff\u2019s father and defendants provided for arbitration of her claim and that she was bound thereby. Since no statutory grounds for vacating or refusing to confirm the award appeared, defendants\u2019 motion to confirm was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">McComb, J., Peters, J., Tobriner, J., Peek, J., Mosk, J., and Burke, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-10\"><em>Estate of Carpenter, </em>127 Cal. 582, 585 [60 P. 162], refers to the power to bind minors to arbitration in the context of a probate proceeding. We do not reach the issues that may be presented in such a context. See also, <em>Millsaps </em>v. <em>Estes, </em>137 N.C. 535 [50 S.E. 227, 107 Am.St.Rep. 496, 70 L.R.A.
