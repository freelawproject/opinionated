Cruz, who is confined for treatment as a narcotics addict (Pen. Code, \u00a7 6450) in the branch,of the California Rehabilitation Center located in the California Men\u2019s Colony, East Facility. We appointed counsel to represent petitioner in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">Petitioner contends that in the prehearing stages of his commitment process the authorities failed in several respects to comply with the strict statutory requirements of Penal Code section 6450<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and hence that his commitment is invalid under <em>In re Jones </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 325, 327 [1]-328 [3] [38 Cal.Rptr. 509, 392 P.2d 269], and <em>In re Raner </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 635, 641-643 [6] [30 Cal.Rptr. 814, 381 P.2d 638]. We need' not reach that issue, however, for the record shows that in the course of the proceedings petitioner personally asked to be committed, and with advice of counsel and full knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>his rights signed a waiver of the statutory requirements that were held controlling in <em>Raner </em>and <em>Jones. </em>The facts also fail to support petitioner\u2019s second main contention, i.e., that his transfer to and current confinement in the California Men\u2019s Colony branch of the California Rehabilitation Center constitutes \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d under <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California </em>(1962) 370 U.S. 660 [82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758].</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The waiver signed by petitioner is on a typed form which states: \u201cI, Harry A. Cruz, in order to begin treatment for my narcotic drug addiction as soon as possible, hereby freely and voluntarily make this waiver in open court of my statutory rights in this proceeding, including but not limited to those rights contained in Sections 5353, 5053, 5054 and 5055 of the Welfare and Institutions Code of this State.\u201d We need not now determine whether so sweeping a waiver of <em>all </em>the statutory safeguards surrounding these special proceedings would, or in all circumstances should, be valid;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rather, and commendably, the reporter's transcript discloses that the waiver here made was augmented by interrogation and a specificity of facts, so that the validity of the commitment does not rest on giving the waiver an actual effect as broad as it purports to declare on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The trial court first informed petitioner (and a group of other persons being similarly processed) of the nature and purpose of the proceedings, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">\u201cAll of you ladies and gentlemen before me at the present time have been certified to me by some other Court in which you stand convicted either by plea or conviction by Court or jury of an offense, either a misdeameanor or a felony, and you have been certified to me, to the Court, as possibly being addicted to the use of narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">\u201cThe function of this Court on that certification is to appoint doctors and to try to ascertain the facts of whether you are or are not addicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">\u201cIf we find after that examination, after a hearing on that, that you are addicted, then the ultimate order will be the narcotics rehabilitation program, committing you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\">\u201cIf we find you are not addicted to narcotics, on medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>testimony or otherwise, you will be recertified to the certifying Court for the criminal charge there pending.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\u201cYou are here at the present time to be advised of your rights, or at least advised of these proceedings, and of certain rights that you have in respect to them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The court then appointed the necessary physicians, fixed the date and time of the medical examination, and stated that \u2018 \u2018 Their reports will be rendered to the Court, and the hearing on those reports, and their testimony, will be set the following Wednesday, a week from today ... at which time you will have the opportunity to present evidence on your own behalf. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Next, to represent those persons (including petitioner) who had no private attorney, the court appointed the Public Defender \u201cto counsel and advise you concerning these proceedings, and we will take any necessary motions or otherwise in your behalf for your protection. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">The matter of waiver was then raised by the court as follows; 1 \u2018 Those of you who desire to go to the Center right away, waive your time of hearing and be off, on signing the appropriate waivers of time I can see that you are examined this afternoon by the doctors, and if they find you addicted I will have you on your way Friday with the other group that are going, that have already been examined, so those who want to waive their time of hearing and go immediately, raise your hands . . . and give your name to my clerk.1 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">Petitioner called out his name, and that afternoon the court reconvened and questioned him as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-11\">\u201cThe Court: Harry Cruz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-12\">\u201cMr. Cruz, this morning you were in here and you said that you felt possibly you were actually addicted, wanted to go to the rehabilitation program as soon as possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-13\">\u201cDo you still feel that way about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-14\">\u201cMr. Cruz: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-15\">11 The Court : Yon want to go right now ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-16\">\u201cMr. Cruz: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-17\">\u201cThe Court: During the recess there was shown you a written document, a waiver of various rights and notices. Did you read that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-18\">\u201cMr. Cruz: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-19\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court : Did you talk to the Public Defender about it ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-20\">\u201cMr. Cruz: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-21\">11 The Court : Counseled with him ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-22\">\u201cMr. Cruz: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-23\">\u201cThe Court: All right, you are still of the same mind, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>want to go right away, want to waive those time requirements ? If so, you can sign that waiver. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Petitioner apparently signed the waiver at that time. The court then asked the two physicians who had examined petitioner to give their findings. They testified that \u201cMr. Cruz is addicted to narcotics, and he would benefit by the rehabilitation program. \u2019\u2019 The physicians\u2019 certificate was filed at the same time, reciting petitioner\u2019s narcotics history and noting the fact that \u201cBoth arms show evidence of recent use.\u201d The court ruled that the waiver would be received into evidence, and committed petitioner to the rehabilitation program as a person addicted to narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Penal Code section 6507 declares that \u201cHearing may be waived by consent of the person sought to be committed, expressed in open court.\u201d In <em>In re Jones </em>(1964) <em>supra, </em>61 Cal.2d 325, 329-330 [4], we held in effect that although section 6507 is found in article 3 of chapter 11 of the narcotic addict commitment law (\u00a7\u00a7 6500-6510, dealing with \u201cpersons not charged with a crime\u201d), it should likewise be deemed applicable to commitment proceedings instituted\u2014as in the ease at bench\u2014pursuant to article 2 of that law (\u00a7\u00a7 6450-6454, dealing with \u201cpersons charged with a crime\u201d). We there observed (61 Cal.2d at p. 329, fn. 6) that \u201cthe Legislature does not consider narcotic addicts incompetent to voluntarily submit to treatment,\u201d and concluded that \u201cSince voluntary submission to commitment conserves the time and effort of the parties and the judiciary, such waiver, if properly made, should be facilitated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The question now to be determined comprehends recognizing the essentials of such a waiver and whether it was here \u201cproperly made.\u201d On the record in <em>Jones </em>we rejected as insufficient an alleged waiver on behalf of the person there committed. That person had been brought before the court without arraignment or notice, and had not personally requested\u2014indeed, had expressed opposition to\u2014commitment as a narcotics addict; in such circumstances we held that the acts of counsel in stipulating to the admission of certain alienists\u2019 reports and submitting the entire matter thereon were inadequate to constitute a waiver binding on his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Here, by contrast, the necessary elements of a valid waiver are present: i.e., (1) petitioner was first fully informed by the court of the nature and purpose of the commitment proceeding and of his rights therein; (2) an attorney was appointed to represent petitioner in this proceeding, and petitioner was given an opportunity to obtain his advice in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>regard to the proposed waiver ;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (3) a medical examination was conducted by court-appointed physicians to verify petitioner\u2019s addicted condition; and (4) thereafter the judge in open court questioned petitioner individually as to his desire to begin treatment as soon as possible, received from him the waiver set forth hereinabove, and took in evidence the testimony and report of the examining physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">No reason appears why this informed and limited waiver should not be given effect. We do not thereby retreat from our holdings in <em>In re Jones </em>(1964) <em>supra, </em>61 Cal.2d 325, 327 [1]-328 [3], or <em>In re Raner </em>(1963) <em>supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 635, 637 [1]-643 [6], establishing the principle of strict compliance with each of the statutory prerequisites for maintenance of these special proceedings; but we take this opportunity to commend a practice which, while fully protecting the rights of the individual, permits the start of treatment and rehabilitation to be expedited in uneontested commitment cases and thus \u201cconserves the time and effort of the parties and the judiciary\u201d <em>(In re Jones </em>(1964) <em>supra, </em>61 Cal.2d 325, 329, fn. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Petitioner was committed to the California Rehabilitation Center on August 14, 1963; on December 13, 1963, he was transferred from the main California Rehabilitation Center facility at Corona to the branch facility located at California Men\u2019s Colony-East. He contends that his transfer to and current confinement in that branch amounts to \u201cimprisoning\u201d him \u201cas a criminal,\u201d and hence is unconstitutional under <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California </em>(1962) <em>supra, </em>370 U.S. 660, 667, as being \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d in violation of the Eighth Amendment (see <em>In re De La O </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 128, 134-137, 149-150 [13] [28 Cal.Rptr. 489, 378 P.2d 793]). Petitioner alleges that he is \u201choused among felons imprisoned for all types of offenses,\u201d and stresses the Legislature\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>declaration (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2046) that the California Men\u2019s Colony is \u201ca state prison for the confinement of males under the custody of the Director of Corrections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The contention is without merit here. The institutional heart of the addict rehabilitation program remains the California Rehabilitation Center facility at Corona. But that facility is, as it should be, a minimum security institution; as we observed in <em>In re De La O </em>(1963) <em>supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 128, 149 [13], the \u201cexternal indicia of criminality\u201d in this program are unfortunate and should be minimized wherever possible. The security problem may nonetheless be urgent, for at least two reasons. First, many of the persons committed as addicts have long records of petty lawbreaking (see Finestone, <em>Narcotics and Criminality </em>(1957) 22 Law &amp; Contemp. Prob. 69-79) and have manifested little respect for authority in any form. Second, the physical and psychological grip of narcotics addiction is so strong that at some point in the treatment process many addicts will tend to rebel and turn uncooperative, preferring in effect the known consolations they find in drug use to the unknown problems they fear having to face upon rehabilitation; yet if the program is to have any hope of long-term success it must remain compulsory, a fact statistically attested to by the high relapse rate of persons voluntarily committed to the federal narcotics hospitals (see Winick, <em>Narcotics Addiction and Its Treatment </em>(1957) 22 Law &amp; Contemp. Prob. 9, 23-25).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Under our statutory scheme the Director of Corrections bears the ultimate responsibility for maintaining security in the operation of the rehabilitation program while preserving its chances of success. For minor infractions, of course, customary institutional responses will often be sufficient: e.g., counseling by members of the facility staff, warning as to adverse effect on consideration for release to out-patient status, curtailment or loss of privileges. But in the unfortunate event that such pressures prove inadequate to resolve a difficult security problem, the Legislature has authorized the exercise of two further administrative controls. Penal Code section 6550 provides in relevant part: \u201cThere is hereby established an institution, <em>and branches thereof, </em>under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections, to be known as the California Rehabilitation Center. <em>Branches may be established in existing institutions of the Department of Corrections . .. </em>(Italics added.) Pursuant to this statutory authority the Director of Corrections has from time to time designated certain facilities of the Department of Corrections as branches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>of the main California Rehabilitation Center facility at Corona. One unit of California Men\u2019s Colony-Bast was thus designated on August 7, 1961; and on April 23, 1964, the entire East Facility of the Men\u2019s Colony was given such branch status.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Secondly, Penal Code section 6553 provides: \u201cThe Director of Corrections shall make rules and regulations for the government of the California Rehabilitation Center and the management of its affairs.\u201d Such authority obviously extends to the branches of the California Rehabilitation Center located in other facilities of the Department of Corrections (cf. Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5054, 5058). Pursuant thereto the Director of Corrections has established criteria for the transfer of persons (committed under this program) from the main California Rehabilitation Center facility at Corona to the branch at California Men\u2019s Colony-East.  In general, persons subject to transfer are those who do not \u201cdemonstrate sufficient internal controls to live in a minimum security open institution.\u201d In particular, such persons fall into four classes : (1) those who have continual serious adjustment problems ;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) those who are serious escape risks; (3) homosexuals who cannot adjust to the dormitory housing at the Corona facility; and (4) persons who jeopardize internal security by introduction of contraband or by dangerous \u201cacting out\u201d behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">The facts of the ease at bench demonstrate the practical wisdom of these arrangements. Petitioner\u2019s record at the Corona facility is a sad one, showing repeated failure to attend vocational classes, repeated refusal to perform routine work assignments, and repeated violation of institutional regulations. (See petitioner\u2019s central file, included as a certified exhibit to the People\u2019s return.) At first the authorities sought to deal with these infractions by applying such institutional pressures as counseling, admonishment, and reprimand. When \u2014and only when\u2014such methods failed to bring results, petitioner was ordered transferred to the branch facility at California Men\u2019s Colony-East. The reasons supporting that order are set forth as follows in petitioner\u2019s central file (see classification memorandum of December 12,1963) : \u201cSubject\u2019s behavior and attitude has deteriorated in the past few weeks. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Staff has tried with this Subject but Subject seems to be unwilling or unable to fully participate in CEO program. Subject has had several GDC 115s [i.e., violations of institutional rules], has been counselled, has been discussed in the community group, etc. Subject seems to be a young confused individual who finds it difficult to internalize controls and to function in the atmosphere of CEO. Subject received two GDC 115s in the period of less than two weeks, the last GDC 115 written being for being the \u2018delivery boy\u2019 of illegal letters to and from the Women\u2019s Unit. It is recommended that Subject be returned to CEO when he shows the ability to handle responsibility and has learned to internalize controls.\u201d Viewed in this light, the transfer of petitioner was a proper exercise of the authority of the Director of Corrections to maintain reasonable security in the operation of the narcotic addict rehabilitation program, and thereby more efficiently promote the potential benefits of the project for all inmates, including petitioner as his responses might ultimately permit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Equally unsupported by the facts is petitioner\u2019s further contention that the conditions of his confinement at California Men\u2019s Colony-East constitute \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d within the meaning of <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California </em>(1962) supra, 370 U.S. 660. It is true that the 46 addicts in that facility (see fn. 5, <em>ante) </em>are not housed apart from the other inmates, but the People explain that the decision not to segregate them was taken \u201cIn order to prevent internal security and management problems and to expose them to the normal actvities of the Facility . . . .\u201d More importantly, these addict inmates are offered a program of treatment and rehabilitation similar in all respects to that of the central facility at Corona: i.e., qualified counseling on a weekly basis in groups of less than 10 men, plus individual counseling when indicated; academic and vocational training, plus regular work assignments; recreational and religious facilities; and periodical progress evaluations with a view to retransfer to the central facility at Corona or direct release to out-patient status.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The record shows that each of these benefits has been made available to petitioner; and although he has thus far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>tended to maintain his uncooperative behavior pattern, his most recent progress review states that \u201cEfforts will be continued through individual counseling to help Cruz see himself as others see him. Hopefully some progress can be made in the areas of motivation and maturity. \u2019 \u2019 Nothing in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California </em>(1962) <em>supra, 370 </em>U.S. 660, forbids such special civil confin\u00e9ment for the treatment and rehabilitation of the individual addict and for the protection of society.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Petitioner (through his counsel) raises several further contentions which merit, at most, only brief discussion. He stresses the 1963 <em>(post-De La </em>O) declaration of legislative intent (Pen. Code, \u00a7 6399) to the effect that persons \u201cunresponsive to treatment nevertheless should be kept in the program for purposes of control. \u2019 \u2019 The full quotation of that statute, however, speaks of persons \u201cwho are <em>uncooperative with efforts to treat them </em>or are otherwise unresponsive to treatment <em>. . . </em>(Italics added.) We need not consider at this time whether such confinement could constitutionally be imposed on one who for <em>medical </em>reasons may be \u201cunresponsive to treatment\u201d;* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> here the certified exhibits (see petitioner\u2019s central file, <em>passim) </em>demonstrate that this petitioner was transferred to the Rehabilitation Center branch at California Men\u2019s Colony-East not because he was \u201cunresponsive to treatment\u201d in a medical sense, but simply because he was \u201cuncooperative with efforts to treat him\u201d and had created continuing security problems at the Corona facility. As shown hereinabove, resolution of such security problems is within the power and duty of the Director of Corrections as administrator in charge of this program, and the method here adopted by him, in the light of the facts, is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Petitioner also suggests that if the California Rehabilitation Center is not a \u201chospital\u201d as such, it must either be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>\u201cprison\u201d or violate the terms of Health and Safety Code section 11391.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The point is without merit. The present narcotic commitment legislation (Stats. 1961, ch. 850, amended Stats. 1963, ch. 1706) was enacted subsequent to Health and Safety Code section 11391 (in its original form, see Stats. 1929, eh. 216, \u00a7 2) and to this extent may be deemed to have superseded the earlier (and more general) statute. Manifestly the Legislature did not, by enacting section 11391, render itself impotent to create at a later date a new and specialized type of facility for \u201cthe receiving, control, confinement, employment, education, treatment and rehabilitation\u201d of persons addicted or in imminent danger of addiction to narcotics. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6400, 6551.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Petitioner was convicted (by plea of guilty) of a violation of Health and Safety Code section 11721, which at the time here relevant declared that no person \u201cshall use, or be under the influence of, or be addicted to the use of\u201d unauthorized narcotic drugs. He now argues that the statute under which he was committed (Pen. Code, \u00a7 6450, as it then read) deprived him of equal protection of the laws in that it granted the opportunity to demand a jury trial in the superior court on the issue of addiction to those persons committed to the program \u201cafter conviction of a misdemeanor <em>other than </em>a violation of Section 11721 of the Health and Safety Code.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This contention was considered and rejected in <em>In re De La O </em>(1963) <em>supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 128, 151-153 [15]. Petitioner seeks to distinguish <em>De La O </em>by pointing out that the defendant in that ease had been charged with unlawful use of <em>and addiction to </em>narcotics, whereas here the charge was unlawful use and being under the influence of narcotics. But as we observed in <em>De La O </em>(at pp. 151-152 [15] of 59 Cal.2d), any of the acts prohibited by Health and Safety Code section 11721 \u201care important (for the procedures contemplated by Penal Code section 6450) simply as being preliminarily or tentatively indicative of a condition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>defendant; i.e., a condition which appears to be primarily one of illness rather than criminality ....</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">\u201cObviously, one who has been convicted of violating (in California) Health and Safety Code section 11721, on any tenable interpretation of its language, has at least demonstrated some history of illegal narcotics use. As a basis for consideration for the civil and remedial procedures delineated by section 6450, conviction of any violation of section 11721 is sufficient. These benefits are potentially open to all persons on the same tests, and there is no denial here of equal protection of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Petitioner attacks his underlying conviction of violating Health and Safety Code section 11721 on the ground that although he was under 21 years of age at the time (he was 18 or 19) the court neither notified his parent or guardian nor appointed counsel to represent him; that inaction, petitioner asserts, was \u201ccontrary to the mandate of Penal Code Section 858 . . . .\u201d Such a contention, of course, should have been raised by appeal from the judgment of conviction of violating Health and Safety Code section 11721, and in any event is devoid of merit. Penal Code section 858 requires the court to notify the defendant\u2019s parent or guardian or to appoint counsel only \u201cIf it appears that the defendant may be a minor,\u201d in which event \u201cthe magistrate shall ascertain whether such is the case . . . . \u201d Here there is no showing that the magistrate in the misdemeanor proceeding had before him any facts from which it should have \u201cappeared\u201d to him that \u201cthe defendant may be a minor.\u201d In the absence of such facts it was not improper for the magistrate to allow this defendant to waive counsel and plead guilty to a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Petitioner\u2019s further arguments are so devoid of merit<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as to require no discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">The order to show cause is discharged and the petition for habeas corpus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Traynor, C.

Mr. Ragins also told his clients that \"if they desired to contest their commitment, I would cross-examine the doctors and that they would have an opportunity to testify at their hearing, \u2019 <em>\u2019 </em>but that if they preferred to enter the program as quicldy as possible they would be allowed to waive the statutory time requirements. Finally, Mr. Ragins customarily advised \"any person who indicated any hesitancy to enter the program to follow the regularly established court procedure of later examination and hearing. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Indicative of the policy of retaining each such person in the more permissive atmosphere of the Corona facility if at all \u25a0 practicable, is the further directive that he may be transferred to California Men\u2019s Colony-East \"only when very careful efforts have been made to adjust him satisfactorily at this [Corona] facility ....\u2019\u2019 (See Criteria on Transferring CRC Cases to CMC-East, included as a certified exhibit to the People\u2019s return.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b344-6\">A perspective on the problem is gained by considering the fact that of the 1,388 male patients in the main California Rehabilitation Center facility and its various branches as of October 9, 1964, only 46 (or 3.3%) were confined in the branch located at California Men\u2019s Colony-East.
