We affirmed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 223 [32 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>424, 284 P.2d 16] ; cert den, 375 U.S. 994 [84 S.Ct. 634, 11 L.Ed.2d 480].)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Lopez\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus presents the question whether we must grant him a new trial because of the admission at trial of his statements allegedly obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel as delineated in the recent cases of <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 478 [84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977], and <em>Massiah </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1964) 377 U.S. 201 [84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246], even though the judgment against him became final before these cases were decided. The petitions for writs of habeas corpus by both Lopez and Winhoven present the question whether the commission of errors in the penalty trials similar to those condemned in <em>People </em>v. <em>Morse </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 631 [36 Cal.Rptr. 201, 388 P.2d 33], requires us to grant petitioners new penalty trials. We have concluded that the right to counsel as established in <em>Escobedo </em>and <em>Massiah </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral attack. We further conclude that we must afford petitioners new penalty trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Lopez and Winhoven were arrested in Bakersfield on August 30, 1960, on charges that they committed a burglary in that community. At that time the police also suspected them of perpetrating the Los Angeles robbery of July 29, 1960, in which a fatality had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The Attorney General concedes that \u201con September 15th or 16th the Los Angeles police and District Attorney\u2019s office arranged to have Robert Luna, who was being held on other criminal charges, placed in the Kern County Jail in the same cell as Lopez and report to the police any statements of Lopez pertinent to the murder then under investigation.\u201d The ruse worked; Lopez made several incriminating statements to Luna which also implicated Winhoven. On September 30th Luna wrote down the statements from memory. Upon return to Los Angeles County on September 30, 1960, under a warrant for their arrest issued September 26, 1960, defendants were arraigned on charges of murder. At the trial, Luna testified as to his conversation with Lopez; likewise, Luna\u2019s memorandum concerning the content of the conversation was read into the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Lopez argued on appeal that his alleged statements to Luna in the Bakersfield jail were admissions obtained by trickery, and that their use constituted a denial of due process. We held the statements admissible since there was \u201cno behavior by the State\u2019s law enforcement officers that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>overbore defendant\u2019s will to resist nor is there any indication that his admissions were anything but \u2018freely self-determined.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 223, 248 [32 Cal.Rptr. 424, 384 P.2d 16.].) We further held that Lopez could not challenge the reading into the record of Luna\u2019s notes since he had not objected to this evidence at the trial. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 249.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Lopez now contends that in view of the two above cited decisions of the United States Supreme Court, which were rendered after the final determination of his ease, the introduction of the evidence concerning his incriminating statements to Luna wrongfully deprived him of his constitutional right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">In the first of these cases, <em>Massiah </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1964) 377 U.S. 201 [84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246], a codefendant, in cooperation with federal agents, elicited from the defendant incriminating statements which were communicated by a radio transmitter to the police. The defendant had already been indicted and was represented by counsel. The United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe petitioner was denied the basic protections of [the Sixth Amendment] . . . guarantee when there was used against him at his trial evidence of his own incriminating words, which federal agents had deliberately elicited from him after he had been indicted and in the absence of his counsel.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">In the second of the eases, <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 478 [84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977], the Supreme Court extended the right to counsel to the preindictment interrogation stage, holding that \u201cwhere . . . the investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect, the suspect has been taken into police custody, the police carry out a process of interrogations that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements, the suspect has requested and been denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, and the police have not effectively warned him of his absolute constitutional right to remain silent, the accused has been denied \u2018 the Assistance of Counsel \u2019 in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution as \u2018made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, \u2019 . . . and that no statement elicited by the police during the interrogation may be used against him at a criminal trial. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 490-491.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">We have held today in <em>People v. Dorado </em>(1965) <em>ante, </em>p. 338 [42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 398 P.2d 361] that a defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>confession could not properly be introduced into evidence if (1) the investigation was no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but had begun to focus on a particular suspect, (2) the suspect was in custody, (3) the authorities had carried out a process of interrogations that lent itself to eliciting incriminating statements, (4) the authorities had not effectively informed defendant of Ms right to counsel or of his absolute right to remain silent, and no evidence established that he had waived these rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\"> Whether or not Lopez\u2019s incriminating statements were improperly admitted either under <em>Massiah </em>or under <em>Escobedo </em>and <em>Dorado, </em>we hold that <em>Massiah </em>may not serve as the basis for collateral attack upon judgments which have become final before the date upon which the United States Supreme Court rendered that decision, nor may <em>Escobedo </em>or <em>Dorado </em>be applied to eases which have become final prior to the date that the United States Supreme Court rendered the <em>Escobedo </em>decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">We reach this conclusion upon the basis of the three following propositions which we shall more fully analyze hereinafter : First, although the United States Supreme Court in <em>Escobedo, </em>by providing a suspect with an opportunity to obtain the protection of counsel at the accusatory stage, sought to eliminate conditions which invited coerced confessions, the ruling does not require a retroactive application.  Second, new interpretations of constitutional rights have been, and should be, applied retroactively only in those situations in which such new rules protect the innocent defendant against the possibility of conviction of a crime he did not commit; the fact that defendant was denied counsel under <em>Escobedo </em>does not affect the issue of guilt. Third, an absolute rule of retro-activity as to interpretations of constitutional rights which envisage the correction of future practices would impair the administration of criminal law and ultimately result in constitutional rigidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Turning to the first proposition, we believe that the United States Supreme Court in <em>Escobedo </em>sought primarily to prevent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>police tactics which, in the past, have spawned involuntary confessions. The court has concluded that presence of counsel would go far to eradicate such tactics. As a means to that end it held that, if the opportunity to procure such counsel had been denied, the confession or incriminating statement procured by the police should not be introduced into evidence. Thus the rule contemplated the prospective prevention of coercive practices\u2014not the extirpation of such practices committed in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The words of the United States Supreme Court, written by Mr. Justice Goldberg, announce the philosophy of the holding of <em>Escobedo-. </em>\u201cWe have learned the lesson of history, ancient and modern, that a system of criminal law enforcement which comes to depend on the \u2018confession\u2019 will, in the long run, be less reliable and more subject to abuses than a system which depends on extrinsic evidence independently secured through skillful investigation. As Dean Wigmore so wisely said: \u2018 <em>[A]ny system of administration which permits the prosecution to trust habitually to compulsory self-disclosure as a source of proof must itself suffer morally thereby. </em>The inclination develops to rely mainly upon such evidence, and to be satisfied with an incomplete investigation of the other sources. .. . The simple and peaceful process of questioning breeds a readiness to resort to bullying and to physical force and torture. If there is a right to an answer, there soon seems to be a right to the expected answer,\u2014that is, to a confession of guilt. . . .\u2019 (8 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940) 309.) (Emphasis in original.) This Court also has recognized that \u2018history amply shows that confessions have often been extorted to save law enforcement officials the trouble and effort of obtaining valid and independent evidence. . . .\u2019 <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>373 U.S. 503, 519 [83 S.Ct. 1336, 10 L.Ed.2d 513].\u201d (378 U.S. at pp. 488-490.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Likewise, the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice White, in which Justices Clark and Stewart joined, recognizes that the objective of the majority was the prevention of practices that might lead to coerced confessions: \u201cThis new American judge\u2019s rule, which is to be applied in both federal and state courts, is perhaps thought to be a necessary safeguard against the possibility of extorted confessions.\u201d (378 U.S. at p. 498.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Indeed four of the justices who joined the majority in <em>Escobedo </em>had previously urged that the only effective antidote to abusive police tactics and extorted confessions was the presence of counsel for the accused. In his dissenting opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>in <em>Crooker </em>v. <em>California </em>(1958) 357 U.S. 433, 441 [78 S.Ct. 1287, 2 L.Ed.2d 1448], in which Mr. Chief Justice Warren and Justices Black and Brennan joined, Mr. Justice Douglas said, \u201cThe third degree flourishes only in secrecy. One who feels the need of a lawyer and asks for one is asking for some protection which the law can give him against a coerced confession.\u201d (See also <em>Cicenia </em>v. <em>Lagay </em>(1958) 357 U.S. 504, 511 [78 S.Ct. 1297, 2 L.Ed.2d 1523] (Douglas, J., dissenting).) Mr. Justice Black, dissenting in <em>In re Groban </em>(1957) 352 U.S. 330, 342-343 [77 S.Ct. 510, 1 L.Ed.2d 376], stated, \u201cNothing would be better calculated to prevent misuse of official power in dealing with a witness or suspect than the scrutiny of his lawyer or friends or even of disinterested bystanders.\u201d (See also <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1948) 332 U.S. 596, 605-606 [68 S.Ct. 302, 92 L.Ed. 234] (Frankfurter, J., concurring) ; <em>Spano </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1959) 360 U.S. 315, 324 [79 S.Ct. 1202, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265] (Douglas, J., concurring.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The resolution of the court in <em>Escobedo </em>to sterilize the police antechamber from the use of coercive tactics undoubtedly resulted from the realization of the inadequacy of present methods of dealing with involuntary confessions. The mere rejection of such confessions from evidence has not prevented police overreaching. Studies have shown that questionable tactics to obtain confessions or admissions continue on a widespread basis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The very difficulty of detecting the coercion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>might occur during police interrogation* *3<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5and the vagueness of the applicable standards for such determination<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> have been adverse factors necessitating a new approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Thus the court in <em>Escobedo </em>sought the correction of the <em>conditions </em>which invited the coerced confessions and the attendant evils.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But the new rule need not reach back to eradicate an environment entombed in the past; if that environment did produce the evil fruit of the coerced confession we may trust that the process of trial, despite the difficulties, disclosed it. We cannot say that the possibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>abuse in the past is such that the <em>voluntary </em>statement then elicited must now be exorcised.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Second, unlike other rulings of the United States Supreme Court dealing with new interpretations of the Constitution, the <em>Escobedo </em>rule does not automatically call for retroactive application in order to correct past convictions of innocent defendants. Whatever the inadequacies of our prior procedures, we do not believe that they carried a substantial risk of the conviction of an innocent person because of the use in evidence of his voluntary statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Without discussion, the United States Supreme Court has applied retroactively on collateral attack its decisions requiring procedural fairness at criminal proceedings that vindicated an indigent\u2019s right to counsel at trial* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and on appeal,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that guaranteed an indigent\u2019s right to a transcript of the trial,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that imposed more stringent standards for determining the voluntariness of confessions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Without counsel, a defendant unskilled in trial technique might not be able properly to establish his innocence at the trial. <em>(Powell v. Alabama </em>(1932) 287 U.S. 45, 68-69 [53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158, 84 A.L.R. 527] ; <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 335, 344-345 [83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, 93 A.L.R.2d 733].) Without a transcript a defendant could not obtain an adequate appellate review of alleged errors at the trial which might be prejudicial. <em>(Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1956) 351 U.S. 12, 16 [76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891, 55 A.L.R.2d 1055].) The involuntary confession, always potentially unreliable, could result in the conviction of the guiltless defendant. <em>(In re Harris </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 879, 886 [16 Cal.Rptr. 889, 366 P.2d 305] (Traynor, J., concur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>ring).)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To reject the retroactivity of the above constitutional rights would be to sanction the continued incarceration of a defendant despite errors at the trial which, upon correction, could well establish his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The <em>Escobedo </em>rule did not, however, emanate from the inherent unreliability of the confessions introduced in the trials of the past or from the uncertainty of the guilt of those who had thus confessed; it emerged from the belief that secret interrogation was the source of coercion, that the opportunity for the presence of counsel would end the secrecy and that the exclusion of the confession obtained without such opportunity would deter those tactics. The court sought to discourage oppressive police practices; it did not seek to undo the procedures of yesterday, which despite their undesirability did not necessarily cause the conviction of the innocent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The same considerations which induce the denial of a retrospective application of the rule against the introduction of illegally seized evidence support a similar result here. The chief purpose of the rule in <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1961) 367 U.S. 643 [81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081, 84 A.L.R.2d 933], was to preclude police conduct which ignored \u2018 \u2018 the right to privacy embodied in the Fourth Amendment\u201d and to make certain that \u201cthe right to be secure against rude invasions of privacy by state officers ... no longer . . . remain[ed] an empty promise.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 660.) Although all courts do not agree, many have held that <em>Mapp </em>cannot be the basis for collateral attack on final judgments because the purpose of elevating the exclusion of illegally procured evidence to a constitutional requirement lies in deterring unconstitutional police searches.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, since the admission of illegally obtained evidence does not infect the trial of the particular individual with unfairness, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>since deterrence operates prospectively only, the purpose of <em>Mapp </em>would not be served by retroactive application.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">To use the words of Judge Medina in <em>United States </em>ex rel. <em>Angelet </em>v. <em>Fay </em>(1964) 333 F.2d 12, 19, \u201c.. . the new exclusionary principle does not arise out of any claim that the evidence that was admitted is untrustworthy or that the trial was tainted by some fundamental unfairness in regard to the interests of the particular defendant.\u201d Or as Chief Justice Traynor has stated, \u201cIt is not the purpose of the exclusionary rule to protect the guilty. Its purpose of deterring lawless law enforcement will be amply served in any state from now on by affording defendants an orderly procedure for challenging the admissibility of the evidence at or before trial and on appeal.\u201d <em>(Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio at Large in the Fifty States </em>(1962) Duke L.J. 319, 341.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Likewise the role of <em>Escobedo </em>in deterring improper police conduct will not be served by retroactive application.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Third, a newly defined constitutional right which involves the correction of future practices rather than erroneous convictions of the past should not be subject to rigid retro-activity. We no longer subscribe to that \u201csplendid myth\u201d of Blaekstone that all constitutional interpretations are eternal verities that stretch backwards and forwards to infinity.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>(United States </em>ex rel. <em>Durocher </em>v. <em>LaVallee </em>(1964) 330 F.2d 303, 312; <em>United States </em>ex rel. <em>Angelet </em>v. <em>Fay </em>(1964) 333 F.2d 12, 15.) We Imow now that we must choose here between competing values; we must seek to preserve a dynamic concept of constitutional right rather than sacrifice it upon an unrealistic and destructive altar of absolutism.  As Justice Cardozo, in upholding the constitutionality of prospective overrulings by state courts, said, <em>\u201cA </em>state in defining the limits of adherence to precedent may make a choice for itself between the principle of forward operation and that of relation backward. It may say that decisions of its highest court, though later overruled, are law none the less for intermediate transactions. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co. </em>(1932) 287 U.S. 358, 364 [53 S.Ct. 145, 77 L.Ed. 360, 85 A.L.R. 254].)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Indeed some recent judicial opinions have maintained that it is \u201cgenerally undesirable to give retroactive effect to overruling decisions, except in the most compelling circumstances. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(United States </em>ex rel. <em>Angelet </em>v. <em>Fay </em>(1964) 333 F.2d 12, 21; <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>(1964) 235 F.Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>526.) This court has explicitly recognized that in certain situations a decision should not be given retroactive effect. <em>(Forster Shipbuilding Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 450 [6 Cal.Rptr. 24, 353 P.2d 736]; <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Faus </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 672 [312 P.2d 680].)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Courts, in some instances, have refused to apply retroactively a new legal ruling to criminal defendants who were convicted under a prior decision or statute subsequently disapproved. In <em>Warring </em>v. <em>Colpoys </em>(1941) 122 F.2d 642, 646-647 (Vinson, J., cert. den. (1941) 314 U.S. 678 [62 S.Ct. 184, 86 L.Ed. 543]) a prisoner sought release upon a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the decision interpreting a federal contempt statute under which he had been convicted had been overruled. In refusing to grant the writ the court stated that the considerations that \u201cshould guide the lawmakers and the lawappliers in making their determinations in respect of whether a change in the law is to be effective only for the future or also for the past . . . should be applicable to both sides of a potential litigation, civil or criminal. ...\u201d Courts have refused to apply the <em>Jencks </em>rule <em>(Jencks </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 353 U.S. 657 [77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103]) retroactively on collateral attack. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Gandia </em>(1958) 255 F.2d 454.) In <em>Durham </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1954) 214 F.2d 862, in which the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia announced a new rule for the determination of insanity in criminal cases, the court said, \u201c [I]n adopting a new test, we invoke our inherent power to make the change prospectively.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 874.) In <em>Shioutakon </em>v. <em>District of Columbia </em>(1956) 236 F.2d 666, the court, in holding that under a statute a judge in a juvenile court must inform the juveniles of their right to counsel, applied its decision prospectively.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Petitioner argues that because we deal with a constitutional protection we must apply it retroactively on collateral attack. In refusing to apply <em>Mapp </em>retroactively, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit met that argument as follows: \u201c It is pointed out that where constitutional rights are violated prejudice is presumed. It is our view, however, that the development of constitutional law calls into play precisely the same operations of the judicial process as does the development of a body of decisional law in any other field. The extent to which the new doctrine is to be applied should depend, in the language of Mr. Justice Cardozo, upon \u2018considerations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>of convenience, of utility, and of the deepest sentiments of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>(United States </em>ex rel. <em>Angelet </em>v. <em>Fay </em>(1964) 333 F.2d 12, 16.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Nor can we overlook the further consideration that retroactivity would impose impossible burdens upon the administration of criminal justice. Unlimited retroactive application of <em>Escobedo </em>would result in the reconsideration of countless cases that were correctly decided under the law in force at the time of trial; in many such cases witnesses and evidence would no longer be available. Many hardened and dangerous criminals would glean the greatest profit from unlimited retroactivity; they serve lengthy sentences imposed long ago; their cases thus offer the least likelihood of successful retrial. To require a general release of prisoners of undoubted guilt would be to cripple the orderly administration \u2022 of the criminal laws. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sobell </em>(1963) 314 F.2d 314, 323, fn. 6, 324 (Friendly, J.) ; <em>United States </em>ex rel. <em>Durocher </em>v. <em>LaVallee </em>(1964) 330 F.2d 303, 314, 315 (concurring and dissenting opinions); <em>United States </em>ex rel. <em>Angelet </em>v. <em>Fay </em>(1964) 333 F.2d 12, 20-21.)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>A ruling that <em>Escobedo </em>compelled retroactive collateral attack could well impede further developments in constitutional law. The absolute application of new interpretations, which on the surface appears as an instrument of fair play, in reality may stand as a formidable barrier to a dynamic application of constitutional standards. If every change must ipso facto be applied to all prior proceedings, no matter how ancient, future change may be put in jeopardy. (See <em>United States </em>ex rel. <em>Angelet </em>v. <em>Fay </em>(1964) 333 F.2d 12, 20-21; Freund, <em>New Vistas in Constitutional Law </em>(1964) 112 U.Pa.
