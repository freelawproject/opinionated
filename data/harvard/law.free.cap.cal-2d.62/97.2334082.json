Bailey. \u2019 <em>\u2019</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b126-12\">PEEK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATd\">In this appeal by Allstate Insurance Company, the question is whether respondent Mission Insurance Company is liable under its nonowner or operator\u2019s policy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>liability insurance issued to Jasper L. Bailey at the time Bailey negligently operated an automobile registered in the name of a joint venture of which he was one of the partners. We hold that such derivative ownership interest by Bailey in the accident vehicle did not invalidate his nonowner\u2019s policy and relieve Mission of liability under that policy. Since Bailey was not uninsured at the time of the accident, the trial court erred in determining that Allstate was liable under the uninsured motorist clause in a liability policy which covered the victims of the accident, Florence Feldt and Vincent Gandolfo.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The action arose when Mission sought a declaration of non-liability against its insured, Bailey, and the accident victims, Feldt and Gandolfo. The injured parties cross-complained against Bailey, his insurance carrier, Mission, and also joined Allstate as the carrier of the uninsured motorist coverage which protected them in the event Bailey was not insured. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.2.) Bailey was subsequently dismissed as a cross-defendant and did not appear on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Bailey\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended for a number of years for failure to satisfy a judgment against him. Near the end of the period of suspension in order to secure a license he took steps to furnish proof of financial responsibility for any accidents he might be involved in, as required by the Vehicle Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since Bailey did not own a vehicle for which an owner\u2019s policy could be issued,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he applied for an operator\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The agent who placed Bailey\u2019s policy indicated in his testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>mony at trial that registration was the sole criterion in determining the type of policy issued, so that an \u201cunownership\u201d policy was issued unless the applicant had vehicles registered in his name. As issued to Bailey, Mission\u2019s policy recited: \u201cThe insurance does not apply: (a) As respects the named insured, to any automobile <em>owned by </em>the named insured. . . . \u201d (Italics added.) Mission then filed with the Department of Motor Vehicles the official form SR 22, \u201cCalifornia Financial Responsibility Insurance Certificate,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the department reinstated Bailey\u2019s driver\u2019s license. As issued by the department Bailey\u2019s license allowed him to operate only vehicles not owned or registered in his name. A department official explained in his testimony that the limitation on Bailey\u2019s license \u201crestricted him to operating vehicles not registered in his name. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">A few months after his driver\u2019s license was reinstated Bailey and another individual, Frank Johnson, made plans to form a joint venture to hook dance hands. They purchased a station wagon to transport the musicians and registered it with the department in the name of \u201cJ &amp; B Enterprises.\u201d There was no indication on the application for registration that Bailey had any ownership interest in the vehicle. Bailey furnished the major portion of the down payment, although Johnson signed the contract with the financing bank. Even though J &amp; B Enterprises did not actually engage in business, apparently Johnson retained some use and control over the station wagon. However the vehicle was used principally by Bailey for his personal affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Because there is no question that Bailey was responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>for the injuries to Feldt and Gandolfo, Mission and Allstate stipulated that the damages are payable by one of them according to whether the owner exclusion in the Mission policy was applicable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In determining whether the station wagon was owned by Bailey within the meaning of the Mission policy and the statutes governing the terms of that policy (see <em>Wisdom </em>v. <em>Eagle Star Ins. Co., </em>211 Cal.App.2d 602, 604 [27 Cal.Rptr. 599]), we note that \u201cthe <em>entire </em>automobile financial responsibility law must be liberally construed to foster its main objective of giving \u2018monetary protection to that everchanging and tragically large group of persons who while lawfully using the highways themselves suffer grave injury through the negligent use of those highways by others\u2019 \u201d <em>(Interinsurance Exchange </em>v. <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., </em>58 Cal.2d 142, 153 [23 Cal.Rptr. 592, 373 P.2d 640]). Also, we view the question before us as if the Mission policy were the only insurance available to compensate for Bailey\u2019s negligent acts. Section 16371 provides that driving privileges shall not be restored until judgment debtors such as Bailey give proof of ability to respond in damages. Mission certified Bailey to the department as able to so respond for negligently caused harm, and thus we must first look to the terms of its policy and the statutes governing the meaning of the provisions in that operator\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">As previously noted an individual in Bailey\u2019s situation is required to furnish proof of ability to respond in damages and must secure either an owner\u2019s policy as provided by section 16451, an operator\u2019s policy as prescribed by section 16452, or a policy satisfying both such sections. The operator\u2019s license so issued is restricted according to the type of certificate of insurance filed with the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">It is a further statutory requirement that \u201cUnless the certificate or certificates filed with the department evidencing the issuance of a motor vehicle liability policy show that the person in whose behalf they are filed is covered in the operation of all vehicles <em>registered in his name, and any motor vehicle not owned or registered in his name, </em>the department shall place an appropriate restriction\u201d on his driver\u2019s license (\u00a7 16456). (Italics added.) This latter section explicitly makes registration the sole criterion for the ownership category, and since to obtain a license an individual must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>come within the ownership category or the operator\u2019s category, the phrase \u201cnot owned or registered\u201d must have reference to operator\u2019s coverage alone. The words \u201cnot owned\u201d in that phrase thus must be understood to he the equivalent of \u201cnot registered,\u201d since anything less than registered ownership must place an individual in the operator\u2019s category. Section 16456 also must be deemed to cause the phrase \u201cnot <em>owned </em>by him\u201d in section 16452, which italicized word was that used in the exclusion in the Mission policy, to mean \u201cnot <em>registered </em>to him.\u201d In the instant context, then, ownership is deemed to be registered ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Although there is some ambiguity in the department\u2019s instructions for the filing of form SR 22 <em>{supra, </em>fn. 4), its instructions to certifying carriers appear to be in accord with the foregoing interpretation of the applicable statutes. A contrary interpretation would leave a gap in the insurance protection afforded the public whenever persons in Bailey\u2019s status operate a vehicle in which they have some interest less than registered ownership. (See <em>Van Erem </em>v. <em>Dairyland Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1958) 5 Wis.2d 450 [93 N.W.2d 511, 513-514].) There is no indication in the overall statutory scheme that our Legislature intended any such hiatus in coverage. (See Veh. Code, div. 7, chs. 2, 3. )</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Thus even though Bailey had an ownership interest in the station wagon through his participation in the joint venture (see Corp. Code, \u00a7 15025), since the vehicle was registered in the name of J &amp; B Enterprises rather than in his name it was not a vehicle owned by him within the terms of Mission\u2019s nonowner coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Our present determination is similar to that in <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Armendariz, </em>224 Cal.App.2d 56 [36 Cal.Rptr. 274], where a carrier issued an operator\u2019s policy to a young driver who had an equitable interest in the vehicle which he was operating at the time of the accident. The vehicle was registered in his father\u2019s name, although the hoy supplied the downpayment. It was held that \u201cin the absence of fraud or a clear misrepresentation\u201d it was not intended that an insurer might be excused from liability under an operator\u2019s policy \u201cby merely showing that the insured may possibly have some equitable interest in the vehicle involved and accordingly he becomes an owner thereof\u201d within the meaning of section 16452. (See 224 Cal.App.2d at pp. 64-65; accord <em>Indiana Lumbermens Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Parton </em>(D.C.M.D. N.C. 1957) 147 F.Supp. 887, 889-890.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Respondent Mission argues that construing its policy to cover Bailey\u2019s instant negligence amounts to a circumvention of the licensing law, since he was at least <em>an </em>owner of the station wagon and his license restricted him from operating vehicles which he owned. But it does not appear to have been the intent of the applicable statutes <em>or of </em>the department to restrict Bailey from owning a car or operating a vehicle which he owned so long as the vehicle was insured. He was issued a restricted license merely because he was not the registered owner of a vehicle for which he might secure the proof of insurance necessary to be issued an unrestricted license.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is no showing that Bailey attempted to perpetrate a fraud upon the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The judgment against Allstate Insurance Company is reversed, and the trial court is directed to enter judgment against respondent Mission Insurance Company.

It is apparent that the Legislature intended to provide full liability insurance coverage for an individual required to furnish proof of ability to respond in damages as a condition for issuance of a driver\u2019s license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b127-11\">It is prescribed by section 16451 that: \u201cAn owner\u2019s policy of liability insurance shall: (a) Designate by explicit description or by appropriate reference all motor vehicles with respect to which coverage is thereby intended to be granted. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b127-13\">Section 16452 states: \u201cAn operator\u2019s policy of liability insurance shall insure the person named as insured therein against loss from the liability imposed on him by law for damages arising out of <em>use </em>by him of any motor vehicle <em>not owned by him. </em>...\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Form SB 22 as used herein has two boxes on its face to be cheeked by the carrier following its statement that a motor vehicle liability policy has been placed in force.
