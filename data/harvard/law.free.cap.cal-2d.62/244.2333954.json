(hereinafter referred to as Pipe Lines). The barge lines claimed that Pipe Lines was charging unreasonably low rates for transporting petroleum products from San Francisco Bay Area refining points to Stockton, Sacramento, and Chico.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The commission found that the rates charged by Pipe Lines were not unreasonable and denied the barge lines any relief. By petition for writ of review, the barge lines claim that the commission erred in determining that section 727 of the Public Utilities Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had no application to the instant proceedings<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the commission abused its discretion in failing to establish minimum rates under section 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Section 726 provides: . . In any rate proceeding where more than one type or class of <em>carrier, as defined in this part [\u00a7\u00a7201-2113, known as the Public Utilities Act], or in the Highway Carriers\u2019 Act </em>[\u00a7\u00a7 3501-3812], is involved, the commission shall consider all such types or classes of carriers, and, pursuant to the provisions of this part or the Highway Carriers\u2019 Act, <em>fix as minimum, rates </em>applicable to all such types or classes of carriers <em>the lowest of the lawful rates so determined for any such type or class of carrier. This provision does not prevent the commission from granting to carriers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>by water such differentials in rates as are permitted under other provisions of law.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Section 727 states: \u201cIt is the policy of the State that the use of all waterways, ports, and harbors of this State shall be encouraged, and to that end <em>the commission is \u00bfErected in the establishment of rates for water carriers </em>applying to business moving between points within this State <em>to fix those rates at such a differential under the rates of competing land carriers </em>that the water carriers shall be able fairly to compete for such business. In fixing the rates there shall be taken into consideration quality and regularity of service and class and speed of vessels. <em>\u2018Competing land carriers\u2019 includes all land carriers as defined in this </em>part, <em>and includes a highway contract carrier and a radial highway common carrier as defined in the Highway Carriers\u2019 Act.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Notwithstanding the assumption in sections 726 and 727 that the Public Utilities Act or the Highway Carriers\u2019 Act contains definitions for the terms \u201ccarriers\u201d and \u201cland carriers, \u2019 \u2019 definitions are not found in either of the acts. That omission, however, does not require us to ignore the terms. Unless effect is given to them, section 726, which relates solely to \u20181 carriers, \u2019 \u2019 would be rendered totally inoperative, an intent we cannot reasonably attribute to the Legislature. Accordingly, the term \u201ccarriers\u201d as used in section 726 should be interpreted in accordance with applicable principles of statutory construction.  It is obvious that the provisions of section 727 are directly related to those of section 726, and the term \u201ccarriers\u201d should be given the same meaning in both sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">A pipeline carrying petroleum products comes within the ordinary concept of a carrier. (See Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict. (3rd ed. 1961) p. 343; Black\u2019s Law Dict. (4th ed. 1951) p. 269; <em>Schmitt </em>v. <em>War Emergency Pipelines </em>(1949) 175 P.2d 335, 336; <em>State Tax Com. </em>v. <em>Petroleum Exploration </em>(1934) 253 Ky. 119 [68 S.W.2d 777, 779]; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Cumberland Pipe Line Co. </em>(1922) 193 Ky. 728 [237 S.W. 405, 408] ; <em>Giffin </em>v. <em>South West Pennsylvania Pipe Lines </em>(1896) 172 Pa. 580 [33 A. 578, 580].)  Moreover, statutes are to be interpreted to give a reasonable result consistent with the legislative purpose <em>(Kusior </em>v. <em>Silver </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 603, 620 [7 Cal.Rptr. 129, 354 P.2d 657]), and in furtherance of the purpose of the sections to regulate competition, a pipeline should be subject to the statutory regulation when it competes with other carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>The fact that pipelines are not included in the businesses specified as common carriers in section 211 is not determinative, for the term is not limited to enumerated businesses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Western Air Lines, Inc. </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 621, 639 [268 P.2d 723].)  Although pipelines were at one time specifically defined by statute as common carriers and the definition was repealed in 1953 subsequent to the adoption of sections 726 and 727 (Stats. 1913, ch. 327, p. 657; Stats. 1953, ch. 596, p. 1844), the repeal cannot be said to show a legislative intent to exclude pipelines from the operation of sections 726 and 727 since those sections use the term \u201ccarrier\u201d and not \u201ccommon carrier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Even though it appears that the provisions of sections 726 and 727 are applicable to the activities of Pipe Lines, it does not necessarily follow that the petitioning barge lines are entitled to relief in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The barge lines have not sought to obtain permission to reduce their rates to compete with Pipe Lines but have requested the commission to require Pipe Lines to raise its rates for the avowed purpose of encouraging competition.  Under section 727 the direction to the commission to fix rates so that water carriers will be able to compete fairly against land carriers, as we have seen, is applicable only to \u201cthe establishment of rates for water carriers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The language of the code section does not compel the commission to adjust the rates of land carriers in order to permit water carriers to compete. If we were to conclude that to encourage competition the commission was required to raise rates of competing land carriers where the costs of water carriers exceeded those of the land carriers, water carriers by engaging to transport any commodity could require land carriers to raise rates no matter how ill-equipped or inefficient the water carriers might be in transporting the commodity. Such a construction of the section would not only create an administrative aberration, but would be economically unsound at the expense of the consuming public, for land carriers would be deprived of the incentive to improve efficiency and to economize if competing water carriers were not similarly motivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Furthermore, a construction of section 727 to require the adjustment of the rates of land carriers for purposes of competition would be contrary to the policy set forth in section 726 where the minimum rate to be fixed by the commission is to be the \u201clowest of the lawful rates\u201d for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>carrier.  Although an exception to the provisions of section 726 is made for water carriers, the exception extends only to \u201cgranting to carriers by water such differentials in rates\u201d as are permitted by other provisions, and the exception does not extend to requiring land carriers to increase rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the commission, under section 727, need not and indeed cannot require land carriers to adjust their rates upward for the purpose of permitting water carriers to compete. The commission found that Pipe Lines\u2019 rates were not unreasonable, and we recognize no compulsion to reach a contrary conclusion.  As noted above, a majority of the commission, although concluding that section 727 was inapplicable, was unable to agree as to the reason for the inapplicability. Since the question is one of law and one of the reasons offered by the commissioners is valid, the inability to obtain a majority does not require annulment of the commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The commission\u2019s refusal to fix a minimum rate under section 726 did not constitute an abuse of discretion. The record shows that the barge lines sought relief under section 727 and did not request the commission to fix its minimum rate under section 726 until after the commission\u2019s decision herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The order of the commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Traynor, C. J., McOomb, J., Peters, J., Tobriner, J., Peek, J., and Burke, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-10\">AU section references herein are to the Public Utilities Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-11\">The commissioners were unable to agree as to the reason for the inapplicability of section 727. Two commissioners concluded that section 727 was inapplicable because Pipe Lines was not a <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>competing land carrier\u201d within the meaning of the section, and two other commissioners reasoned that the section is applicable only to proceedings to establish \u201crates for water carriers\u201d and that no such proceeding was involved. Each opinion reserved the question considered crucial by the other. The fifth member of the commission concluded in a dissenting opinion that section 727 was applicable and that the commission should determine whether the barge lines were entitled to relief under that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
