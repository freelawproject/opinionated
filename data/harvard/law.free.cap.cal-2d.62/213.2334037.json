J.</author>\n<p id=\"Amm\">Robert T. Fairbank appeals from a decree of final distribution of the estate of Mary Mason. The testatrix devised her home and most of its contents to Robert\u2019s mother if she outlived the testatrix and if not, then to Robert. Robert\u2019s mother predeceased the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Several years after executing her will, the testatrix became mentally incompetent, and the Security First National Bank was appointed guardian of her estate. With the approval of the court the guardian sold the testatrix' home and kept the proceeds of the sale, approximately $21,000, in a separate account. It spent all but $556.66 of this account to support the testatrix, who died without regaining competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The trial court decreed that there was a partial ademption of Robert\u2019s gift to the extent the proceeds from the sale of the testatrix \u2019 home were spent during the guardianship and therefore ordered that only the unexpended proceeds, $556.66, be distributed to him. It ordered distribution of the remainder of the estate, $6,808.08, to the residuary legatees, who are respondent Katherine McKenna, a friend of the testatrix, and eight nieces and nephews.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Robert contends that, in the absence of proof that the testatrix intended an ademption, he is entitled to have the specific gift to him satisfied, so far as estate assets permit, before distribution of any residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\u201c \u2018Ademption of a specific legacy is the extinction or withdrawal of a legacy in consequence of some act of the testator equivalent to its revocation, or clearly indicative of an intention to revoke. The ademption is effected by the extinction of the thing or fund bequeathed, or by a disposition of it subsequent to the will which prevents its passing by the will, from which an intention that the legacy should fail is presumed. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Estate of Goodfellow, </em>166 Cal. 409, 415 [137 P. 12], quoting from <em>Kramer </em>v. <em>Kramer </em>(5th Cir. 1912) 201 F. 248, 253 [119 C.C.A. 482].)  A change in the form of property subject to a specific testamentary gift will not effect an ademption in the absence of proof that the testator intended that the gift fail. <em>(Estate of </em>Stevens, 27 Cal.2d 108, 115-116 [162 P.2d 918]; <em>Estate of Moore, </em>135 Cal.App.2d 122, 130-134 [286 P.2d 939]; <em>Estate of MacDonald, </em>133 Cal.App.2d 43, 45, 48 [283 P.2d 271]; <em>Estate of McLaughlin, </em>97 Cal.App. 485, 489 [275 P. 875] ; see <em>Estate of Calori, </em>209 Cal.App.2d 711, 712 [26 Cal.Rptr. 281]; <em>Estate of Cline, </em>67 Cal.App.2d 800, 805-806 [155 P.2d 390]; 43 Cal.L.Rev. 151.) Accordingly, when the guardian of a mentally incompetent testator has sold property subject to a specific gift in his ward\u2019s will, the beneficiary is awarded the proceeds of the sale. (See <em>Wilmerton </em>v. <em>Wilmerton </em>(7th Cir. 1910) 176 F. 896 [100 C.C.A. 366, 28 L.R.A. N.S. 401]; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>387 Ill. 542 [56 N.E.2d 619]; <em>In re Estate of Bierstedt, </em>254 Iowa 772 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>[119 N.W.2d 234]; <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Gillespie, </em>338 <em>Mass. </em>278 [154 N.E.2d 906] ; <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Fullmer, </em>112 Ohio App. 140 [175 N.E. 2d 209]; <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>96 N.H. 216 [72 A.2d <em>497]; In re Cooper, </em>95 N.J.Eq. 210 [123 A. 45, 30 A.L.R 673]; 51 A.L.R.2d 770; 6 Page, Wills (3rd rev. ed. 1962) \u00a7 54.18, pp. 271-274. Contra <em>Matter of Ireland, </em>257 N.Y. 155 [177 N.E. 405] ; <em>Hoke </em>v. <em>Herman, </em>21 Pa. 301.)  The reasons for refusing to find an ademption upon the guardian\u2019s sale are: (1) The incompetent testator lacks intent to adeem (see <em>Wilmerton </em>v. <em>Wilmerton, supra, </em>176 F. at pp. 899-900) and the opportunity to avoid the effect of an ademption by making a new will. (See <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Gillespie, supra, </em>338 Mass, at p. 283; 74 Harv.L.Rev. 741, 745.) (2) A contrary rule would allow the guardian, by changing the form of guardianship property, to determine the distribution of the estate. (See <em>In re Cooper, supra, </em>95 N.J.Eq. at p. 213; <em>In re Estate of Bierstedt, supra, </em>254 Iowa at p. 778; 6 Page, Wills, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 273-274.)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Respondents contend, however, that when proceeds from the sale of specifically devised property have been consumed during guardianship, ademption necessarily occurs. We do not agree with this contention.  Although a specific testamentary gift is adeemed regardless of the testator\u2019s intention when the specific property has been disposed of <em>by the testator </em>and cannot be traced to other property in the estate (see Prob. Code, \u00a7 161, subd. (1); <em>Estate of Buck, </em>32 Cal.2d 372 [196 P.2d 769]; <em>Estate of Goodfellow, </em>166 Cal. 409 [137 P. 12]), or when <em>the testator </em>has placed the proceeds of such property in a fund bequeathed to another (see <em>Estate of Babb, </em>200 Cal. 252 [252 P. 1039]), it does not follow that there is an ademption when the specific property has been sold and the proceeds spent <em>by a guardian </em>during an incompetency from which the testator does not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">To permit such an ademption would allow the guardian to destroy his ward\u2019s testamentary plan even though the guardian was acting to protect the ward\u2019s economic interests. It is true, of course, that whenever it is necessary to dispose of the ward\u2019s assets to manage his estate properly and provide for his needs, his testamentary scheme may be adversely affected. Moreover, if there were no better alternative, we might be persuaded by the decisions from other jurisdictions holding that there is a <em>pro tanto </em>ademption to the extent that the proceeds of a sale of a specific gift have been used by the guardian for the care of an incompetent testator. (See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>387 Ill. 542 [56 N.E.2d 619]; <em>In re Estate of Bierstedt, </em>254 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Iowa 772 [119 N.W.2d 234]; <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Gillespie, </em>338 Mass. 278 [154 N.E.2d 906]; <em>Morse </em>v. Converse, 80 N.H. 24 [113 A. 214]; <em>In re Barrow\u2019s Estate, </em>103 Vt. 501 [156 A. 408]; 51 A.L.R.2d 770, 797.)  Although the Legislature has provided no specific alternative to cover this situation, it has set forth rules to govern the abatement of testamentary gifts when the assets of the estate are insufficient to satisfy them in full. (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 750-753.) We believe that those rules provide a better alternative than the rule of <em>pro tanto </em>ademption and that they therefore constitute an appropriate model for this court to adopt. <em>(Decorative Carpets, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization, </em>58 Cal.2d 252, 256 [23 Cal.Rptr. 589, 373 P.2d 637]; see also Model Probate Code, \u00a7 231 (Simes 1946).) Thus, expenses of guardianship during an incompeteney from which a testator does not recover are not substantially different from expenses and debts of a decedent\u2019s estate. Indeed, if guardianship expenses are not paid before the death of the incompetent, they become debts of his estate. It should make no difference in the distribution of an estate that a guardian rather than an executor paid those expenses, for it is no more the function of a guardian than it is of an executor to modify the decedent\u2019s testamentary plan. Accordingly, we adopt for the distribution of the estate in such a case the rules set forth in sections 750-753 of the Probate Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">When specifically devised property has been sold and the proceeds used to pay debts and expenses, the devisee may have his gift redeemed from the remainder of the estate. Section 753 of the Probate Code provides: \u201cWhen property given by will to persons other than the residuary devisees and legatees is sold for the payment of debts and expenses or family allowance, all the devisees and legatees must contribute according to their respective interests to the devisee or legatee whose devise or legacy has been sold, and the court, when distribution is made, must settle the amount of the several liabilities and decree the amount each person shall contribute, and reserve the same from his distributive share for the purpose of such contribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\u201c [T]he provision of section 753 that \u2018all the devisees and legatees must contribute according to <em>their respective interests </em>to the devisee or legatee whose devise or legacy\u2019 (italics added) has been appropriated to the payment of debts contemplates interest as measured by the class of the various devises and legacies (i.e., whether general or specific, etc.; [citation]). ...\u201d <em>(Estate of Stevens, </em>27 Cal.2d 108, 119 [162 P.2d 918].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Thus, the residuary legatees must contribute in full to satisfy Robert\u2019s specific gift (Prob. Code, \u00a7751), since the testatrix\u2019 will does not provide that her home is to be appropriated for the payment of debts and expenses. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 750.)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The decree is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">McComb, J., Peters, J., Tobriner, J., Peek, J., Mosk, J., and Burke, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The application of petitioner and respondent for a rehearing was denied February 10, 1965.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
