Specifically, father contends that DHS \u201cfailed to prove its factual allegations, and its failure to do so is dispositive and requires reversal.\u201d The state, for its part, concedes that \u201cthe juvenile court erred in concluding that DHS had proved the facts alleged in the petitions by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d and, for that reason, \u201cthe judgments should be reversed.\u201d We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Judgments reversed as to C.

R., reversed as to father; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-6\"> In one of the judgments, the juvenile court also took jurisdiction over E. R., who is not father\u2019s child. Given that father is not E. R.\u2019s parent or guardian, it appears to be uncontested that it was inappropriate for the court to assert jurisdiction over him as to father.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
