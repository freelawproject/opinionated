Because the claims here were not such actions, we reverse the attorney fees awards. We hold that a defendant\u2019s successful invocation of the governing documents as a defense does not entitle it to attorney fees if the claim was not brought to enforce those documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Appellants were residents and shareholders in respondent, a 317-unit apartment cooperative in Santa Monica. Because the apartment building was significantly damaged by the 1994 Northridge earthquake, respondent\u2019s shareholders undertook to renovate and repair the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">In December 2001, appellants each filed separate but identical complaints against respondent. In their complaints, appellants alleged that they were shareholders of respondent and holders of proprietary leases in the apartment cooperative operated by respondent as a common interest development within the meaning of section 1351, subdivision (c). Appellants contended that respondent notified them in 1997 that all residents must vacate their units for approximately one year while repairs and renovations occurred; respondent would pay for packing and relocation expenses; insurance would cover homeowners\u2019 dues and mortgage payments during the absence of the residents; and units would be repaired and renovated using materials and workmanship of the same quality as that which existed before the earthquake. Appellants alleged that they relied on respondent\u2019s statements in vacating their units; that their expenses were never reimbursed; and that they incurred damages exceeding $100,000. Appellants alleged that the promises were enforceable. Appellants did not allege that they were seeking to enforce the terms of their proprietary leases or the bylaws or other governing documents of respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Respondent demurred to the complaints on the ground that appellants had not relied upon any promise but had merely done what was required of all shareholders during reconstruction of the building: namely, move out. Respondent also argued that the terms of respondent\u2019s governing documents, which were binding on all shareholders, vested respondent\u2019s board of direc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>tors with responsibility for renovation and repairs, and limited appellants\u2019 remedies in the event of a dispute concerning the board\u2019s maintenance and repair of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Respondent specifically relied on the following provisions of its bylaws concerning earthquake damage: [|] \u201c13.01 Partial Destruction. In the event that Ocean Towers is partially damaged or destroyed as a result of fire, earthquake, flood or other hazard and such damage is of such magnitude that it may reasonably be repaired or restored within one hundred twenty (120) days after the occurrence of such damage or such damage is confined to not more than ten percent (10%) of the Apartments or such damage does not substantially interfere with the use and occupancy of at least ten percent (10%) of the Apartments, then the Board shall cause such damage to be rebuilt and repaired and the cost thereof, net of any insurance proceeds, shall be assessed against all Shareholders pro rata in the ratio set forth in Section 10.06; provided, however, in the case of the destruction of improvements which exceed the building standard, the Board shall only be obligated to rebuild and repair such damage to the building standard. [f] 13.02 Major Damage or Destruction. In the event of damage or destruction to the building which exceeds that set forth in 13.01 but where the cost of restoration is less than sixty percent (60%) of the fair market value of Ocean Towers (exclusive of value attributable to the land) prior to such damage or destruction, then the decision as to the restoration of the building shall be placed before the Shareholders at a meeting to be called by the Board within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of such destruction. If holders of a majority of the Shares concur, then the building shall be restored and the cost of such restoration, net of insurance proceeds, shall be assessed against all Shareholders pro rata . . . .\u201d Respondent also relied on provisions of appellants\u2019 proprietary leases that empowered respondent and its board with discretion concerning maintenance of the cooperative housing project; limited tenants\u2019 remedies to their rights as shareholders under respondent\u2019s articles and bylaws; and provided that no abatement of rent or other compensation be accorded tenants in connection with repairs or improvements to the project.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">On February 4, 2002, appellants filed first amended complaints that were identical in all material respects to the original complaints, except that they alleged promissory estoppel as the basis for seeking to enforce the promises. The trial court sustained respondent\u2019s demurrers to the amended complaints but granted appellants leave to amend within 10 days. The record does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>contain the trial court\u2019s written ruling or order, nor does it show the ground for the trial court\u2019s ruling sustaining the demurrers. Appellants did not amend their respective amended complaints but instead sought to dismiss them without prejudice after the 10-day period had expired. Respondent moved for dismissal of appellants\u2019 actions with prejudice and for entry of judgment, which motions the trial court granted. The judgments were entered on October 22, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Respondent filed motions for attorney fees pursuant to sections 1717 and 1354, subdivision (f). The trial court awarded respondent $15,000 in attorney fees pursuant to section 1354, subdivision (f) in each of appellants\u2019 actions. Appellants appealed the attorney fees awards, and the two appeals were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">An order granting or denying an award of attorney fees is generally reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard of review; however, the \u201c \u2018determination of whether the criteria for an award of attorney fees and costs have been met is a question of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1158, 1169 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 79], quoting <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 615, 621 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 388].) Respondent\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees under section 1354, subdivision (f) is a question of law requiring a de novo standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">B. <em>Attorney Fees Under </em>Section 1354, Subdivision (f)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">Section 1354 is part of the Davis-Stirling Act, which governs common interest developments in California. (\u00a7 1350 et seq.) Subdivision (f) of section 1354 provides: \u201cIn any action specified in subdivision (a) to enforce the governing documents, the prevailing party shall be awarded reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1354, subd. (f).) Subdivision (a) of section 1354 states that the covenants and restrictions set forth in an association\u2019s governing documents are binding upon and enforceable by the association and all owners of separate interests: \u201cThe covenants and restrictions in the declaration shall be enforceable equitable servitudes, unless unreasonable, and shall inure to the benefit of and bind all owners of separate interests in the development. Unless the declaration states otherwise, these servitudes may be enforced by any owner of a separate interest or by the association, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>by both.\u201d (\u00a7 1354, subd. (a).) \u201cGoverning documents\u201d are defined in section 1351, subdivision (j) as \u201cthe declaration and any other documents, such as by-laws, operating rules of the association, articles of incorporation, or articles of association, which govern the operation of the common interest development or association.\u201d (\u00a7 1351, subd. (j).)</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">C. <em>Trial Court\u2019s Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Although the record contains no statement by the trial court of its reason for sustaining the demurrers, the trial court expressly awarded attorney fees under section 1354, subdivision (f). Thus, we may infer that its orders sustaining the demurrers were based on respondent\u2019s governing documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The leases between appellants and respondent provided: \u201cIn the event of any action between the parties hereto seeking enforcement of any of the terms and conditions of this Lease, the prevailing party in such action shall be awarded, in addition to damages, injunctive and other relief, its reasonable costs and expenses, not limited to costs and reasonable attorney fees.\u201d We may also infer that by not awarding fees under section 1717, which provides for attorney fees pursuant to a contract, the trial court did not determine that there had been an \u201caction\u201d \u201cseeking enforcement\u201d of the lease. As this appeal only involves the application of section 1354, subdivision (f), we do not decide whether the leases and the attorney fees clauses in the leases may be applicable. We deal here only with a statute and not with a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">D. <em>Inapplicability of Section 1354, Subdivision (f)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Section 1354, subdivision (f) expressly limits the award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in an \u201caction ... to enforce the governing documents.\u201d Appellants\u2019 actions were not to \u201cenforce\u201d respondent\u2019s \u201cgoverning documents\u201d because the complaints and the amended complaints contained no claim based on a right or remedy under the governing documents. Instead, the claims were to enforce promises unrelated to the governing documents. Demurrers or other defenses asserting the governing documents do not constitute \u201caction[s] ... to enforce the governing documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Respondent argues that if a plaintiff attempts to frame an action as not enforcing the \u201cgoverning documents,\u201d but is in reality asserting a claim under the governing documents, a defendant who, in effect, enforces those documents by defeating the claim on the basis of the governing documents, may be deprived of attorney fees under section 1354, subdivision (f). Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>spondent is correct that plaintiff cannot avoid the attorney fees provisions if the essence of the claim falls within the enforcement of the governing documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Thus, in <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Fairway Oaks Homeowners Assn. </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 715 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 158] <em>(Kaplan), </em>the court affirmed an attorney fees award to a prevailing defendant pursuant to section 1354, subdivision (f), even though the amended complaint in that case did not purport to enforce the common interest development\u2019s governing documents. The plaintiffs in <em>Kaplan </em>sought to enforce their proxy and cumulative voting rights to elect association board members by initially filing a complaint alleging violations of both the association\u2019s bylaws and the Corporations Code. When the association demurred on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to pursue alternative dispute resolution as required by section 1354, subdivision (b), the plaintiffs amended their complaint to allege a breach of Corporations Code section 7616 as the sole cause of action. They specifically alleged that the articles and bylaws of the association provided for the right of the members to vote by proxy and attached those documents to the pleading. After the association prevailed at trial, the trial court granted the association\u2019s motion for attorney fees under section 1354, subdivision (f). The plaintiffs challenged the award on the ground that the sole theory of their amended complaint was a breach of the Corporations Code and that the action was not one \u201cto enforce the governing documents\u201d as required by section 1354, subdivision (f). The court of appeal affirmed the attorney fees award under section 1354, subdivision (f), reasoning that \u201c[t]he gist of the action, as revealed by the record, was to enforce the members\u2019 proxy and cumulative voting rights under the bylaws. ... [][]... [][] It was an adversarial action to enforce the governing documents and was designed to protect the members from allegedly improper action by the Association and preserve their rights to cumulative and proxy voting.\u201d <em>(Kaplan, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at pp. 720-721.) The court said that the bylaws are part of the governing documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Here, however, the \u201cgist\u201d of appellants\u2019 actions was not to enforce the governing documents. The actions, even if not meritorious, were based on an alleged promise unrelated to the governing documents. Although respondent\u2019s demurrer invoked the governing documents in order to defeat appellants\u2019 claims, section 1354, subdivision (f) does not authorize an award of attorney fees in this case. (Cf. <em>Exxess Electronixx v. Heger Realty Corp. </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 698 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 376] [prevailing on tort claim does not result in award of attorney fees under a contract providing for such fees in an action to enforce a contract].)</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In <em>Palmer v. Agee </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 377 [150 Cal.Rptr. 841], a tenant who successfully asserted section 789.5 as a defense in an unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>detainer action was awarded statutory attorney fees under former section 789.12,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which provided for the award for attorney fees to the prevailing party in an \u201caction arising out of Sections 789.5 to 789.22.\u201d In that case the court granted the tenant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the landlord had not complied with a 60-day written notice of termination requirement imposed by former section 789.5.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court concluded that the action did \u201carise\u201d out of Civil Code section 789.5, even though the tenant invoked the statute defensively. <em>Palmer v. Agee, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.3d 377, is distinguishable from the instant case because the statutory language authorizing attorney fees in that case was broader than the language in the instant case. The statute in that case authorized an attorney fees award in an \u201caction arising out of\u2019 the applicable statute. Here, the applicable statute provides for attorney fees to the prevailing party in \u201can action ... to enforce the governing documents.\u201d (\u00a7 1354, subd. (f).) Even if a defensive contention arises out of the statute,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it does not constitute \u201can action to enforce\u201d the governing documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The common understanding of an \u201caction to enforce\u201d is that it is a proceeding initiated by the filing of a claim. Thus, an action not only encompasses the complaint \u201cbut refers to the entire judicial proceeding at least through judgment and is generally considered synonymous with \u2018suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Nassif v. Municipal Court </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1294, 1298 [263 Cal.Rptr. 195]; see <em>Exxess Electronixx v. Heger Realty Corp., supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at p. 712, fn. 15.) Section 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure defines an \u201caction\u201d as follows: \u201cAn action is an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice by which one party prosecutes another for the declaration, enforcement, or protection of a right, the redress or prevention of a wrong, or the punishment of a public offense.\u201d Section 30 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: \u201cA civil action is prosecuted by one party against another for the declaration, enforcement or protection of a right, or the redress or prevention of a wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">An \u201caction to enforce\u201d does not refer to specific pleadings or steps within the action or a defense. Thus, a demurrer does not constitute \u201can action to enforce\u201d a right. A demurrer is a pleading that challenges the legal sufficiency of another pleading. <em>(People v. Hale </em>(1965) 232 Cal.App.2d 112, 120 [42 Cal.Rptr. 533].) \u201cThe function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of a pleading by raising questions of law.\u201d <em>(Salimi v. State Comp. Ins. Fund </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 216, 219 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 640]; see <em>Holiday Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1413, 1420 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 766].) A demurrer is not \u201cprosecuted\u201d against another (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 22, 30) and therefore is not an \u201caction to enforce.\u201d \u201c[A] \u2018defense\u2019 is \u2018[t]hat which is offered and alleged by the party <em>proceeded against in an action or suit, </em>as a reason in law or fact why the plaintiff should not recover or establish what he seeks[; ...[][] it is a] <em>response to the claims </em>of the other party, setting forth reasons why the claims should not be granted.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Exxess Electronixx v. Heger Realty Corp., supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at p. 712, fn. 15.) That the common meaning of \u201caction\u201d\u2014as in an \u201caction to enforce\u201d\u2014does not include procedural steps such as a demurrer or other defenses is illustrated by the following passage in an authoritative work: \u201cThe broad definition [of action] covers the following: (1) suits at law or in equity. [Citation.] (2) Certain adversary proceedings that take place during a probate proceeding. [Citation.] (3) Actions for declaratory relief. [Citations.] (4) Actions for divorce (dissolution of marriage). [Citation.]\u201d (3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1996) Actions, \u00a7 11, pp. 64-65.) There is nothing in this passage to suggest that a defensive matter raised by a demurrer is included in the term \u201caction.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">As the court said in <em>Exxess Electronixx v. Heger Realty Corp., supra, </em>64 Cal. App.4th at page 712, 75 Cal.Rptr.2d 376, which involved a lease provision, \u201c[u]nder any reasonable interpretation of the attorneys\u2019 fee provision, we cannot equate raising a \u2018defense\u2019 with bringing an \u2018action\u2019 or \u2018proceeding.\u2019 By asserting a defense to the cross-complaint, Heger Realty did not bring an action or proceeding to enforce the lease or declare rights under it.\u201d Similarly, here the defense of the governing documents by way of demurrer was not an \u201caction ... to enforce the governing documents.\u201d Moreover, respondent\u2019s position that a demurrer is an \u201caction,\u201d if carried to its logical conclusion, would have the anomalous consequence that if respondent\u2019s demurrers had been overruled, respondent would be responsible for appellants\u2019 attorney fees. Treating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>a demurrer as an \u201caction\u201d could have unforeseen consequences in other areas involving the established use of the word \u201caction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Respondent suggests that a claim not based on the governing documents is likely to be more far-fetched, and thus it would be anomalous that the more dubious a claim the less likely attorney fees can be awarded against the party making such a claim. But the language of the statute awarding attorney fees determines whether or not a successful defense will result in an attorney fees award. Section 1354, subdivision (f) authorizes an attorney fees award only in \u201can action ... to enforce the governing documents.\u201d (\u00a7 1354, subd. (f).) The statute could have been written to provide for attorney fees to the prevailing party in any action \u201carising out of or related to\u201d the governing documents or in which they are enforced. But it did not.  A court is not free to give the words of a statute a definition \u201cdifferent from the plain and direct import of the terms used.\u201d <em>(California Fed. Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 342, 349 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 279, 902 P.2d 297].) The court\u2019s role is to ascertain the meaning of the words used, \u201c \u2018not to insert what has been omitted\u2019 \u201d or otherwise rewrite the law to conform to an intention that has not been expressed. <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The trial court\u2019s awards of attorney fees in both cases are reversed.

Relevant precedent, <em>Kaplan v. Fairway Oaks Homeowners Association </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 715 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 158], and a commonsense examination of the record reveal that the trial court was right, it was such a lawsuit.

In that case, the complaint alleged a violation of the Corporations Code relating to proxy and voting rights, but after an examination of what the case was actually about, the Court found that the \u201cgist\u201d of the action was to enforce the homeowners\u2019 voting rights under the governing documents. <em>(Kaplan v.

Benedict Hills Estates Assn. </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1388, fn. 2 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 166] [gravamen of an action labeled \u201ccontinuing nuisance\u201d was enforcement of the covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&amp;R\u2019s)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Here, although the cause of action came with a promissory estoppel label, appellants\u2019 theory was actually based on Ocean Towers Housing Corporation\u2019s alleged violation of its duty to repair appellants\u2019 earthquake-damaged apartments and to restore those apartments to their original condition, a duty imposed by the governing documents. The gist and gravamen of the complaint was a violation of the governing documents. That, not the label, controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">\u201cHow the party achieves the goal of enforcing the right in question is not determinative of the right to an award of attorney fees. . . . The impact of the litigation is.\u201d <em>(In re Head </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 223, 228-229 [228 Cal.Rptr. 184, 721 P.2d 65] [Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021.5, fees available to prevailing party in habeas corpus proceedings].)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">\u201cGist\u201d and \u201cgravamen\u201d are shorthand for the California primary rights theory, \u201cunder which the invasion of one primary right gives rise to a single cause of action.\u201d <em>(Slater v. Blackwood </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 791, 795 [126 Cal.Rptr. 225, 543 P.2d 593].) \u201c \u2018[T]he \u201ccause of action\u201d is based on the harm suffered, as opposed to the particular theory asserted by the litigant. . . . Even where there are multiple legal theories upon which recovery might be predicated, <em>one injury </em>gives rise to only one claim for relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading, Inc. v. Lawyers\u2019 Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 854, 860 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 691, 855 P.2d 1263], quoting <em>Slater v. Blackwood, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 795.) \u201c[T]he nature of a cause of action does not depend on the label the plaintiff gives it or the relief the plaintiff seeks but on the primary right involved.\u201d <em>(Bird, Marella, Boxer &amp; Wolpert v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 419, 427 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 782].) The caption of the complaint or the particular theory adopted by the pleader is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>It is clear from the allegations in this complaint that the primary right appellants actually sought to enforce was their right to have the damage to their apartments repaired and the apartments restored to their original condition, in accord with the governing documents. Under the guise of \u201cpromissory estoppel,\u201d appellants sought precisely the relief available to them under the governing documents. Any judgment awarded under the promissory estoppel theory would result in the enforcement of those documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">I now turn to the discussion of <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Agee </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 377 [150 Cal.Rptr. 841] and its progeny. (I would also discuss <em>Exxess Electronixx v. Heger Realty Corporation </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 698 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 376], but it is a Civil Code section 1717 case, in which the issue was whether tort causes of action were brought to enforce a contract. The issue is not an unusual one, but it has nothing to do with this case, or this discussion.)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In Palmer, the plaintiff was the owner of a mobilehome park, and landlord to defendant tenants. He initiated eviction proceedings under standard landlord-tenant procedures. The tenants moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the landlord had failed to comply with the eviction procedures specified in the Mobilehome Residency Law. The trial court granted the motion and awarded fees to the tenants under a section of that law which provided for fees to the prevailing party \u201cin any action arising out of\u2019 that law\u2019s eviction provisions. The Court of Appeal affirmed. After making some commonsense observations about the kind of game-playing landlords would engage in if the ruling was otherwise, the court held that \u201cAn action is not limited to the complaint or the document initiating the action but the entire judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>(Palmer v. Agee, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.3d at p. 387.)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Other courts have concurred in this analysis: <em>Nassif v. Municipal Court </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1294, 1298 [263 Cal.Rptr. 195], considering the meaning of \u201caction\u201d for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 583.110 cited <em>Palmer\u2019s </em>holding, and <em>Sunkyong Trading (H.K.) Ltd. v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 282, 288-289 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 504], which considered \u201caction\u201d under Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6, cited <em>Nassif </em>for the proposition for which <em>Nassif </em>cited <em>Palmer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">\u201cGenerally an action is defined as a proceeding wherein one asserts a right or seeks redress for a wrong. ([Code Civ. Proc.] \u00a7 22.) An action is usually deemed to commence upon the filing of a complaint ([Code Civ. Proc.] \u00a7\u00a7 350 &amp; 411.10) and remains pending until the judgment is final. ([Code Civ. Proc.] \u00a7 1049.)\u201d <em>(Nassif v. Municipal Court, supra, </em>214 Cal.App.3d at p. 1298.)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>These cases tell us that even if\u2014and that is not the case here\u2014respondent had sought fees based on a governing-documents demurrer, it would be entitled to fees if it prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The majority seeks to distinguish <em>Palmer </em>from this case based on the purported difference between an \u201caction to enforce\u201d and an \u201caction arising from.\u201d I find the discussion overly clever and hypertechnical. These are attorney fee provisions, similar to countless statutory and contractual attorney fee provisions. Such provisions should be interpreted broadly and liberally. <em>(Milman v. Shukhat </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 538, 545 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 526] [Civ. Code, \u00a7 1717 mutuality]; <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Fairway Oaks Homeowners Association, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at p. 719.) Their only possible purpose is to discourage litigation by providing that when two parties get into in a lawsuit over the matters subject to the contract or statute, the winner gets fees. I simply cannot imagine that a lawyer or legislator ever reached the considered opinion that it was right and just that in some circumstances the party who files, but not the party who defends, may recover fees. What kind of sense would that make, if the context is not a laboratory analysis of language, but the ordinary lives of people, organizations, and their lawyers? None.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">A search of the legislative history shows no trace of such an intent. Those legislative documents which mention the attorney fee provision in Civil Code section 1354 (the clause was added as part of a bill which primarily concerned solar energy) describe the provision as one which awards fees to the prevailing party \u201cin any litigation to enforce\u201d the CC&amp;R\u2019s (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3689 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 23, 1990, par. 4; Sen. Housing and Urban Affairs Com., com. on Assem. Bill No. 3689 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 2, 1990, par. 4.), or \u201cin any action to enforce restrictions affecting common interest developments.\u201d (Assemblyman Hauser, sponsor of Assem. Bill No. 3689, letter to Governor, Aug. 28, 1990, p. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Finally, the majority\u2019s narrow reading of \u201caction\u201d seems to me to have the potential to unnecessarily confuse what are not, at the moment, confused issues. Does the majority suggest that a plaintiff who files a writ of mandate seeking to compel a board to act under the governing documents, and is successful, is not entitled to fees? After all, a writ is not an \u201caction,\u201d it is a special proceeding. Suppose the governing documents established a statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>limitations on suits against the board, and a board successfully moved for summary judgment on that ground? As I read the majority, that board would not be entitled to fees. Where is the logic in that result? I can see none, and would confine this opinion to a simple affirmance of the trial court\u2019s straightforward ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 9, 2004, and respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied December 1, 2004.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
