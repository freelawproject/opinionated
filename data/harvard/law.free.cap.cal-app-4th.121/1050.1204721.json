J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aei\">Nerissa H. (Mother) and Earl L., Sr., (Father; collectively Parents) appeal from the order terminating their parental rights over Earl L. and Earllia L., which freed them for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">Parents contend the juvenile court violated their rights to due process (U.S. Const., 14th Amend.) by requiring them to make an offer of proof before setting a contested hearing to determine whether the sibling exception (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1)(E))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applied. They also contend that setting Earl L. and Earllia L. free for adoption would be detrimental in light of their strong bond with two older half siblings, Jamesha T. and Jesse T.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">Based on our review of the record and applicable law, we affirm the order. In particular, we conclude that the offer of proof procedure set forth in our earlier decision of <em>In re Tamika T. </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 1114 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 873] applies to the sibling exception to termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b931-15\">Mother has five children. In descending order of age, they are Unesha L.; Jamesha T.; Jesse T.; Earl L.; and Earllia L. Jamesha T. and Jesse T. share the same father. Earl L. and Earllia L. also share the same father.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>The Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) filed a petition (\u00a7 300) to detain Unesha L., Jamesha T., Jesse T, and Earl L.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">On February 15, 2002, the juvenile court sustained a second amended petition and declared the children to be dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">A separate petition (\u00a7 300) was filed by DCFS on behalf of Earllia L., who was bom in early June 2002. The juvenile court sustained the petition, as amended, and declared her to be a dependent.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">On September 18, 2002, Earllia L. was placed in the foster home of Betty G. Earl L., Jamesha T., and Jesse T, were already there. Unesha L. had been placed in another foster home.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">At the May 9, 2003, hearing, the juvenile court terminated family reunification services and set the matter for a permanency plan hearing (\u00a7 366.26). The court found Mother was not in compliance with the case plan and Father\u2019s compliance was only partial.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Betty G. informed DCFS that her intent was \u201cabsolutely [to] adopt Jesse [T.] and Jamesha [T.],\u201d but her financial situation enabled her at that time only to adopt Earl L. and Earllia L. She explained her choice of legal guardianship for the other two siblings was based on advice that this plan would enable them to receive more educational benefits in light of their ages.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">At the January 7, 2004 hearing, the juvenile court found a permanency plan of guardianship would be in the best interests of Jamesha T. and Jesse T. and appointed Betty G. their legal guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">Father, joined by Mother, opposed adoption as the permanency plan for Earl L. and Earllia L. and relied on the sibling exception. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1)(E).)</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">After finding the offer of proof was insufficient, the court denied Parents\u2019 request for a contested hearing. The court found Earl L. and Earllia L. were likely to be adopted and terminated parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b932-15\">Parents contend they were denied due process, because the juvenile court required an adequate offer of proof as a condition precedent to a contested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>hearing on the sibling exception. We conclude the request for an offer of proof was within the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">\u201cOf course a parent has a right to \u2018due process\u2019 at the hearing under section 366.26 which results in the actual termination of parental rights. This requires, in particular circumstances, a \u2018meaningful opportunity to cross-examine and controvert the contents of the [social worker\u2019s] report.\u2019 [Citations.] But due process is not synonymous with full-fledged cross-examination rights. [Citation.] Due process is a flexible concept which depends upon the circumstances and a balancing of various factors. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Jeanette V. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 811, 816-817 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 534].)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">\u201cBecause due process is, as we noted in <em>In re Jeannette V., supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th 811, a flexible concept dependent on the circumstances, the court can require an offer of proof to insure that before limited judicial and attorney resources are committed to a hearing on the issue, [the parent] ha[s] evidence of significant probative value. If due process does not permit a parent to introduce irrelevant evidence, due process does not require a court to hold a contested hearing if it is not convinced the parent will present relevant evidence on the issue he or she seeks to contest. The [juvenile] court can therefore exercise its power to request an offer of proof to clearly identify the contested issue(s) so it can determine whether a parent\u2019s representation is sufficient to warrant a hearing involving presentation of evidence and confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses.\u201d <em>(In re Tamika T, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th 1114, 1122.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">The mother in <em>In re Tamika T. </em>relied on the strong parental relationship exception. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1)(A) [termination detrimental to child because parent maintained regular visitation and contact with child].) We know of no reason why our <em>In re Tamika T. </em>holding should not apply equally to the sibling exception. We therefore conclude that the juvenile court has discretion to require the parent(s) seeking a contested hearing on the sibling exception to make \u201can offer of proof to clearly identify the contested issue(s)\u201d prior to determining whether a hearing is warranted. <em>(In re Tamika T, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at p. 1122.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">II,III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The order terminating parental rights is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A4I\">Hastings, J., and Curry, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-16\"> All further statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b933-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1050.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
