The answer denied the charge under oath. On the hearing, upon proofs, in \u2018the court below, a decree was made in accordance with the prayer of the bill, from which defendant appealed. Temporary \u25a0alimony had been granted, which ceased on entry of decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-14\"><em>G.

He read the affidavit of defendant, that she was entirely without means of her own, except as she earned them by the labor of her hands; and, also, the certificate of two counsel, that they had examined the case, and considered it a proper one for an appeal, and had accordingly advised an appeal being taken.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\n<em>A.

Wife with pecuniary means to defend or prosecute the suit on her behalf, is incident to divorce cases. It is necessary to the-ends of'justice. \"Without this power in the Court, the wife-that should have no separate property of her own, would be. without the requisite means of prosecuting or defending the-, suit, and of supporting herself in the mean time. The statute-relative to divorces says: '\u201cThe Court may, in its discretion, require the husband to pay any sum necessary to enable the-Wife to carry on or, defend the suit during its pendency,\u201d but makes no mention of temporary alimony. So far as the stat-. ute goes, it is only confirmatory of the common law, which had been acted upon by our courts before we had any statu-, tory provisions on the <em>subject. </em>\u2014 Story <em>v. Story, Walk. Ch. </em>421.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The decree below having been adverse to the wife is not, we think, of itself a sufficient ground for denying the motion. The certificate of two counsel shows the appeal was taken in good faith. We think this sufficient to warrant us in exercising-the discretion with which we are vested.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b286-8\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">\n<em>Motion granted.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>On a subsequent day, on affidavits showing that defendant had been guilty of repeated acts of adultery pending this appeal, <em>Maynard </em>moved for an order vacating the allowance of alimony above made.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The counsel for defendant, now declining any further to appear in the case, the Court, on looking over the affidavits, granted the motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-10\"> See also <em>McGee v.
