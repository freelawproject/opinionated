The act of 1855, being in derogation of the common law, is to be construed strictly. The evil intended to be remedied by it was the sale of the wife\u2019s property without her assent, whereby she was, many times, reduced to want and suffering. That evil was ' remedied by giving her such 'an estate in her personal property as would prevent the husband selling it without her consent, and freeing it from liability for his engagements. The statute authorizes the wife to contract, sell, transfer, mortgage, devise, and be\u25a0queath her property, but does not take from the husband the possession of it so long as he \u2022 uses that possession for the benefit of himself, his wife, and family. The court should not so extend this statute as to authorize the wife, without cause on the part of the husband, to remove herself and her property from his care and possession, and thereby break up the family, and destroy his peace and 'comfort.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-8\">It is also contended that, by the marriage contract, the wife tacitly agrees to put into possession of her husband her personal estate, and not remove so long as he provides her 'a suitable home. He is hable for the support of herself and her children, while there is no such obligation on her part to support him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-9\">This property was in the husband\u2019s lawful possession, fand, until demand made, any person would be a trespasser who intermeddled with it against his consent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-10\">2. The wife not being a competent witness against the husband, her statements could not be proved for or against \u25a0him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number><em>A. S. </em>Robertson, and <em>A. B. Maynard, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"As7\">Manning J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The circuit judge was correct in admitting the evidence, and in stating the law, which is too clear to admit- of doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The statute of 1834 <em>(Comp. L. </em>\u00a73289) did not give a married woman full power to control her separate property without the assent of her husband. It provided all property acquired by her before or after marriage should continue to be her separate property, and should not be liable for her husband\u2019s debts, engagements, or liabilities; but prohibited her from giving, granting, or selling or removing it from the premises of her husband' without his consent, except authorized thereto by the judge of probate, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">By the act of 1855 <em>(Comp. L. </em>\u00a73292), these restrictions are removed, and she is authorized to contract, sell, transfer, mortgage, convey, devise, or bequeath it, in the same manner, and with the like effect as if she were unmarried. The object of the Legislature, by this act- \u2014 -for the language is too clear, it seems to us, to admit of any doubt \u2014 was to give the wife the same power, in all respects, over her property that she had before marriage. That it was intended to release or emancipate such property from the common-law rights and dominion of the husband, is not only obvious from the language referred to, but from the additional fact that the statute also provides that actions may be brought by and against her in relation to such property as if she were <em>unmarried. </em>\u2014 Comp. <em>L. </em>\u00a73294.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">It follows, as a necessary consequence, that the authority given by her to defendants to remove the property, was competent evidence for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The judgment below must be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b380-9\">All the Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
