The affidavit for attachment, based upon the non-residence of a defendant, was made February 23d, 1857, and the writ issued thereon bore date two days thereafter. Property was attached by virtue of this writ, but Fessenden was not personally served, and did not appear in the cause-Judgment having passed against him by default, he brought the case to this Court by writ of error, alleging several grounds of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-9\"><em>G.
