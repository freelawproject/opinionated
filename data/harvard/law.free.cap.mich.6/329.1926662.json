An assignee under an assignment, whether good or bad on its face, is not now regarded as a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser. \u2014 <em>Pierson v. Planning, </em>2 <em>Mich. 445; Burr. on Ass\u2019ts, </em>439, <em>and cases cited.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-11\">2. This assignment is'bad on its face.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-12\"><em>a. </em>It contains no sufficient description of property, without recourse to the schedule; that being referred to for identification. Where a schedule is so referred to, nothing passes except what is therein mentioned, and until appended there is no description. General words of description in a deed are always limited by such a specification, and nothing passes excepting what is so specified. \u2014 5 <em>Png. L. &lt;&amp; Pq. </em>411; <em>Durr, on Ass\u2019ts, </em>243, 321; 5 <em>Johns. </em>335; 12 <em>Pide. </em>22; 21 <em>Pide </em>503; 14 <em>Barb. </em>39; 10 <em>W. H. </em>358; 11 <em>N. PC. </em>411; 6 <em>Barb. </em>410; 2 <em>Wis. </em>60, 61.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>h. </em>It does not purport to convey all the property of the assignors, although it purports to be, and is, a general assignment. With such a reference to the schedule as is contained here, the presumption arises that there is property not embraced in it, even if the references to the stores and ashery were broad enough to convey every thing there; or, in other words, even if the reference to the schedule did not limit <em>them. </em>\u2014 JBurriU, <em>244,245; 5 Wheat. </em>107; 5 <em>Mason, </em>280; 8 <em>Md. </em>418.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-5\">The most that could be claimed by assignors would bo that they might show affirmatively that all their property was actually covered by the assignment. But this the Court held they need not do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-6\">e. This assignment is bad because it allows the assignors to change the schedules. If the assignment contained a conveyance of all the property, without reference to the schedule, then the power retained might be regarded as one merely to rectify clerical and numerical errors. But wheb the schedule, as here, is descriptive, and necessary to point out what is intended to be conveyed, a power to alter it amounts to a power to make material changes in the assignment, and renders it void. \u2014 1 <em>Am. Lead. Cases, </em>97; <em>Burr, on Ass\u2019ts, </em>333, 234, 209, 212, 235.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-7\"><em>d. </em>The assignment is void because it allows sales <em>on credit. </em>The words \u201c <em>terms and conditions \u201d </em>are always applied, in common parlance, to the time and mode of payment, and such is the only sensible construction here, when every other contingency is expressly provided for.\u2014 <em>Burr. on Ass\u2019ts, </em>197, 452; 21 <em>Pick. </em>185; 1 <em>Metc. </em>79; 2 <em>Duer, </em>533; 2 <em>Wis. </em>59 ; 1 <em>Wis. </em>286.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-8\"><em>e. </em>The assignment provides for an unlimited delegation of powers. That assignees should have power to act through agents in ordinary business matters, is well enough, but to give them power to appoint attorneys, not only with their own broad powers, but with power of substitution, is, we submit, a most dangerous excess.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>3. The assignees could only hold (as against creditors who attach) such property as is delivered to them under the <em>assignment. </em>\u2014 Burr, <em>on Ass'ts, </em>298; <em>Comp. B. </em>\u00a73188.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-4\">And they could not lawfully make the schedule. As part of the assignors\u2019 deed, the assignors must either make it, or at least cause it to be made, and know its contents, and adopt it. \\</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-5\">4. The preference of a private debt is illegal.\u2014 1 <em>Band/. Ch. </em>348; 3 <em>Barb., Ch. </em>46; 25 <em>Vt. </em>351.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-6\">The whole question of fraud in fact, including this matter, was submitted by the Court to the jury.\u2014 24 <em>Barb. </em>121.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-7\"><em>G. V. N. Bothrcp, </em>for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-8\">1. Such a construction must be given the assignment as will fairly carry into effect the intention of the parties so far as it can be collected from the whole instrument. Where two constructions are admissible, that should be preferred which will render it legal and operative, rather than that which would render it void. \u2014 22 <em>Wend. </em>483; 11 <em>Bide. </em>181; 11 <em>Wend. </em>181; <em>per Mitdiell J., </em>18 <em>Barb. </em>650; <em>per Barleer B, </em>11 <em>Barb. </em>392.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-9\">2. The assignment in question was clearly intended to operate <em>in present\u00ed. </em>It transfers in the most comprehensive terms all the partnership property, and provides for immediate possession by the assignees. A schedule was not necessary to define the property assigned \u2014 the assignment itself does not make it so, and the reference therein to a schedule means no more than if the words had been \u201cof which it is proposed that a particular schedule shall be made out hereafter and annexed hereto.\u201d \u2014 See 15 <em>Conn. </em>152; 22 <em>Bide. </em>468; 2 <em>Baige, </em>311; 14 <em>M. &amp; W. </em>41. The acts of the parties cotemporary with the making of the contract, or nearly so, may be looked . at to aid in its interpretation (2 <em>Cush. </em>283); and the proof of their acts shows this to have been their construction of the instrument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>3. Even, if the assignment did not purport to convey all the partnership property, the deed would not be void unless property was withheld with actual fraudulent intent. ' \u2014 24 <em>Barb. </em>120.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-6\">4. The right reserved in the assignors to perfect the schedules did not invalidate the deed. Any reservation, directly or indirectly <em>for the, benefit of the_ assignor, to the prejudice of the </em>creditors, avoids the deed. \u2014 4 <em>1red. </em>204; 11 <em>Wend. </em>202; 15 <em>JST. T. </em>144; and see 16 <em>K. T. </em>563. But the reservation in this deed does not fall within the principle. It reserved a right simply to look over the schedule to be made, to see if it was perfect, <em>if this should be found necessary. </em>It was a reservation, not for the benefit of the assignors primarily, but for the benefit of the creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-7\">5. The assignment did not authorize the assignees to sell on credit. \u201411 <em>Barb. </em>198; 21 <em>Barb. </em>65; 21 <em>Barb. </em>128; 1 <em>Kern. </em>304; 3 <em>Kern. </em>215.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-8\">6. As to the right to make preferences of individual debts, there is some conflict of cases. There are two cases which seem to imply a denial of \u00a1the right. \u2014 2 <em>Sandf. Ch. </em>448; 4 <em>Sandf. S. C. </em>252. On the other hand, the following cases seem to affirm the right. \u2014 3 <em>Barb. Ch. </em>46; 1 <em>Clarke Ch. </em>193; 1 <em>Lie. Law Mag. </em>442. But whatever may be the law on this subject, it has always been held that such a preference did not, in law, avoid the assignment; that the preference was illegal, <em>not under the statute, but only under the equitable rule which devotes partnership property primarily to the satisfaction of partnership debts. </em>\u201411 <em>Wend. </em>206; 3 <em>Barb.Ch. </em>46; 4 <em>Sandf. S. C. </em>298; and see 15 <em>K. Y. </em>96.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-9\">But it is to be further observed that the expression of opinion of the Court on this point was, so far as this case is concerned, a mere abstract opinion. The assignment does <em>not prefer </em>private debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-10\">If any of the creditors named in schedules B. or C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>were in fact individual creditors, that would appear only in evidence. It would indicate, either a mistake on the part of the assignors, or else a fraudulent design to palm individual debts off for partnership debts. If there was a mistake, it would not vitiate; if on the other hand, it was the result of a fraudulent design, it would bring the assignment directly within the statute, and this would be a question of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-5\">Now, this was the only way this question could properly arise in this case. No such point was, in fact, made on the trial. No request to instruct the \u2018jury Avith reference to such a case was asked by the defendant\u2019s counsel, The Court was asked to instruct the jury that it was unlaAvful to prefer the private debts of the copartners, which, under this assignment, was an abstract question.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b341-6\">Martin Ch. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">It is Avell settled that a schedule detailing at large the property conveyed, is not necessary to the validity of an assign<em>ment. </em>\u2014 See <em>Hollister v. </em>Loud, 2 <em>Mich. </em>809; <em>Rundlett v. </em>Dole, 10 <em>N. H. </em>458. It is sufficient to constitute a legal transfer that the property is described with reasonable certainty. If then a schedule be referred to in an assignment, it may, or may not, be a necessary part of such instrument, for the purpose of ascertaining what property is conveyed; and it may, or may not, have the effect to restrict the general words of the grant, according to the context, and the mode in which reference is made to it. No arbitrary rule can therefore be laid doAvn respecting the necessity or effect of a schedule, if one be referred to, but these are to be determined by a consideration of the whole instrument, from which the intent of the parties making it is to be gathered; and such intent, when ascertained, is to control its construction in this respect, as in all others.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">A great diversity exists in the reports respecting the construction of debtors\u2019 assignments, and a disposition has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>not infrequently manifested to construe them with great technical nicety, sometimes approaching illiberality. This tendency has led to the application of particular and subordinate rules of construction in some instances, in disregard or forgetfulness of those paramount rules which control the interpretation of all other written instruments. The principle most generally applied to the construction of this class of instruments is this: \u201cThat if a general clause in an instrument be followed by special words which accord with the general clause, the deed shall be construed according to the special matter.\u201d But in the application of this principle care is not always taken to observe how far the special words accord with the general clause, nor the manner of their application to it; and general words have been controlled and limited in their operation by special words, from an arbitrary application of this principle, although at the obvious sacrifice of the intent of the assignor, as manifested by the whole instrument. The diversity also which exists in the forms of assignments, their subjects, and the manner in which schedules have been referred to, has induced some errors from want of care in observing their dissimilarities.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u201cIn construing contracts, deeds, and other written instruments,\u201d says Selden J., in <em>Platt v. </em>Lott, 17 <em>N. Y. </em>478, \u201cresort is had to a variety of legal rules for the purpose of aiding in their interpretation; but all other rules are subordinate to that primary rule which requires that every such instrument should be construed according to the intention of the parties. Whenever, from an examination of the writing itself, and on a comparison of its various parts, the intent with which it was executed can be clearly ascertained, that intent is to govern, whether the construction to which it tends is, or is not, in accordance with those minor rules, which arc merely auxiliary to the one great paramount rule referred to. Hence, notwithstanding the ordinary rule, that general words are controlled hr their operation by those which are more particular and specific, if, upon looking at the assignment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>in this case, we are able clearly to see that it was the intention of the assignors to convey to the assignees th.eir whole property, we are bound to give effect to that intention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The cases cited will be found, upon careful examination, not to conflict with this rule, while <em>Driscoll v. Fiske, </em>21 <em>Pick. </em>503, expressly recognizes it. \u2014 See also <em>Burr. on Assets </em>(2 <em>ed.), </em>265, 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">An examination of the deed of assignment from Wallace <em>&amp; </em>Co., and a comparison of its different provisions, leave no doubt in our minds as to the design with which it Was executed. It commences by a recital of the reasons which induced it, and the object sought to be accomplished by it; the reasons being the heavy indebtedness of the assignors, and their utter inability to discharge it with punctuality or in full; and the object being to secure their credi-' tors the p\u00f3ssession of whatever property and effects they were seized of, at as early a day as possible, and to prevent undue sacrifice of the same. It then, in general terms, conveys aE their personal property and choses in action, <em>of \u25a0every name and nature </em>whatever, to the assignees \u201cas the same is more particularly described in the schedule <em>proposed </em>to be hereafter annexed to this instrument, marked schedule A., and especially including all the stock and merchandise\u201d in their several stores, describing their locality, and \u201c other property, accounts, debts, and demands as herein already intended to be conveyed,\u201d together with all the ashes on hand at their ashery, &amp;c. It further requires and empowers the assignees to take immediate possession of the property and choses in action assigned, and to appropriate them to the payment of their debts. These provisions clearly manifest an intention by the Wallaces to assign \u2022all their property for the purposes expressed in the instrument, and that it should presently operate. And such, we think, was its effect, notwithstanding the reference to a schedule. And so it was evidently regarded by the parties; for the proof is that the assignees did immediately reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the assignors\u2019 property to possession, as well that specially designated, as other property not mentioned hut obviously regarded as embraced in the general language of the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">But the reference to the schedule is claimed to render one necessary to the conveyance of any property. The difficulty in this case, is from the reference being made in the present tense. If it had been \u201c as the same <em>is to be </em>more particularly described,\u201d or had a provision been inserted that a schedule should be. made and annexed, no doubt would have arisen respecting the present operation of the assignment, nor of the property covered by it. Such we think to be the true purport of this reference. Language is to be construed by its context; and no one can read this instrument without arriving at the conclusion that the schedule was contemplated to be subsequently made, and was not in existence when the assignment was drawn up. The inartificial manner in which this reference is made can not affect the general and controlling language of the instrument, but such reference should be read so as to accord with it. Now if, as we have already shown, a schedule is not necessary to the validity of an assignment, and if, when one is referred to, it will become necessary or not, according as the language of the whole instrument shall demonstrate such necessity to determine what property is conveyed, it follows that the absence of such schedule, although referred to, does not necessarily render the instrument incomplete, nor authorize the presumption that the assignors had property not conveyed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In <em>Platt v. Lott </em>(supra), where the general words of assignment were no stronger than those in the one before us, the reference to the schedule was as follows: \u201cThe same being more fully and particularly enumerated and described in a schedule thereof hereunto annexed,\u201d &amp;c.: the assignment, from a consideration of the whole instrument, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>held good to convey all the assignor\u2019s property, whether enumerated in the schedule or not; and the Court says, \u201cThis (the reference to the schedule) however by no means indicates an intention to qualify or limit the broad and comprehensive language previously used. A schedule Would, of course, be necessary as a matter of convenience, and as a guide to the assignee; and the provision for its annexation, although it is thereby made a part of the assignment, does not warrant the inference that it was intended that if. any portion of the property of the assignors should be omitted, which might well occur through accident or inadvertence, the title to such property should not pass to the assignee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">In the case before us, the reference is to a schedule <em>proposed to be annexed; </em>and when this is read in connection with the declared object of the assignment, the desire expressed that the creditors should have possession of all the property and effects of the assignors \u201cat as early a day as possible,\u201d the general words of the grant, and the subsequently declared trust that the assignees should at once, or as soon as practicable, take possession of the property assigned, the idea that such proposed schedule was necessary to the perfection of the instrument, and that nothing was assigned until such schedule should have been made and attached, is without foundation. It is very apparent from a consideration of the whole deed, that this reference to a schedule Avas not made in contemplation- that Avhen annexed it would operate as the only descriptive words of the grant, nor to limit or restrict its general words; but that, as the assignment was by general words, the nature and situation of the property was such as to render one necessary to afford the assignees specific information of the items of property and choses in action thereby assigned, to enable them fully and understandingly to execute them trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The reservation of a power to <em>perfect </em>the schedule at some future time, if it should become necessary, strongly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>confirms our construction of the reference to the schedule, and clearly shows that the schedule was not regarded as essential to the immediate operation of the assignment, or as limiting its general language. But it was objected that this reservation renders the assignment void. From what has been already said, it follows that the exercise of this reserved right can have no effect to restrict, in any degree, the assignment, or to limit the general words of conveyance, or to divest the assignees of the property reduced to possession, whether scheduled or not. The evident intention in inserting it was to secure the right to furnish evidence of the particular property embraced within the <em>general terms </em>of the assignment, if that should become necessary. The power to perfect the schedule does not imply the power to impair the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The first three objections to the admissibility of the assignment as evidence were therefore properly overruled. By this construction, we give effect to the instrument consistent with the intention expressed in its preamble, and with the construction put upon it by the parties at the time of its execution, as manifested by the change of the possession of the property before a schedule was made; and when an honest intent can as clearly be inferred from its language as a fraudulent one, we are not at liberty to infer the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"AxJ\">It was fourthly objected that the assignment was void as allowing the assignees to sell upon credit. The assumption that they Avere allowed to sell upon credit is based upon the \u25a0following language: \u201cAnd sell and dispose of the same, either at public or private sale, as they, in their good judgment, may deem best, and upon such terms and conditions as they may deem most advisable, and for the best interest of the creditors, converting the same into money,\u201d &lt;fco. If it be true that the grant of a power to sell upon credit would render the assignment void (which .is a question not before us) yet Ave think; a fair and reasonable interpret<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>ation of this language will not justify the conclusion that -an illegal act was contemplated. This provision is Usually found in the forms of assignments consulted by draftsmen; and it is as reasonable to presume that the intent in following such form, and in using the language, was for a lawful as for an unlawful purpose. It was undoubtedly inserted to clothe the assignees with full and entire power over the assets, and to invest them with every discretionary power which they might lawfully exercise. We think, therefore, as no express power to sell upon credit is given by the assignment, so none should be inferred from this general and, to some extent, technical language; and such are now the later and better adjudications. \u2014 See cases cited in <em>Burr. on Ass'ts </em>(2 <em>ed.), </em>217, 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">It was lastly objected that the assignment was void as allowing the assignees to delegate their trust without restriction. It is difficult to determine the meaning of this objection. The instrument concludes with the usual clause authorizing substitution, and was evidently intended to clothe the assignees with power to appoint such agents or attorneys \u25a0as they might find necessary for the collection of debts, or the transaction of any other business matters where an agent \u25a0might be necessary, and can not, except upon the most violent presumption, be construed into a power to delegate their trusts. We see nothing unusual or objectionable in this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The assignment being valid, the court below properly refused the first five requests of the plaintiffs in error, in charging the jury. The sixth request of the counsel for the plaintiffs in error was also properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The assignment itself makes no preference of any private and individual debts of the assignees, but such are placed in the fourth and last class.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">It is time that there was evidence in the case showing that individual debts were included in the schedule of preferred debts, but how many, or to what amount, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>appear. Whether the assignors have the right to pref\u00e9r individual debts, or not, is a question upon which some diversity exists in the courts, of the different states, but one we are not required to determine in the present case, as the current of authorities, and the better opinion, we think to, be that suoh preference does not render the assignment void. \u2014 See <em>Hollister v. Loud, supra; Newman v. Bagley, </em>16 <em>Pick. 570; Kirby v. Schoonmaker, 3 Barb. </em>Ch. 46; <em>Nicholson v. Leavitt, </em>4 <em>Sandf. S. C. </em>252; <em>Kemp v.
