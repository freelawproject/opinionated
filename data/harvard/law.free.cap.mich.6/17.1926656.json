It sets forth that on the 3d day of July, 1835, James Abbott, being the owner of said premises, conveyed the same to Francis G. Macy, for the consideration of $5,000, and the deed thereof was duly recorded: That, soon after said conveyance, Macy left Michigan, and has not since resided therein, and has been entirely ignorant of any use which may have since been made of said lots, and that he gave no assent to any such use: That, on receiving such conveyance, Macy gave a mortgage back to Abbott, executed and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>corded in due form, to secure the payment of $4,000 of the purchase money, in four equal annual installments, with interest :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-5\">That on the 4th clay of August, 1835, Macy being still the owner of said premises, subject to the mortgage, gave a warranty deed of a one-fourth undivided interest therein, to. one Freeman Dodd, which latter deed was recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the city of Detroit, on the 9th day of October, 1835; that said Dodd never resided in Michigan, and never assented to, or knew of, any occupancy or use of said lots adverse to himself:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-6\">That on said 4th day of August, 1835, Macy being-still the owner of a three-fourths interest in said premises, subject to said mortgage, gave a warranty deed of an undivided one-half interest therein to JoseiDh Iioxie; which last deed was recorded in the office of the register of deeds, of the city of Detroit, on the 9th of October, 1835; and that said Iioxie never resided in Michigan, and never assented to, or knew of, any use or occupancy of said premises adverse to himself:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-7\">That on the 1st of November, 183Y, Macy mortgaged his remaining one-fourth interest to the Farmers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank of Michigan, which latter mortgage was by the bank subsequently assigned to Messrs. Trowbridge, Stuart, and Owen, and by them to Gr. Y. N. Lothrop. Mr, Lothrop was made a party defendant, and allowed the bill to be taken as confessed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-8\">The bill further states that the first and second installments of the mortgage given by Macy to Abbott, were duly paid; that the third and fourth installments remaining unpaid, Abbott, in or about the month of August, 1839, filed his bill to foreclose the said mortgage, in the then Court of Chancery for the first circuit of the State of Michigan; that such proceedings were thereupon had in said foreclosure suit that, on January 12th, 1841, said premises were sold by a master, pursuant to a decree of said court, to said Abbott, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>for two hundred dollars, and a master\u2019s deed given therefor, which was recorded February 4th, 1841, in the register\u2019s office of Wayne county. The master made his report, which was confirmed by the court January 12th, 1841, and a decree entered against Macy for the balance:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-5\">That said Abbott was sole complainant, and Macy sole defendant in said foreclosure suit, although Abbott well knew, and had due notice, in law and in fact, of the conveyances to Dodd and Hoxie, and of the mortgage to said Farmers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank, so that the rights, interests and equities of said parties, and their assigns, were wholly unaffected by said foreclosure proceedings; that Dodd and Hoxie had no notice of said foreclosure proceedings, nor did they in any way assent thereto, or to any conveyances or occupancy of said lots, since the conveyance thereof by Macy, as aforesaid:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AP\">That on the 4th of August, 1842, Abbott gave a warranty deed of said premises to John Winder, but neither Abbott nor Winder ever took or had any actual or legal possession after the said deed to Macy; or if they ever took possession, it was not till the year 1845:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-6\">That in 1852, Winder caused said premises to be surveyed and platted into city lots, and several persons became interested therein by purchase, who are made parties defendant to the bill:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-7\">That on the 4th day of October, 1854, said Hoxie, being still the owner of a one-half undivided interest in said premises, conveyed the same by deed, executed in due form, to the complainant; which deed was duly recorded:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-8\">That on or about January 8th, 1839, Dodd assigned all his interest in said premises to John Stevens and William Emerson, and the survivor of them, in trust for Dodd\u2019s creditors, With full power in the assignees to sell the same as they should see fit; that said assignees accepted the trust, and took on themselves its execution; that Stevens subsequently died, whereupon the title of Dodd in the property became vested in Emerson, the surviving assignee:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>That on the 21st day of July, 1842, the said Dodd filed his petition in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, sitting in bankruptcy; and, pursuant to the statute and the practice of said court, he was duly declared a bankrupt by said court, September 5th, 1842; and W. C. II. Waddell, who was the general assignee in bankruptcy appointed by said court, became the owner of all the property of said Dodd, from the date of said decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-5\">That Waddell, on March lVtli, 1855, pursuant to the order and direction of said court in bankruptcy, sold and conveyed to the complainant all the right and interest which he had in the premises, as assignee of Dodd, and by virtue of said decree in bankruptcy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-6\">That after the death of said Stevens, -assignee of Dodd \u25a0as aforesaid, said Emerson, his .survivor, on June 6th, 1855, sold and conveyed to the complainant all the interest he had in said premises, as assignee of Dodd, and as survivor of Stevens. And the bill charges that neither Stevens nor Emerson knew any thing of the foreclosure suit of Abbott against Macy, nor had notice of any conveyances, occupancy, or improvements, from and under Abbott and Ms assigns thereafter:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-7\">And complainant claimed, by virtue of said several conveyances, to be the owner in fee simple of an undivided three-fourths of said premises, subject only to said Macy mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-8\">Winder, and the several defendants deriving title under Mm, claimed to be purchasers in good faith under the proceedings had for the foreclosure of the Macy mortgage, and without any notice of the Dodd and Hoxie deeds, and insisted that the right of Macy and his grantees to redeem was extinguished by such foreclosure proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-9\">The cause having been put at issue, testimony was taken, of which it is only necessary to notice that relating to the Dodd and Hoxie deeds. These were both executed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>city of New York, in 1835, and acknowledged before a com-, missioner of deeds, in all respects in conformity with the then laws of New York, and each had a single subscribing witness, who was the officer taking the acknowledgment: no. county clerk\u2019s certificate was attached, showing the official character and signature of the commissioner. The deeds were recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the city of Detroit, on the 9th day of October, 1835; and the principal question in the case was, whether, having but one subscribing witness, and wanting such clerk\u2019s certificate, they were authorized, under the laws of the territory of Michigan, then in force, to be recorded, so that their being placed on record was constructive notice to Abbott and those claiming under him. There was no proof that Abbott had actual notice of these deeds at the time of the foreclosure.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b21-5\"><em>B.

The Dodd and Hoxie deeds were executed and acknowledged in strict conformity to the laws of New York, and were therefore authorized to be recorded here under the act of 182'T, embraced in the Code of 1833. This act did not specify .what evidence should be deemed sufficient that a deed has been executed according to the foreign law, when it is presented to a register for record; and this defect is made the subject of comment by the Supreme Court in <em>Ives v. </em>Kimball, 1 <em>Mich. </em>308. But it may be presumed, as say the Court, that the register did his duty, and that he had the proper evidence before <em>him. </em>\u2014 Ewing's <em>heirs v. Savary, </em>3 <em>Bibb, </em>287; <em>Hope v. Sawyer, </em>14 <em>Ill. </em>254. A register of deeds might record any deed which appeared to have the proper form, leaving the questions, whether it was <em>properly recorded, </em>and whether it was notice to subsequent purchasers, to be determined when they should arise. \u2014 <em>Talbot's lessee V. Simpson, Pet. C. C. </em>188, 189.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>3. Defendants claim that deeds executed out of the territory must conform not only to seo. 7, but also to sec. 1, of the act of 1827,, and therefore that such deeds must have two witnesses, whether the law of the place where executed required them or not; and that they must, in all respects, be in accordance with all the provisions of our statute, and also with the <em>laws and usages </em>of the place where executed. To this most unnatural and forced construction -of the statute we answer:</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-5\">It is contrary to the plain and obvious intention of the Legislature, which must prevail, so that professional criticism shall not be necessary to understand it. \u2014 23 <em>Pa. St. </em>231.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-6\">Nothing can be more manifest than that two classes of conveyances were intended to be .provided for; that secs. 1 and 2 should cover the first class, composed of deeds executed in the territory, and sec. 7 the other class, composed of such as should be executed in other states and countries.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-7\">The object of the latter section was to facilitate the making- of deeds of lands situated here, in parts of the world where the local law of Michigan might not be known.\u2014 <em>DeSegond v. </em>Culver, 10 Ohio, 191.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-8\">Sec. 8 of the act of 1820, Avhich is incorporated into sec. 7 of the act of 1827, provides that all deeds which <em>had been </em>executed in other states and countries, according .to the <em>laws and usages </em>thereof, should be confirmed; and they are declared to be as valid and effectual, to all intents and purposes, as though they had been acknowledged and proved in the territory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-9\">From this clause Ave gather,- \u2014 -</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-10\">First, That doAvn to 1820, there was no laAv or statute which authorized a deed of lands here to be executed out of the territory; and,</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-11\">Second, That foreign deeds Avere not intended, nor expected, to conform to the statute as to domestic deeds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-12\">- Why are deeds executed in other states, before and after the statute, classed together in the same section, and both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>placed on the same footing? Why are the former deeds confirmed ? And why are they not required to conform to sec. 1, \u25a0as to two witnesses ? There can be but one answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-5\">It is clear that sec. 1, which is general, relates only to deeds executed in Michigan, wMle sec. 7, being special, has reference onbf to such as might be executed elsewhere. This view is sustained by sec. 2, which specifies the officers before whom <em>such deeds </em>(before named in sec. 1) may be acknowledged or proved; and these officers can, of course, be only such as hold office under the laws of Michigan. Special provisions of a statute, relating to a particular subject or class, will not be controlled or affected by general provisions on the same general subject. \u2014 <em>United States v. </em>Weise, 2 <em>Wall. Jr. </em>72; <em>Jones v. </em>Jones, 18 <em>Me. </em>308; <em>Ottawa v. LaSalle Co. </em>12 <em>Ill. </em>339; <em>Rex v. Archbishop of Armagh, </em>8 <em>Mod. </em>8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-6\">It is said that sec. 1 provides the mode in which all deeds shall be executed, and that sec. 7 only relates to the forms of authentication of foreign conveyances when they shall have been executed with two witnesses and according to sec. 1. But \u201cstatutes are to be construed in reference to the principles of the common law; and it is not to be presumed that the Legislature intended to make any innovation on the common law, further than the' case absolutely required.\u2019 \u2014 1 <em>Kent, </em>464; <em>Whitcomb v. Rood, </em>20 <em>Vt. </em>49; <em>State v. </em>Mace, 5 <em>Md. </em>337; <em>U S. v. Magill, </em>1 <em>Wash. C. C. </em>463; <em>State v. Norton, </em>3 <em>Zab. </em>33; <em>Adams v. Terrentine, </em>8 <em>Ired. </em>147. Now, sec. 1 speaks of deeds and other conveyances signed and ealed, and sec. 7 speaks of deeds and conveyances made and executed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-7\">The word <em>deed </em>has a fixed and definite signification at common law. It \u201cis a writing sealed and delivered by the parties.\u201d Independent of statutes, a deed requires no subscribing witness. \u2014 4 <em>Kent, </em>451, 452; <em>Forsaith v. Clark, </em>1 <em>Fos. </em>409; <em>Dole v. Thurlow, </em>12 <em>Metc. </em>157, 165; <em>Long v. Ramsay, </em>1 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>72; <em>Jackson v. Wood, </em>12 <em>Johns. </em>73; <em>Moore v. Vance, </em>1 <em>Ohio, </em>1; <em>Wilkins v. Wells, </em>9 <em>S. &amp; M. </em>335.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>When, therefore, the Legislature, in sec. 1, speak of a deed signed and sealed, and, in sec. 7, of a deed made and executed, they mean the same thing- \u2014 -\u201ca writing sealed and delivered by the parties.\u201d Such is the long settled meaning at common law of the terms they use; which meaning was not changed, as there was no necessity for innovation, either in the subject or in the object of the legislation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-5\">We have accordingly, under both sections, deeds fully executed, without witness, acknowledgment, proof, or certificate. The sections are alike in this respect, and the latter requisites relate to the forms of authentication only. We thus see the object of this statute; that these forms might be different in domestic and foreign deeds, and that in the latter they might vary so as to conform to the different local laws where they might be executed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-6\">Again: Sec. 1 contains no negative words. It is declared that a deed in the form there prescribed shall be good and valid, but it is not declared that deeds in the ordinary form shall not be valid. These affirmative provisions are merely <em>directory. </em>\u2014 French <em>v. </em>French, 3 <em>N. H. </em>234, 256, 263; <em>Stone v. Ashley, </em>13 <em>N. H. </em>38; <em>Dole v.

Randall, </em>3 <em>Mich. </em>581.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-7\">A conveyance, signed, sealed, and delivered as a deed,, would be good, as between the parties, notwithstanding the. statute, and it would be a monstrous distortion to construe, the first section as excluding every other form, when a far more natural construction would give sec. 7 an exclusive operation as to foreign deeds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-8\">Nor do secs. 2 and 4 help defendants. Sec. 2 opens with the words, \u201cAll such deeds\u201d \u2014 referring, of course, to sec. 1; and it makes no allusion to sec. 7, or to deeds executed in other states. The officers in this section are, of course, none other than public officers of the territory of Michigan.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>The first subdivision of sec. 4 refers expressly to deeds by married women residing in this territory; and the words, \u201ctaken in manner aforesaid,\u201d can refer only to the previous secs. 1 and 2. The seventh section has no such connecting links as these with the first section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-4\">The second subdivision of sec. 4 refers expressly to deeds by married women, not residing in this territory; and these, therefore, come under see. 7. It will be noted that the words \u201call such deeds,\u201d as found in sec. 2, and \u201ctaken in maimer aforesaid,\u201d found in the first part of sec. 4, are carefully excluded from the last part of sec. 4. This fact will appear very significant when we come to compare the whole legislation of the state on the subject. It will be found far from <em>accidental. </em>\u2014 Fowler <em>v. </em>Tuttle, 4 <em>Fos. </em>9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-5\">Again: When wo come to sec. 6 we find the same absence of all words having reference to sec. 1, or any other section; and all deeds entitled to be recorded by virtue of this act, are provided for. Deeds made pursuant to sec. 1, or pursuant to sec. 7, had the same equal right to record.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-6\">25., <em>S. A. &amp; </em>25. Goodwin, and <em>A. </em>25. Fraser, for defendants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-7\">There is no evidence in the case of any conveyances from Macy to either Dodd or Hoxie.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-8\">By the legislation of Michigan, at the time of the execution of these instruments, two witnesses were required to make them valid, as conveyances of real estate. All deeds were required to be attested by two witnesses by the original Ordinance of 1787.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-9\">By the act of the Legislative Council of the territory of Michigan, of April 12th, 1827, all conveyances of real estate lying in the territory must be signed and sealed by the grantors, and signed by two or more witnesses, and proved, and acknowledged, and recorded, to be valid. Sec. 2 provides how such deeds shall be proved or acknowledged within the state to entitle them to be recorded, and sec. 6 provides when such record shall be evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Sec. 7 provides, as to deeds executed in another state, that they shall be acknowledged, proved, and certified in conformity with the laws of that state, and shall be as valid as if proved or acknowledged according to the laws of Michigan. This statute continued in force until the Revised Statutes of 1838, by which witnesses were dispensed with, but again required by the act of April 29th, 1839, and by all subsequent enactments.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-5\">The instruments purporting to be executed August 4th, 1835, by Macy to Dodd and Hoxie, are not, then, valid deeds \u2014 being signed by only one witness \u2014 for want of conformity to the statute requirements in the mode of execution under the act of April 12th, 1827.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-6\">It will also be seen by sec. 7 of the same act, that in the case of land lying in Michigan, deeds therefor \u201cmade and executed\u201d in another state, \u201cshall be acknowledged, and proved, and certified, according to, and in conformity with, the laws and usages\u201d of the state in which they shall be acknowledged or proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-7\">The statute of New York in force at the time these deeds were executed, did not authorize the record of a deed in any county except that in which the officer resided, when the acknowledgment was taken before a commissioner, without its being \u201c certified by the county clerk under his seal of office,\u201d \u201cspecifying\u201d that the commissioner \u201cwas duly authorized to take the same,\u201d and that the signature to his certificate was genuine. \u2014 R. <em>S. of N. Y. </em>1830, <em>vol. </em>1, <em>p. </em>746, <em>sec. </em>4, <em>sub. </em>1<em>; p. </em>749, <em>sec. </em>18.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-8\">The case of <em>Ives v. </em>Kimball, 1 <em>Mich. </em>308, presented a different point. The objection there was not the absence of the certificate, but that the fact should be proved at the trial. The court, in that case, and in <em>Lacy v. </em>Davis, 4 <em>Mich. </em>150, appear to have overlooked the fact that, by sec. 7 of the Michigan statute, the deed should be acknowledged -and-certified in conformity with the laws of New York, and that by sec. 18 of the New York statute, such a deed could not be recorded in any other county in the state, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>being \u201ccertified\u201d by the county clerk, if taken by a commis\u25a0\u2022sioner, or a county judge not a counsellor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-5\">The deeds being defective in the statute requirements as '\u25a0to execution, the record was wholly unauthorized and void, and is no evidence of' the execution of such deeds, and no \u25a0notice to Abbott or his grantees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-6\">The same consequence will follow, if our position be correct, that these deeds were not so \u201cacknowledged and certified\u201d as to entitle them to be recorded. \u2014 <em>Wing v.

But if not entitled to record,, then, though, recorded in fact, the record is notice to no one,, and Dodd and Hoxie, and their grantees, are barred of all' rights of redemption by the foreclosure against Macy alone;all the mortgaged premises having been purchased by the other defendants from Abbott, and neither he nor his-, grantees- having any notice of the titles in question, aside fi\u2018om the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">These deeds purport to have been executed in the state of New York, and each has but a single witness, who is, the same person before whom the acknowledgment was taken*</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The defendants insist that these deeds were not entitled to record, <em>First, </em>Because not properly acknowledged and certified, according to the laws of the state of New York, and the seventh section of the territorial act of Michigan, of April 12th, 182V <em>(Compilation of </em>1888, <em>p. </em>281, efic.); and, <em>Second, </em>If duly acknowledged and certified, they could not be legally recorded, because not attested by two witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The first ground of objection we think wholly untenable. It is fully met by the decision of this court in <em>Ives v. Kim-ball, </em>1 <em>Mich. </em>308, which arose under the same law. The only circumstance which might distinguish that case from the present (as relates to this point), is, that in that case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>the acknowledgment was taken before a judge of the Court of Common Pleas, wb\u00f1e in tbe case before us it was before a commissioner. The provision, of the New York Revised Statutes <em>(.Edition of </em>1836, <em>vol. </em>1, <em>p. </em>'749, <em>section </em>eighteen), to which we are referred, and which requires a clerk\u2019s certificate to a commissioner\u2019s acknowledgment when the deed is to be recorded in another county, manifestly has no application to this case, as it only applies when the deed is to be recorded in some other county of <em>that state. </em>This clerk\u2019s certificate is no part of the acknowledgment, or of the certificate of acknowledgment. The latter under' section seven of the is the only certificate required territorial act. The question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>hero is, whether the acknowledgment, and the <em>certificate of such </em>acknowledgment, were in accordance with the laws of New York. TJpon this question we can not entertain a doubt. We think, therefore, the deeds were sufficiently acknowledged and certified to entitle them to record here, if they could be recorded with a single witness only.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">But the question still remains, whether the deeds were entitled to record with but a single subscribing witness. .</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">This question depends entirely upon the territorial statute originally adopted by the Governor and Judges, March 27th, 1820, from the laws of five of the original states <em>{Laws of </em>1820, <em>p. </em>156, <em>et seq.), </em>re-enacted without altera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>tion (so far as this point is involved), April 12th, 1827 <em>(Laws of </em>1827, <em>p. </em>258; <em>and Laws of </em>1883, <em>p. </em>279), and in force at the time the deeds in question were made and recorded. \"We say the question depends entirely upon this statute, because it was the only statute in force upon the subject, and because, though statutes <em>in pari materia </em>often shed much light upon the true construction of a particular statute in a doubtful case, yet, in the present case, we think the legislative intent can be easily deduced from this statute itself, and if it could not, such is the peculiar nature of the case, that little .light could be derived either from prior or subsequent legislation. Little from the for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>mer, as this was tbe first act of the legislative power of the territory in reference to the material questions here in-, volved. And whether the provision of the Ordinance requiring two witnesses (until other provisions should be made by the territorial laws) was, or was not, in force when this act was adopted, it ceased <em>upon its </em>adoption, and its prior existence can furnish no safe inference in itself, whether the policy of that Ordinance in this'respect was intended to be <em>continued </em>or <em>changed </em>by the act. The one inference might be as probable as the other, and the question can only be settled by the provisions of the act itself Quite as little light is to be derived from subsequent legislation; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>because, <em>First, </em>There was no subsequent act on the subject till after these deeds were executed and recorded, and a legislative construction could have little effect upon prior transactions; and, <em>Second, </em>The subsequent legislation so entirely changed and re-changed the law relative to witnesses, and deeds executed out of the state, that the principal inference to be drawn from this subsequent legislation as to the understanding or intention, of the Legislature in reference to this act, is, that' they were not satisfied with the law as it was, and therefore chose to alter it by making a different provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The question must, therefore, be settled by an analysis of the provisions of the act itself; and its solution will be found to depend mainly upon the first and seventh sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The first section provides \u201cThat all deeds or other conveyances of any lands, tenements, or hereditaments, lying in this territory, signed and sealed by the parties granting the same, having good and lawful right and authority thereunto, and signed by two or more witnesses, and acknowledged by such grantor or grantors, or proved, and recorded, as hereinafter provided, shall he good and valid to pass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>the same lands, tenements, or hereditaments, to the grantee or grantees, without any other act or ceremony in law whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Whether a deed without two witnesses would be invalid to pass the title <em>inter </em>partes, under this -section, is a question upon which we express no .opinion, as it is not involved in the case. But whether it relates to the validity of the deed <em>inter </em>partes, or only to its validity for the purposes of registry, for which provision is made in the subsequent sections, can make little difference here: whether it relates to the one or the other, or to both, we are satisfied from the nature of the provision, and the whole scope of the act \u2014 the obvious design of which was to provide <em>a system </em>for the conveyance of lands and the registry of deeds, which should be complete in itself \u2014 that this see, tion must be construed as exclusive in its operation, though there are no negative words; and this is abundantly shown by the following authorities, cited by the counsel of the defendants.\u2014 <em>Wiswall v. Ross, </em>4 <em>Port. Ala. </em>321; <em>Claris v, Graham, </em>6 <em>Wheat. 577; Alston v. Thompson, </em>1 <em>Cheves, </em>271; <em>Gorham v. Daniels, </em>23 <em>Vt. </em>600.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">But if this provision, touching the validity of the deed, relates only to its validity for the purpose of registry (and, it certainly relates to <em>this, </em>whether it has any greater extent or not), no one can doubt that, in <em>this respect </em>at least, the provision is exclusive, and no deed included under this section could be recorded without two witnesses. There was no registry at common law; and so far as this pro-, vision relates to validity for the purpose of registry, it is an <em>enabling act. </em>The validity of the deed for the pur-, pose of registry can extend no further than the affirmative provisions of the statute have extended it; the common law can not supply any omission or deficiency of the statute. The same reasoning will apply to, and the same conclusion result from, the provisions of section seven, touching the validity of deeds there mentioned. We can not, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>resist the conclusion that to authorize the registry of a deed under this statute, it must be a valid deed under this statute, and that its validity must depend upon the <em>affirmative provisions </em>of the <em>statute itself; </em>unless, indeed, the statute has in some way recognized a common law deed as susceptible of record \u2014 a point which we shall consider in the proper place.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">But do the provisions of this section, in reference to the execution and attestation of deeds, extend to the deeds mentioned in the seventh section? The language of the first section is general, and on its face purports to apply to all deeds affecting lands in the territory; and must therefore be applied to all the deeds mentioned in the act, unless clearly limited to a part only, by some subsequent .provision. It is also apparent that while this section purports to prescribe rules for the execution and attestation of all deeds affecting lands in the territory, it has made no provision for the mode of acknowledgment, or proof (as a substitute for acknowledgment), or registry, of the deeds mentioned in it; but for provisions touching these subjects it <em>exp'essly refers </em>to the subsequent provisions of the act, by the clause \u201cand acknowledged, or proved, and recorded, as <em>hereinafter provided.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">This reference would seem to extend to all the subsequent provisions of the act on the subject of acknowledgment or proof and registry, and plainly to indicate that all the deeds and conveyances for the acknowledgment or proof and registry, of which provision is made in any subsequent Section, were understood to be included among the deeds and conveyances mentioned in this section, unless this reference should be found to be limited by some subsequent provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The subsequent provisions relating \u2022 to the acknowledgment or proof and registry are to be found in sections two, three, four, six, and seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Section two (which will be noticed more fully hereafter) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>provides for the acknowledgment or proof of deeds <em>within </em>the territory only, requires them to be recorded, and prescribes the consequences of omitting to record them. It makes no provision for acknowledgment or proof out of the territory, nor does it prescribe the order or manner o\u00ed recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Section three provides for a register of deeds in the city \u25a0of Detroit.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Section four provides for the acknowledgment of deeds of married women: 1st, those <em>residing in </em>the territory; 2d, those <em>residing toithout </em>the territory; and authorizes the recording of deeds of the latter class.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Section six, provides that \u201c <em>all </em>deeds,\u201d &amp;c., entitled to be recorded \u201cby virtue of <em>this act,\u201d </em>shall be recorded in the order and within the time therein prescribed ; and makes the deed when recorded, with the register\u2019s certificate on the same, as well as the record, or a transcript thereof, evidence in any court, without further proof. This is the only section which provides for the order or mode of recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Section seven, upon which the questions in this cause mainly depend, is in the following words: \u201cThat all deeds and conveyances of lands, tenements, or hereditaments, situate lying and being within this territory, which shall hereafter be made and executed in any other territory, state, or country, whereby such lands, tenements, or hereditaments shall be conveyed, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected or incumbered in law, shall be acknowledged, and proved, and certified, according to, and in conformity with, the laws and usages of the territory, state, or country, in which such deeds or conveyances were acknowledged or proved, or in which they shall be acknowledged or proved; and all such deeds and conveyances are hereby declared effectual and valid in law, to all intents and purposes, as though the same acknowledgments had been taken, or proof of execution made, within this territory, and in pursuance of the laws thereof; and such deeds and conveyances, so acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>or proved as aforesaid, may be admitted to be, and shall be, recorded in the respective counties in which such lands, tenements, or hereditaments, do or may lie; and all deeds and conveyances of lands, tenements, and hereditaments, situate'lying and being within this territory, which have been acknowledged or proved in any other territory, state, or country, according to, and in compliance with, the laws and usages of such territory, state, or country, and which deeds or conveyances have been recorded within this territory, be and the same are hereby, confirmed and declared effectual and valid in law, to all intents and purposes, as though the said deeds or conveyances, so acknowledged or proved and, recorded, had, prior to being recorded, been acknowledged or proved within this territory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">It is contended by the complainant\u2019s counsel that the general provisions of section one are restrained by the language of section two, so as to include no other deeds than those which are required to be acknowledged under the provisions of section two, and that the reference contained in the language of section one in the clause \u201cas hereinafter provided,\u201d &amp;c., is thereby restrained in like manner; that section seven provides for a class of deeds not included in section one, and is to be treated as complete in itself, providing for the execution, acknowledgment, and registry of all deeds executed out of the territory; and in support of this view (and necessary to its support) it is further contended, that the execution of the deeds mentioned in section seven is sufficiently provided for by the, section itself, either, 1st (as maintained by the counsel who opened the argument), by adopting a common law deed and a common law execution; or, 2d (as urged with much ability by the_ counsel who closed), that this section has adopted, for the purposes of execution, the law of the place of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Let us see whether this construction will fairly harmonize the various provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Is the first section limited by the second as contended? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>It can not be denied that, on a first inspection, confining ourselves strictly to the particular words, \u201call such deeds,\u201d &amp;c., in connection with the provision for acknowledgment within the territory, this view would appear plausible; but Avhen we come to look at the leading idea and main object of the section, in connection with the various provisions which precede and follow it, we do not think this view can be maintained. The leading- idea and chief purpose of this section were not to limit the preceding section, but to provide for the acknowledgment of deeds <em>within </em>the territory, and before officers within the territory; to require such deeds to be recorded, and to prescribe the consequences of a neglect to record. The apparent repugnancy between this section and the preceding, considered with reference to its main scope and professed object, is merely incidental; while to construe it only with reference to the particular words referred to, would create a direct conflict between this section and sections one, six, and seven. The same harmony of transition from one section or one provision to another is, perhaps, hardly to be expected in an act adopted, as this was, from the laws of five separate states, as would be expected in an act prepared and passed, as a whole, by the same legislature. But statutes should always be so construed as to produce the least conflict, and to harmonize, as far as possible, all their provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The construction contended for by the complainant would confine the express general reference in section one (of which we have spoken) exclusively to the deeds mentioned in section two; while it is manifest, we think, that this reference extends also to those mentioned in section six, which latter section obviously includes those mentioned in section seven, as well as those in section two, \u2014 and it is admitted that those mentioned in section two are included in section one. Indeed, we think the reference is quite as clear to section six as to section two; as the sixth section is the only one which provides fully the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>order and manner of recording, and prescribes the effect of the record. If, then, it extends to the deeds mentioned in the sixth section, how can it be claimed not to extend to those mentioned in the seventh, which are included in the sixth?</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The same reference of section one just as evidently extends to the second class of deeds mentioned in section four, which, if executed out of the territory, might, as we think, and as complainant\u2019s counsel contend, be acknowledged or proved out of the territory, under the provisions of section seven. And it can not well be doubted that the same class of deeds might also be acknowledged <em>in </em>the territory under section <em>two.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Section seven refers only to deeds executed out of the territory; and is entirely silent as to the manner of executing or attesting such deeds, but makes full and express provision for the mode of acknowledgment, or proof, and \u2022 the certificate thereof, when taken in any other state or country \u2014 not by adopting the law of the <em>place </em>of execution, but of the <em>place where </em>such <em>acknowledgment </em>or <em>proof </em>may be <em>taken.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\"><em>We </em>cannot suppose that by the terms \u201cdeed or conveyance made and executed\u201d (see section seven) the Legislature intended to adopt a common law deed merely, or the mode of execution at common law. We can see no foundation for such an in_ ference in the language; and there is nothing in the context or general scope of the statute to warrant the inference that they intended to use the terms \u201c deed or conveyance,\u201d in this section in any different sense from that in which the same terms are used in every other portion of the act. Nor can we suppose, especially in the absence of any language indicative of such an intent, that they intended to authorize the recording of deeds, not only without a witness, but without even the signature of the grantor, neither of which was essential at common law\u2014 sealing alone being sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">It may, we think, be safely affirmed that this feature of the common law was never recognized in the territory of Michigan, if in any of the northwestern states; and the construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Which would allow such a deed to be recorded, would certainly violate the rule of construction contended for*by the complainant\u2019s counsel, that the plain and obvious meaning should be 'taken, instead of one only discoverable by professional criticism, for which he cited 23 <em>Pa. St. </em>242.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Again, as already intimated, a married woman residing out 'of the territory, might, by virtue of section four, either execute and acknowledge her deed out of the territory under section seven, or within it under section two; and the construction contended for by complainant would then make the <em>same word, </em>in the <em>same connection </em>and in the <em>same place, </em>mean a common law deed under section seven, or a statute deed under section one, as. it might happen to be acknowledged within or Without the territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">But the construction claimed by one of the complainant\u2019s counsel, that this section has adopted, in reference to the <em>execu~ \u25a0tion </em>of the deed, the law of <em>place of execution, </em>is, if possible, still less tenable. The language of the section precludes any such construction. It has not adopted the law of the place of execution for <em>any </em>purpose; while it has adopted, in the most explicit terms, in reference to the acknowledgment or proof, the law of the place <em>where acknowledged </em>or <em>proved. </em>It is but treasonable to suppose that if it intended to adopt the law of the place of execution, that intention would also have been expressed. The expression of the one is the exclusion of the -other.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Now, the execution of the deed, and the attestation by subscribing witnesses \u2014 whether it be a part of the execution (as we think it is, under this statute) or not, are distinct from the acknowledgment, and complete -without it. And we see no good reason why a deed executed in the state of New York might not, under section seven, be acknowledged or proved in the state of Pennsylvania or Ohio. In such case, the law of the place of execution and the place of acknowledgment would be different, and the latter only would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"AW\">But again: Section seven after providing for the acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>edgment ont of the territory, declares that \u201c all such deeds and conveyances \u201d shall be \u201c as effectual and valid in law, to all intents and purposes, as though the same acknowledgments had been taken, or proof of execution made, within this territory, and in pursuance of the laws thereof.\u201d This necessarily implies that the deed, though executed out of the territory, might have been acknowledged here, and, if so, it must have been under the provisions of section two, as this was the only law under which, any acknowledgment could be taken here; and, in this case,, beyond all controversy, the two witnesses would have been required ; as it is admitted, on all liands, that all the deeds, for-the acknowledgment of which provision is made in section two, are included in, and referred to. by section one.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The conclusions, then, to be drawn from an analysis of the statute, are that the reference in section one extends to the deeds mentioned in section seven; that, consequently, the deeds mentioned in section seven are included among those for the execution and attestation of which provision is made in the first section; and that the seventh section, being silent on the subject of execution and attestation, and only providing for acknowledgment or proof, a deed with but a single witness Avould be of no greater validity for the purposes of registry, when acknowledged out of the territory under section seven, than if the same deed, so attested, had been acknowledged within the territory under section tAvo.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Let us now see if this final conclusion is not expressed in plain and unmistakable terms in the language of section seven itself. After having made provision for the acknowledgment or proof of deeds out of the territory, it adopts the following language already quoted \u2014 \u201c and all such deeds, and conveyances are hereby declared effectual and valid in law, to ah intents and purposes, <em>as though the same acknowledgments had leen </em>taken, <em>or proof of execution </em>made, <em>within this </em>territory, <em>and in pursuance of the laws thereof.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\"><em>We </em>are compelled to regard this as a plain and direct Statute enactment of the conclusion at which Ave have already arrived by analysis of the Avhole act.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>It declares just liow far such deeds shall be valid; not to all intents and purposes, but to the <em>same extent </em>as if the same \u25a0deed had been acknowledged \u201cin this territory, and in pursuance of the laws thereof.\u201d No reference could be more direct to the provisions of section two of this act, 'which was the \u25a0only law under which the acknowledgment could be -taken in the territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The test question then is, Had these deeds from Macy to Dodd and Hoxie, with but a single subscribing witness, been acknowledged in the territory under section two of this act, would they have been valid deeds, for the purpose of registry ? Clearly they would not, since it is not, and can not be, denied that all the deeds for the acknowledgment or proof of which provision is made hi the second section, are included in the first section, and must -be executed according to the provisions of the latter to entitle them to record.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">We think, therefore, that whatever doubt might be entertained whether the reference hi section one extends to section 'seven, there can be little doubt that the language of section seven, above quoted, refers directly to section two, and, through that, to section one, for all that is essential to entitle a deed to record, except the acknowledgment or proof, and certificate, provided for in the seventh section. A similar limitation as to validity, and a similar reference to the first two sections of the act, are contained in the latter part of the seventh section,, in reference to deeds previously acknowledged out of the territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The language referred to is too plain and explicit, and the whole provision too cautiously worded, especially when twice used in the same section, to have been the result of accident or mistake. At all events, if a mistake, it is one which this court can not correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">We are, therefore, of opinion that the deeds from Macy to Dodd and Hoxie were not entitled to be recorded; that, though recorded in fact, the record was notice to no one; and, therefore, that Macy and his grantees were barred of the right \u25a0of redemption by the foreclosure suit against Macy alone. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>For these reasons the decree of the court below, dismissing the bill, must be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b46-5\">Martin Oh.
