S. Getchell, Agent\u201d; that witness had previously endorsed his paper, both for defendant\u2019s business and for defendant\u2019s private purposes; that, by contract, witness had agreed to furnish defendant in his business four thousand dollars, in cash or endorsements, if the legitimate business of his concern required it; that he never refused to advance or endorse for defendant when his legitimate business required; that said contract was in force December 10th, and that witness\u2019 advances and endorsements at that time did not amount to four thousand dollars; that witness was never a partner with defendant; that the advances and endorsements of witness had not at any time amounted to four thousand dollars; that he was to be a participator in the profits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the business carried on by the name of \u201cW. S. Getchell Agent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-5\">The defendant then offered to prove a partnership between Strong and defendant: That Strong was liable for losses; that he was to furnish moneys and endorsements to the amount of four thousand dollars; that the notes alluded to were used in payment of liabilities of said concern, and that defendant had a right so to use them; and that said Strong did acknowledge his liability as a partner by payment of accounts of said concern, of which said Strong and Getchell were members. This was objected to by the prosecution, and was ruled out by the court, and an exception was taken by the prisoner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-6\">The attorney for the defendant then asked said witness the following question: \u201cHave you paid any accounts of said concern within the life, of the contract between you and defendant?\u201d To which the prosecuting attorney objected, and the court sustained the objection, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-7\">The defendant then asked witness the following questions: \u201cWas defendant irresponsible on December 10th and 11th?\u201d \u201cHave you not refused to endorse for the defendant at any time during the lifetime of said contract?\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Have you not stated that you were unable to put in as much as you were obliged to by contract, in carrying on said business?\u201d All of which were severally objected to by the prosecuting attorney, and the court sustained the objections, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-8\">The witness then, on further cross-examination, testified, that on said December 10th the defendant ought to have been more responsible than when he signed the contract with witness. Defendant said when he went into the business he was worth nothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-9\">The defendant then asked the witness: \u201cHad defendant told you during last summer that the concern was losing money, and he wanted to give up the business?\u201d To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>which the prosecuting attorney objected, and the court sustained the objection, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-5\">The prosecuting attorney, further to maintain said issue, produced as a witness <em>W. H. Goodenow, </em>who, among other things, gave evidence tending to corroborate said Strong as to representations made by defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-6\">The defendant then, to prove the issue on his part, recalled said Goodenow, who testified that defendant had been doing business for about three years as agent of Strong; that he had there the written contract between said Strong and defendant; which witness then produced to the court, and of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-7\"><em>\"Memorandum of </em>Agreement, made this 1st day of July, A.d. 1857, between H.

I said \u2018No, as I sujiposed he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the man to pay the note, as he had defendant\u2019s assets.\u2019 He said the goods which had been in defendant\u2019s store were his, and he had taken them.

In the afternoon of the same day I again saw Strong; he then said he had waived protest on the note, and expected to pay it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-5\">The defendant then gave in evidence by <em>W.

If Strong was bound to advance the endorsement, there could be no fraud, and therefore no intent to defraud, in procuring it.\u2014 3 <em>Arch. Or.

The obtaining of a signature to such paper, by false pretences, to be used for a jourpose not known or consented to by the signer, is defrauding him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-11\">' In all cases a man shall be presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act; and where the act is an unlawful one, criminal intent is presumed. In the class of cases under consideration, it is not necessary to show any use of the paper obtained, or any loss or probable loss by reason of it. The crime is committed by obtaining such paper by false pretences, and with the view of any unlawful use of it. A man is defrauded by the fact that his paper is thus obtained, and may be unlawfully used for purposes without his consent or knowledge. \u2014 <em>People v.

Thomas, </em>3 <em>Hill, </em>169, cited by defense, was considered not to be a case of obtaining the money by false pretences, on the ground that the money was due. It might quite as well have been put on the ground that the motive of paying the money was rather to discharge an admitted debt than because of the falsehood. The case of <em>Rex v. Williams, 7 C. &amp; P. </em>355, it is submitted, is not law. This, case is, in effect, the device of a creditor to collect a debt from an unwilling debtor, and is placed on the supposed latitude which that fact justifies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-8\">We can not find any -sound principles of law to sustain it. We do not believe that because a man claims a debt of another, which that other refuses to pay, the creditor may, by falsehood or crime, obtain property or chattels from the debtor. By such an act he legally and morally <em>defrauds </em>him of the property in question. It will not do to say that this wrong balances the wrongful withholding of the debt. The two wrongs do not make a right.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b503-9\">Martin Ch. J. :</author>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">We think the Recorder erred in excluding the evidence offered by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">The indictment charges that on the 11th of December, 1858, he, by means of false pretences, obtained the en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>dorsement of Strong to a note of one hundred and fifty dollars made by himself. The statute under which the indictment was found provides that <em>\u201c </em>every person who, with intent to defraud or cheat another, shall designedly, by color of any false token or writing, or by any other false pretence, obtain the signature of any person to any written instru, ment, the making- whereof would be punishable as forgery, or obtain from any person any money, personal property or valuable thing, shall be punished,\u201d &amp;c. \u2014 2 <em>Comp. I. </em>\u00a75183.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The object of the defense in this case, in offering the rejected evidence, was to show that there was no intent to cheat or defraud \u2014 the untruth of the pretence being admitted. A falsehood does not necessarily imply an intent to defraud, for it may be uttered to secure a right, and, however much and severely it may be reprobated in ethics, the law does not assume to punish moral delinquencies as such. To defraud is to deprive another of a right, of property or of money, and this may be accomplished by falsehood, by withholding the right or property, or by force. In the present case, the prosecutor insists that he was defrauded because he was induced to endorse a note by the false representation of the defendant that a prior note for the same amount, endorsed by him, was defective, and had been destroyed; that he was thereby induced to lend his name for double the amount he otherwise would. The simple fact of procuring by falsehood the endorsement, was not an offense within the statute; it must have been\" procured with the intent to defraud, and, where an intent is made the gist of an offense, that intent must be shown by such evidence as, uncontradicted, will fairly authorise it to be presumed beyond a reasonable doubt. It is true that a man is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his acts, but, under this statute, it is not the consequence but the intention, which fixes the crime. There are no <em>natural </em>consequences, strictly speaking, to this act. It is itself an indifferent act, as the consequences will depend upon what he does with the paper, and this will depend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>upon his will \u2014 in other words, his intent. It was, therefore, necessary for the prosecutor to show something more than the application, the falsehood, and the endorsement, before he could ask a conviction; he should have shown those facts which, in the absence of all other proof, would warrant the jury in finding an intent to defraud; unless such intent is fairly to be inferred from the circumstances attending the act itself. If the fact of negotiating both notes would justify such a finding, yet the presumption thus raised might be repelled by the defendant, by exhibiting in evidence such a state of facts as would show that fraud was not designed, or could not have resulted. This he attempted to do by showing the relations of himself and Strong, the obligation Of Strong to endorse his paper,' his refusal to do so notwithstanding his contract, the necessity for the money for their joint benefit, and the appropriation of the avails of the note in their business, and according to the terms of their agreement. All this was refused, and the evidence offered for that purpose ruled out.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">We think this evidence would legitimately tend to disprove the presumption of an intent to defraud, and should have been allowed to go to the jury to enable them to determine <em>quo animo </em>the endorsement was procured.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">These considerations render an examination of the other errors assigned unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">A new trial should be granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b505-8\">Christiancy and Campbell JJ. concurred.</judges>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">Manning J.:</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">When, by false pretences, the signature of a person is obtained to a written instrument, where the signing of the name by a third person to such instrument would be punishable as forgery, the law implies an intent to cheat or defraud; and nothing more need be shown to warrant a conviction. But the fraudulent intent implied from the act itself is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>conclusive on the party. He may show there was in fact no intention to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The Recorder seems to have erred in supposing the implication of law was conclusive, and not <em>prima facie </em>evidence only, of the criminal intent. In this I think he erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\n<em>New trial ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
