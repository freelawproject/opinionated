The refusal was no error. It is not shown that upon a hearing the motions were granted, and it is reasonable to conclude they were not. The exceptions to the court\u2019s charge do not show to have been presented at the proper time and are. further believed by us to be without merit. Special charges Nos. 10 and 11 were given. We have examined the- other charges asked and find them either covered by the main charge or not supported by testimony, and we do not believe error appears in the refusal of any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">We have examined and considered each of the numerous bills of exception and are of opinion that a discussion of none of them would be and said to the profession nor clarity any point of practice. None of them manifest error. Several bills are attempted to be proven by bystanders. Each of said bills is proved up only by two bystanders, which is not sufficient. Osborne v. State, 56 S. W. Rep. 54. Said bills are further defective in not sufficiently showing that the trial court refused to approve them. Landrum v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep. 666; Johnson v. State, 59 S. W. Rep. 900.</p>\n<p id=\"Atd\">The court heard evidence on the presentation of the motion for new trial sought because of misconduct of the jury, and his action in refusing said motion presents no abuse of the discretion confided to him in such matters. We do not think the evidence need be set out. It amply showed both the manufacture and storage of intoxicating <em>liquor or </em>premises controlled by appellant and his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b452-10\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b452-11\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AfsR\">Appellant insists that the indictment was defective and should have been quashed in response to his motion because duplicitous, that is, it charged two separate and distinct offenses in one count, viz: the unlawful keeping of his premises for the purpose of storing liquor, \u2014 and also the unlawful keeping of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>said premises lor the purpose o\u00ed manufacturing liquor. The indictment charged appellant with keeping his premises to be used for the purpose of storing and manufacturing liquor. The gist of the offense is the keeping of his premises for an unlawful purpose, as said by this court in Wimberly v. State, 95 Texas Crim. Rep. 102. The principle involved is altogether different from that in Todd v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep. 99, and Melley v. State, 93 Texas Crim. Rep. 522. It is as though one charged with an assault with a knife, a bludgeon and a pistol, should object to the indictment because it set out different means by which the offense might have been committed, in the same count. In See. 508 of Mr. Branch\u2019s Annotated P. C. many authorities are cited in support of the proposition that where several ways by which an offense may be committed are set' forth in the same statute, and they are embraced in the same general definition and are punishable in the same manner and to the same extent, and are not repugnant to each other, they may be charged conjunctively in the same count.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\">A bill of exceptions to the refusal to charge the jury not to consider certain argument of State\u2019s attorney, which contains no showing of the fact that such argument was in fact made, other than the statement that it was objected to, brings nothing before us. We are not permitted to verify the allesaions of one bill by reference to those of another. Banks v. State, 62 Texas Crim. Rep. 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">We find nothing in the statute defining the offense charged against appellant which requires allegation or proof that the storing forbidden, in order to be penal, must be for \u201cpurposes of sale.\u2019,\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Nor are we able to agree that the law requiring the use of jury wheels in certain counties, restricts the selection of qualified jurors or disfranchises them. Art 5152 of the chapter of our civil statutes regarding the jury wheel, specifically requires that the officers charged with the duty of filling said wheel shall write the names of \u201call men who are known to be qualified jurors under the law\u2019\u2019 in such county on separate cards; Art. 5153 of said chapter commands that all of said cards shall be placed in the wheel. We are unable to comprehend how this could be in any sense restrictive or disfranchising. All qualifed jurors cannot sit in any given case. There must be provided means of selection. That under discussion takes the entire body of the jurors of the county and seems to us to provide a fair means of selecting from them juries for the week and venires.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Being unable to agree with any of the contentions of appellant, his motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
