H. Schronstein; the second count charged him with fraudulently receiving and concealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the property from one V. Carlin, knowing it to have been theretofore stolen. The first count only was submitted to the jury. Schronstein was a merchant in the city of Galveston. Two suits of clothing were stolen from his store, aggregating more than fifty dollars in value. One suit was found in appellant\u2019s possession, another in the possession of one Joe Villa, who had purchased it from appellant. The State used as a witness, Vidal Carlin, a youth fourteen -or fifteen years of age. He was working in the store for Schronstein at the time of the theft, and testified that appellant told him if he did not get him a pair of pants from the store he (appellant) \u201cwould get\u201d witness; that some two or three weeks later appellant told witness to get him some suits of clothing from the store; that he did take the two suits in question on Saturday, taking one out of the store about three o\u2019clock, and hiding it back of the store in a box, and about a half an hour later, took the other suit and hid it in the box; that after he quit work at six o\u2019clock, he met appellant, and took him to the back of the store and turned the clothing over to him. This witness also testified that he had taken some thirteen pairs of pants and some five or six shirts from the store, taking them one at a time and hiding them, and later turning them over to appellant; that sometimes appellant would give him money for. taking the clothes, and sometimes he did not; that for the two suits of clothes appellant gave eleven dollars to witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\">The point is made that the. undisputed evidence does not make appellant guilty as a principal in the theft of the property, but only as an accomplice to the theft, or as a receiver of stolen property, and that for such reason the conviction can not stand. The State\u2019s attorney agrees with this view of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Appellant was not present when the theft was committed. He was doing nothing in furtherance of its commission. Vidal had no interest in the proceeds of the stolen property when disposed of by appellant. He understood that appellant would take the stolen property and perhaps give him some amount for it, although this did not appear to be always the ease. <em>We </em>think these facts exclude the idea that appellant was a principal in the theft.
