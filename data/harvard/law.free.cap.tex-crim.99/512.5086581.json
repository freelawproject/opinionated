Just prior to the expiration of this sixty day period appellant obtained an order from the court granting him additional time in which to file a statement of facts, which said order contains no mention of the bills of exception. The five bills of exception appearing in this record were each filed on January 13th following the adjournment of court. Manifestly they were filed too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Two witnesses testified for the State that they found appellant occupied in working at a part of the machinery of a still which was in operation. The still was of about 150 gallon capacity, and from its worm whiskey was running into a barrel nearly half full of the liquor. Appellant was his own only witness and denied having anything to do with the still, but averred that his presence there was for the sole purpose of getting a drink. The evidence supports the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b567-14\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b567-15\">LATTIMORE, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AAo\">Appellant seeks a rehearing in order that he may have inserted into the order of the trial court extending <em>the </em>time for filing statement of facts and bills of exception, certain things which he now insists were omitted from said order as it appears on the minutes. <em>We </em>know of no way by which the trial court, after appeal and affirmance here, may change his orders made during the trial term. When the record on appeal differs from the record made in the trial court, by agreement, or if necessary by writ of certiorari, this court can have the record here corrected to correspond with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>record in the trial court, but we regret that we know of no way by which we can afford appellant the relief sought, and in as much as his contention is based entirely upon that proposition, the motion must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
