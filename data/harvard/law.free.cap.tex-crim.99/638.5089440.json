No exceptions appear to have been reserved to such refusal. Numerous exceptions were taken to the court\u2019s main charge. In the absence of a statement of facts we are not able to appraise the force of these exceptions.

It further appearing to the court that the indictment correctly charges appellant in the second count thereof with the offense of receiving and concealing stolen property of the value of $200.00 and that said count was properly submitted by the court in his charge to the jury, and that the jury returned a verdict of guilty under said count, the judgment is reformed finding appellant guilty of receiving and concealing stolen property of the value of more than $50.00 and that he be confined in the state penitentiary for a period of two years, and as reformed the judgment is ordered affirmed. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
