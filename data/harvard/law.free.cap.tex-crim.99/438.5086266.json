The learned trial judge made an order overruling said plea. There appears no bill of exceptions complaining that such plea was not submitted to the jury. Appellant also made what is denominated \u201cA motion to dismiss,\u201d alleging that in cause No.8640 (containing the three same counts above referred to), he had been tried and convicted. The trial court overruled this motion. There are three bills of exception, the first of which was taken to the refusal of the motion to dismiss. We are in doubt as to the correctness of such practice as the filing of such motion to dismiss, which was addressed to the court. However, if such practice be proper, the court was called on to decide the questions thus presented. It appears that a complete still was found in appellant\u2019s car, which finding formed the basis of the prosecution for the possession and transportation of the still.1 It also appears that at a different time and place1 eight barrels of mash belonging to appellant were found and this transaction was made the basis of the prosecution for the possession and manufacture of said mash. Appellant made a written confession admitting that he had the still and that he purposed making whiskey on same out of said mash. Not only do these things show two entirely separate and distinct offenses, but in support of the motion to dismiss it was not shown that the judgment in cause No. 8640 was a final judgment, and no effort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>seems to have been made to submit the matters involved to the jury. If called on to act on such a motion, we think the action of the trial court in overruling it entirely correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\">No error appears in the complaint of the reception of evidence showing that on the same day on which officers found the eight barrels of mash with which appellant was shown to have been connected, he was found in Terrell, some four and one-half miles from tvhere the mash was located, and that in Terrell he had a still in his car. An element of the offense of possession, transportation, etc. of mash is, that it was made, etc., for the purpose of manufacturing intoxicating liquor. Appellant\u2019s possession of a still in the same neighborhood and about the same time as that of the mash, would be a circumstance tending to make plain his purpose and intention in regard to the mash.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">We do not comprehend the third bill which presents objection to the introduction of testimony of the finding of the two wagons with the barrels of mash in them on the same day appellant was found with the still in his car. The offense here on trial was the making of said mash. The finding of same and the showing of appellant\u2019s connection therewith were the material facts involved in the instant-prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">No error appearing, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b462-8\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AfG\">Appellant insists that we erred in what we said, and also in that we did not say anything about his third bill of exceptions. We are satisfied that what we said was correct, and we did not discuss said third bill of exceptions because of our belief that it was taken under a misapprehension. It is now insisted that we should discuss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Appellant was on trial for manufacturing mash. Bill No. 3 recites that certain witnesses having sworn that they found appellant in a car with a still in boxes, were also asked if they found anything in a wagon about four and one-half miles from there on Sunday morning, the same day the still was found in appellant\u2019s car. This was objected to for the reason that appellant was being tried for transporting a still and equipment, etc., and that to prove that he was seen that same morning four and one-half miles away with mash in barrels in a wagon, had no bearing on the issue; that the court overruled the objection and permitted Mr. Carter to swear that he found two barrels of mash in the wagon on that day and that appellant was trying to drive said wagon down the road, etc. The terms of the bill manifest the fact that it has no application. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>and we are still of opinion that it was taken under a misapprehension. In manifests no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
