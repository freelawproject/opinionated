IT. S. Lattimore, Judge of the 96th District Court, sitting as a Juvenile Court in Tarrant County, entered a judgment declaring the relator an incorrigible and committing him to the State Juvenile Training School at Gatesville for a period of not less than two nor more than five years, from which judgment we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-17\">* \u00ab i0 which sentence defendant excepts and give\u00e1 notice of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-18\">This application is based upon the proposition that the complaint upon which the appellant was charged was not filed in the District Court but in the County Court. There are other averments of alleged irregularities.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-19\">It has been held by this court that an appeal from a judgment entered by a court having prima facie jurisdiction of the person and the offense cannot be substituted by a writ of habeas corpus. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Ex parte McKay, 82 Texas Crim. Rep. 221; Ex parte Burkhart, 94 Texas Crim. Rep. 583. County and district courts, when sitting in juvenile eases, are designated \u201cjuvenile courts\u201d. See Art. 1198, C. C. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In the present case, the judgment rendered is by a court of competent jurisdiction, and according to its recitals, it acquired jurisdiction of the person of the relator. Prom its judgment an appeal lies according to the express language of the statute. See Art. 1197, C. C. P. If the procedure by which the jurisdiction was acquired is faulty, the error is one which could be corrected upon appeal. We must therefore decline to review it upon an application for a writ of habeas corpus. Accordingly the application for such writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"A0X2\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
