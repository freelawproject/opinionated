The second was dismissed by order of the court before proceeding to trial. The first and third were submitted to the jury and conviction was under the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Omitting formal parts it charges that appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">\u201c* * * did then and there unlawfully make and post threats and signs by then and there posting what is commonly known as the regalia and robes of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan then and there consisting and being composed of a white robe and hood for the body and head of any person then wearing the same, to do personal violence to E. T. McDonald with the intention of causing the said E. T. McDonald to abandon the said County of Potter, in the State of Texas, in which said county and State the said E. T. McDonald then and there resided ; * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">A motion to quash addressed to the indictment generally was overruled. After conviction a motion in arrest of judgment attacking specially said third count was presented but not sustained. The substance of both motions is that the allegations are too vague, uncertain and indefinite to charge and do not charge an offense under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">We have been favored with no brief either for the state or appellant. The only case in which the statute in question has been construed coming to our notice is Dunn v. State, 43 Texas Crim. Rep., 25, 63 S. W. <em>573, </em>and the facts of that case are so dissimilar to those in the present instance as to give us little aid. The meaning of the word \u201cpost\u201d in its usual acceptation is \u201cto attach to a post, a wall, or other usual place of affixing public notices; to placard; as to <em>post </em>a notice; to <em>post </em>playbills; to advertise.\u201d (Webster\u2019s International Dictionary.) The statute would seem to provide: (a) that any person who posts any anonymous notice, or makes any threats or signs to do personal violence to another with intent to cause the latter to abandon his residence, etc., (b) or who by any other method <em>posts </em>any character or style of notice or threat to do personal violence to another with such intent, shall be guilty of whitecapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">There is no allegation of any anonymous notice or threat being posted, but the regalia and 'robes of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan are alleged to have been posted, which according to the pleader constituted as a matter of law \u201cthreats and signs\u201d to do personal violence. The mere alleging that the \u201cregalia and robes\u201d of the Klan were \u201cposted,\u201d in the absence of some explanatory averments, conveys no in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>formation to accused or to the court as to how such act constituted a \u201cthreat\u201d or \u201csign\u201d to do personal violence to McDonald.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Again, if it should be charged that a notice or sign or written threat was \u201cposted\u201d it would convey intelligence under the ordinary and usual meaning of \u201cpost\u201d as to what had occurred, as was clear in the Dunn case (supra) where a coffin and scaffold with a man hanging thereon, were drawn with the words \u201cJim Owens went to Hell June 20th, 1900,\u201d Owens being the party to whom the notice was sent. But when it is charged that the thing \u201cposted\u201d were the regalia and robes of the Klan, \u2014 articles of wearing apparel not ordinarily associated with \u201cpost\u201d in its usual meaning, \u2014 it left accused, and leaves this court, to speculate and wonder what was done with the \u201cregalia and robes\u201d that would support an allegation that they were \u201cposted.\u201d Were they hung on the door knob, the wall of appellant\u2019s residence, or were they suspended from a tree in his yard? Who can tell from the indictment? When we go to the facts developed by the state it becomes even more apparent that no information was conveyed by the indictment as to what was relied on by the state to support its allegations. It appears that appellant was a member of the Klan; that on the night of the alleged offense he secured eight robes and hoods ostensibly to be used in a parade in a neighboring city. Instead of so using them he and six other persons,\u2014 without knowledge or authority of the Klan or its officers, \u2014 sought a conference with McDonald, at which he was by word of- mouth threatened with personal violence unless he left Potter County within twenty-four ho'urs. No personal violence was done him at this time. Appellant and his companions wore the robes and hoods at this conference. This constituted the alleged \u201cposting of the regalia charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The certainty required in indictments has so often been discussed a review of the subject is not called for. Many authorities are collated in Section 493 Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., sustaining the principle that the indictment should apprise the defendant of the charge against him, and be sufficiently specific as to enable him to plead a judgment thereunder in bar of another prosecution; and in Section 494 is the further correct proposition that, \u2014 \u201cIt is not always sufficient to follow the language of the statute. There are cases that require greater particularity, either from the obvious intention of the Legislature or from the application of known principles of law,\u201d \u2014 also supported by many collated cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The conduct of one who in disguise threatens personal violence to another is reprehensible whatever the purpose be, but the terms of the statute invoked in this case\u2019cannot be extended beyond its legitimate scope or proper construction to meet such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">For the reasons already given the judgment must be reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
