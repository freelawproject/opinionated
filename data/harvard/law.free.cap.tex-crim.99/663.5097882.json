Taken as a whole, we think the charge is somewhat confusing. His defense should have. been submitted in an affirmative manner. Clevenger v. State, 96 Texas Crim. Rep. 23 and cases cited. The burden did not rest upon the appellant to prove his innocence. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>was entitled to an acquittal if from any source there was evidence in the record which left in the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt as to whether he was transporting the liquor for medicinal purposes. This principle of law, couched in appropriate language, should have been given in the charge to the jury. Jones v. State, 257 S. W. Re. 895, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">State\u2019s counsel concedes the charge to be faulty in the particulars mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">For the reason stated, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
