Appellant left her at her father\u2019s home, telling her that he would come back that afternoon,, but he did not come back. She said she was seven months advanced in pregnancy at that time, and had since given birth to a child. She also testified that since their separation appellant had not contributed to her support, but averred that she did not know why. Also that since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>that time she had gotten a divorce from appellant and at the time of the trial was living with her father, who was taking care of her and her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">An examination of the record discloses that no testimony whatever was heard by the court or jury relative to appellant\u2019s financial condition or his ability to take care of his wife and child, nor is it shown that there was not sufficient cause for the separation. The statute under which this prosecution was had provides that the abandonment must be wilful and without justification, and- the burden is on the State to show these facts. In order to measure up to the requirement that a continued abandonment be shown to be wilful, we are of opinion that there should be some showing of ability on the part of the accused to pay or contribute to the support of his wife; there would hardly seem to be proof of a wilful failure to contribute unless there be some such showing.
