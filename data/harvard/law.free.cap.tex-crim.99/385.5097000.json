Appellant objected to the remark, and the court instructed the jury to disregard it. We fail to find anything in the bill showing that the appellant did not become a witness. Complaint of the refusal of the accused to testify cannot be sustained when it is not shown by the bill that the accused did not testify. Quinney v. State, 86 Texas Crim. Rep. 358, 216 S. W. Rep. 882; Tillman v. State, 225 S. W. Rep. 165; Gonzales v. State, 226 S. W. Rep. 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-19\">The court instruct\u00e9d the jury that the witness Prickett was an accomplice, and informed the jury of the law touching the necessity for corroboration of an accomplice witness. The language selected by the court is like that in Campbell\u2019s case, 57 Texas Crim. Rep. 302. This charge has been criticised as inaccurate in some respects and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>as not applicable to every case. See Anderson v. State, 95 Texas Crim. Rep. 352, (motion for rehearing) \u2022 Whether in a given case the use of the charge mentioned or the failure to give an accurate one would work a reversal would depend upon the facts which were before the jury. Without knowledge of the proof that was made, this court is not in a position to determine that in giving the charge mentioned and in refusing the appellant\u2019s special charge on the subject of accomplice testimony, harmful error was committed. See Abbott v. State, 94 Texas Crim. Rep. 31; Watson v. State, 90 Texas Crim. Rep. 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">There was no error shown in refusing to instruct the jury to acquit the appellant. The evidence, aside from that of the accomplice, may have been ample.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In the absence of a statement of facts, the presumption is indulged in favor of the judgment that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b409-9\">ON MOTION POE EEHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b409-10\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Ameo\">Appellant urges that the remarks of the State\u2019s attorney during a discussion between counsel for the parties and the court respecting the admission of certain testimony, \u2014 to the effect that if \u201cHe wants to put the defendant on the stand we will let him be put on,\u201d was a reference to the failure of the defendant to testify which ought to be held by us reversible error. The bill as it appears in the record shows that while the trial was progressing and appellant's attorney was making an argument to the court, he referred to what the defendant had said, in reply to which the State\u2019s attorney made the remark complained of. This appears to us to be in the nature of an objection on the part of State\u2019s counsel to a statement by appellant\u2019s counsel as to what he had said, there being nothing before the court to justify appellant\u2019s counsel in his reference. The evidence had not closed and it was not then known to State\u2019s counsel, apparently, whether the accused would be a witness or not. We do not think it violative of the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">Appellant has filed in this record a statement of facts agreed to by both counsel for the State and the defendant, within the time allowed for filing of the statement of facts herein, and asks us to issue a writ of certiorari to compel the perfection of this record. In as much as the statement of facts is not approved by the trial judge, even if it should be properly before us by insertion in the record, we could not consider it. In order eo call upon this court to pass upon a statement of facts, it must bear the approval of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Appellant also asks us to consider another matter which is not properly before us. A motion was made to quash the jury panel upon facts therein stated. The truth of the matters so averred are not made to appear either by a statement of facts or a bill of exceptions filed during term time. In the absence of some such showing we must uphold the correctness- of the action of the lower court in overruling said motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Being unable to agree with any contention made, the motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">ON APPLICATION POR LEAVE TO PILE SECOND MOTION POR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b410-8\">LATTIMORE, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AJSo\">We regret that we can not grant the application for leave to file second motion for rehearing. The showing of diligence on the part of appellant with regard to the filing of statement of facts, is not- sufficient. The depositing of said statement of facts, after same had been agreed to by the district attorney and appellant\u2019s counsel, with the district clerk within the time required, but without the approval of the district judge, would not justify us in giving said statement consideration, or in ordering the issuance of certiorari to perfect the record, unless there had been a showing of more diligence than here appears. The mere fact that the district judge was in an adjourning county ill, would not justify appellant in making no effort apparently to procure his approval. However, in this connection we might observe that we have examined the statement of facts and if same were before us it would not change our judgment of affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Leave to file second motion for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">\n<em>Denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
