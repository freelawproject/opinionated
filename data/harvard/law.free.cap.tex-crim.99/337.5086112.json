In one paragraph of the motion, it is claimed that since the trial there had come to the knowledge of the appellant testimony by which he would be able to show that at the time of the collision he was driving his car at a rate of speed not exceeding twenty miles per hour and that the injured party was at fault. The motion is signed by the appellant but is not verified by the affidavit of either the appellant or his attorney. Reference is made in the motion to the affidavit of one Limper, which does appear attached to the motion. It was taken by the attorney for the appellant who was acting as a notary public. The absence of the verification of the motion by the oath of the appellant precludes the consideration of the ground mentioned. See Vernon\u2019s Texas Crim. State, Art. 837, p. 777; Branch\u2019s Ann. Texas P. C., Sec. 192. Even if the motion were sworn to by the appellant, the affidavit of the witness taken by the attorney for the appellant would not support the averment. See Branch\u2019s Ann. Texas P. C., See. 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-15\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-16\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
