Brown, </em>for appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-14\">The authorities are uniform, so far as the question-has been the subject of adjudication, in upholding appellant\u2019s contention that the deed to Boulette conveyed the westerly one-half of lot one in area, as is shown -by the following citations: <em>Dart v. Barbour, </em>32 Mich. 267; <em>Au Gres Broom Co. v. Whitney, </em>26 Mich. 42; <em>Heyer v. Lee, </em>40 Mich. 353 (29 Am. Rep. 537); <em>Jones v. Pashby, </em>48 Mich. 634 (29 N. W. 374); <em>Hartford Iron Mining Co. v. Cambria Mining Co., </em>80 Mich. 496.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-16\">Time being of the essence of the contract, and the complaint alleging a tender only on the day named therefor in the contract, evidence of a second tender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>on November 22, 1894, nearly a year thereafter, was inadmissible. <em>Hogan v. Kyle, </em>7 Wash. 595 (38 Am. St. Rep. 910); <em>Drown v. Ingels, </em>3 Wash. 424; 1 Warvelle, Vendors, p. 108; <em>McCroskey v.

Dowd, </em>for respondents:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-6\">Appellant relies upon the deed to Boulette, containing the words \u201c west half,\u201d and the mesne conveyances thereof to respondents. The lot having been divided by deeds of conveyance to two different parties, the intention of the parties as to the location of this line will be sought for from all the deeds. The grantees each supposed that they were buying about twenty acres. Each had an opportunity to ascertain the true quantity. If he chose not to avail himself of that opportunity, but to buy and sell by boundaries and describe the land as containing so many acres, and it subsequently appeared that there was a mistake in the quantity but not in the boundaries the sale will be binding. <em>Morris Canal Co. v. Emmett, </em>9 Paige, 168 (37 Am. Dec. 388); <em>Stebbins v. Eddy, 4 </em>Mason, 414; <em>Marvin v. Bennett, </em>8 Paige, 312; <em>Jackson v. McConnell, </em>19 Wend. 375; <em>Smith v. Evans, </em>6 Binn. 102 (6 Am. Dec. 436); <em>Boar v. McCormick, </em>1 Serg. &amp; R. 166; <em>Greer v. Squire, </em>9 Wash. 363; <em>Powell v. Clark, 4 </em>Am. Dec. 67; <em>Slaughter\u2019s Adm\u2019r. v. Gerson, </em>13 Wall. 379. The deed conveying the west half of lot 1 was executed first, and it controls in a conflict as to the boundary line between the two halves of the lot. <em>Flynn v. Sparks, </em>11 S. W. 206; <em>Keller v. Shelmire, </em>7 South. 587.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-7\">The word half used in the descriptive part of the deeds has no reference to quantity, and does not mean one of two equal parts. The presumption is that the word, used as it is, relates solely to boundaries and indicates one of the legal subdivisions of the public do<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>main. The word \"west\u201d indicates where to find the monument or corner stone from which to start, and the direction to be pursued; and the word \u201c half\u201d indicates the number of chains to go in that direction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-5\">In construing the language of a deed, the object sought is certainty. Quantity is not the guide, if the intent can be otherwise ascertained: for quantity is the least certain of all tests. <em>McClintock v. Rogers, </em>11 Ill. 279 (30 Am. Dec. 741); <em>Martin v. Carlin, </em>19 Wis. 454 (88 Am. Dec. 696); <em>Neff v. Paddock, </em>26 Wis. 551; <em>McEvoy v. Loyd, </em>31 Wis. 145; <em>Packscher v. Fuller, </em>6 Wash. 539; <em>Greer v. Squire, </em>9 Wash. 362; <em>Campbell v. Clark, </em>8 Mo. 553; <em>Campbell v. Johnson, </em>44 Mo. 247; <em>Dalton v. Rust, </em>22 Tex. 134; <em>May v. Baskin, </em>12 Smedes &amp; M. 430.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-6\">Oral testimony to show the location of the boundary line at the time of the conveyance of the west half of the lot to O. A. Boulette was admissible. What constitutes a boundary line is a fact to be determined by the jury. Where a word has a dual meaning, affecting the location of a boundary line, it constitues a latent ambiguity. 2 Parsons, Contracts, (2d ed.) \u00a7 78; 1 Greenleaf, Evidence, (7th ed.) \u00a7 286; 3 Washburn, Real Property, (4th ed.) p. 407; 1 Warvelle, Vendors, p. 376, \u00a7 6; <em>Stanley v.

The case was tried by the court without a jury and findings of fact and conclusions of law duly made, upon which judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs, and defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Among other things the court found that on December 12, 1893, plaintiffs tendered to defendant \u201ca good and sufficient deed of conveyance of said real property. . . . That at the time said tender was made, and at all times mentioned herein, the plaintiffs owned said real estate and had a right to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>vey the same.\u201d This finding was excepted to and is assigned as error. The record discloses that the premises embraced in the contract of sale between the parties are located in lot 1, section 22, township 24 north, range 1, east, W. M. This lot was owned on August 11, 1890, by W. H. Braden, M. L. Beets and B. C. Bott, who on that day conveyed to O. A. Boulette the \u201cwest half\u201d of lot 1, section 22, township 24 north, range 1 east, W. M., according to the government survey, containing twenty acres more or less. It is the claim of the appellant that the grant of the \u201c west half \u201d conveyed to Boulette the west half in quantity and not the part lying westerly of a line drawn north and south midway between, and parallel to, the side lines of said lot. The lot is the fraction of a forty acre subdivision, a portion of the southeast corner being cut off by the bay. Boulette platted the town of Charleston on the west half of said lot only, and the premises concerning which this litigation arises lie on the easterly margin of the plat, and if appellant\u2019s contention as to the effect of the deed to Boulette is correct, the eastern portion of the premises described in the complaint do not lie within the grant to Boulette, and the plaintiffs had no title to that portion of the premises on the 12th of December, 1893; so that the sole question is, whether a deed conveying the \u201cwest half\u201d of a fractional lot, which lot contains less than a legal subdivision of forty acres, <em>conveys </em>an equal half of the lot in area. We think it must be answered affirmatively and that appellant must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">In <em>Hartford Iron Mining Co. v. Cambria Mining Co., </em>80 Mich. 491 (45 N. W. 351), the court say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">\u201cThe literal significance of the word \u2018half\u2019 is one of two equal parts into which anything may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>divided. ... It must be held that the true boundary line between these two pieces of land is by a line, drawn north and south, dividing the lands into equal acreage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Counsel for respondents strenuously insist that the question involved, being one of boundary, is to be determined by ascertaining the intention of the parties to certain conveyances made prior to the execution of the contract between the parties to this action, and further contend that the prior conveyances and the understanding of the parties thereto as ascertained from their testimony upon the trial, are sufficient to show that there were twenty acres in the tract known as the \u201c west half.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">We think that no proper case was presented calling for the introduction of parol evidence as to the intention of the parties. No ambiguity is apparent upon the face of the deed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">\u201cThere should be interpretation only when it is needed \u2014 that is only where, without it, the meaning or effect of the contract would be in doubt.\u201d <em>Hartford Iron Mining Co. v. Cambria Mining Co., supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">See, also, <em>Dart v. Barbour, </em>32 Mich. 267; <em>Harris v. Oakley, </em>130 N. Y. 1 (28 N. E. 531).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">In the contract between the parties it is expressly stipulated that time was of the essence thereof, and it satisfactorily appearing that .the defect in plaintiffs title was not remedied prior to the time when defendant elected to rescind, it follows that judgment should have been entered for defendant for the amount which she had paid upon the purchase price together with legal interest thereon from the dates of such payments. She was entitled to a marketable title and could not be required to accept less in quantity than what she had agreed to purchase and pay for. Under the word<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>ing of this contract she was entitled to withdraw from its provisions and demand a return of the money theretofore paid by her upon it, at any time after the expiration of the time fixed by the contract for plaintiffs to perform their part, and before such actual performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Hoyt, C. J., and Anders and Dunbar, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
