This court, at the hearing, ordered forthwith diminution of the record, in compliance with which order the Assistant United States Attorney filed in this court forthwith the official Narcotic Case Report from the Treasury Department, Bureau of Narcotics, containing copy of a statement signed and sworn to by appellant with reference to these transactions. This statement shows that the tobacco can of marihuana was sold by appellant in the night of August 27, 1953, and that the pound of bulk marihuana was sold by appellant at 2:00 P.M. on August 28, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">The transactions described in the information were separate offenses.
