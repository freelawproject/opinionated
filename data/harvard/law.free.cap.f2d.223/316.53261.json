The gravamen of the complaint was that a reorganization of the railroad in 1896 was illegal. Appellants said they had protested the reorganization continuously since that date. However that may be, they did not seek judicial remedy until they brought the present action in 1950.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the District Court Judge Tamm, with a careful and exhaustive opinion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> concluded that the action was barred by <em>laches. </em>We agree and have nothing to add to his discussion of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-22\">. 13 Stat. 365.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b364-24\">. A suit was brought in the Southern District of New York in 1900 by one Hoover, not of appellants\u2019 committee. It was allowed to die for want of prosecution in 1939, and a motion to reinstate it was denied for inexcusable <em>laches.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AUL\">. Landell v.
