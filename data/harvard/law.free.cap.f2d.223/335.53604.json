But it is clear that the clay in question \u2014 described as \u201cEureka halloysite\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 was already known and available for purchase in the market. What was discovered was that this clay had certain desirable properties not previously realized. The question is whether that discovery, under the circumstances here presented, amounted to invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The prior art knew that certain clays were good catalysts in the cracking process. Legg taught that halloysite from Indiana, having high bulk specific gravity, hardness and fine porosity, was suitable (Patent No. 2,305,220). Shabaker taught the use of measures to lower the iron content of kaolin clays, including halloysite, to improve their catalytic function (Patent No. 2,466,051). The Eureka halloysite which plaintiffs employ is low in iron content \u2014 so low, in fact, as not to require the reductive measures described by Shabaker.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It would be natural, therefore, for one skilled in the art to use \u2014 or at least test \u2014 Eureka halloysite, once it had been called to his attention (as it was here) by one knowing its general characteristics. Vanadium Corp. of America v. Marzall, 1952, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 3, 197 F.2d 187. The results achieved were better than expected. But the Patent Office and the District Court were justified in concluding that this fact did not convert plaintiffs\u2019 choice of a particular clay \u2014 belonging to a known class\u2014 into a patentable invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\">. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 4915 (1875), as amended, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 63 (1946), was repealed by the Act of July 19, 1952, c. 950, Section 5, 66 Stat. 815, and was replaced, to the extent here pertinent, by 66 Stat. 803, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 (1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\">.
