Putting to one side the decision of this court in Brown v. United States, 5 Cir., 257 F.46, that if, as was the case here, the .place where the offense was committed was sufficiently described, the court will take judicial notice of facts which vest the United States with jurisdiction,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the record overwhelmingly, indeed conclusively, establishes, the jurisdictional .facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-24\">The judgment is affirmed. \u2022</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-13\">.
