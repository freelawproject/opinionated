We think the argument is not well made. A prescription for narcotics comes within the meaning of the phrase \u201cother writings\u201d as used in the above cited Code section. United States v. Tommasello, 9 Cir., 160 F.2d 348, affirming D.C., 64 F.Supp. 467. Cf. Hart v. Squier, 9 Cir., 159 F.2d 639; Johnson v. Warden, 9 Cir., 134 F.2d 166, certiorari denied 319 U.S. 763, 63 S.Ct. 1320, 87 L.Ed. 1714; Prussian v. United States, 282 U.S. 675 51 S.Ct. 223, 75 L.Ed. 610. See also Lewis v. United States, 9 Cir., 170 F.2d 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Moreover, inasmuch as the appellant here did not appeal from his conviction, the motion to dismiss his present appeal is well taken for the reason that the question now raised should have been raised on a direct appeal from his conviction. See Sunal v. Large, 332 U.S. 174, 67 S.Ct. 1588, 91 L.Ed. 1982; Goto v. Lane, 265 U.S. 393, 44 S.Ct. 525, 68 L.Ed. 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed; and the motion to dismiss the appeal is sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
