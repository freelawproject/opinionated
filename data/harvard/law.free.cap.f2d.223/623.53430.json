The second provided that S.P.A. buy the entire output of a steam electric-generating plant (to be constructed by Central) and. sell electric energy to Central for forty years for the use of its members. Both contracts contained the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-11\">\u201c(a) This agreement is and all rights and obligations hereunder, and the expenditure of funds by the Government under any provisions hereof, are expressly conditioned and contingent on the Congress making the necessary appropriations to enable the Government to carry out the provisions of the agreement, and in case the Congress fails to make such appropriations, the Cooperative hereby releases the Government from all liability due to the inability of the Government to perform this agreement on that account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-12\">\u201c(b) No obligation contained herein for the future payment of money by the Government, or liability on the part of the Government for breach of any of the provisions contained herein, shall be binding upon or enforceable against the Government unless and until the Congress first appropriates funds out of which such obligations or liability can be legally paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">The transmission system, completed pri- or to June 30, 1953, was delivered to S.P.A., and Central commenced purchasing electric power from S.P.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">The Interior Department appropriation for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1953,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>\u201cContinuing Fund, Southwestern Power Administration</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsH\">\u201cNot to exceed $1,200,000 shall be available during the current fiscal year from the continuing fund for all costs in connection with the purchase of electric power and energy, and rentals for the use of transmission facilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The Statement of the House Managers contained the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">\u201cNone of the funds allowed are to be used for the purpose of implementing existing contracts with REA cooperatives which provide for the lease-purchase of transmission or generating facilities. The funds may be used only for the purchase of electric power and energy and the payment of wheeling service charges at rates and in amounts comparable to those paid in the Southwestern Power Administration area under existing contracts based only on use value received with no additional allowance for purchase or lease of facilities. Such arrangements may be made with REA Cooperatives in the area but no funds for this purpose are to be available after February 28, 1954..\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Appellants viewed this Statement as a bar to allocating funds from the appropriation for the performance of the aforementioned contracts. Accordingly, they declared the contracts suspended by their own terms. Central brought this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">The amended complaint prayed for (1) judicial review of agency action; (2) a declaration that appellants\u2019 actions are illegal and lacking in due process; (3) a determination of the rights, status and legal relations of the parties; and (4) a judgment directing that appellants not refuse to perform the contracts on the ground that Congress failed to appropriate funds. Appellants moved to dismiss on the ground, among others, that this was an unconsented suit against the Government, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The District Court denied this motion and granted Central\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The order decreed that the congressional appropriation was available to carry out the contracts; that appellants acted illegally and beyond the scope of their authority in refusing to carry out the contracts on \u201cthe alleged grounds that no appropriation of funds had been made by Congress\u201d; and that \u201cto the extent that funds are available\u201d from the Interior Department Appropriation Act appellants \u201care authorized to carry out the provisions of said contracts with [Central].\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">We think the suit must be dismissed. It may be, as the District Court held, that appellants are not precluded by the Statement of the 'House Managers from using funds from the Interior Department Appropriation Act for the purpose of carrying out the contracts in question. But appellants\u2019 action in refusing to so use the funds \u201ccertainly * * * is not a violation of any express command of Congress.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Act is permissive only. It does not impose upon appellants a clear affirmative duty to use the funds for that specific purpose. At least so much is essential to avert the doctrine of sovereign immunity as a bar to effective relief in the nature of mandamus or specific performance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The District Court apparently recognized that such relief was barred since it undertook only to determine the rights of the parties under the contracts. But such a determination is purposeful only in relation to an action in the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>of Claims for breach of contract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Clearly then, this determination should await that remedy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Reversed and remanded for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">EDGERTON, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\">.
