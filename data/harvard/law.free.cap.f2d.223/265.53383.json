At issue are: (1) appellant\u2019s right as lessor to accrue unpaid rentals for the balance of a ten-year lease after a Conservator-Receiver appointed for the lessee national bank had repudiated the lease and appellant had re-entered the premises; (2) appellant\u2019s right as depositor to accrue interest on its impounded deposit in a national b'ank in the years 1933 to 1940, when it was unknown whether any interest would be paid; and (3) whether or not appellant\u2019s claim for refund of 1939 income taxes and interest was filed within the time permitted by the statute. Other questions, including a claimed bad debt deduction for 1939 and the right to net operating loss carryovers in 1940 and 1941, depend upon decision of the basic issues stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-19\">The district court concluded that the appellant could not accrue the above-described rental and interest income, and that appellant\u2019s refund claim for 1939 was barred by the statute of limitations. Judge Koscinski\u2019s discussion of the issues, accompanying his complete findings of fact and conclusions of law, is thorough, clear,' and correctly reasoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-22\">For the reasons therein stated, it is ordered that the judgment of the district court, 131 F.Supp. 136, be and it hereby is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
