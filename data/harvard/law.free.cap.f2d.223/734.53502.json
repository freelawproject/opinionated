Appellant, applicant below, contended there had been no instances of actual confusion since it first used its mark in 1948 and that continued use would not result in confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-15\">Only the opposer took testimony and introduced exhibits, but both parties filed briefs and were represented at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-16\">The testimony shows that appellee and its predecessor began use in 1932 of the mark \u201cSpringstep\u201d on carpet pads and linings, more accurately described as carpet \u201cunderlays.\u201d Since that time extensive advertising in magazines, newspapers, and other media, have contributed to sales of over twenty-five million square yards of its products.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-17\">It appears that sponge rubber in sheet form for use as carpet cushioning material came on the market in 1946 or 1947. During 1948 appellee purchased such sheets from another concern and sold them under the \u201cSpringstep\u201d mark, but no such sales have since been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>The Examiner of Interferences was of the opinion that although the goods were of the same descriptive properties, the marks applied thereto were \u201cregistrably distinguishable,\u201d on the grounds that the word \u201cSpring,\u201d common to each mark, possessed an unmistakable descriptive significance in relation to the respective products of the parties and was not capable, in itself, of identifying or distinguishing either product; and the suffixes being wholly dissimilar, concluded that concurrent use of the marks was not likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">In reversing the examiner, the commissioner pointed out that although the word \u201cSpring\u201d <em>suggested </em>a characteristic of the involved products, it did not <em>describe </em>them; that, as a conspicuous portion of each mark and \u201cas the first syllable of the word \u2018Springstep\u2019 and of the single word \u2018Springfoam,\u2019 it may not be disregarded as being per se \u2018incapable of identifying such goods as to source.'\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The commissioner concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A04S\">\u201cCarpet cushions or underlays made of felt have been an article of commerce for many years, and \u2018Springstep\u2019 has long been used as a trade-mark for felt carpet cushions and underlays; and since sponge foam rubber is a comparatively new product in the carpet cushion and underlay industry, I am of the opinion that the purchasers familiar with \u2018Springstep\u2019 felt underlays, upon seeing \u2018Springfoam\u2019 on sponge rubber sheets and pads, are likely to believe that the latter is opposer\u2019s trademark for a new type of underlay. In other words, the public is likely to believe that the two products emanate from the same source.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">In its brief on appeal, and during oral argument before us, appellant renews the contentions advanced below, but the record is devoid of any evidence in support thereof. For example, it is urged that there is no indication of record that appellant\u2019s product is sold through furniture stores or other institutions that normally handle carpets. We think, however, the commissioner correctly pointed out there was likewise nothing in the record to indicate that the goods might not be appropriate for and sold as carpet cushions or underlays through stores which normally handle carpets. That observation is similarly applicable to appellant\u2019s contention that the channels of distribution for appellee\u2019s goods are distinct and \u201cfar afield\u201d from its own. Again there is nothing whatsover in the record relating to appellant\u2019s channels of distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">We have read the decisions cited by appellant but, as is generally true in trade-mark matters, find none of them sufficiently in point with the facts here to disturb the decision appealed from. It is, however, a familiar and well settled rule in opposition proceedings that any reasonable doubt which may exist on the question of likelihood of confusion in trade should be resolved against the newcomer. The newcomer's field of trademark selection is not so limited as to require registration of a mark which sufficiently resembles an old and established mark as to likely result in -confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">The decision appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">JOHNSON and COLE, JJ., dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">JACKSON, J (retired) recalled to participate herein in place of GARRETT, C. J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
