Appendix, \u00a7 462(a) (1952). The appellant claims lack of \u201cprocedural due process\u201d in the steps that were taken, or failed to be taken, leading up to his order for induction. On all this we find nothing which is grounds for appeal under our decision in United States v. Hagaman, 3 Cir., 1954, 213 F.2d 86. So far as the appellant\u2019s case as outlined in his brief is concerned we should unanimously affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-18\">But since the judgment of the district court was entered and the appeal was taken and briefs filed in this case, the Supreme Court has decided a group of cases dealing with liability of accused persons who have refused to be inducted in the Armed Services. The decision in point here is Gonzales v. United States, 1955, 348 U.S. 407, 75 S.Ct. 409, 410. In that case the majority of the Supreme Court decided the question whether the petitioner \u201cwas entitled to receive a copy of the recommendation made by the Department of Justice to the Appeal Board under the provisions of \u00a7 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 62 Stat. 612, as amended, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456 (j).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-19\">The majority decided that question in the affirmative. What Gonzales was entitled to, Cooper was entitled to. He did not receive the report above described. He is, therefore, according to this last ruling by the Supreme Court, improperly-convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-20\">The judgment of the district court will be reversed and the case remanded with directions to order judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
