The first and principal point relates to a remark made by the prosecuting attorney in his summation to th\u00e9 jury. The accused was arrested after he had allegedly made a sale- of narcotics to an informer who had been: supplied with marked money. The arrest was made in a little house, or shack, on a used-ear lot. Three police officers participated and were present when the arrest was made. Officer Holcomb testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-15\">\u201cIn our first conversation with the defendant, he stated \u2018Well, I guess you got me.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-16\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-17\">\u201cHe stated \u2018Well, I guess you got me.\u2019 Then he said, he further stated that \u2018The bitch made a buy off of me.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-18\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-19\">\u201cAfter more questioning, and the examination of the money with the fluorescent light, the defendant denied that he had made a sale to Miss Martelly. He would only state she owed him some money and she came down there to pay him the money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alh\">Another of the officers testified briefly as to the arrest, without relating the conversation, and the third officer was not called. In his argument to the jury the prosecuting attorney said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-20\">\u201cWhat did he say when he was arrested? Holcomb told you he said words to the effect that he was in for it; that this so and so made a buy off of him. And then afterwards he made a denial, taking an inconsistent position. Both of them can\u2019t be true. And it is uncontradicted, the statement of what the officer said.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atl\">Appellant says the reference of the prosecutor to an uncontradicted statement of the police officer is an impingement upon his Fifth Amendment right not to testify against himself.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He relies upon a rule that, if testimony could have been contradicted by the accused alone, refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ence to such testimony as uncontradicted is a prejudicial comment upon the failure of the defendant to take the stand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But that is not the factual situation here. Three officers were present, and the statement of the one could have been contradicted by either or both of the other two.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover the court gave a very careful charge in respect to the matter. The trial judge told the jury specifically that they were to draw no inferences from the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand and that they should not construe the prosecutor\u2019s remarks as having any reference whatever to his not taking the stand. Furthermore the prosecutor did not tell the jury the confession was uncontradicted. The police officer related both the confession and a denial by Peden. The prosecutor told the jury the officer\u2019s statement, which included the denial as well as the confession, was uncontradicted. We think Peden\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights were not invaded. Judge Edger-ton concurs in the result on this point because of the clear and accurate charge of the trial judge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Appellant urges error in the admission of an exhibit (the vial of narcotic tablets). He says the Government failed to establish an effective chain of control over the vial from him to the officers. In brief the evidence was that a female informer, in the presence of police officers, made a telephone call and received one. She was then searched by a policewoman and was given marked money, placed in a taxicab, and driven several blocks. The cab stopped; a man, identified as Peden, approached the cab; the rear door was opened for a few minutes; Peden leaned into the cab; the door was then closed and the driver drove off. The police officers had observed the transactions from a distance. They immediately took both the informer and Peden into custody. The informer had a vial of tablets, analyzed as dromoran hydrobromide, genetically related to morphine, and Peden had the marked money. At the trial the informer did not testify. Peden urges that without her testimony there was no proof of the sale of the drugs by him. We think the chain of evidence was ample. ' Reasonable men might well have been persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt, by the chain of events we have narrated, that Peden made the sale to the informer. The police cannot be expected to locate an observer close enough to transactions in this traffic to see the actual passage of the goods and the money. The informer in this case was an addict. An extensive search for her, under an attachment issued by the court, failed to locate her at the time of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">The third point presented on behalf of appellant relates to a comment by the trial judge on the evidence. We find no error in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-11\">. Int.Rev.Oode of 1939, \u00a7\u00a7 2553(a), 2554 (a), 26 U.S.C.A.
