This order, reciting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-22\">\u201cOn October 22, 1952, defendant filed a pleading styled \u2018Election Not to Serve Sentence\u2019, which pleading was not acted upon by the Court. And it further appearing that on December 15, 1954, defendant filed a motion styled \u2018Motion to Nullify Election Not to Serve Sentence\u2019. It Is Ordered that the defendant\u2019s \u2018Motion to Nullify Election Not to Serve Sentence\u2019 be denied for the reason that it presents no basis for action by this Court at this time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aii\">is in form and in fact not a final order from which an appeal will lie, but interlocutory and non-appealable. The appeal must, therefore be, and it is hereby Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
