Derenberg, New York City, of counsel), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b780-4\">Before O\u2019CONNELL, Acting Chief Judge, and JOHNSON, WORLEY, COLE and JACKSON (retired), Associate Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b780-5\">O\u2019CONNELL, Acting Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">This js an appeal from the decision of the Assistant Commissioner of Patents, Honorable Daphne Leeds, acting for the Commissioner by delegation of authority and affirming the decision of the Examiner of Interferences sustaining appellee\u2019s opposition to appellant\u2019s application for the registration of the term \u201cDear-To-Me\u201d for use, among other things, in the sale of perfume and cologne, admittedly identical in kind with certain merchandise alleged by the op-poser-appellee to be sold under its mark \u201cEndearing,\u201d 100 U.S.P.Q. 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Appellant further admitted in its answer to the Notice of Opposition that appellee\u2019s trade-mark \u201cEndearing\u201d was issued to the opposer February 11, 1947, more than a year prior to any use by appellant of its mark contested here, \u201cDear-To-Me.\u201d The latter was published in the Official Gazette of December 25, 1951, as a result of an application filed by appellant February 28, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Appellee in its Notice of Opposition alleged use of its mark \u201cEndearing\u201d in interstate commerce on various toilet articles, including perfume and cologne, since March 1946, and that it has spent large sums of money and considerable effort in promoting the sales prestige of its merchandise and mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">The controlling issue presented before the tribunals of the Patent Office involved the question of the likelihood of confusion in trade in the event that the competing marks were concurrently used by the respective parties on related or identical goods. The Examiner of Interferences in sustaining appellee\u2019s opposition stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8e\">\u201cAs to the involved marks themselves, namely \u2018Dear to Me\u2019 and \u2018Endearing\u2019 it is believed that they have in common not only the word \u2018dear\u2019, as the applicant asserts, which comprises the dominating part of both marks, and thus renders the marks quite similar in sound, but said marks considered as a whole are practically synonymous in meaning, and it is well settled that similarity in meaning alone between marks is sufficient to give rise to a likelihood of confusion or deception of purchasers, when, as here, they are applied to similar goods. Bourjois, Inc., v. Parfumes Schiaparelli, Inc., 72 U.S.P.Q. 32; Esso Standard Oil Co. v. Sun Oil Co., 89 U.S.P.Q. 333; Younghusband, etc., v. Societe D\u2019Etudes et D\u2019Expansion de La Parfumerie de Luxe, 83 U.S.P.Q. 190; The American Steel and Wire Co. of N. J. v. Hancock, 91 U.S.P.Q. 350.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">The Assistant Commissioner of Patents in affirming the conclusion reached by the Examiner of Interferences, and in approving certain reasoning and the authorities set forth in his decision herein-before described, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-13\">\u201cThe marks do not look alike. They have a considerable similarity in sound. Most importantly, however, as the Examiner said, they are \u2018practically synonymous in meaning, and it is well settled that similarity in meaning alone between marks is sufficient to give rise to a likelihood of confusion or deception of purchasers, when, as here, they are applied to similar goods.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-14\">We find ourselves in agreement with the conclusion reached by the concurring decisions of the respective tribunals of the Commissioner of Patents. Accordingly, we deem it unnecessary to present and discuss various other points and authorities cited by the parties in support. of their respective positions. Suffice it to say, that this court has recently held that marks substantially identical in meaning alone, but attached to identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>cal goods, may result in the likelihood of confusion, despite the fact that such marks are wholly unlike both in sound and appearance. Hancock v. American Steel &amp; Wire Co. of New Jersey, etc., 203 F.2d 737, 740, 40 C.C.P.A., Patents, 931. There in a unanimous decision, among other things, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-4\">\u201c* * * In determining likelihood of confusion between marks on identical goods, it is proper to consider their appearance, sound and meaning. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., 150 F.2d 439, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1074. Clearly the involved marks \u2018Tornado\u2019 and \u2018Cyclone\u2019 do not look or sound alike. But a combination of all three factors need not necessarily exist, and an opposition to registration may be sustained if the marks are identical or so similar in meaning that confusion as to origin is deemed likely. See Norris, Inc., v. Charms Co., 111 F.2d 479, 27 C.C. P.A., Patents, 1174.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Appellant relying on the case of Hillyard Chemical Co. v. Vestal Laboratories, Inc., 206 F.2d 926, 41 C.C.P.A., Patents, 701, contends, however, (1) that \u201cThe Assistant Commissioner erroneously considered that similarity in meaning between the marks alone was sufficient to give rise to the likelihood of confusion or deception;\u201d that other factors than meaning must be considered in an appropriate case\u201d and (2) that \u201cAll circumstances under which the respective merchandise is marketed and sold should be considered in determining the likelihood of confusion and deception.\u201d We shall discuss those contentions seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">(1) The law of this jurisdiction regarding the determination of the question of the confusing similarity of competitive marks in a proceeding like this has provided that the marks must be considered in their entireties. And with respect to sound, meaning, and appearance, substantial identity between the marks in any one or more of such attributes is, in of itself, fatal to the registration of his mark by an applicant. Hancock v. American Steel, etc., supra; Coty, Inc., v. Perfumes Habana, S.A., 190 F.2d 91, 38 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1180; Skol Co., Inc., v. Olson, 151 F.2d 200, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents, 715; Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., Inc., v. Wright, 46 F.2d 711, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 937; Traders Oil Mill Co. v. Lever Brothers Co., 100 F.2d 249, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents, 899; Mason, Au &amp; Magenheimer Co. v. Hawley &amp; Hoops, 86 U.S.P.Q. 272; Ex parte J. H. Clarke &amp; Co., 95 U.S.P.Q. 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">(2) Where, however, the facts presented by the record, if pleaded and proven, create an estoppel against the owner of a trade-mark due, say, to laches on his part, and wherein the question of public interest is nowise involved, the issue of confusion resulting from the use of similar or identical marks on related goods is not a factor that requires consideration. Lightnin Chemical Co. v. Royal Home Products, Inc., 197 F.2d 668, 39 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1031; Lantz Brothers Baking Co. v. Grandma Cake Co., etc., 161 F.2d 739, 34 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1073.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">We also believe that appellant\u2019s contention is well taken to the effect that the circumstances under which the respective merchandise is marketed and sold should be considered in determining the likelihood of confusion. Appellee in its Notice of Opposition set forth, among other things, this material allegation in support of its position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-12\">\u201c* * * jn view of the confusing similarity between the marks of the parties, any fault or defect found with applicant\u2019s perfume or cologne, offered for sale under applicant\u2019s alleged trade-mark Dear to Me, would have the tendency to reflect upon and to injure the reputation which opposer enjoys, and ever since long prior to applicant\u2019s adoption of the alleged trade-mark Dear to Me has enjoyed, for its perfume, cologne and other toilet preparations sold under its trade-mark Endearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">The circumstances under which appellant\u2019s merchandise is marketed and sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>were thus developed, so far as pertinent, by counsel for the respective parties:</p>\n<p id=\"AZSI\">Direct Examination by Mr. von Bernuth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-4\">\u201cQ. Mrs. Voigts, are you and your husband partners carrying on the business of the Cecile Gagnon Company? A. Yes, we are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-5\">\u201cQ. Where do you carry on the business? A. We carry on the business at 15 Lake Street, White Plains.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-6\">\u201cQ. New York State? A. New York State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">\u201cQ. What is the business of Ceeile Gagnon Company? A. The business is the selling of the perfumes and cologne under the name \u2018Dear to Me.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-8\">\u201cQ. \u2018Dear to Me\u2019 is the trademark that you use ? A. The trademark that we are using, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-9\">Cross Examination by Mr. Maltitz:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-10\">\u201cQ. Mrs. Voigts, do you do your own manufacturing of perfume and cologne? A. We do not, no. We bottle it and package it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-11\">\u201cQ. You buy the perfume and the cologne somewhere else, you mean? A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-13\">\u201cQ. And you also buy the bottles and the cartons and the other packaging material somewhere else? A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-14\">\u201cQ. Then you do the bottling and the packing in your home in Yonkers; is that correct? A. In White Plains.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-15\">\u201cQ. White Plains? A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-16\">\u201cQ. Do you do it right in your own home? A. We have a large cellar in our home. It is done in the cellar of our home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-17\">A family is not to be disparaged in its effort to launch an enterprise in the basement of its home. Some of our industries also did their pioneering under humble circumstances. It would seem, however, that customers in the purchase of cosmetics, such as perfume, cologne, and toilet preparations, might well require further reassurances were they to learn that such merchandise was bottled and packaged in the basement of someone\u2019s home. Hence we believe that in the excerpt hereinbefore quoted, the opposer has sustained the described allegation of his opposition. Yale Electric Corporation v. Robertson, 2 Cir., 26 F.2d 972, 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-19\">The decision of the Commissioner of the Patent Office, for the reasons stated, is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-21\">JOHNSON and WORLEY, Judges, dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-22\">JACKSON, Judge, retired, recalled to participate herein in place of GARRETT, Chief Judge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
