Whatever, in the conflicting<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> state of the authorities, might have been thought as to the state of the law at the time the district judge made his decision, we are of the view that, in the light of the quite recent decision in Association of Westinghouse Salaried Employees v. Westinghouse Electric Corporation, 348 U.S. 437, 75 S.Ct. 488, 501, the law is otherwise. There, where the suit was brought by their union on behalf of employees for accrued wages due them, the Supreme Court, in a full scale opinion, canvassing the meaning and scope of Section 301 of the Labor Management Act, held that congress did not intend thereby to, and did not, clothe federal courts with general jurisdiction in all suits by and against labor unions. So holding, it affirmed a judgment of the Court of Appeals, directing the dismissal of the suit for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">Here appellant urges upon us that; as shown by the concurring opinions, a great deal of the discussion in the main opinion was beside the mark of the decision; that it is authority for and only for the view announced in the concurring opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Warren and Mr. Justice Clark, that \u201cthe language of \u00a7 301 is not sufficiently explicit nor its legislative history sufficiently clear to indicate that Congress intended to authorize a union to enforce in a federal court the uniquely personal right of an employee for whom it had bargained to receive compensation for services rendered his employer\u201d, and that the decision is not authority for the view that the section does not confer jurisdiction of the instant suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">We cannot agree with this view. The invoked section does not in terms refer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>issues of the kind litigated here. We do not think it extends to such issues. Indeed subsection (a) deals expressly with and only with suits \u201cfor violation of a contract * * * \u201d between an employer and a labor organization. We think that nothing in the language and structure of the section or in its context and history authorizes the view that either its purpose or its scope contemplates the bringing in federal courts of suits of the kind dealt with here for a declaratory judgment as to a controversy which, under Sec. 158(d) (1), (2), (3) and (4), Title 29 U.S.C.A., is peculiarly within the competence and jurisdiction of the Labor Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">The judgment is reversed with directions to dismiss the suit for want of federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-15\">. \u201c\u00a7 185.
