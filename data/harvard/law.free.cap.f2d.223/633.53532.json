Section 132 of the District of Columbia Revenue Act of 1949, on the other hand, gives priority to the District of Columbia for unpaid gross sales taxes before all \u201cclaimants of whatsoever kind or nature\u201d and makes penalties and interest thereon \u201ca prior and preferred claim.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The referee held that the Bankruptcy Act governed the District\u2019s claim for gross sales taxes, interest and penalties. Accordingly, he allowed only a \u00a7 64, sub. a(4) priority for taxes and interest, and applied \u00a7 57, sub. j to disallow penalties. The District vigorously contends that the Bankruptcy Act provisions are superseded by \u00a7 132 of the District\u2019s Revenue Act because that section was enacted later in time and expressly applies \u201cWhenever the business or property of any person subject to tax * * * shall be placed in receivership or <em>bankruptcy </em>* * *.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">This contention has considerable force. Literally, \u201cbankruptcy\u201d is all-inclusive and appears, at first blush, to extend to proceedings under the national Bankruptcy Act. But we are not bound by what \u201cmay appear on \u2018superficial examination\u2019 \u201d to be the plain meaning of a word.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cWords generally have different shades of meaning, and are to be construed if reasonably possible to effectuate the intent of the lawmakers * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Our duty to look beyond the apparent meaning of statutory language is particularly clear where, as here, the effect of a literal reading is an implied repeal pro tanto of an earlier enactment. \u201cA law is not to be construed as impliedly repealing a prior law unless no other reasonable construction can be applied.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cThe problem is to reconcile the two [acts], if possible, and to give effect to each.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\"> We think such reconciliation is achieved here under a reasonable construction of the word \u201cbankruptcy,\u201d as used in \u00a7 132 of the District of Columbia Revenue Act, to embrace only proceedings under local insolvency acts. That section follows, almost verbatim, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Maryland sales tax statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As there ,used, \u201cbankruptcy\u201d refers only to state proceedings since the state act obvious-, ly could not affect priorities under the national act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While Congress in adapting the Maryland law to the District <em>could </em>have used the word \u201cbankruptcy\u201d in a different sense than in the Maryland act, there is absolutely no evidence in the legislative history that it did. On the contrary, an important objective of the drafting committee was \u201cto reduce the differences and possible friction * * between the adjoining areas of Maryland and * * * the District of Columbia * * * <em>by keeping the proposed measure as nearly as possible identical with the Maryland sales tax now in </em>existence.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We infer that Congress adhered to the Maryland usage of \u201cbankruptcy.\u201d This narrows \u00a7 132 but by no means eliminates it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In addition to the f oregoing legislative history, we think other considerations make plain that Congress did not intend to repeal or modify crucially important provisions of so basic a statute as the Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-16\">(1) The Bankruptcy Act of 1867 gave to federal and state taxes a position prior even to costs of administration;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and this special treatment of taxes was ostensibly continued by the Act of 1898.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> An ambiguity in that act, however, gave rise to \u201c27 years of controversy\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> which was not finally settled until 1926 when Congress expressly fixed the policy which substantially governs the priorities of federal and state taxes under the present act.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is unrealistic to assume that Congress intended to create an exception sharply altering this long and well-considered policy without express reference to the Bankruptcy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-17\"> (2) \u201cThe broad purpose of the Bankruptcy Act is to bring about an equitable distribution of the bankrupt\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>estate among creditors holding just demands * * * \u201d;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and, in the execution of that purpose, Congress has established a \u201creasonable classification of claims as entitled to priority <em>because of superior equities </em>* * <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Congress expressed no reason \u2014 and we are aware of none \u2014 why the District\u2019s claim for its unpaid sales taxes has any greater equity than claims of other governmental units for such taxes. And there is no support in logic or in the legislative history for assuming that Congress changed its mind about the superior equities of claims under \u00a7\u00a7 64, sub. a (1), (2) and (3). Moreover, to allow penalties as a \u201cprior and preferred claim\u201d is sharply at odds with equitable principles traditionally governing the distribution of a bankrupt\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">For the foregoing reasons we uphold the rulings below: (1) that the District\u2019s claims for sales taxes and interest were entitled to priority only under \u00a7 64, sub. a(4) and \u201cto no other priority whatsoever * * * \u201d; and (2) that interest and penalties on the unpaid sales taxes in excess of six per cent per annum should be disallowed under \u00a7 57, sub. j as a penalty.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The only remaining question on this appeal involves the District\u2019s claim for a one per cent per month payment on delinquent personal property taxes. The statute,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> which imposes such taxes and delinquency payments, does not contain a provision like \u00a7 132 of the sales tax statute. The District contends that its claim is for interest. But it is in excess of the legal interest rate and the statute specifically designates it a penalty. We therefore agree with the ruling below that the claim is for a penalty which is barred by \u00a7 57, sub. j of the Bankruptcy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-26\">.

Section 132 will still give the District priority in local insolvency proceedings. Its scope will be similar to that of \u00a7 3466 of the Revised Statutes, 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 191, after the priority given therein to debts owing the United States was held to have- been superseded in proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act by the priorities listed in \u00a7 64, sub. a.

Similarly here. When no proceedings are instituted under the Bankruptcy Act, or when the bankrupt person or corporation involved is not eligible to become a \u201cbankrupt\u201d under the act, 30 Stat. 547, as amended, 11 U.S. C.
