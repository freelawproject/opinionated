His appeal presents two complaints: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>(1) that the trial judge mistakenly instructed the jury that appellant had admitted' prior convictions of serious crimes; and (2) that the evidence is insufficient to support the jury verdict, particularly from the aspect of corroboration, or the lack of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The prosecutrix, one Della Woodley, married at the time of the occurrence to one Riley Woodley, (since deceased), gave the only direct testimony concerning the circumstances before the crime and the details of its commission. She identified the appellant as the perpetrator. In the absence of the jury, attorneys appointed by the District Court and the trial judge fully advised the defendant of his rights and urged him not to take the witness stand. The trial judge said finally, \u201c * * * this record of yours will undoubtedly be brought out and it may affect the weight that the jury is going to give your testimony.\u201d The judge explained the nature of the charge he would give on this point, emphasized that the Government must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and then asked: \u201cDo you understand what the Court \u00cdS' talking about?\u201d Walker answered \u201cYes, sir.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cDo you want to go on the stand or stay off the stand ?\u201d \u201cOn the stand.\u201d The Court: \u201cYou want to go on the stand despite what the Court has told you and despite the advice the lawyers have given you?\u201d Walker replied \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-16\">Appellant taking the witness stand, said \u201cLet me tell my story, then I will answer your questions.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-17\">On cross-examination the accused was queried concerning various convictions thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-18\">\u201cQ. Are you the same Henry Walker who in 1941 was convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>rape and robbery in the State of Virginia? (No response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\">\u201cThe Court: Are you the same person, Mr. Walker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">\u201cThe Witness: When my prosecutor makes a statement against me here, then I am going to trial.

I am not on trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-10\">\u201cQ.

Would you answer the question, please? (The witness shakes his head in the negative.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-12\">\u201cThe Court: Which is your answer, that you will not answer the question or you were not convicted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-13\">\u201cThe Witness: I thought I was being prosecuted by one Della Woodley. I know her as well as I know myself. That woman you all put up here, that ain\u2019t no Della Woodley. I know her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-14\">\u201cThe Court: How about this conviction that the District Attorney asked you about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-15\">\u201cThe Witness: Well, that there was something or other that somebody else had me in the court room for. I am not being tried for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2s\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-16\">\u201cQ.

Did you know the young lady who took the stand here today, Della Woodley? A. It wasn\u2019t Della Woodley that I know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-26\">\u201cQ. Did you know Della Woodley? A.

When she gets on the stand and tell you what happened\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-29\">\u201cQ. Did you know her in 1944? A. \u2014 then I will answer your questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-31\">\u201cQ. Did you know her in 1944? A. She haven\u2019t made any complaints before this Court against me. Why should I get up here and testify against myself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-33\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-34\">\u201cThe Court: What is your answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-35\">\u201cThe Witness: When Della Woodley makes her complaint against me, then I will answer him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-36\">And so it went, question and answer down to and including a denial by the appellant that he had ever seen the prosecutrix \u201cuntil she got on the stand. This is the first time in my life.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-37\">\u201cThe Court: Would the Court be correct that you say you did not take her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>\u201cThe Witness: I don\u2019t know her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">\u201cThe Court: Then did you force her to have intercourse with you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">\u201cThe Witness: I never seen her before. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">\u2018 On redirect examination the appellant insisted that the Della Woodley of whom he spoke had died in the District of Columbia on August 12, 1953. A custodian of records from the Bureau of Vital Statistics testified that an examination of the records over a two year period failed to disclose the death of any person named Della Woodley.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">The record discloses that the appellant was discerning and acute under examination, talking readily and glibly when supplying answers which served his position, while evasive as to incriminatory matter or nonresponsive when interrogated about his record. As to the various questions concerning prior criminal convictions, had the accused answered in the affirmative, that would have ended the matter. Had he answered in the negative, the Government would have been bound to introduce the record of his conviction and identify him as the person named in that record. To many such questions he made no response whatever; to others he made replies such as may be discerned from the samples herein reproduced. The trial judge made it clear that the jury was not \u201cto indulge in any inference or any presumption that there is any relation between what he may have been or may not have been convicted of before, and you are not to indulge any presumption against him. It is merely that he, as any other witness, when he takes the stand, may have his credibility or the credence or the weight of his testimony attacked by the alleged possession of an alleged criminal record, in order that you, as you are acquainted with that fact, may pass upon the credence or the weight or the credibility to [sic] which you will attach the testimony that he gave, and it is for no other reason.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">There was no obj ection at the trial to the instruction as given, despite the requirement of Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C. A.: \u201cNo party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.\u201d Had such timely objection been made, the judge would have had an opportunity to correct any claimed error and to give appropriate instructions to the jury. Villaroman v. United States, 1950, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 240, 241, 184 F.2d 261, 21 A.L.R.2d 1074. The evasiveness of the appellant and his failure or refusal when a witness, under the circumstances described, might properly permit the jury to draw such inferences as the situation suggested. Raffel v. United States, 1926, 271 U.S. 494, 46 S.Ct. 566, 70 L.Ed. 1054; Caminetti v. United States, 1917, 242 U.S. 470, 37 S.Ct. 192, 61 L.Ed. 442. The judge made it clear that the jury was \u201cthe sole judge of the facts,\u201d and on the basis of the whole charge, highly favorable in general to the appellant, it cannot fairly be said that the trial judge invaded the jury's province. We do not doubt that it is always better practice for the government to establish prior convictions by introducing a proper record. We cannot say, in the light of the whole case, that the failure to do so was here prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">Although it is argued to us that the evidence is insufficient to support the ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>diet, and more particularly, that the testimony of the prosecutrix lacks corroboration, we conclude otherwise. Because of the seriousness of the charge and of the unusual circumstances already suggested herein, we have carefully examined the entire transcript. In Kidwell v. United States, 1912, 38 App.D.C. 566, 573, this court said: \u201cWe are aware that a conviction for this offense will be sustained upon the testimony of the injured party alone. But where the courts have so held, the circumstances surrounding the parties at the time were such as to point to the probable guilt of the accused, or, at least, corroborate indirectly the testimony of the prosecutrix.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *The Kidwell case has since been held to require corroboration in rape cases \u201cin the sense that there must be circumstances in proof which tend to support the prosecutrix\u2019 story, * * * and for lack of it Kidwell\u2019s conviction for one offense was reversed.\u201d Ewing v. United States, 1942, 77 U.S.App.D.C. 14, 17, 135 F.2d 633, 636, certiorari denied, 1943, 318 U.S. 776, 63 S.Ct. 829, 87 L.Ed. 1145. See also, McGuinn v. United States, 1951, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 197, 191 F.2d 477. In the Ewing case we were asked to reverse the Kidwell rule, to \u201cinquire again into the whole theory of the necessity of corroboration\u201d and to adopt a requirement of \u201cdirect corroboration\u201d in cases like this. This court rejected the suggestion saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">\u201cIf by \u2018direct corroboration\u2019 is meant the testimony of an eyewitness, the result would be in most cases that conviction could not be had except upon the defendant\u2019s confession.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If it means less than that, it is hard to see how it could relate to anything other than circumstantial evidence which supports the prosecutrix\u2019 story, and this is what the Kidwell case requires. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af1\">\u201cBut to safeguard the defendant by requiring corroboration in this sense is one thing. To throw around him a wall of immunity requiring the testimony of an eyewitness or \u2018direct evidence,\u2019 which is more than circumstantial, in support of the prosecutrix\u2019 story, is another. We are satisfied that the rule stated in the Kidwell decision is one which should not be overthrown.\u201d Ewing v. United States, supra, 77 U.S.App.D.C. at page 17, 135 F.2d at page 636.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Although a strong argument can be made for the proposition rejected in the Ewing case and re-advanced here, the majority has concluded that the Kidwell rule as interpreted and applied in the Ewing case should be reaffirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">Professor Wigmore\u2019s treatment of the problem proffers a rationale not dissimilar to our earlier opinions and to the thinking upon which we base our present ruling. See 7 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 2061-2062 (3d ed. 1940). In any event, and in each case, the ultimate effect to be accorded to \u201ccorroboration\u201d can be achieved through the exercise by the trial judge of his power to direct a verdict of acquittal whenever the government\u2019s case is inadequate, or to set aside a verdict when he is convinced it has been returned upon insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">In this case the prosecutrix was in her early twenties at the time of the attack and was married to a man known to have engaged in gambling and fighting.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>About 8 P.M. on the night in question, she was approached at her residence by-Walker. He told her that her husband was in trouble, hiding out, that he needed her, that Walker had him in a secluded spot where her husband awaited her. He told her not to get excited but her husband \u201cwants you right away, because he had assaulted this fellow very badly and the police was looking for him.\u201d She went to her room, put on her hat and coat, and went with Walker a half block to a trolley line where they boarded the streetcar. At a transfer point they changed cars and continued their ride. In conversation en route, after the prosecutrix had told Walker of her efforts to stop her husband\u2019s gambling and fighting, Walker said \u201cHe was a nice boy, a little quick-tempered.\u201d They sat together for about a half hour, got off the streetcar in a secluded neighborhood and walked down a street running toward a railroad track \u201cwhere he said he had my husband waiting on me.\u201d There he throttled her and by force pulled her down through knee-high bushes and grass, and after a struggle, assaulted her. She pleaded with him and told him if he would let her go she would not tell the police but would return home. She lost her hat at the scene. The prosecutrix then walked, perhaps a mile, before encountering a motorcycle officer whom she told \u201cjust what had happened to me and he called the scout car.\u201d Sgt. Howe of the Sex Squad saw her at the Tenth Precinct station. \u201cShe alleged she had been raped.\u201d Counsel thereupon objected, but the Government was entitled to the fact of her complaint. The officer described the back of her coat with several mud stains on it and a number of twigs. The sergeant called Policewoman Brown-low at the Women\u2019s Bureau and \u201cdirected her to report to the 10th Precinct and transport, the complainant to Gallinger Hospital for a pelvic examination * and added that she did so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The prosecutrix testified she was taken to the Women\u2019s Bureau, thence to the hospital where she was examined and where her bruises were painted. Sgt. Howe took the prosecutrix to the scene the following day. There they found a hat belonging to the prosecutrix. There was evidence that the ground, some 50 feet from the railroad tracks, \u201chad been considerably disturbed.\u201d The officer described the strip of brush and grass some 30 feet wide adjacent to the paved road. The scene was a \u201cgood eighth of a mile\u201d from the nearest house.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">There was no slightest suggestion of proof of any motive on the part of the prosecutrix to charge Walker with the offense. Her identification of him was positive and unchallenged. Indeed it is entirely reasonable to expect that she would never forget him, under the circumstances narrated, after riding the lighted streetcars for some thirty minutes, and then being attacked, as has been described. She testified that Walker left the scene and walked down the railroad tracks as she set out on foot and walked until she found the policeman. Her narrative was unshaken despite vigorous and competent cross examination. Highly important further were the circumstances attendant upon the appellant\u2019s taking the witness stand. He answered glibly enough on every point which he recognized to be favorable to himself and he either sparred or evaded or was silent otherwise. It is not likely that the jury was oblivious to his claim that the prosecutrix was \u201cnot the Della Woodley\u201d he knew. The jury might have concluded that he failed to identify her. He testified that \u201cDella Woodley\u201d was dead but the records were otherwise. He refused to affirm or deny that on the night of the crime he had taken her \u201cout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>riding by Catholic University,\u201d or \u201cdown near a railroad line,\u201d or \u201cseized her by the throat\u201d or to state whether during the relevant period he was working in Virginia with the husband of the prosecutrix. His attitude when \u201cquestioned also might have been regarded as corroborative to some extent.\u201d Ewing v. United States, supra, 77 U.S.App.D.C. at page 17, 135 F.2d at page 636. Other circumstances which need not be set forth also corroborated her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The charge as a whole was highly favorable to the accused. The jury saw and heard the witnesses, evaluated their testimony and found the appellant guilty. The accused exercised his own choice in taking the stand. Bruno v. United States, 1939, 308 U.S. 287, 294, 60 S.Ct. 198, 84 L.Ed. 257. We cannot say that the jury could not fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Curley v. United States, 1947, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 389, 160 F.2d 229, certiorari denied, 1947, 331 U.S. 837, 67 S.Ct. 1511, 91 L.Ed. 1850. We can say with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened, that if there be error, the judgment was not thereby substantially swayed and substantial rights were not affected. Kotteakos v. United States, 1946, 328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557. It therefore is our duty to affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-7\">. \u201cThe Court: Mr. Walker, you are the defendant at the bar and these two very fine attorneys have been appointed in your defense. * <em>* </em>* They are able men.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">They have had a lot of experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">\u201cNow, they have advised me that, in turn, they have instructed you that you can either go on the witness stand as a witness in your own behalf or you can stay off the stand. You are fully aware that you have a bad criminal record. You have been ten times charged with rape. You have been convicted four times. You got 20 years one time and you were pardoned. You got a conviction in May, 1935, of larceny, six months. You have served five years for rape. You have served a year and six months for rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">\u201cYou have also been convicted of assault and battery and aggravated assault, apparently assault with intent to kill, and you got 3% years to 7 on that.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">\u201cNow if you take the stand, those convictions can be brought out in evidence against you to affect your credibility as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">\u201cNow they have advised you, as they told me, advised you carefully. You don\u2019t have to go on the stand. You have been examined by two psychiatrists within less than 30 days, and they say you are of sound mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">Appellant was 59 years of age and the prosecutrix was 22 at the time of the assault, according to the transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-19\"><em>. </em>He then said: \u201cJudge, Your Honor, and ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I was arrested in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the 25th day of June, and I was removed to Washington, D. C. on the 29th day of July, 1953, because a complaint had been made against me by one Della Woodley, November 28, 1944. Therefore, Della Woodley is my complaining witness, and if I am to go on trial this morning, according to the Ninth Amendment to the Constitution, she should be here to make her complaints before the Judge and the jury of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-21\">\u201cDella Woodley, my complainant, died August 12, 1953. Therefore, there is no complaining witness to appear before this Court to make any complaints against me however. And is it a lawful thing, Your Honor, to put a man on trial for his life four months and four days after the death of the complaining witness, to have gathered a group of people together to take this stand to tell the Court what somebody told them about me and what they believe about me without any facts, however, from Della Woodley?</p>\n<p id=\"b662-22\">\u201cI know her as well as I know myself. I know her when I see her. This woman that taken this stand was not Della Woodley. I know her. I went with a long time, and this woman is not Della Woodley. Della Woodley, my prosecutor, is dead. That is all I got to say.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b663-18\">. The record of this conviction was not in evidence but it appears that Walker was sentenced to serve 3% to 7 years for the offense. He was returned from Pennsylvania July 29, 1953, to stand trial in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b664-13\">. In this same reference, the court further charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_V\">\u201cNow in this particular case the defendant has taken the stand in his own behalf and he has testified to having a prior criminal record. If the Court should refer to the testimony in any wise, you are to understand that the Court is the sole judge of what the law of the case is and you are the sole judge of the facts, or what the testimony was. If your recollection differs from the Court\u2019s, you will understand that your recollection controls. The Court\u2019s recollection is that he was confronted with a record which showed convictions of the crimes of rape, and also of assault, assault with <em>intent to </em>kill, as the Court recalls.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b665-6\">. Commenting on the crux of the issue as there presented, the court said: \u201cIn this case defendant was convicted under this count upon the bald statement of the prosecutrix that the acts had extended continuously over a period of three years in the house of the defendant, where his wife and family resided. In view of the respectable standing of defendant, as shown by the evidence, and the incorrigible character of the prosecutrix and her bad reputation for truth and veracity in the community where she resided and' was known, we do not think the evidence in support of this charge rises to the required standard.\u201d Id., 38 App.D.C. at page 573.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b665-14\">.

United States. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-15\">\u201c * * * We are aware that a conviction for this offense will be sustained upon the testimony of the injured party alone. But where the courts have so held, the circumstances surrounding the parties at the time were such as to point to the probable guilt of the accused, or, at least, corroborate indirectly the testimony of the prosecutrix.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlrC\">In the later case of Ewing v. United States, we held unequivocally that there \u201cmust be circumstances in proof which tend to support the prosecutrix\u2019 story * * noting that it was for lack of such corroborating evidence that \u201cKid-well\u2019s conviction for one offense was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>versed\u201d; <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and we held that circumstantial, as well as direct, evidence would satisfy the corroboration requirement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">In a majority of the American jurisdictions which follow the corroboration rule, corroboration is required on both the matter of the <em>corpus delicti </em>(penetration by force) and the matter of the identity of the accused.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Decisions of this court demonstrate \u2014 and my brethren do not say otherwise \u2014 that the rule has been so applied in this jurisdiction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Those decisions also demonstrate the insufficiency of the corroboration in the instant case on both matters. The record, with but one exception, discloses none of the corroborative circumstances present on both matters in the Ewing case, supra, in the later case of McGuinn v. United States,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and in other cases sustaining rape convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\"><em>The corpus delicti. </em>The prosecutrix testified that she made her complaint to the first police officer she saw. That officer did not testify, despite the obvious importance of his testimony, concerning her physical and nervous condition. She testified that he took her to the precinct station where she repeated her complaint to Detective Sergeant Howe. Howe did testify. Concerning her physical appearance he said only that there were \u201cseveral mud stains\u201d and \u201ca number of twigs\u201d on the back of her coat. <em>He was not asked about her nervous condition. </em>The prosecutrix testified that a policewoman took her to the Women\u2019s Bureau and later to a hospital \u201cwhere they examined me and painted my legs and things where the bruises were.\u201d The policewoman, who testified, could not recall the prosecutrix or the circumstances under which the prosecutrix gave her a statement on the night in question. <em>No medical testimony or hospital records were produced in connection with the alleged hospital examination, </em>despite the glaringly apparent need for such corroboration. The Government made no attempt to explain the absence of evidence on any of these matters.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Except for the fairly prompt complaint, none of the ostensibly corroborating testimony tended to establish any more than that <em>something </em>had occurred at the time and place in question; but that it was rape, <em>i. e., </em>penetration by force, depended entirely upon the complainant\u2019s own testimony. This was not so in the Ewing and McGuinn cases. In Ewing there was not only a prompt complaint but medical evidence that the prosecutrix had recently had intercourse for the first time and testimony by several witnesses that she appeared nervous and distraught on the following day; while in McGuinn, in addition to the prompt \u2022complaint, there was testimony that the complainant was \u201cin a nervous and crying condition\u201d and an admission of intercourse by the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><em>Identity of the accused. </em>The answer to a leading question on direct examination of the prosecutrix provided the only testimony in the entire record linking appellant to the charged offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">\u201cQ. Calling your attention specifically to the 28th day of November, 1944, and to the time of about 8:00 o\u2019clock, 8:15, 8:30 of that day, I will ask you whether on that day and at that time you saw the defendant here present, Henry Walker? A. Yes, I did.\u201d'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The prosecutrix admitted on cross-examination that she had never seen appellant before the night of the alleged crime and did not know his name at that time; and nothing in the record indicates she ever saw him again until the moment of trial, or that she had ever identified him in a police line-up, from pictures, or by any distinguishing physical features.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">No other testimony or circumstance linked the appellant to the crime. The majority asserts that the prosecutrix\u2019 identification is corroborated by the fact that she rode on lighted streetcars with her assailant for thirty minutes and so had a good opportunity to observe him. But testimony of the prosecutrix herself does not meet the requirement that her testimony be corroborated. There is not one iota of corroboration that such a streetcar ride took place. It is urged further that appellant\u2019s silence when asked certain incriminating questions provided corroboration on the issue of identity. Without deciding whether the mere silence of an obviously confused and ignorant defendant can ever be corroborative evidence, we note that on cross-examination appellant stated categorically that he had never seen the complainant before she got on the stand at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">I have found no case in which this court has affirmed a rape conviction in the absence of substantial corroboration of identity. In Ewing there was testimony that the accused was known to the complainant, and that he lived in the same apartment and \u201cspent the night [of the alleged attack] either in the living room or in a room across the hall * * \u201d from the complainant. In McGuinn [89 U.S.App.D.C. 197, 191 F.2d 478] we noted that the accused was \u201cfound as described by the complaining witness in the front seat with his pants and shorts down.\u201d There has been comparable corroborative evidence of identity in other cases. For example, in Robinson v. United States: \u201cIn addition to the complaining witness\u2019 positive identification, there was much substantiating evidence both of identification and of the crime. Some of it was circumstantial. Some of it was in the form of testimony concerning damaging admissions previously made by defendant.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In Brown v. United States, where \u201cthe only question was one of identification,\u201d a companion of the victim at the time of the assault identified the accused at the trial. We held the case was properly submitted to the jury since \u201cthere was positive testimony identifying [the accused] as the assailant.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>The court, citing Curley v. United States,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> says, \u201cWe cannot say that the jury could not fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d But even if the evidence would have been sufficient under the Curley rule, in a case not involving rape, the plain meaning of our corroboration rule in rape cases is that there must be an acquittal as a matter of law where, as here, the prosecution fails to produce the required direct or circumstantial corroborative evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\">. Ordinarily, review of this issue is barred where, as here, the motion for acquittal was not renewed after the close of all the evidence. This principle, however, does \u201cnot restrain us from rectifying manifest error or serious injustice.\u201d Battle v. United States, 1953, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 220, 221, 206 F.2d 440, 441, and authorities cited, note 3.
