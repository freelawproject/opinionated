The mark, allegedly in use since February of 1950, was for olive oil and was applied to the cans in which such product is sold. The application was examined and the mark published in the Official Gazette of the Patent Office on January 1, 1952. Several weeks thereafter, on January 23, 1952, appellant herein filed its notice of opposition to registration of appellee\u2019s mark. The opposition was predicated on appellant\u2019s prior adoption, ownership, and continuous usage since 1916 of the trade-mark \u201cAristocratic,\u201d also for olive oil. The notice alleged that appellee\u2019s mark so resembled \u201cAristocratic\u201d as to be likely, when applied to the identical goods of the parties, to cause confusion, mistake, or deception of purchasers as to the source of origin of such goods. Appellee admitted appellant\u2019s prior use of \u201cAristocratic\u201d but entered a general denial of other allegations pleaded in the notice of opposition. Neither party took testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-17\">The Examiner of Interferences of the Patent Office, on the basis of the pleadings before him, found that confusion in trade would likely result if the marks were concurrently registered. This decision was reversed by the Assistant Commissioner of Patents, acting for the Commissioner, who held that the marks did not look or sound much alike, except for the suffix \u201ccratic;\u201d and further \u201cthat the word \u2018Aristocratic\u2019 has such a familiar and well-known meaning to the ordinary, unsuspecting, unwary and inattentive purchaser that he will readily distinguish it from \u2018Cosmocratic\u2019 which probably will have little or no meaning to him.\u201d Lekas &amp; Drivas, Inc., v. Tenth Avenue Trading Corp., 100 USPQ 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-18\">In its appeal here, appellant urges recognition of similarities in sound, appearance, and meaning between \u201cCosmocratic\u201d and \u201cAristocratic.\u201d It emphasizes that the marks are applied to identical goods, and that \u201cAristocratic\u201d is a well-known trade-mark, in use some 34 years prior to appellee\u2019s adoption of \u201cCosmocratic,\u201d and that doubts on the likelihood of confusion should be resolved against the newcomer.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-19\">It is clear that the dominant part of appellee\u2019s composite mark is the word notation \u201cCosmocratic.\u201d The monogram and design are of such secondary signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>canee as to be almost wholly disregarded in determining the likelihood of confusion between the involved marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Each mark contains the suffix \u201ccratic\u201d or \u201cocratie.\u201d While appellant obviously cannot appropriate these suffixes to its exclusive trade-mark use, a prefix sought to be used in combination therewith by' a subsequent trade-mark applicant must be sufficiently distinctive and employed in such .association as will obviate the likelihood of confusion as to the origin of the goods marketed under the respective marks. See Eureka Williams Corporation v. Willoughby Machine and Tool Company, 194 F.2d 543, 39 C.C.P.A., Patents, 832, and Eureka Williams Corp. v. McCorquodale, 205 F.2d 155, 40 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1028. That some similarity is bound to' exist between trademarks 'employing common suffixes is clear. Confusion is likely between trademarks, however,- only if their over-all presentations in any of the particulars of sound, appearance, or meaning are such as would l\u00e9ad the purchasing public into believing that the products to which the marks are applied emanated from the same source. In testing this issue, fixed legal rul\u00e9s exist \u2014 if not in harmony, certainly in abundance \u2014 but, in the final analysis, the application of these rules in any given situation necessarily reflects a matter of individual'judgment largely predicated on opinion. There is, however, and can be no disagreement with the rule that the purchaser is confused, if at all, by the marks as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Taking into consideration that th\u00e9 marks here in question',' \u201cAristocratic\u201d and \u201cCosmocratic,\" are each applied to olive oil, that this commodity is a relatively inexpensive food item, and a matter of frequent purchase, we are nevertheless of the opinion that the buyer possessing ordinary intelligence and exercising ordinary care in relation to the purchase of such goods would have no difficulty in distinguishing between the contested marks. While the difference in sound and appearance is quite apparent, when the marks are viewed in their entireties, it might be said that each mark seeks to convey the same general thought to the public, i. e., that among discriminating individuals the olive oil sold under the respective marks is the best that can be bought anywhere. We do not think it necessarily follows,, however, if this meaning be attributable to the intent of the parties here, that the ordinary purchaser will arrive at a similar conclusion. \u201cAristocratic\u201d is a word with clear meaning to most everybody. On the contrary, \u201cCosmocratic\u201d is a notation without a readily grasped connotation. In any event, we do not feel that these marks are such as to confuse or deceive the ordinary purchaser into parting with his money on belief that there is no difference in' the source from whence springs \u201cAristocratic\u201d and \u201cCosmocratic\u201d olive oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">For the reasons hereinbefore stated, the \u2022 decision of the Assistant Commissioner of Patents, acting for the Commissioner, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">' JACKSON, J., retired, recalled to participate herein in place' of GARRETT, C. J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
