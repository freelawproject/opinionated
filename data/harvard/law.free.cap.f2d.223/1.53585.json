The locale of the property, and of all events of that day, was Lake Harbor, Florida, a small farming hamlet southeast of Lake Okeechobee and forming the point of interchange between the southern end of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad tracks, and those of the Florida East Coast Railway leading south. The surrounding country is open farmland and glades area, with muck soil.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">\u201cOn February 20, 1951, the appellant Thomas was the owner of a building used as a warehouse and packing house, located upon land owned by the appellee Railroad and forming part of its right-of-way immediately south of its tracks in Lake Harbor, Florida. The land upon which the building stood was leased to Mr. Thomas for a rental of $60.00 per year, and included an indemnity provision whereby the lessee agreed to save harmless the Railroad any liability for loss or damages to the lessee\u2019s building or its contents \u2018whether the same is the result of fire caused by negligent emission of sparks from the locomotive engines of Lessor, or otherwise, however resulting.\u2019 (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 20).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">\u201cAppellant Plank had a sublease from Thomas, with the approval of the Railroad, covering a leanto shed located at the southeast corner of the packing house, and in which he operated a machinery repair shop. Under the terms of the sublease Mr. Plank was also bound by the indemnity provision in the original lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">\u201cDuring the early evening of February 20, 1951, the entire packing house was destroyed by fire, and thereafter the appellants Thomas and Plank filed separate suits in the state court against the Railroad, attaching copies of the lease and sublease to their respective complaints, and claiming damages for the loss of the building and the property stored inside. The cases were removed to the United States District Court for the southern district of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-14\">\u201cThe significant allegations of both complaints are identical, and charge the Railroad with \u2018gross, wilful and wanton negligence,\u2019 with \u2018reckless disregard of defendant\u2019s duty to protect plaintiff against injury,\u2019 and with \u2018an intention to invade a legally protected interest of the plaintiff.\u2019 The complaints then set forth that the employees of the Railroad first set fire to a pile of debris close to the building owned by Thomas, then left the fire burning and departed from the scene, and finally that the Railroad\u2019s depot agent, having been notified of the fire, was dilatory in reporting its existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-15\">\u201cUpon motion of the defendant setting up the indemnity provision in its lease as a bar to the actions, the District Judge dismissed the complaints. The plaintiffs appealed, and this Court reversed, holding that the clause was valid and would exempt the Railroad from liability for ordinary negligence, but would not apply if <em>wilful or wanton </em>negligence were proved. Further holding that the complaints could be construed as alleging <em>wilful or wanton </em>negligence (but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>expressly withholding opinion upon the adequacy of the facts alleged), the Court remanded the cases for trial on the merits. See Thomas v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co., 5 Cir., 1953, 201 F.2d 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u201cThe Railroad filed its answer to each complaint denying the acts alleged and all claims of wilful or wanton negligence, and set up the indemnity provision in its lease as an affirmative defense. The cases were consolidated and tried together in July, 1953.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The taking of testimony before the court and a jury began on the morning of Friday, July 10, 1953, and was not concluded until the late afternoon of Tuesday, July 14th. The district court denied the motion of the defendant for a directed verdict made at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 testimony. When all of the testimony was in, the defendant renewed its motion for a directed verdict assigning an additional ground as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">\u201cComes now the defendant at the close of all the testimony and renews the motion heretofore made for a directed verdict upon the grounds therein stated, and upon the additional ground that it now appears from the affirmative testimony of the employees and agents of the defendant that the defendant has not been guilty of wanton or wilful negligence or any act which would intentionally harm the property of the plaintiffs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">After argument on the motion, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">\u201cThe Court: Well Gentlemen, I don\u2019t think that there is sufficient evidence to warrant the jury considering this case, or these cases, from the standpoint of wilful or wanton negligence, so I am going to grant the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">\u201cMr. Brown: May I suggest in order to save expense of the parties, in view of the fact that we have gone this far, that Your Honor reserve ruling and submit this matter to the jury so that in the event the jury-should return a verdict in favor of the railroad, then there would be no need of appealing; in the event the jury should return a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, then by an appeal on the part of the defendants the Circuit Court might pass upon the question without the necessity of going to the expense of another trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-12\">\u201cMr. DeJarnette: Let\u2019s not compromise in our ruling. You have expressed the view that you do not think it should go to the jury. I feel that under those circumstances the verdict should be directed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-13\">\u201cThe Court: I think so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-14\">The sole question to be decided is whether there was sufficient proof of wilful or wanton misconduct on the part of the defendant to require submission of the case to the jury. One of the latest statements by this Court of the rule to be applied reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-15\">\u201cOn a motion for a directed verdict, it is the duty of the court to accept as true all the facts which the evidence tends to prove, and draw against the party making the motion all reasonable inferences most favorable to the party opposing the motion, and if the evidence is of such a character that reasonable men in an impartial exercise of their judgment may reach different conclusions, then the case should be submitted to the jury.\u201d Swift &amp; Co. v. Morgan &amp; Sturdivant, 5 Cir., 214 F.2d 115, 116.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-16\">See also Strawn v. Travelers Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 200 F.2d 778, 779, 780; Lowrie v. American Surety Co. of New York, 5 Cir., 146 F.2d 33, 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-17\"> Appellee insists that the rule to be applied in the federal courts is that a motion for directed verdict should be granted when \u201cthe evidence is clearly such that if a verdict were rendered for the adverse party, the moving party would be entitled to a new trial. Pennsylvania Railway Co. v. Chamberlain, 1933, 288 U.S. 333, 343 [53 S.Ct. 391], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>77 L.Ed. 819; Daroca v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 5 Cir., 1941, 121 F.2d 917.\u201d The authorities relied on by the appellee sustain its statement of the rule (see also Strawn v. Travelers Ins. Co., supra), though we think the word \u201centitled\u201d should be emphasized, for it is now well settled that the rules to be applied as to the sufficiency of the evidence are different when the court is passing on a motion for directed verdict or for judgment n. o. v. on the one hand, and when it is passing on a motion for new trial on the other.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the evidence is so clearly insufficient that the party against whom the verdict was rendered \u201cwould be entitled to a new trial\u201d, Pennsylvania Railway Co. v. Chamberlain, supra [288 U.S. 333, 53 S.Ct. 395], or that the judge \u201cwould be obliged to grant a new trial\u201d, Daroca v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., supra [121 F.2d 920], or \u201ccompelled to set aside a verdict\u201d, Strawn v. Travelers Ins. Co., supra [200 F.2d 779], then a denial of a motion' for new trial would be an abuse of discretion, an error of law reviewable on appeal. See Whiteman v. Pitrie, 5 Cir., 220 F.2d 914, and authorities there cited. In less extreme cases, however, when the verdict is merely contrary to the preponderance of the evidence, or when the trial judge thinks the verdict is wrong though supported by some evidence, he may properly exercise his discretion in granting a new trial. Marsh v. Illinois Central R. Co., 5 Cir., 175 F.2d 498, 500; Pennsylvania Thresherman &amp; Farmers\u2019 Mutual Casualty Ins. Co. v. Crapet, 5 Cir., 199 F.2d 850, 853; Snead v. New York Central R. Co., 4 Cir., 216 F.2d 169, 172, 175; 5 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, 2nd ed., Para. 50.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Various formulas for ruling on a motipn for directed verdict appear in the opinions of the Supreme Court, and one of the later cases has said .that the matter is not greatly aided by substituting one general formula for another. Galloway v. United States, 319 U.S. 372, 395, 63 S.Ct. 1077, 87 L.Ed. 1458. The opinion in that case, along with the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Black, demonstrates the necessity of constant vigilance on the part of the lower federal courts lest the constitutional guaranty of jury trial be invaded. One of the latest expressions of the Supreme Court is simply that: \u201cThe requirement is for probative facts capable of supporting, with reason, the conclusion expressed in the verdict.\u201d Myers v. Reading Co., 331 U.S. 477, 485, 67 S.Ct. 1334, 1339, 91 L.Ed. 1615.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">One thing on which all of the cases seem to agree is that it is the jury\u2019s province and not that of the judge to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses, except perhaps in an extreme case where the testimony is demonstrably false. Ewing\u2019s Lessee v. Burnet, 11 Pet. 41, 51, 9 L.Ed. 624; Baltimore <em>&amp; </em>Ohio R. Co. v. Groeger, 266 U.S. 521, 524, 45 S.Ct. 169, 69 L.Ed. 419; Gunning v. Cooley, 281 U.S. 90, 94, 50 S.Ct. 231, 74 L.Ed. 720; Brady v. Southern R. Co., 320 U.S. 476, 479, 64 S.Ct. 232, 88 L.Ed. 239. The rule is thus stated in the last cited case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-13\">\u201cWhen the evidence is such that <em>without weighing the credibility of the witnesses </em>there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict, the court should determine the proceeding by non-suit, directed verdict or otherwise in accordance with the applicable practice without submission to the jury, or by judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 320 U.S. at pages 479, 480, 64 S.Ct. at page 234.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-14\">In the present case, the testimony of the defendant\u2019s witnesses, who happened to be its employees,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> if believed by.the jury, would establish that the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>fendant had been guilty of no fault whatever, certainly of no wilful or wanton misconduct. To require submission of the issue to the jury, it was not necessary that the testimony establish a wilful or intentional wrong but only that a jury case be made on the issue of wanton misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">The opinion thus far was written by Judge Rives and the court is in complete agreement on the controlling principles as stated; this statement is therefore adopted by the majority of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-16\">TT ,, . , . ,, . . However, the remainder of the opinion , \u2019 . \u201e T ! V.runs counter to the views of Judge Rives, . . , , . , , . and is not concurred m by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-23\">There are numerous Alabama decisions as to what constitutes wanton negligence. In one of the recent pronouncements of the Alabama Supreme Court the subject is dealt with as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-28\">\u201cBe it understood that \u2018intentional injury\u2019 and \u2018wanton injury\u2019 are moral equivalents, but their elements are different, and proof of the one would not suffice of proof of the other. Birmingham Ry., Light &amp; Power Co. v. Ryan, 148 Ala. 69, 41 So. 616; Alabama Great Southern R. Co. v. Ensley Transfer &amp; Supply Co., 211 Ala. 298, 100 So. 342. Feore v. Trammel, 212 Ala. 325, 102 So. 529, 533.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-40\">Citing this case this court in Wunderlich v. Franklin, 5 Cir., 100 F.2d 164, 167, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-43\">\u201cIn defining wanton negligence, the Alabama courts emphasize the necessity that the lack of care and disregard of probable consequences be so great that, in its ethical aspects at least, it be analogous to a will or intention to produce the re-suit. A clear distinction between willful and wanton injuries is main- , . tamed on the basis of distmct elements, but the cases do not lose sight of the fact that, in holding liability for wanton negligence, they are treating the wrongdoer as if he had actually intended the result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Am\">The Feore case, supra, further says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\">\u201cIt follows from the decisions that * * *; to, constitute wantonness, that the party charged, or his servant acting for him in the premises, was conscious of the conduct which caused the injury, and conscious, from his knowledge of the existing conditions, that injury would likely or probably result from his conduct or omission to act, and with reckless indifference to consequences he consciously and intentionally did the wrongful act or omitted to do or discharge some known duty m the premises which produced the miurious result declared for m the complaint. Shepard v. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co., 200 Ala. 524, 76 So. 850; Alabama Power Co. v. Conine, 210 Ala. 320, 97 So. 791; Birmingham Ry., Light &amp; Power Co. v. Cockrum, Ala. 372, 60 So. 304.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ax\"> Bearing in mind then that we are not here concerned with simple negligence (the appellants by contract waived any claim for negligence) and that to find wantonness there must be evidentiary facts upon which the jury could infer an ethical or moral wrong committed by agents of the appellee, we conclude that the trial court correctly held that, jn the language of the Supreme Court in Myers v. Reading Co., supra, there was an absence of \u201cprobative facts capable of supporting, with reason\u201d a jury verdict of wilful or wanton misconduct,</p>\n<p id=\"ADq\">Omitting for the moment a discussion testimony of the witness Johnson, the following chronological statement of events was clearly proven. There was a steam locomotive and caboose on one two tracks near the burned building, A^ou* <em>Bj1B </em>p'm; Duncan\u2019 tbf brabeman wh\u00b0 had beea in <em>^ </em>cabofe\u2019 was awakened by the smell of smoke; he went outside and gaw a gmall fire between the caboose and locomotive; he put at least 20 buckets of water on the fire and thought he put it out; he then ate his supper and waited until some repairs were made on the engine which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>then pulled up to the station at about 7:15; plaintiff Plank and a friend of his named Simmons, both of whom testified for the plaintiffs, were at Plank\u2019s shop, which was later burned, and saw someone putting water on the fire until they saw only smoke, and then they both went home. Simmons testified \u201cWell, at that time it looked like they had it pretty well whipped. I don\u2019t remember seeing any smoke as I went away.\u201d Plank testified that he saw men who looked like railroad men putting water on a fire about 8 or 10 feet in circumference for 15 minutes or more before he went home, and that he left with Simmons, who testified it was then 6:15 or 6:20; that he saw no fire at that time. Thereafter, several witnesses saw a fire near the tracks and near the building at shortly after 7:00 o\u2019clock, at about the time the locomotive and caboose moved; then one witness Embry testified that he went to the railroad station at about 7:30 to 8:00 p. m. and found the ticket agent trying to phone to get help to put out a fire that he had observed nearing the packing house; he testified that the agent said \u201cthat the switch engine had just dumped hot ashes several yards down the track and, of course, the grass had caught fire and it was burning to the packing house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ati\">If this were all the testimony we think it clear that there is no evidence from which the jury could infer wantonness on the part of the railroad company. Here is evidence of two fires having two different origins. Proof of both of them was offered by appellants. The first, having been discovered by the railroad brakeman between 5:00 and 6:00 o\u2019clock, was smothered by him so that not only did he think it was out but so that Plank, whose building was later destroyed, calmly went home, apparently confident of the same thing. The second was stated by the station agent between 7:30 and 8:00 o\u2019clock to have \u201cjust\u201d resulted from the dumping of hot ashes. If this caused the fire, at any rate the station agent was trying to telephone for help as soon as he saw it, and there is no evidence that any other person knew that such a fire had been kindled by the locomotive. All of this evidence was either undisputed or offered by the plaintiffs. Surely there was no evidence of wanton misconduct here.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">We have now to consider the testimony of the witness Johnson, who stated that he had been getting supplies out of the packing house and left about 5:30; he testified that he saw \u201csome Coast Line employees,\u201d not otherwise identified, around a fire between the tracks, apparently cooking a meal;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> they were there at 5:30 when he left. He said he came driving back down the road \u201ca few minutes after six; sometime <em>along there </em>shortly after six\u201d; he said he observed \u201csome grass and weeds around there were burning, around the area where these fellows had been, where this cooking was.\u201d On further questioning by plaintiff\u2019s counsel as to whether he observed any men \u201cby the fire as you came back there sometime after 6:00 o\u2019clock,\u201d he said \u201cthey were around there.\u201d Asked how much fire there was shortly after six he said it was 12 or 15 feet wide.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Appellant contends that this testimony shows a continuation of the fire alleged to have been started by the railroad\u2019s employees into the fire later seen after seven o\u2019clock in order to tie the appellant in with the theory that its employees casually stood by while the fire they had allegedly started spread to the grass and endangered the buildings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is no support in the evidence for such a contention. Giving full credit for truthfulness to Johnson\u2019s testimony that he saw a blaze a few minutes after six and saw two men around it, it is perfectly clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>that this is the same blaze that Plank and Simmons saw and which they watched until 6:15 or 6:20, when it was quenched to their satisfaction and that of the train brakeman. There is no testimony that any railroad employee later saw any fire identified as a railroad kindled fire until the event related by Embrey at the ticket office. How could wantonness be attributed to the appellee railroad company for leaving the first fire if one of the plaintiffs who watched its progress was also satisfied that it was quenched?</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">To permit a jury to find wanton or wilful negligence from such a set of circumstances would be to permit rank speculation. It would destroy any distinction between ordinary and wanton negligence and permit a jury upon a <em>prima facie </em>showing of simple negligence to treat it equally as a <em>prima facie </em>showing of wantonness. Since two of plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses agree practically to the minute as to the small fire just after 6:00 o\u2019clock and one of the plaintiffs himself testified that it was apparently out and his friend and co-watcher testified he did not even see any smoke after the action of the brakeman, it is evident that the court recognized the complete break in the evidence which would connect the 5:30 to 6:00 o\u2019clock fire with that which between 7:30 and 8:00 o\u2019clock destroyed the packing house. At the very least it would eliminate any basis in fact for an inference that, if it did later rekindle, there was any moral or ethical wrong committed by Duncan in not being aware of that possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">We think the trial court was clearly right in granting the appellee\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, since there is no direct evidence that the fire on the railroad tracks did in fact become the fire that destroyed the buildings. The extreme unlikelihood that it did so is emphasized by three of the plaintiffs\u2019 own witnesses. Two of them testified that to their satisfaction the railroad kindled fire appeared to be quenched and the other testified that the station agent attributed the destruction of the buildings to a fire caused sometime after 7:00 o\u2019clock by the dumping of hot ashes. While this is denied by the employee involved, we must take it as true, and, if so, then the plaintiffs must show some wanton misconduct after the dumping of the ashes. The only suggestion of negligence in this regard is the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint that the agent, instead of trying for several minutes to phone for help unsuccessfully, should have left his station and run somewhere for help. Such conduct would hardly amount even to ordinary negligence. It certainly does not permit the inference that it amounted to wilful or wanton misconduct. It was at worst the failure to exercise correct judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b52-5\">. Howard v.

It seems to me that in reaching that conclusion they obviously evaluate the credibility of, and in fact necessarily reject as unworthy of belief, contrary testimony and plausible inferences therefrom, as to the origin and progress of the fire, some of which was given by appellee\u2019s own witnesses, and which fairly required submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">The majority\u2019s apparent adoption of appellee\u2019s theory that there were two separate and distinct fires, and their further assumption that the first fire discovered by appellee\u2019s brakeman, Duncan, between 5:00 and 6:00 P.M. \u201cwas smothered by him,\u201d seem to me unjustified on the basis of this record, particularly in view of Duncan\u2019s candid admission even on direct examination by appellee\u2019s counsel that <em>he merely thought </em>he extin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>guished the first fire.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And while appellants\u2019 testimony may not positively identify and connect up chronologically the first 6:00 P. M. fire as identical with that which admittedly destroyed their property between 7:30 and 8:00 P. M., with deference I submit that the testimony, as well as the surrounding physical facts and time element involved, at least created a strong inference for the jury that the fire ultimately causing the damage was but a continuation of the fire which Johnson testified he had observed approximately an hour earlier being used for cooking purposes by appellee\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Johnson testified that he first observed the fire from \u201cshortly after five\u201d until \u201csomewhere around five-thirty,\u201d when he left the packing house, and again upon his return \u201ca few minutes after six.\u201d Warren testified that he first noticed the fire \u201csomething after six o\u2019clock\u201d and again at 7 P. M., \u201cor a little after\u201d in \u201capproximately the same place\u201d where he had seen the previous fire, and that at that time he saw appellee\u2019s train leaving the Lake Harbor station with the fire still burning. Crouch testified that he first saw the fire at about 7:05 P. M., shortly after he arrived home, and that when he got to the scene \u201cthere was nobody around the fire,\u201d which was then \u201cat the far end of the packing house,\u201d and that \u201cthe train, a car and the engine, had just cleared the crossing.\u201d Hoskins, the brakeman on appellee\u2019s train crew, testified by deposition that he first observed the fire in the maiden cane \u201cblowing across the track * # * at an angle\u201d toward the packing house between 6:00 and 7:00 P. M., and that he \u201cdid not do anything\u201d or turn in any alarm because he assumed someone else had done so and wanted to get back to his work. Revels first noticed the fire, according to his testimony, around 7 o\u2019clock, at which time it was in the maiden cane \u201cprobably 75 or 100 feet from the packing house,\u201d and stated that when he drove away he \u201clooked back * * * to see if they had gotten the fire out\u201d and could still see it burning in \u201cthe same place\u201d, though appellee\u2019s train had just departed. Finally, Embry testified by deposition that he saw the fire at about 7:30 P. M., at which time it was burning about \u201c50 to 75 feet from the packing house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-15\">In view of all the foregoing and other testimony, the majority\u2019s conclusion that there exists a \u201ccomplete break\u201d in the testimony connecting \u201cthe 5:30 to 6:00 o\u2019clock fire with that which between 7:30 and 8:00 o\u2019clock destroyed the packing house,\u201d seems to me unjustified, and simply an invasi\u00f3n of the jury\u2019s province by drawing inferences adverse to parties against whom a verdict has been directed. Viewing the testimony most favorably to appellants, as here we must, it seems to me that reasonable and fair-minded jurors quite justifiably might have concluded from all the testimony and reasonable inferences that the fire which ultimately destroyed appellants\u2019 property was started by appellee\u2019s employees;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that it was recklessly left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>unattended in either a burning or smouldering condition by appellee\u2019s train crew when they departed , sometime thereafter;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that appellee\u2019s crew well knew, as evidenced by Duncan\u2019s testimony, footnote (1), supra, that a \u201cmuck fire\u201d was diincult to put out and, if left unattended, might easily re-ignite the dry grass and maiden cane surrounding appellants\u2019 property, particularly with even a \u201clittle breeze blowing\u201d; <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that, with knowledge of appellants\u2019 property thus imperiled by their own acts, they took no positive action to fully extinguish any remaining embers, but even departed leaving it unattended, and, insofar as this record reveals, without informing appellants, as nearby property owners, or anyone else, of the possibility of its recurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>To my way of thinking, all of the foregoing testimony certainly constitutes \u201cprobative facts capable of supporting, with reason,\u201d a jury verdict of willful or wanton misconduct, Myers v. Reading Co., supra [331 U.S. 477, 67 S.Ct. 1339], and proof from which the jury might reasonably have inferred \u201can ethical or moral wrong committed by agents of the appellee.\u201d The majority, however, say that it does not, but to add a favorite quotation of that master of the apt phrase, the late Mr. Justice Jackson, \u201c \u2018The more (they) explain it, the more I don\u2019t understand it.\u2019 \u201d Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, at page 214, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1762, 91 L.Ed. 1995. Somewhat facetiously, I might add that, if appellee\u2019s main theory as to the extinction of the first fire be accepted, this is probably the only fire known that may well have burned appellants\u2019 property after it had been completely \u201csmothered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The majority suggestion that wantonness should not be attributed to appellee\u2019s agents from the testimony as to the origin and supposed extinction of the first fire, merely because appellant Plank departed from the warehouse area allegedly after himself being \u201csatisfied that it was quenched,\u201d seems to me a purely speculative and unwarranted assumption under this record. Certainly, that argument is hardly referable to restrict any right of recovery which might have been found by the jury to exist in favor of appellant Thomas, and its effect, if any, as a probative fact tending to negative wantonness, was at most a minor circumstance for the jury\u2019s consideration in resolving the basic issue of wanton misconduct. I actually find no testimony or inferences one way or the other in this record that Plank departed from the warehouse so satisfied,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but conceding arguendo that he did, it seems to me that a jury would still have been justified in making a finding of wanton misconduct, if they believed that Plank was justified, from all the proven facts and circumstances, in assuming that appellee\u2019s train crew would not recklessly depart the warehouse area without notification to him or someone else that they were leaving unattended a smouldering condition for which they were responsible, so as to imperil his property. In any event, to draw such an adverse inference merely from Plank\u2019s departure does not appear warranted in view of the undisputed fact that Thomas owned the packing house and Plank\u2019s sublease of a small, open lean-to shed \u201con the east end\u201d hardly justified any grave apprehension on his part as to the safety of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">Furthermore, though I regard the testimony as to the damage having actually been caused by the first fire as more credible,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I still doubt whether the majority is justified in holding that no wanton misconduct could reasonably have been found by the jury under appellee\u2019s theory that a second and subsequent fire actually caused the damage. I would not belabor this point, for regardless of whether the fire which de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>stroyed appellants\u2019 property was the \u201cfirst fire\u201d observed by the witness Johnson, or the \u201csecond fire\u201d caused by appellee\u2019s engine having discharged hot coals on the track, as revealed by the testimony of Embry, there is still direct testimony in this record as to the existence of a fire, caused in one way or the other by appellee\u2019s servants, dangerously near appellants\u2019 property, from about 5:30 P.M. almost continuously until approximately 7:30 P. M. when the property was destroyed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">All of the above detailed factual argument, both by the majority and myself, as to the sufficiency of the evidence on the issue of wantonness, is simply illustrative of the inherent impracticability of appellate courts attempting to resolve, through infinitely varying interpretations, ultimate factual issues and inferences from conflicting and equivocal testimony. Every factual argument here invoked could more appropriately have been addressed to a jury below. The basic difficulty in close cases is that varying interpretations result not so much from a literal reading of the testimony, as from the inferences \u201creasonably\u201d to be drawn therefrom. But it is not a court\u2019s province to draw or weigh inferences for a jury any more than it is its privilege to resolve direct testimonial conflicts. See Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 318 U.S. 54, 68, 63 S.Ct. 444, 87 L.Ed. 610; Tennant v. Peoria &amp; P. U. R. Co., 321 U.S. 29, 35, 64 S.Ct. 409, 88 L.Ed. 520. While I agree with my brothers that a jury\u2019s speculation and conjecture as to wantonness may not be permitted, in the absence of probative proof tending to reveal its existence, I think they mistakenly assume there must be \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of wantonness in order to justify submission. Surely a <em>prima facie </em>showing of wantonness above and beyond simple negligence may reasonably be inferred from all the probative facts and circumstances here proved. The Supreme Court has itself upheld direction of a verdict only after giving \u201cfull credence to all of the testimony\u201d and \u201cmaking due allowance for all reasonably possible inferences favoring the party whose case is attacked.\u201d Cf. Galloway v. United States, 319 U.S. 372, 395, 396, 63 S.Ct. 1077, 1090, 87 L.Ed. 1458. And, as Mr. Justice Black there observed, \u201cthe judges of the District Courts and the Circuit Courts of Appeal are the primary custodians of the (Seventh) Amendment\u201d, and have almost the entire responsibility of insuring compliance with the rule that a verdict is directed \u201conly when, <em>without weighing the credibility of the witnesses, </em>there is in the evidence no room whatever for honest difference of opinion over the factual issue in controversy.\u201d Galloway v. United States, supra, at page 407, 63 S.Ct. at page 1096, Black, J., dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">I confess an abiding conviction that the right to a jury trial is one of the great bulwarks of our constitutional system, and can only view with alarm the ever present tendency of both trial and appellate courts inadvertently to deprive some litigants of this constitutionally guaranteed right, simply because of our fallible human tendency to reject, by means of subjective rather than objective analysis, sworn testimony which, as individuals, we do not consider worthy of belief. See Lavender v. Kurn, 327 U.S. 645, 653, 66 S.Ct. 740, 90 L.Ed. 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-5\">.
