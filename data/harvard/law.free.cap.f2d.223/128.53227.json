The district court in an opinion, 130 F.Supp. 691, filed April 18, 1955 rightly concluded that the issue, and the only one remaining in the case, to be tried on remand was whether the cable of acceptance of Fernseh, G.m.b.H., was sent prior to 1:10 P.M. (E.S.T.) in Washington, D. C., June 14, 1941, and hence prior to the effective time of Executive Order 8785. Under the mandate the defendant may not now assert, as he seeks for the first time to do, that the time of the completion of the contract is to be determined by the application of German law to be the time of the receipt of the cable of acceptance by the plaintiff instead of the time of its sending.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-19\">The motion will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
