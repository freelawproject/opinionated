The application was denied on the ground that it is not possible to register corporations under the Act. Thereupon this action was instituted, asking a mandatory injunction directing the Board to issue the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-21\">The District Court held, on cross motions for summary judgment, that \u201cthe statute must be construed by its very terms as inapplicable to corporations and applicable to natural persons only.\u201d 127 F.Supp. 41, 42. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-23\">. 64 Stat. 854, ch. 953, Sees. 2-1801 through 2-1818, District of Columbia Code 1951.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
