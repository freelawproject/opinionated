Appellant clearly acknowledges that \u201cit recognizes that its trade-mark \u2018Retractable-Anvil\u2019 has certain descriptive properties, and because of this registration has been sought under Section 2(f) of the Act of 1946 * * Also in its brief, appellant states \u201cThe necessity of protecting one who has adopted a mark <em>descriptive of its product </em>as the insignia of his business * * (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">With respect to the second suggestion, which is clearly at issue, appellant alleges use of the notation since 1940, and introduced certain advertising material in which the term is associated with appellant\u2019s company. For example, \u201cInternational Stapling Machines Featuring the \u2018Retractable-Anvil\u2019 \u201d and \u201cInternational Staple and Machine Company manufacturers of \u2018Retractable-Anvil,\u2019 \u201d and others of like character.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">The above appears to be the extent of appellant\u2019s evidence in attempting to discharge its burden of proving secondary meaning or distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">In holding that appellant\u2019s evidence was insufficient, the commissioner pointed out two patents issued to one Werner Schafroth, Chief Executive Officer of applicant company, and signer of the instant application, covering a stapling device and machine. One of the patents refers to \u201cpenetrating members being formed with a crescent shaped anvil surface;\u201d and the other refers in many instances to \u201cpenetrating anvil,\u201d from which the commissioner concluded there is no doubt that an \u201canvil\u201d is a common element of a stapling device.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-13\">Since the real issue here relates to the question of sufficiency of proof, we take the liberty of quoting at some length from the commissioner\u2019s discussion and evaluation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-14\">\u201cIn addition to the two patents which are identified and claimed by applicant, the records of the Patent Office reveal the following four additional patents granted to Werner Schafroth: No. 2,469,050 (May 3, 1949) for a stapling machine which provides \u2018mechanical means for actuating staple clinching <em>anvils </em>through an arc of about 100 degrees, holding them in the extreme or clinching position, and then <em>returning the anvils to their original </em>position * * *\u2019; No. 2,469,055 (May 3, 1949) for a stapling machine having \u2018rotary piercing anvils\u2019; No. 2,470,727 (May 17, 1949) for an <em>anvil </em>clinching staple machine which provides \u2018mechanical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>means for driving staples through flaps or ends of closed cartons and actuate staple clinching <em>anvils </em>to pierce the material, clinch the inner ends of the staples and then <em>withdraw the anvils </em>leaving the staples in place\u2019; and No. 2,488,940 (November 22, 1949) for a staple machine having <em>retractable clinching anvils </em>in which it is stated, among other things, that \u2018The present invention relates to stapling machines and is conceived primarily with a stapling machine of the <em>retractable anvil type,\u2019 </em>and \u2018The anvils are subsequently withdrawn and this type of stapling machine has heretofore become known as <em>a retractable anvil stapling machine.\u2019 </em>The term \u2018retractable anvil\u2019 is used in the specifications and claims of this last mentioned patent in at least a dozen places to describe the machine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\">\u201cExhibits filed in support of the application- show a number of descriptive uses of the term, such as, \u2018featuring th\u00e9 Retractable Anvil\u2019; \u2018The retractable anvil stapler which closes filled cartons from the outside\u2019; drawings of the anvil with explanatory material which includes \u2018This final view shows the staple completely clinched and the anvils retracted\u2019; \u25a0 International Stapling machines exclusively feature the patented principle of the \u2018retractable anvil\u2019; \u2018The Retractable Anvil was invented, perfected, and incorporated in machines, especially designed for its use by Werner Schafroth * * * \u2019; \u2018International\u2019s engineers are ready to solve your individual packaging problems by building the retractable anvil into stapling machines\u2019; \u2018The anvils are retracted, leaving a neat and perfect clinch inside the carton;\u2019 and others. Several of the models pictured in the exhibits obviously include the 'mechanism covered by Patent No. .2,488,940 for a staple machine having retractable clinching anvils. The evidence submitted leads to but one conclusion, namely, the term \u2018Re- \u25a0 tractable Anvil\u2019 has not acquired a secondary meaning, i. e., it has not become distinctive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">We have carefully examined and considered the various contentions set out and discussed by appellant in its brief as well as the decisions cited in support thereof but in view of our agreement with the correctness of the commissioner\u2019s holding, it is not necessary to discuss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The decision appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">JACKSON, J., retired, recalled to participate herein in place of GARRETT, C.
