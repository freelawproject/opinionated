Since the transcripts of record and the specifications of error are practically identical in the two cases, and since they were consolidated for trial in the District Court, it is appropriate to dispose of them in a single opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Only two points are relied upon by appellants: that \u00a7 3294(c) is unconstitutionally vague, and that the trial court should have granted their motions to tranfer their cases from the Tampa Division to the Jacksonville Division. The first of these points was decided adversely to appellants\u2019 contention in Sulli v. United States, 5 Cir., 213 F.2d 100, and certiorari was recently denied in that case, 348 U.S. 826, 75 S.Ct. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">As for the second point, it is precisely the same argument which was made in Ippolito v. United States, 5 Cir., 223 F.2d 154, and Cagnina v. United States, 5 Cir., 223 F.2d 149, and for the reasons stated in the former of these we think appellants\u2019 contentions on this point are equally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The judgments are</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
