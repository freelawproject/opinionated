He moved in the District Court for suppression, as evidence, of a recording and a transcript of a telephone conversation. The court granted the motion [D.C., 121 F.Supp. 274] and the government appealed. Appellee moves to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">The court expressed the opinion that its order of suppression was reviewable and cited United States v. Cefaratti, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 297, 202 F.2d 13. In that case the indictment had been dismissed, after the order of suppression and before the appeal, and in the present case the indictment is pending. But in Cefaratti we did \u201cnot imply agreement\u201d with United States v. Rosenwasser, 9 Cir., 145 F.2d 1015, 156 A.L.R. 1200, which treated such a difference as critical. On the contrary, we rested Cefaratti \u201csquarely on the Cohen [Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528], Swift [Swift &amp; Co. Packers v. Compania Caribe, 339 U.S. 684, 70 S.Ct. 861, 94 L.Ed. 1206], and Stack [Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 72 S.Ct. 1, 96 L.Ed. 3] cases.\u201d The principle was, we said, that an order which does not \u201cterminate an action\u201d has the finality which 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 requires for appeal \u201cif (1) it has \u2018a final and irreparable effect on the rights of the parties\u2019, being \u2018a final disposition of a claimed right\u2019; (2) it is \u2018too important to be denied review\u2019; and (3) the claimed right \u2018is not an ingredient of the cause of action and does not require consideration with it.\u2019 \u201d 91 U.S.App.D.C. at page 301, 202 F.2d at page 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">In this case, as in Cefaratti, without the suppressed evidence the prosecution cannot succeed. Yet the two cases differ in at least one critical respect. In Cefaratti, the evidence was obtained by search and seizure. Rule 41(e), Fed.R.Crim.P., 18 U.S.C., provides that when evidence so obtained is suppressed it \u201cshall not be admissible * * * at any hearing or trial.\u201d In the present case, the evidence was not obtained by search and seizure and Rule 41(e) is irrelevant. The District Court may decide to admit, at the trial, the evidence it has suppressed before trial. Its order of suppression therefore has not \u201c \u2018a final and irreparable effect on the rights of the parties.\u2019 \u201d It is not \u201c \u2018a final disposition of a claimed right.\u2019 \u201d It is an \u201cinterlocutory order\u201d within the meaning of D.C.Code 1951, \u00a7 17-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">We imply no opinion on the question whether this appeal would lie if the indictment had been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
