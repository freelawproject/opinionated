The defendant, Roger Ough Henderson, insists that the local board wrongfully refused to reopen and consider anew his classification; that, since his classification as 1-0 he had changed his vocation, had become a full time minister, and was entitled to a IY-D classification; and that, because of the refusal of the board to reopen his classification, he was not guilty of the charge of refusing to carry out the orders of the board in violation of 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix \u00a7 462, the charge upon which he was tried and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-17\">The defendant registered on September 16, 1948. His registration questionnaire, which was returned to the board December 9, 1948, stated that the defendant had worked continuously since 1942 with his father on the home farm which consisted of 280 acres, and that in 1949 he intended also to farm 80 acres of land which belonged to his aunt. In that questionnaire Henderson stated that he was a conscientious objector, but he made no claim to exemption as a minister.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-18\">In the conscientious objector form which -the defendant executed he stated that he was a member of the religious organization, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and had been a part time minister for the past nine years, going from house to house publicly witnessing to his belief. The defendant\u2019s claim to a IV-E classification as a conscientious objector was granted by the local board June 2, 1949. On March 5, 1951, the board reclassified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the defendant as I-A, and a month later he was ordered to report for a physical examination. This examination indicated that the defendant was physically fit for military training and service.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">A few days later the defendant appeared before the board and stated that he had been an active member of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses since July 21, 1949, that he was a minister going from house to house passing out literature and that he tried to get out every Thursday to distribute this church literature. In this interview the defendant also stated that Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses \u201cis an unprofitable [sic] organization\u201d and that the \u201cministry is not connected as vocational.\u201d The board denied his claim to exemption as a conscientious objector, but the defendant appealed and the local board was ordered by the appeal board to classify the registrant as I-O. This the board did and then promptly notified the defendant of such change in his classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">On July 14, 1952, while his appeal was still pending, the defendant wrote a letter to the board stating that he had new evidence which he claimed entitled him to a ministerial classification. The new evidence to which the defendant referred was a certificate of his appointment, on May 1, 1952, as a \u201cpioneer\u201d minister by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. This certificate was a typewritten form executed by T. J. Sullivan, Superintendent of Ministers and Evangelists of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, and it stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">\u201cThis is to certify that Roger Henderson is a duly ordained minister of Jehovah\u2019s witnesses, engaged, as his customary vocation, in preaching and teaching the principles of this Society and administering the rites and ceremonies thereof in public worship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">\u201cHe has been duly ordained in accordance with the principles prescribed by this Society. This was by a public ceremonial on July 1, 1940 * * *. Since such date he has been recognized by this Society as qualified to represent it in such capacity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">\u201cHe was duly appointed on May 1, 1952, as a \u2018pioneer\u2019 minister and acts as a direct representative of this organization and has since been organizing and establishing churches and generally preaching the doctrines and principles of Jehovah\u2019s witnesses in a territory assigned to him. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-12\">\u201cHe is therefore declared and certified by this Society to be, in accordance with its principles, a duly ordained minister, having the qualifications to preach \u2018the gospel of God\u2019s kingdom\u2019. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">It is to be noted that this certificate, while dated July 8, 1952, stated that the defendant had been appointed a full time minister \u201ceffective\u201d May 1, 1952. Prior to his request that his classification be reopened and considered anew, the defendant had filed numerous affidavits of members and officials of his church which stated that the defendant was an ordained minister of that church and recited the work he had done as a minister. But after the submission of the defendant\u2019s certificate of appointment as a \u201cpioneer\u201d minister, the record of the local board fails to reveal any further evidence submitted prior to the time of its decision not to reopen the defendant\u2019s classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">Section 1625.2 of 32 C. F. R. provides that \u201cThe local board may reopen and consider anew the classification of a registrant (1) upon the written request of the registrant, * * * if such request is accompanied by written information presenting facts not considered when the registrant was classified, which, if true, would justify a change in the registrant\u2019s classification * * When this entire record which was before the board is considered, we think there was probably a basis in fact on which the board could have decided either to grant or to refuse the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-16\">On August 28, 1952, the board decided against the defendant. But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>decision was on an erroneous theory. The action of the board in denying the defendant\u2019s request was described in a memorandum written by the secretary of the board and made a part of the defendant\u2019s file. This memorandum stated that \u201cthe local board did not reopen the case because the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society was not recognized as an agency.\u201d While there is some conflict in the evidence as to just what was said and as to what was in the minds of the members of the board to cause their secretary to make this record as to the reason for the board\u2019s refusal to reopen the registrant\u2019s classification, it seems perfectly clear that the members of the board, when they made the decision, were of the opinion that the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society was merely the publishing house or branch of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and, therefore, was without power to appoint ministers of that faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Mr. Dunbar, the chairman of the local board, testified in the District Court that the board had instructed its secretary as to its reason for refusing to reopen the defendant\u2019s classification. He stated that he had possibly made the statement in this respect and explained that <em>\u201c* </em>* we did not recognize this, the Watchtower, we feel, or at least I felt and some of the board members felt, that the Watchtower is a publication of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses from all the correspondence and books he had on the desk, and we have never ever said Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses wasn\u2019t a religious group or sect, no, but we didn\u2019t recognize this Watchtower as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. That is what was said, or words to that effect, anyway. * * * We felt that it [the Watchtower] was a part of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, yes, but we felt it was nothing more than the publication since \u2014 For example, the Presbyterian Church, you get the Presbyterian Life. It\u2019s a publication of the Presbyterian Church. That\u2019s what we felt this was.\u201d Mr. Dunbar also said that the board felt that the pioneer certificate issued to the defendant by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society was nothing more than a letter from the publishing branch of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society has long been recognized by the Selective Service System as the legal governing body of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and it is at least partly because of this incorporated society, its purposes and activities, that the members of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are considered as belonging to a \u201crecognized religious sect.\u201d See United States v. Balogh, 2 Cir., 157 F.2d 939, 941-43 footnote. The local board was, therefore, not privileged to base its decision on its erroneous belief that the appointment of the defendant as a \u201cpioneer\u201d minister by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society was not an appointment by the governing body of a recognized religious sect. There was no basis in fact or in law for such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Since the board's refusal to reopen and consider anew the defendant\u2019s classification was founded upon this erroneous theory or belief of the board members, the board's orders to the defendant subsequent to its refusal to reopen his classification were a nullity, and the defendant's refusal to obey such orders did not constitute a violation of 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The decision of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
