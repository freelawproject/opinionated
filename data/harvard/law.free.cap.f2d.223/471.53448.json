No claims have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-27\">Claims 25-30, inclusive, are process claims, and claims 31-35, inclusive, product claims. The Board of Appeals affirmed the rejection by the examiner of the product claims (Nos. 31-35). No appeal has been taken to this court from that rejection. With regard to the process claims (Nos. 25-30), the board refused to sustain the rejection upon one of the grounds upon which the examiner based his decision, but the board affirmed the rejection upon the other grounds. Appellant appeals from this latter decision only.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Claim 25 is illustrative, and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\">\u201c25. A process of preparing phosphates which comprises introducing, for quick fusion, an at least \u00a1partially defluoriliated superphosphate, prepared by calcination at a temperature below its fusion temperature, into a mass of said material being maintained in the molten state at temperatures below volatilizing temperatures for phosphorus constituents, removing at least a portion of said molten mass when homogeneous and quenching the removed portion within at least ten seconds after its removal from the molten bath.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The references which were cited by the Board of Appeals are the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Tromel 2,093,176 Sept. 14, 1937</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Franck et al. 2,183,379 Dec. 12, 1939</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Butt 2,442,969 June 8, 1948</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Maust 2,446,978 Aug. 10, 1948</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Schilling 2,539,638 Jan. 30, 1951</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">Curtis et al. \u2014 Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, Vol. 29, No. 7, July 1937 pp. 766-770, \u201cFertilizer from Rock Phosphate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">The principal reference so far as we are here concerned is the patent to Tromel, the rejection of the appealed claims having been based by the board upon Tromel alone, or upon Tromel in view of Schilling. The patent to Maust and the article by Curtis et al. were used as auxiliary references. The patents to Butt and Franck et al. were not relied upon by the board in the rejection of the claims here involved, but the Solicitor for the Patent Office suggests that they may be useful in arriving at an understanding of the general subject matter to which the claims are directed. In view of the limited issues which have been presented to this court, an exhaustive discussion of the references is not deemed necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">Appellant\u2019s application is directed to a method of producing from \u201cphosphate rock\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a phosphorus compound (primarily tricalcium phosphate) suitable for use as an animal feed supplement. Some of the references have the same object, while the others are primarily concerned with the production of phosphates to use as <em>fertilizer. </em>Although appellant points out these different objects, it does not seem that there is any difference in the processes directed to these two objects which would have any bearing on the patentability of the present process, and appellant does not seem to so claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">Apparently, in so far as we can determine from the record, phosphate, rock in its natural state is not satisfactory for use either as a feed or as a fertilizer, and it is usually further treated before use. Some of the procedures involve treatment with various types of acid, and \u201ccalcination\u201d or roasting. In appellant\u2019s specification we are told that it is necessary to reduce the amount of flourine which is in the natural rock to extremely low percentages in order to use the rock to best advantage. Apparently large amounts of the flourine are removed by the acid treatment and calcining steps, but enough remains to cause serious difficulties in animal feeding. We are also told in the specification that it is desirable to obtain as high a percentage of the <em>alpha </em>crystalline form of tricalcium phosphate as possible, because the <em>alpha </em>crystalline form has its phosphate, P2O5, in a more \"available\u201d state than the natural rock, i. e., it can be more readily absorbed by the animals.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">The process described in the application involves melting the phosphate rock either before or after previous acid treatment or calcining steps, and then \u201cquenching\u201d the molten rock immediately. This process is said to reduce the amount of flourine to negligible amounts, and to maximize the <em>alpha </em>form of tricalcium phosphate.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>It is apparent from the specification that appellant thought he was the first to develop the quenching step, and it was strongly emphasized in the application and its prosecution below for its efficacy in obtaining the <em>alpha </em>crystalline form. The Board of Appeals refused to treat this step of appellant\u2019s process as being inventive, stating, \u201cQuick quenching of Tromel\u2019s product seems to us to be wholly uninventive since this is a known expedient in the art to preserve the tricalcium phosphate in the alpha form. Schilling discloses the expedient and it is further illustrated by Maust, * * * and the Curtis et al. article, * * The ground of rejection of the examiner which was overruled by the board related to a particular combination of references thought to show the unpatentability of this quenching step. Although appellant\u2019s reasons of appeal are general in form, alleging that the \u201cBoard of Appeals erred in affirming the Primary Examiner\u2019s rejection upon [references],\u201d the brief in behalf of appellant before this court does not controvert nor discuss at any length the board\u2019s holding with respect to the unpatentability of the <em>quenching </em>step recited in the claims. It follows that appellant must be deemed to have abandoned any claim of patentability for this quenching step. In re Cremer, 173 F.2d 376, 36 C.C.P.A., Patents, 980, 990. In re Dalton, 188 F.2d 170, 38 C.C.P.A., Patents, 953, 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Thus, the only question before this court is whether there is invention in \u201cintroducing, for quick fusion, an at least partially deflourinated superphosphate, * * * into a mass of said material being maintained in the molten state * * Appellant argues that this is \u201cthe critical and distinguishing step of the claims here on appeal.\u201d In his brief appellant states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">\u201cThe above defined critical step effects substantially instantaneous fusion of the phosphate rock whereby the flourine is almost completely removed therefrom. Gradual heating of the phosphate rock to the fusion temperature, as in the prior art does not achieve the same result as that obtained by appellant. Gradual heating of the phosphate rock to the fusion temperature yields, even after a prolonged period of maintenance of the rock in the molten state, a product which contains on the order of ten times as much flourine as that resulting from the method embraced by the appealed claims. Since it is the flourine content which is the limiting factor on the <em>quantity </em>of a particular phosphate material which can be used as an animal feed supplement, the significance of the appellant\u2019s invention is apparent.\u201d [Italics quoted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">The tribunals below were mainly concerned with the patentability of the product claims, and with the patentability of the quenching step of the process, and consequently relatively little is said on the precise issue now before this court, whether the manner of <em>melting </em>the rock is inventive.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">In an examiner\u2019s letter dated January 16, 1952, which finally rejected appellant\u2019s claims, the following is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aau\">\u201cApplicant now argues that the manner of melting the phosphatic charge is critical and inventive. The material to be melted is introduced into a molten bath of the material. This appears to be merely a convenient and obvious manner of melting a charge and cannot be considered inventive. Note Chalmot of record, for example, which shows solid phosphatic material introduced into a body of molten material. Moreover, the present specification does not support the contention that the particular manner of melting the charge is essential, but merely states that the preferred method is a convenient way of operating.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">The Chalmot reference referred to by the examiner is not in the record, and cannot of course, be considered by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-15\">The \u201cExaminer\u2019s Statement\u201d made upon appeal to the Board of Appeals does not treat specifically the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>whether there is invention in the quick fusion as defined by the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The decision of the Board of Appeals contains the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">\u201c* * We believe that the Tromel two stage procedure involves a fusion sufficiently rapid to come within the terms of the appealed claims due to the introduction of the heated rock from the first zone into the second or fusion zone. The latter would contain material maintained in the molten state. The claims contain no correlation between the amount of rock entering and the amount maintained in the molten pool.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Although the Board of Appeals appears to have rested its affirmance on a showing of the step in the Tromel reference, under well settled law, the examiner\u2019s grounds of rejection are deemed to have been affirmed by the board in the absence of a specific reversal. In re Dreshfield, 110 F.2d 235, 27 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The principal contention by appellant is that Tromel is an ineffective reference on the ground that it does not show the introduction of the unmelted material into a molten pool of the same material. Tromel shows a two stage process where the rock is heated to a temperature just short of fusion in the first stage, and then is led into a second stage where the temperature of the furnace is above the fusion temperature. There is no statement in Tromel that there is an actual <em>pool </em>of molten material in the second stage. Although the board thought that the second stage would necessarily contain a pool of molten material, a reading of the \u201cExaminer\u2019s Statement\u201d gives the impression that its author may have thought that there was <em>no </em>such pool. Appellant argues that such conflicting interpretations destroy Tromel as a reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">We do not consider it necessary to decide here whether or not Tromel shows the particular manner of melting which is claimed herein. Tromel as well as Schilling shows the melting of phosphate rock to remove flourine, and in order to prevail here, appellant must show that this method of melting is <em>critical.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">We cannot regard the statement in the claim that the fusion is \u201cquick\u201d as defining a critical step, independently of the method of attaining such \u201cquick fusion.\u201d How quick is \u201cquick\u201d? That certainly cannot serve to distinguish appellant\u2019s method from that of the prior art. As is pointed out by the brief in behalf of the Commissioner of Patents, the time of Tromel\u2019s melting operation is one half hour, while the \u201caverage holding time\u201d of the fused material in appellant\u2019s furnace is about one hour, and so \u201cTromel\u2019s fusion is necessarily \u2018quick\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">Furthermore, we do not regard the specification that the quick fusion results from introducing unmelted material into a molten pool of the same material as going any further toward defining a critical step. The time required by such fusion would be necessarily dependent upon the relative quantities of the molten mass and the unmelted mass, and upon the temperatures of each. We are unable to discern that the fusion attained by the method of the claims would be substantially quicker than the fusion of the prior art, or even that it would be quicker. Such a situation precludes a finding of criticality by this court in the face of the rejection below.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">Perhaps the most damaging <em>objection </em>to a finding of criticality in the appellant\u2019s method of melting is that made by the Primary Examiner, that the specification itself negatives criticality in the melting step. Appellant\u2019s specification states that <em>completely </em>deflourinated material may be used in the process; that the temperature of the material \u201cis not critical provided it is in the molten condition, nor is it critical with respect to the length of time under which this material is maintained in a molten condition so long as it is completely and entirely processed into a molten condition\u201d; that the longer the molten material is maintained in the molten state, the lower the flourine content will be; that the feed materials should be placed in a molten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>state or condition \u201cby heating the material to a molten state\u201d; and that this is <em>\u201cgenerally done\u201d \u201ceconomically\u201d </em>in a reverberatory furnace or other vessel having a large pool of previously molten material. (Emphasis added.) One of the two examples in the specification stated that a \u201cpool of molten material was maintained in the furnace,\u201d while the other stated only that the unmelted material \u201cwas then melted and fused at a temperature of about 1500\u00b0C.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">It is apparent that appellant in his specification considered fusion attained by the introduction of unmelted material into a pool of molten material as the equivalent of fusion attained by any other method. So treating the process in his specification, he cannot now be heard to claim that it is critical. In re Field, 174 F.2d 128, 36 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1035; In re Bloomer, 178 F.2d 407, 37 C.C.P.A., Patents, 770; In re Gardiner, 171 F.2d 313, 36 C.C.P.A., Patents, 748; In re Borcherdt, 197 F.2d 550, 39 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1045; In re McCarn, 212 F.2d 797, 41 C.C.P.A., Patents, 905, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">There remains to be considered only an affidavit introduced by appellant, after the final rejection but before the hearing before the Board of Appeals. The board in its opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">\u201cAppellant requests us to consider an affidavit under Rule 132 [35 U.S. C.A.Appendix] filed July 14, 1952 although it has not been commented upon by the Examiner. This affidavit compares the flourine content resulting from quick fusion of phosphate rock (.003%) with that obtained by slow fusion in a reverberatory furnace (.041%). We do not find that this affidavit has any bearing on the rejections which we have sustained; consequently we find no occasion to take any further note thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Appellant has assigned this holding of the board as error. The affidavit compared the flourine content left after treating a partially deflourinated phosphate rock by appellant\u2019s process, with the flourine content remaining after uncalcined phosphate rock was subjected to a \u201cslow fusion process.\u201d As is pointed out by the Solicitor for the Patent Office, \u201cThe comparison, of course, should have been between appellant\u2019s quick fusion process and the quick fusion process of Tromel.\u201d We are of the opinion that the board was correct in holding that the affidavit has no bearing on the case. Even giving full credit to the affidavit, it cannot show that appellant\u2019s method of melting is critical over those shown in the prior art now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Since appellant has not demonstrated that his method of melting phosphate rock is critical and distinguishes over the prior art, it follows that the decision of the Board of Appeals must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-16\">. The Curtis et al. article states in a footnote: \u201cThe term \u2018rock phosphate\u2019 is used to distinguish the amorphous phosphates, such as occur in the deposits in Tennessee and Florida, from the \u2018mineral phosphates\u2019 of definite chemical compositions, such as fluorapatite, phosphorite, etc.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
