With the end of World War II, it became apparent that before expiration of this contract in 1953 Sierra\u2019s rapidly increasing demands would require either the construction of an additional transmission line into its area by P G &amp; E, or the development of a new source of power. Accordingly, in 1947 Sierra commenced negotiations with P G &amp; E and the Bureau of Reclamation which offered to furnish power from Shasta Dam.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">At first P G &amp; E offered a 15-year contract at the 1938 contract rates but with an \u201cescalator fuel clause.\u201d Sierra rejected this and turned to intensive negotiations with governmental agencies for \u201ccheap Government power.\u201d P G &amp; E then proposed a lower rate (the so-called P-31 schedule) for the same term without the escalator clause. This proposal was accepted in June 1948 and embodied in a contract which was duly filed with the California Public Service Commission and the Federal Power Commission. The P-31 schedule was a lower rate approved by the California Public Service Commission (formerly Railroad Commission) to enable P G &amp; E to retain business of customers that would otherwise \u201cbe lost altogether\u201d to public power competition. But a significant condition of this approval was that any loss from such service would be borne by P G &amp; E\u2019s stockholders and not by its other customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">In 1952, however, when public power from Shasta Dam was no longer available to Sierra, P G &amp; E sought the California Commission\u2019s approval for rate increases for Sierra and other customers under the P-31 schedule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commission refused on the ground that the special contracts were entered into \u201cin order to forestall alleged government competition and with the clear understanding that its stockholders must bear any burden * * In February 1953, in a further effort to increase its rates, P G &amp; E filed the schedule of increased rates in question here with the Federal Power Commission under \u00a7 205 of the Federal Power Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sierra thereupon intervened. It urged that \u00a7 205, which provides for Commission approval of newly proposed rates merely upon a finding that they are reasonable, is not applicable where, as here, approval would effect unilateral abrogation of a duly filed rate contract; that to effect such abrogation the Commission must first make the determination, provided for in \u00a7 206(a), that the rate contract to be superseded is \u201cunjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential * * <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thg Federal Power Commission rejected this contention by a vote of three to two and approved the increased rates upon a finding, under \u00a7 205, that they were reasonable. Sierra brought this petition to review the Commission\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-15\">The novel and important question for decision is whether and to what extent the pre-existing right of utilities to enter into enforceable rate contracts has been abrogated by the Commission\u2019s power under the Act to regulate rates. Congress did not expressly abrogate that right. To find such abrogation by implication,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>\u201c* * * we must be guided by the principle that repeals by implication are not favored, and, indeed, that a statute will not be construed as taking away a common-law right existing at the date of its enactment, unless that result is imperatively required; that is to say, unless it be found that the preexisting right is so repugnant to the statute that the survival of such right would in effect deprive the subsequent statute of its efficacy; in other words, render its provisions nugatory.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">So guided, we examine the pertinent provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Section 205(a) of the Federal Power Act requires that rates for the sale of electric energy within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction shall be \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d Section 205(c) provides that all rates, charges and contracts relating thereto shall be filed with the Commission. Section 205(d) provides that no change in such filed rates, charges, or contracts relating thereto shall be made without notifying the Commission. Section 205(e) authorizes the Commission, upon complaint or upon its own motion, to determine whether the newly proposed rate or charge is just and reasonable. In modifying a filed rate under \u00a7 205, it is not necessary to prove that the original rate is unjust or unreasonable; the new rate will take effect if the utility sustains the burden of proving that it is \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d.5 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Under \u00a7 206(a), on the other hand, a finding of unreasonableness <em>is </em>a prerequisite to modification of a filed rate. That section authorizes the Commission, upon its own motion or upon complaint, to find that a rate, or contract affecting such rate, is \u201cunjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential.\u201d If it so finds, it must determine and fix a \u201cjust and reasonable rate, charge * * * or contract to be thereafter observed * * A\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">The Commission argues that under both \u00a7\u00a7 205 and 206(a) \u201cthe statutory scheme is to depend upon regulatory action and initiative in lieu of private contract to protect the buyers\u2019 interests\u2014\u25a0 in the public interest.\u201d But we think this stretches the statutory scheme too far. The Act\u2019s primary aim is that only just and reasonable rates shall be charged. Since \u201cstatutory reasonableness is an abstract quality represented by an area rather than a pinpoint\u201d,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the statutory purpose may be satisfied by more than one rate. Clearly, if contract rates are reasonable, the public interest does not require allowance of higher rates upon the unilateral application of the seller under \u00a7 205, just because the Commission deems the higher rates also to be reasonable. Therefore, it does not \u201cdeprive the statute of its efficacy\u201d to give effect to a duly filed rate contract until such time as the rates specified therein are found unreasonable under \u00a7 206(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">We cannot agree with the Commission that this view of the statutory scheme is inconsistent with \u00a7 205\u2019s requirement that contracts and notice of any changes therein shall be filed with the Commission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Regarding a comparable requirement in a Kansas statute, the Supreme Court said, \u201cThe consent of the Commission * * * is made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>necessary only to prevent changing schedules without notice to the Commission, and thus to secure a proper supervision of schedules.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Obviously the mere fact that two parties have agreed upon a rate, or to a change therein, does not effect an exemption from regulation. We think these references contemplate continued use, rather than abandonment, of rate contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Our view of the statutory scheme is supported by a recent Third Circuit case, Mobile Gas Service Corp. v. Federal Power Comm.,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the authorities therein relied upon. Although- the case arose under the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 717 et seq., \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5(a) of that Act correspond almost verbatim with \u00a7\u00a7 205 and 206(a) of the Power Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There, as here, the Commission had- abrogated a pre-existing contract without any finding that the contract rate was unreasonable. With one judge dissenting, the Court of Appeals, in a carefully considered opinion, reversed the Commission\u2019s order. The court relied upon: (1) cases arising under the Public Utility Law of Kansas which contained provisions similar to \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 (a) of the Natural Gas Act;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (2) the interpretation of the Gas Act adopted by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Colorado Interstate Gas Co. v. Federal Power Comm.;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (3) the doctrine that common law rights will not be impaired without a clear authorization;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (4) a colloquy at hearings on a predecessor bill;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and (5) the signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>cant lack of debate on the question in view of the drastic impact wholesale abrogation of contracts would have had on the natural gas industry.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> These grounds apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Cases relied on by the Commission do not sustain its position. Tyler Gas Service Co. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., which the Commission asserts is inconsistent with the Mobile case, expressly withheld any opinion as to the correctness of that decision.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Midland Realty Co. v. Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co. upheld the constitutionality of the procedure adopted here by the Commission, but did so \u201cupon the construction that the [Missouri] supreme court put upon the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Obviously, in construing the Federal Power Act, we are not bound by the Missouri court\u2019s construction of its statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Although the Commission has at all times insisted that no finding of unreasonableness is required, the majority opinion approving the increase stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">* * if a finding on the lawfulness of the 1948 contract rate were necessary or appropriate, on the record before us that finding would have to be that the 1948 rate is unreasonably low and therefore unlawful. For none of the evidence in this record warrants a finding that any rate would be reasonable that would produce a return of substantially less than the 4.75% resulting from the proposed rate, which is the minimum P G &amp; E is willing to accept.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">This statement, however, is based entirely upon a record made in a proceeding under \u00a7 205(e) in which the unreasonableness of the contract rate was not in issue. And, in any event, as the dissenting Commissioners observed, \u201cno such finding is made. Rather, it seems to have been carefully avoided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the order under review is set aside and the ease remanded to the Commission with instructions either to dismiss the proceeding or for further proceedings under \u00a7 206(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\">. 49 Stat. 847 et seq.
