Johnson Company (a corporation), and others. The complaint was in two counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant filed an answer <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>on June 30,1950. The answer contained five counterclaims denominated as such.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellee filed a reply<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on November 16, 1950, an amended reply<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on March 31, 1952, and a motion on November 20, 1952. The motion was for a summary judgment dismissing the counterclaims. The District Court heard the motion and, on June 19, 1953, entered a so-called judgment which purported to dismiss the counterclaims. From that so-called judgment this appeal was taken on August 18, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">This appeal must be dismissed for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">As indicated above, seven claims for relief were presented in this action\u2014 two as claims of appellee and five as counterclaims of appellant. The so-called judgment here appealed from purported to adjudicate the counterclaims, but did not adjudicate or purport to adjudicate appellee\u2019s claims. The District Court did not make the express determination or give the express direction mentioned in Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended on December 27, 1946, eifeetive March 19, 1948.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore the so-called judgment was not a final decision, within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291, and was not appealable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-15\">If, after our mandate goes down, the District Court sees fit to make the express determination and to give the express direction mentioned in Rule 54 (b) and to enter judgment in conformity therewith, and if appellant appeals from such judgment, it will not be necessary for the parties to reprint their present briefs or the present record on appeal. Such appeal, if taken, can be heard upon the present briefs and the present record, supplemented by a record of proceedings had in the District Court after receipt of our mandate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, we are not to be understood as suggesting that the District Court should or should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>not make the express determination or give the express direction mentioned in Rule 54(b), these being matters exclusively within the District Court\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\">. See Rule 10(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-7\">. The answer was entitled \u201cAnswer and counterclaim of [appellant].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b150-8\">. See Rule 7(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b150-9\">. The reply was entitled \u201cAnswer of [appellee] to counterclaims of [appellant].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b150-10\">. The amended reply was entitled \u201cAmended answer of [appellee] to counterclaims of [appellant].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b150-11\">. Rule 54(b) provides: \u201cWhen more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment upon one or more but less than all of the claims only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates less than all the claims shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b150-17\">.
