The application was examined and passed for publication pursuant to section 12(a) of the Trade-Mark Act of 1946, and the mark was duly published in the Official Gazette on May 1, 1951. On June 28, 1951, appellant filed its notice of opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-18\">In its notice of opposition, appellant alleged that it is the owner of TradeMark Registration No. 324,210, dated May 14, 1935, for the term \u201cGame Bird\u201d for hats for men and women. It was also alleged, in substance, that the goods to which the term \u201cRailbird\u201d is to be applied are identical in kind with the goods sold by opposer and that there would likely be confusion in the trade to the detriment of opposer.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-19\">There was no testimony taken by op-poser. However, opposer did submit, by stipulation, copies of the definitions of \u201crail\u201d and \u201crailbird\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AGb\">Webster\u2019s New Twentieth Century Dictionary (Unabridged) copyright, 1942, by The World Publishing Company:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-20\">\u201crail, n. [OFr. rasle, raale, a rail; same origin as rattle, being so called from its note.] Any bird of the family Rallidm; more particularly, Rallus virginianus, the American rail, a favorite game bird; also, the land rail or corn crake, and water rail of Europe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>\"railbird, n. 1. A bird, the Carolina rail, <em>Porzana </em>Carolina.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">2. In sporting parlance, a hanger-on at race tracks; a small better; a piker. [Slang]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">These definitions were submitted apparently for showing that the marks \u201cRail-bird\u201d and \u201cGame Bird\u201d are synonymous in meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Applicant-appellee submitted deposition testimony of two of its employees. This testimony, insofar as pertinent here, is to the effect that an advertisement of the \u201cRailbird\u201d hat appeared in \u201cEsquire\u201d magazine for the fall, 1950, season; and that the mark is stamped in the hat band of hats. Other testimony also brought out information to the effect that birds and parts of birds have been used as headgear since 1580 B.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The Examiner of Interferences was of the opinion that the resemblance between the terms \u201cGame Bird\u201d and \u201cRailbird\u201d was such \u201cthat their contemporaneous use would be reasonably likely to result in confusion in trade\u201d when used on the identical item of men\u2019s hats.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The Assistant Commissioner did not concur in this belief and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">\u201cIf the proofs had shown that \u2018Railbird\u2019 functions as a trade-mark, I should be constrained to disagree with the Examiner of Interferences as to likelihood of confusion on the grounds that the marks of both parties are apparently always used in conjunction with the more familiar and better known trade-marks \u2018Dobbs\u2019 (opposer\u2019s) and \u2018Stetson\u2019 and device (applicant\u2019s), thereby eliminating likelihood that purchasers would be confused, misled or deceived into believing that the hats so marked emanate from the same source; and the marks do not look alike, do not sound much alike and have distinctly different connotations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">However, the Assistant Commissioner felt, <em>ex parte, </em>that applicant was not entitled to registration of the term \u201cRail-bird\u201d since it was merely a style designation of a particular Stetson hat. In this respect the Assistant Commissioner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-13\">\u201c * * * So far as it appears, the word \u2018Railbird\u2019 has been called to the attention of the public in one advertisement as a particular type or style of \u2018Stetson\u2019 hat, it is used to set up orders in the order section of applicant and is used by salesmen in selling hats to retailers. It is true that the word appears in the hatband, but that fact alone, unaccompanied by evidence of advertising and advancement as a trade-mark showing the \u2018indisputable intention of acquiring it as such\u2019 * * * is insufficient to overcome the evidence indicating that the word is used only to designate a particular style. Style designations, as such, are not registrable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">Opposer has appealed from the decision of the Assistant Commissioner. Applicant has not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">It has been held that an appeal by opposer-appellant, under certain circumstances, is not moot notwithstanding that registration has been denied to applicant-appellee on other grounds. Pep Boys, Manny, Joe, &amp; Jack v. The Fisher Bros. Co., 94 F.2d 204, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 818. This must necessarily be so under the facts in this case since it appears that applicant-appellee is not <em>finally </em>precluded from obtaining registration if he overcomes the <em>ex parte </em>objections to registration raised by the Assistant Commissioner. Compare with the situation in Pabst-Ette Corp. v. Dr. W. J. Ross Co., 120 F.2d 390, 28 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1164, where applicant-appellee did not appeal from an <em>ex parte </em>decision that the mark sought to be registered was either descriptive or misdescriptive of appellee\u2019s goods, and since this decision was final, appellant-opposer\u2019s appeal from the holding that its goods and appellee\u2019s goods were not of the same descriptive properties was held to have become moot. Also see Frankfort Distilleries, Inc., v. Dextora Co., 103 F.2d 924, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1244. In the present case, it ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>pears-from the recordy.'and in fact it i\u00e1 stated by. appellee that \u201cthe.way is left open by the decision of the Commissioner for appellee to-file a new application under the same law to register its mark after obtaining a <em>greater quantity </em>of trademark use, and this action is intended if need be.\u201d It, therefore, follows that the appeal by appellant-opposer is- well-taken in order to obtain our review of the portion of the decision which held the marks not cohfusingly similar, this being necessary to finally resolve the <em>inter partes </em>portion of the Assistant Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The law which is pertinent to th\u00e9 issue of confusing similarity in the present case was set forth in our recent case of L. J. Mueller Furnace Co. v. United Conditioning Corporation, 222 F.2d 755, 42 C.C.P.A., Patents, \u2014. We therefore quote the following portion of the decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE8\">\u201cThe test applied by this court in an opposition proceeding is the likeIihood- of confusion in the mind of the purchasing public as to the origin of the goods. Nestle\u2019s Milk Products, Inc., v. Baker Importing Co., Inc., 182 F.2d 193, 37 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1066; Standard Laboratories, Inc., v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Co., 167 F.2d 1022, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1146. This is a subjective test. -Therefore prior decisions are of lit-tie\u2019value since each case must be decided on its own particular set of facts. North Star Manufacturing Co. v. Wells Lamont Corp., 193 F.2d 204, 39 C.C.P.A., Patents, 764.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO6\">\u201cHowever, various rules have been devoloped for the purpose of aiding in the determination of ,the question of confusing similarity. It is well settled- that the marks must be considered in their entireties.; Apollo Shirt Co. v. Enro Shirt Co., Inc., 165 F.2d 469, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, 849; Valpo Co. v. Solis, Entrialgo y. Compania, 175 F.2d 457, 36 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1160. But different features may be analyzed to determine whether the marks are confusingly similar. Hoffman-La Roche Inc., v. Kawerk, etc., 148 F.2d 557, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 954, and similarities and- dissimilarities should both be considered, Younghusband v. Kurlash Co., Inc., 94 F.2d 230, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 886.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU7\">\u201cIt has also been held that the common portions of the marks can.not. be disregarded; Schering &amp; Glatz, Inc., v. Sharp &amp; Dohme, Inc., 146 F.2d 1019, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 827, but a descriptive word, which has little trade-mark significance, will not be regarded as the dominant part of the mark, West Disinfecting Co. v. Lan-O-Sheen Co., 163 F.2d 566, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, 706.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApA\">It appears that appellant\u2019s main contention, that- the term \u201cRailbird\u201d is confusingly similar to the term, \u201cGame Bird,\u201d is predicated on the proposition that similarity as to either sound, appearance, or meaning is sufficient to indicate likelihood of confusion, citing Hancock v. American Steel &amp; Wire Co. of N. J., etc., 203 F.2d 737, 741, 40 C.C.P.A., Patents, 931. There is no doubt that this is the law. However, whether these factors exist, as indicated by the above-quoted law, is a matter of opinion dependent on the facts of each particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-24\">It is our opinion, applying the above-quoted criteria for determining similarity to the terms before us, when the terms are viewed in their entireties, they do not look alike or sound alike, as held by the Assistant Commissioner. Although the common portions of the words, \u201cBird,\u201d cannot be disregarded, and are no doubt identical, the dissimilarities must also be considered. These dissimilar portions, \u201cRail\u201d and \u201cGame,\u201d in our opinion, are sufficiently different to .caus\u00e9 the words in their entireties to be more different than alike. We reach this conclusion notwithstanding that the above-cited dictionary definitions define a railbird as a game bird. In the Hancock case, supra, we said \u201cOur holding in this case that conf usion is likely is based on our belief that the <em>popular </em>or <em>ordina.</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>ry </em>meanings of \u2018Tornado\u2019 and \u2018Cyclone\u2019 are identical, although there are certain technical distinctions between the two terms.\u201d In the present case, although it appears that the term \u201cgame bird\u201d is generic to the term \u201crailbird\u201d we feel that this fact of itself would not be likely to cause confusion because, as we have indicated above, the words do not sound alike or look alike, and for the further reason that we do not feel that the <em>popular </em>or <em>ordinary </em>meanings of the terms are identical, one word merely being a species of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">We must state that in reaching our decision we have flatly rejected the following theory presented by appellee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4J\">\u201cThe use of birds on and as hats, headdress and sections of birds such as wings, and hats wholly covered with pheasant feathers, not only from ancient times but also down to the present time, before and since appellant\u2019s [opposer\u2019s] use of its mark, is clearly equivalent to the use of the word \u2018bird\u2019 as describing those hats. * * * Since the figure of a bird, large or small, on a hat is in the public domain, so is the word, \u2018bird\u2019 in regard to hats. * * * \u2018A descriptive word having little trademark significance, will not be regarded as the dominant part of a mark.\u2019 * * * It is therefore believed that the words of the mark must be considered together, and since \u2018bird\u2019 is not dominant, \u2018Rail\u2019 and \u2018Game\u2019 must be regarded as the distinguishing portions of the marks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Both the Examiner of Interferences and the Assistant Commissioner apparently felt that the \u201cdominant portion theory\u201d was not applicable to the present facts. We are of the same opinion because we feel that the contention that the term \u201cbird\u201d is descriptive of hats is quite unrealistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">We feel that it is also necessary to comment on the Assistant Commissioner\u2019s statement \u201c * * * that the marks of both parties are apparently always used in conjunction with the more familiar and better known trade-marks \u2018Dobbs\u2019 (opposer\u2019s) and \u2018Stetson\u2019 * * (applicant\u2019s), thereby eliminating likelihood that purchasers would be confused * * We are in agreement with appellant-opposer\u2019s statement, \u201cThe mark for which appellee itself sought registration is not Stetson Railbird but Rail-bird alone. * * * The appellant\u2019s registration covers Game Bird alone. It is true that in the two advertisements made of record and in the specimens of appellant\u2019s mark submitted with the notice of opposition, the additional trademarks do appear. The controversy however, between the parties concerns Game Bird and Railbird, the marks shown in the application and registration respectively. * * * \u201d We therefore feel that it was improper to consider the marks Stetson and Dobbs under the foregoing fact situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">There is one other aspect of the present case which requires consideration, namely, that appellee filed no appeal from the adverse eoj <em>parte </em>holding of the Assistant Commissioner. In this respect, we are of the opinion that we have no authority to consider the <em>ex parte </em>decision of the Assistant Commissioner since no appeal was taken by appellee: See Pocahontas Operators Association v. Carter Coal Co., 160 F.2d 114, 34 C.C.P.A., Patents, 926; Coty, Inc., v. Perfumes Habana, S. A., 190 F.2d 91, 38 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1180; Revere Paint Co. v. Twentieth Century Chemical Co., 150 F.2d 135, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">It is to be noted that appellant did not include in the record appellee\u2019s exhibits 1 to 19, inclusive, and an index to these exhibits. The index and exhibits were added on motion of appellee to correct diminution of the record. This added matter was necessary for a proper decision of this ease and costs for making such addition are therefore assessed against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"A76\">We have carefully considered appellant\u2019s arguments and the cited cases, however, for the foregoing reasons we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>are of the opinion that the decision appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">WORLEY, J., concurs in the conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">JACKSON, Judge, retired, sat for GARRETT, Chief Judge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
