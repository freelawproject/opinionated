Specifically, the indictments charged that the defendants conspired (a) unlawfully to possess counterfeit obligations, (b) unlawfully to publish as true said obligations, and (c) unlawfully to possess with intent to publish as true said obligations, in each instance, \u201cin violation of Title 18 U.S.Code, Section 265.\u201d The formal conclusion of the indictment was \u201ccontrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 88 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) and against the peace and dignity of the United States of America.\u201d At that time, Section 88 was a general conspiracy statute proscribing and penalizing conspiracy to commit any offense, and was punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of two years. Title 18 U.S.Code, \u00a7 294 was in part concerned with counterfeiting and proscribed conspiracy to counterfeit and was punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of fifteen years. Appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years. He now files a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, claiming that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law. He alleges that he relied upon the references in the indictment, and thinking that the maximum sentence would be two years, and already facing a thirteen years sentence by a state court, he passed up an opporcunity to plead nolo contendere and get an eighteen months sentence, and he also allowed himself to be poorly defended by a court-appointed lawyer. He claims that, if he had realized that the more serious crime was charged and that he could be sentenced under Section 294, he would either have pleaded nolo contendere and submitted to an eighteen months sentence, or would have borrowed money and hired a \u201cfirst grade\u201d lawyer and put up a \u201cfirst grade\u201d defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">As between the two statutes, Section 88 punishing conspiracy to commit any offense and Section 294 punishing conspiracy to counterfeit, the particular is entitled to preference over the general statute. Price v. United States, 5 Cir., 74 F.2d 120. Congress evidently intended to provide for a greater punishment for conspiracy to counterfeit than for conspiracy to commit other offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">The law is well settled that the statute on which an indictment is founded must be determined from the facts charged in the indictment, and the facts as pleaded may bring the offense charged within one statute, although another statute is referred to in the indictment. William v. United States, 168 U.S. 382, 389, 18 S.Ct. 92, 42 L.Ed. 509; United States v. Nixon, 235 U.S. 231, 235, 35 S.Ct. 49, 59 L.Ed. 207; United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219, 229, 61 S.Ct. 463, 85 L.Ed. 788; Capone v. United States, 7 Cir., 51 F.2d 609, 616, 76 A.L.R. 1534; Pickens v. United States, 5 Cir., 123 F.2d 333, 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">The pertinent part of Rule 7(c), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C., reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-14\">\u201cThe indictment or information shall state for each count the official or customary citation of the statute, rule, regulation or other provision of law which the defendant is alleged therein to have violated. Error in the citation or its omission shall not be ground for dismissal of the indictment or informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>tion or for reversal of a conviction if the error or omission did not mislead the defendant to his prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Appellant relies strongly upon that Rule and strenuously insists that the error did mislead him to his prejudice. If that were true, the error could have been corrected on motion or on appeal from the original judgment and sentence. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 was not intended as a substitute for appeal, but was enacted to take the place of habeas corpus and has application only where the sentence is void or subject to collateral attack. Taylor v. United States, 4 Cir., 177 F.2d 194. Certainly the sentence in this case was not void nor subject to collateral attack, and the judgment denying defendant\u2019s motion under Section 2255 is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"AzO\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-9\">.
