Erskine, District Judge, who died before he could make or file any findings in the case. By agreement of the parties the cause was submitted to the Honorable Edward P. Murphy upon the record of the testimony and other evidence previously presented to Judge Erskine. The court made findings of fact and entered a judgment in favor of the appellees as plaintiffs and dismissed the appellant\u2019s counterclaim. Upon this appeal the specifications of error in the main assert the right of appellant- to have judgment upon this counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">The record shows that the appellant -is a large and well known manufacturer of paint and paint products which it has sold to the trade and the consuming public throughout the country for more than 40 years. In 1907 it adopted a picture of a Dutch boy as its trade mark for white lead. Subsequently it commenced using the words \u201cDutch Boy\u201d in its advertising and these words were applied successively to linseed oil, red lead paint, white lead paint, flatting oil, wall primer and other paint products. The word trade mark \u201cDutch Boy\u201d was registered in the Patent Office in 1937 for a number of paints and paint products including inside and outside paints, primers, undercoats, lacquers and varnishes. All these uses antedated by a considerable number of years the appellees\u2019 entry into the paint business. In connection with its sales of Dutch Boy paints appellant made very large expenditures devoted to advertising its Dutch Boy trade mark. Its products were shown to be regularly sold through independent dealers as well as through its 39 retail stores. There were some 1200 of these dealers in the eleven' Pacific Coast states. Appellant's sales of paint products bearing this trade mark have aggregated over six hundred million dollars and it has expended in excess of nineteen million dollars in national advertising.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>The appellees on the other hand entered the paint business in 1946 after their discharge from the Navy where they had had some training in connection with the naval paint program. After initiating the paint business and incorporating their enterprise under the name of Manning-Mitchell, Inc., they had some difficulty in procuring raw materials for their marine paints. Then in the same year they acquired for some $9,000 a partnership concern known as \u201cDutch Paint Co.\u201d at San Francisco which operated a small paint factory and which had on hand some labels marked \u201cDutch Paint\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter the apellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>formed a new corporation called \u201cDutch Paint Company\u201d and continued to increase the manufacture and sale of household and other paints using labels and other marks with the names \u201cDutch\u201d and \u201cDutch Paint\u201d. It is of this use that appellant complains in its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The record shows beyond possible controversy that the appellants had a trade mark valid both at common law and under the applicable federal acts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Neither the word \u201cDutch\u201d, nor the words \u201cDutch Boy\u201d are used otherwise than in a fictitious, arbitrary and fanciful manner. Of course the word \u201cDutch\u201d is capable of being used as a geographical term. If used to indicate a product made in Holland or by some Dutch process, it could be a descriptive term. However, the record shows without doubt that appellant\u2019s trade mark does not contain words having either a geographical or descriptive sense. In this respect the case is governed by Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Brothers &amp; Co., 240 U.S. 251, 36 S.Ct. 269, 271, 60 L.Ed. 629, where the court said: \u201cWe do not regard the words \u2018The American Girl,\u2019 adopted and employed by complainant in connection with shoes of its manufacture, as being a geographical or descriptive term. It does not signify that the shoes are manufactured in America, or intended to be sold or used in America, nor does it indicate the quality or characteristics of the shoes. Indeed, it does not, in its primary signification, indicate shoes at all. It is a fanciful designation, arbitrarily selected by complainant\u2019s predecessors to designate shoes of their manufacture. We are convinced that it was subject to appropriation for that purpose, and it abundantly appears to have been appropriated and used by complainant and those under whom it claims. * * * \u2018The American Girl\u2019 would be as descriptive of almost any article of manufacture as of shoes; that is to say, not descriptive at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Here there is no likelihood that the use of the name \u201cDutch\u201d or \u201cDutch Boy\u201d in connection with the appellant\u2019s goods would be understood by purchasers as representing that the goods or their constitutent materials were produced or processed in Holland or that they are of the same distinctive kind or quality as those produced, processed or used in that place.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">The record and briefs do not disclose any assertion on the part of the appellees that appellant\u2019s trade mark was wholly without validity. Appellees however contend that the mark is not a \u201cstrong\u201d but a \u201cweak\u201d mark, citing as their authority for this position this court\u2019s decisions in Sunbeam Furniture Corporation v. Sunbeam Corporation, 9 Cir., 191 F.2d 141, and Sunbeam Lighting Co. v. Sunbeam Corporation, 9 Cir., 183 F.2d 969. We find no resemblance between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>this case and our Sunbeam cases for in those cases it was pointed out that the name Sunbeam was \u201ca meaningful word, a joyful word, a word of comfort, and of health.\u201d It was therefore held that its use was not sufficiently fanciful to warrant the granting of an injunction not merely against the use of the term \u201cSunbeam\u201d on the defendants\u2019 lamps but against the use of the firm name \u201cSunbeam Furniture Corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The fact that' \u201cDutch\u201d as a dictionary term has a geographical significance and that it would be possible for a manufacturer to use that word in connection with his business in its primary geographical sense is beside the point here. Thus one who manufactures paint in Holland cannot be restrained from selling his product as \u201cDutch\u201d paint any more than a watch manufacturer in Switzerland can be prevented from selling his \u201cSwiss\u201d watches. No use of the word \u201cDutch\u201d in a geographical sense is involved here for neither appellant nor appellees are marketing products or goods \u201clikely to be understood by purchasers as representing that the goods or their constituent materials were produced or processed in the place designated by the name or that they are of some distinctive kind or quality as the goods produced, processed or used in that place.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The distinction is well made by the Supreme Court in Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Brothers &amp; Co., supra, where it contrasted with the valid use of \u201cThe American Girl\u201d the supposititious use of a mark \u201cAmerican Shoes\u201d. As the appellees are not making their paints in Holland or using any Dutch processes or giving them any distinctive Dutch quality, the fact that others might have done so is of no significance in this case. There is no question also that \u201cDutch\u201d has certain descriptive meanings. Thus \u201cDutch Kalsomine Brushes\u201d, the record shows, are paint brushes of a special construction; \u201cDutch White\u201d and \u201cDutch Blue\u201d are terms describing certain colors under which some paints are sold although not those of the appellees; \u201cDutch Process\u201d, or \u201cOld Dutch Process\u201d is a means of making white lead used in Holland and some manufacturers of white lead use that process and make reference to it on their labels; \u201cDutch Enamel\u201d is a term descriptive of a kind of enamel first developed in Holland. Neither appellant nor appellees are engaged in the utilization of any such processes and the words \u201cDutch\u201d, \u201cDutch Paint\u201d, or \u201cDutch Paint Company\u201d used by appellees are not claimed to have any relation to any product now or ever made in Holland or any process, color, or other description related to Holland or the Dutch.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">We conclude therefore that the appellant\u2019s trade-mark was one entitled to full protection both under the rules of the common law and under the federal acts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">Under the rules and decisions generally applicable, the appellees\u2019 use of the terms here complained of would constitute an actionable infringement of the appellant\u2019s trade-mark. We note here, in connection with appellees\u2019 competing business, the use of a designation which is \u201cconfusingly similar to the [appellant\u2019s] trade name.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 32 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1114, to the protection of which appellant is entitled, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the infringement is the use, without the registrant\u2019s consent, of \u201cany registered mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers as to the source of origin of such goods or services * *</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">That we have a case here of confusing similarity is very apparent and the facts of the case are not to be distinguished from those in a multitude of decisions finding infringement. Among those cases are Armstrong Paint &amp; Varnish Works v. Nu-Enamel Corporation, 305 U.S. 315, 59 S.Ct. 191, 83 L.Ed. 195; Brooks Bros. v. Brooks Clothing of California, 9 Cir., 158 F.2d 798, adopting opinion D.C., 60 F.Supp. 442; Lane Bryant, Inc. v. Maternity Lane, 9 Cir., 173 F.2d 559. Here there is confusing similarity between the appellant\u2019s trademark and the words used by the appellees in respect to appearance, sound and meaning. The great mass of cases cited by Callman in \u00a7 82.1 of his work on Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks, 2d Ed., in which confusing similarity in sound, appearance or meaning, or in some of these respects, was found to exist, make it clear that in using the words \u201cDutch\u201d, \u201cDutch Paint\u201d, or \u201cDutch Paint Company\u201d in connection with their products, appellees are guilty of infringement of the appellant\u2019s trade mark. The evidence here satisfies the standards of proof set forth in Mershon v. Pachmayr, 9 Cir., 220 F.2d 879: \u201cThere is ample evidence in the case to require the finding that there was material confusion just as the court said there would be, and that there was strong likelihood that there would be confusion, although actual confusion is not essential in the proof of infringing a trade-mark.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">However, the appellant produced a mass of evidence which was uncontradicted showing some 290 instances in which paint dealers, painters, industrial users of paints and retail customers were actually deceived or misled by the appellees\u2019 use of \u201cDutch\u201d, \u201cDutch Paint\u201d, \u201cDutch Paint Company\u201d, and by their advertisements, into believing that appellees\u2019 paints were actually the appellant\u2019s Dutch Boy paints. This evidence of actual confusion showed that it occurred in some 20 communities in California, and in communities in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, and Nevada, and even in Hawaii. Some of these witnesses were experienced painters or construction superintendents; others were individual consumers purchasing for their own use. Testimony was given by some of appellant\u2019s dealers and employees who related many instances of confusion on the part of the consumers visiting the stores. In addition there was substantial testimony that dealers in paints who were accustomed to purchase paint at wholesale, were confused into believing that the appellees\u2019 \u201cDutch Paint\u201d was appellant\u2019s \u201cDutch Boy Paint\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Notwithstanding this extensive proof not only of likelihood of confusion but of actual confusion as well, and notwithstanding the evidence was uncontradicted, the trial court found that there were no purchasers who were confused <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as between defendant\u2019s and plaintiffs\u2019 products and concluded that there was a lack of similarity because the names differed in sound, significance and appearance. We are unable to perceive how the court could have made such a finding in the light of this record. The court\u2019s findings upon this point are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">The record also shows that not only did the appellees beginning in 1946 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>adopt these confusingly similar names but shortly thereafter the method of advertising their paint showed that their continued use of these names and the passing off of their products thereunder was intentionally false and misleading and done with a purpose on their part of deceiving prospective purchasers. Thus appellees advertised \u201cNew Lower Than Pre-War Prices on Dutch Paint\u201d. The facts were, as appellees knew them, that their Dutch paints were not in business before the war and they had no pre-war prices. They also knew that the appellant\u2019s Dutch Boy paint had been sold long prior to the war. They also advertised \u201cHow - Can $2.95 Buy $6 Paint?\u201d, offering their Dutch paint \u201cat approximately 50% of the normal price\u201d. Appellees never sold $6 paints; $2.95 was their normal price, although it was approximately 50% of the normal Dutch Boy price. They advertised \u201cQuality Famous Dutch Paint\u201d which they represented as selling for half price at $2.95.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The proof of this deliberately false and misleading use of advertising in connection with the appellees\u2019 own infringement, has an important bearing upon the inferences to be drawn with respect to the existence of confusion. The rule respecting the consequences of this intent to deceive was stated in My-T-Fine Corporation v. Samuels, 2 Cir., 69 F.2d 76, 77, as follows: \u201cBut when it [intent to deceive] appears, we think that it has an important procedural result; a late comer who deliberately copies the dress of his competitors already in the field, must at least prove that his effort has been futile. Prima facie the court will treat his opinion so disclosed as expert and will not assume that it was erroneous. * * * He may indeed succeed in showing that it was; that, however bad his purpose, it will fail in execution; if he does, he will win. * * * But such an intent raises a presumption that customers will be deceived.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Appellees attempt to meet the appellant\u2019s showing of infringement by setting up defenses of laches, acquiescence and estoppel. The record does not sustain any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The record is that early in 1947, a then partner and associate of the appellees assured the appellant\u2019s manager that they intended to discontinue their use of the name \u201cDutch\u201d as soon as they had exhausted their supply of labels. In March, 1948, there was a discussion between appellant\u2019s advertising manager and the appellees in which the former discussed with appellees the question of the appellees abandoning the use of the word \u201cDutch\u201d. The advertising manager testified that appellees indicated their intention to drop this brand as soon as there was an ample supply of raw materials for other kinds of paints. The appellees\u2019 version of the conversation is that the manager asked them if they had thought of abandoning the use of the word \u201cDutch\u201d and they replied that they could not do so as they were obliged to manufacture Dutch paints because of pigment shortage.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Whichever be the correct version, plainly appellant was endeavoring to canvass the possibility of removing the infringement in 1948. The suit was begun in October, 1949. The attempted proof of laches is too trivial to require serious consideration. In the light of the intentional and fraudulent use of appellant\u2019s trade mark, the defense here is a frivolous one. Menendez v. Holt, 128 U.S. 514, 523, 9 S.Ct. 143, 32 L.Ed. 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">The claim of acquiescence is equally groundless. Thus, it is argued that on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the occasion previously mentioned when the advertising manager of appellant met with the appellees, the manager confined his objections to certain radio advertising on a Sacramento radio station; but that the failure of the advertising manager to make additional objections particularly to the newspaper advertisements which appellees were running, and his failure to make a stronger showing of force against the use of the word \u201cDutch Paint\u201d in connection with appellees\u2019 product, amounted to an acquiescence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The record also shows that some of the appellant\u2019s employees and salesmen during the years 1946-1947-1948 occasionally visited the appellees\u2019 offices and knew that the word \u201cDutch\u201d was displayed on signs and paint cans. There was also produced at the trial a letter written by one Kaegebehn, the manager of appellant\u2019s patent department, to the appellant\u2019s advertising manager. This contained a statement that \u201cDutch\u201d is a geographical name, and as such, it is not registrable as a trademark, but if used exclusively, it may acquire secondary trademark significance. However our mark is Dutch Boy and we can only enforce that mark against others under the trade mark laws.\u201d The writer of the letter was not a lawyer; the letter was an intra-company communication, never addressed to anyone outside the appellant company, and there was no reliance upon it by appellees. Cf. Aunt Jemima Mills Co. v. Rigney &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 247 F. 407.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Appellees began their use of the words here objected to in 1946. In 1947 they gave assurance they would shortly discontinue this use. In March,. 1948, appellant was negotiating with appellees in an effort to procure a promise to discontinue. Formal notice of infringement was given in July, 1949, and the suit begun in October of the same year. Laches, acquiescence, or estoppel are wholly wanting here.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">The appellees attempted to show that a large number of other persons had used the name \u201cDutch\u201d or some combination thereof in connection with sales of paint, and it is contended that the showing made in this respect justifies the trial court\u2019s findings and judgment against the appellant\u2019s claim of a valid trade mark and infringement thereof. The suggestion is that these third party uses of the term \u201cDutch\u201d in the paint industry have been so numerous and so general that the mark must be held to be a weak mark within the meaning of the Sunbeam cases, supra, and further, that the term \u201cDutch\u201d has become <em>publici juris </em>as in the cases of \u201caspirin\u201d and \u201ccellophane\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Appellees have attached to their brief in this court a tabulation which was an exhibit in the court below showing uses which third parties, manufacturers or dealers in paint have made of names which include the word \u201cDutch\u201d. Substantially the same information was portrayed in a photograph which was also an exhibit and which showed in color paint cans to which were attached labels with trade marks using the word \u201cDutch\u201d. A study of the 39 listed uses of the word \u201cDutch\u201d reveals that some of them are duplications, some relate to uses discontinued many years ago, some were used but to a limited extent and in single communities or limited localities far from the Pacific Coast to which appellees\u2019 operations were confined, and for the most part in the eastern portion of the United States,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and some with respect to which there was no proof of any isale whatever; some relate to non-paint products such as floor wax. The remaining proven third party uses of the word \u201cDutch\u201d in connection with paint sale or manufacture<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> are too inconsequential to establish a claim of <em>pub-lid juris </em>or the claim that appellant\u2019s mark has become a weak mark or to justify on any other theory the acts of these appellees. It may be that some of these third persons may also have been guilty of wrongful infringement, but such would not be a defense or justification for the appellees. It is no excuse for them to say that others have been guilty of the same wrong. Del Monte Special Food Co. v. California Packing Corp., 9 Cir., 34 F.2d 774; Potter-Wrightington, Inc., v. Ward Baking Co., 1 Cir., 298 F. 398, affirming D.C., 288 F. 597. Uses of the offending word in local areas in the East are no justification for acts of appellees on the Pacific Coast.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The findings of the trial court fail to note that these third party uses fall into these various categories. The court failed to note that, as earlier here indicated, no one questions the possibility of using the word \u201cDutch\u201d in a geographical or descriptive sense. Some of the third party uses listed in the findings, without noting this distinction, were instances where such proper and unobjectionable uses were made, as in the case of \u201cDutch Kalsomine\u201d, \u201cDutch White\u201d, \u201cOld Dutch\u201d process. Again there was no breakdown of those uses which were local and far distant from the area of appellees\u2019 user. And since the trial court\u2019s findings were based upon the same cold record which is before us, we are \u201cin as good a position as the trial court was to appraise the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We find no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>evidence to warrant a holding that appellant\u2019s trade-mark had become <em>publici juris, </em>or that the word \u201cDutch\u201d, when used as appellees have done, was <em>publici juris. </em>The third party uses as are shown are not such as would permit an inference of acquiescence. We find here no evidence that an originally distinctive mark changed or developed into a generic term.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">There is also a contention that there was an abandonment of the trademark by the appellant. No evidence thereof appears in this regard for there was no evidence of any intent whatever to abandon. Saxlehner v. Eisner &amp; Mendelson Co., 179 U.S. 19, 31, 21 S.Ct. 7, 45 L.Ed. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">What we have said heretofore has in terms referred to the trade-mark infringement. That, however, is but one aspect of the larger field of unfair competition. It requires no extended discussion in view of what we have said to demonstrate that the acts here complained of are not only an infringement of trade-mark but they constitute acts of unfair competition. The law is stated in Weinstock, Lubin &amp; Co. v. Marks, 109 Cal. 529, 541, 42 P. 142, 146, 30 L.R.A. 182: \u201c * * * Upon what principle of law can a court of equity say, \u2018If you cheat and defraud your competitor in business by taking his name, the court will give relief against you, but, if you cheat and defraud him by assuming a disguise of a different character, your acts are beyond the law?\u2019 Equity will not concern itself about the means by which fraud is done. It is the results arising from the means \u2014 it is the fraud itself \u2014 with which it deals. The foregoing principles of law do not apply alone to the protection of parties having trademarks and trade-names. They reach away beyond that, and apply to all cases where fraud is practiced by one in securing the trade of a rival dealer; and these ways are as many and as various as the ingenuity of the dishonest schemer can invent.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">In order to make out a case of unfair competition, it is only required that the natural and necessary consequence of appellees\u2019 conduct in this respect was such as'to cause deception.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The case of Ross-Whitney Corp. v. Smith Kline &amp; French Lab., 9 Cir., 207 F.2d 190, sufficiently demonstrates that wholly apart from trade-mark infringement, the appellant had here made out a case of unfair competition and that the court below had jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">In view of the demonstration in the court below that the appellees\u2019 use of \u201cDutch Paint\u201d and \u201cDutch Paint Company\u201d was by false and misleading advertising, and the consequent demonstration that there was a deliberate and intentional design to cause confusion and mistake and to deceive purchasers, the conclusion must be that whether the cause be viewed as one of unfair competition or as one of infringement of a registered trade-mark, appellant is entitled not merely to relief by injunction but to an accounting of profits and damages as well. \u201cBut where an injunction is had against unfair competition, willfully conducted by the defendant with knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s rights, an accounting normally follows.\u201d Matzger v. Vinikow, 9 Cir., 17 F.2d 581, 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">As for appellant's rights under the trade-mark acts, since this is not a case where there has been \u201cno showing of fraud or palming off\u201d, cf. Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Sanders, 331 U.S. 125, 131, 67 S.Ct. 1136, 1139, 91 L.Ed. 1386, but where the showing is quite to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>contrary and the intentional misleading has been demonstrated, appellant is entitled not merely- to an injunction as prayed for but to an accounting of appellees\u2019 profits and a - recovery of any-damages sustained under the provisions of Title 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a71117, pursuant to the rule of Mishawaka Rubber &amp; Woolen Mfg. Co. v. S. S. Kresge Co., 316 U.S. 203, 62 S.Ct. 1022, 86 L.Ed. 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed- and the cause is remanded with directions to dismiss the appellees\u2019 complaint, to grant to the appellant an injunction as prayed for in its answ\u00e9r and- counter-, claim, and to proceed to take ah accounting of the' appellees\u2019 profits, and to determine appellant\u2019s, damages as.directed in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-11\">. The findings reflect the difficulty of the trial judge in dealing with a record of evidence none of which he had heard from the lips of witnesses. Thus he appears to have overlooked the extensive testimony, uncontradieted, as to the many years of selling and advertising Dutch Boy paints, long prior to the appellees\u2019 commencement of the business, and limited himself on this subject to a finding as follows: \u201cThe earliest national advertisement of the \u2018Dutch Boy\u2019 blue and white label products was in 1947, and the earliest reference to \u2018Dutch Boy\u2019 paints as distinguished from white lead, in defendant\u2019s national advertising, occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>in 1950\u201d. The impression given is that appellant did not begin to advertise its paints, and particularly its mixed ready to use paints, at least on the national scale, until 1947 or even 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"Auj\">The record is quite otherwise. As appears from the deposition of appellant\u2019s advertising manager, since 1913 appellant had been promoting the sale, on a national scale, of ready mixed paint bearing conspicuous labels with its trade mark. In the early 1930\u2019s ready mixed paints called \u201cColors in Oil\u201d were sold throughout the country under the conspicuous Dutch Boy label. Its 1937 trade mark registration was for numerous paints and paint products including \u201cready mixed paints for exterior use\u201d and \u201cready mixed paints for interior use\u201d. Beginning in 1918 what were known as \u201cflatting paints\u201d were sold under the Dutch Boy trade mark; and in the years between 1930 and 1940 similar Dutch Boy labels were applied to white lead paint, lead mixing oil, gloss enamels, varnish, quick drying enamel, enamel undercoat, semi-gloss, flat wall paint, wall primer, one coat flat-wall base and liquid dryer. The record includes numerous photographs of samples of appellant\u2019s paint containers bearing the Dutch Boy label as distributed nation-wide in the years prior to 1940. Some of these were on products such as linseed oil and flatting oil, apparently for u-se of professional painters in mixing paint, but many of them are of mixed ready for use paints designed for sale to the consumers such as \u201cDutch Boy Outside White\u201d, \u201cDutch Boy Satin Egg-Shell\u201d, \u201cDutch Boy Interior White\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"A8f\">Since 1938 appellant produced a full line of more than 30 types of ready mixed paints, each in a variety of colors, and all particularly designed for consumers\u2019 use. All were displayed bearing this label among the stocks of independent dealers nation-wide as well as in the company\u2019s own retail stores. These products were pushed with particular vigor in the area west of the Rocky Mountains. About 1930 appellant took over a concern manufacturing a full line of paints known as Bass-Heuter of San Francisco, and thereafter put out the full line of paint products of that concern using the Dutch Boy label thereon with a smaller insert marked \u201cformerly Bass-Heuter\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"AX9\">During the period following 1914 appellant advertised its trade mark products by distributing for use of painters millions of \u201cwet-paint\u201d signs bearing the Dutch Boy trade mark. From 1928 on it advertised its Dutch Boy products in approximately 200 newspapers throughout the country of which 40 or 50 were on the Pacific Coast. Displayed in the record are exhibits of circulars advertising Dutch Boy painters\u2019 products which were distributed to dealers throughout the country in quantities aggregating hundreds of thousands. During this period the Dutch Boy trade mark was advertised in national magazines such as the Saturday Evening Post and Colliers, and in the farm journals.</p>\n<p id=\"Arh\">The independent dealers in Dutch Boy paint were furnished fluorescent and Neon signs. At least 30,000 of such signs have been distributed since 1915, about 15% of which were installed at the stores selling the products on the Pacific Coast. Mammoth Neon signs bearing the trademark were located for outdoor advertising at places of maximum automobile traffic in New York, Los Angeles, Buffalo, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Chicago, Pittsburg, Cleveland and Cincinnati.</p>\n<p id=\"A6I\">The case was tried in 1950 and the appellant\u2019s advertising manager in testifying produced color advertisements currently appearing that year in national magazines bearing the phrase \u201cDutch Boy Paints\u201d. The unfortunate reference in the quoted finding to the year 1950 is based upon the testimony of appellant\u2019s advertising manager that \u201cthat particular phrase\u201d first appeared in those 1950 advertisements. The result of this wholly unwarranted finding is that it gives an erroneous impression that appellant had only \u201ccome lately\u201d with its trade mark into the mixed paint field.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-11\">. The district court\u2019s findings erroneously recite that this Dutch Paint Co. had been producing \u201cDutch Paint\u201d since 1941. There is no evidence upon the subject other than that \u201cDutch Paint Co.\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>listed in the telephone hook from 1941 on. When it began producing, or when it made its \u201cDutch Paint\u201d labels, does not appear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b247-6\">. Although the record discloses no attack on the registration of appellant\u2019s trade mark, the trial court failed to make any finding thereon, or even to note the fact of registration in the findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\">. See comment on Subdivision (a) of \u00a7 720 Restatement of Law of Torts, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AVy\">\u201cArbitrary or fanciful use. The reasons for the rule that geographical names cannot be trade-marks do not weigh heavily when the geographical name has obviously only an arbitrary or fanciful significance in connection with the goods upon which it is used. Thus Gibraltar may be a trade-mark for automobiles since there is no likelihood that such use of the name would lead purchasers to suppose that there is any particular relation between the automobiles and the geographical locations known by that name, or any likelihood that it would seriously interfere with the freedom of merchants at Gibraltar to use that name. Again, Ethiopian may be a proper trademark for ladies\u2019 stockings; for, while -suggestive of a certain color and sheen, it is only fancifully so and there is no likelihood that other merchants may have occasion properly to use the name Ethiopia on stockings since there is no factor of importance associating stockings with Ethiopia. Such is also the case of Pacific for bread or Arctic for refrigerators.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b248-6\">.

Apparently appellees have abandoned any effort to sustain this finding of no confusion, for speaking of the testimony of appellant\u2019s witnesses on this point, appellees\u2019 brief says that \u201cit is apparent that the presence of the common word \u201cDutch\u201d was the sole cause of their several mistakes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b250-5\">.

This was the occasion previously mentioned on which, according to the testimony of both appellees, appellant\u2019s representative asked them \u201cHave you ever given any thought to abandoning the use of the word \u2018Dutch\u2019?\u201d It was appellant\u2019s version of this conversation that appellees indicated an intention ultimately to drop the Dutch Paint brand and to go into a line of marine paints. Disregarding appellant\u2019s version, it is plain that the parties then discussed the matter of appellees\u2019 giving up the use of the Dutch Paint name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b251-7\">. Appellees learned of this letter only after the action was begun, and through discovery processes. It was not even admissible in evidence. Overlooking this, and the rule of the Aunt Jemima Mills case, the trial court appears to have attached considerable significance to it for its finding 33 reads: \u201cMr. C. F. Kaegebehn, Manager of defendant\u2019s Patent Department, admitted that National Lead Company did not have \u2018proprietary legal exclusive right to the word \u201cDutch\u201d in connection with paint and paint products,\u2019 the while suggesting that a \u2018show of force\u2019 by defendant be used in lieu of such right.\u201d Actually, in the same letter, Kaegebehn was urging the company representative to which it was addressed to advise all persons using the phrase Dutch Paint that the company was prepared to enforce its legal rights \u201cto the utmost\u201d. The letter can have no significance in support of a claim either of acquiescence or of estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b251-12\">. Bayer Co., Inc., v.

As an example of this sort of thing, \u201cDutch Mill\u201d, No. <em>19 </em>on the tabulation mentioned, was a label used on one paint item in an Albany, N. X., store.

These four cases made up the whole of the showing of such third party uses in this area. The Uhl Bros. \u201cOld Dutch\u201d label had been made for ten years prior to 1950, but the Tibbetts \u201cRoyal Dutch\u201d represented a relatively small volume of that concern\u2019s sales; the brand had never been advertised, and one dealer carrying Tibbetts\u2019 paints had never heard of it. The date given for first use of Security Paint\u2019s \u201cRoyal Dutch\u201d was 1944 or 1945.
