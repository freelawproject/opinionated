In accordance with the jury verdict he was sentenced to a term of six months in jail and a fine of $1,000. On appeal, Grites challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction. For the reasons that follow, we reverse that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u201cWhen considering the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal of a criminal conviction, we must view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and accord to the evidence all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. The jury\u2019s verdict will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Traverso </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 172, 176, 366 S.E.2d 719, 721 (1988)(citations omitted). However, in applying this standard of review we cannot disregard credible, unimpeached evidence of the Commonwealth which exculpates the accused and creates a reasonable doubt of his guilt. <em>See Harward </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 468, 479, 364 S.E.2d 511, 516 (1988). Upon these principles we review the evidence which was adduced entirely from the witnesses for the Commonwealth in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">In April 1987, John MacMahon and his father, Dr. MacMahon, desired to purchase a log cabin from Grites. The cabin had been dismantled and the logs were stored on the property of the owner, Leo Bernstein, in Middletown. The parties contemplated that the logs would be removed from their present location by Grites and assembled on Dr. MacMahon\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">The pertinent events leading to the charge against Grites occurred primarily between Friday evening and Monday morning of the weekend beginning on April 24, 1987. On that day, John MacMahon gave Grites a check for $3,000 drawn on a Sovran Bank account by Dr. MacMahon for the purchase of the cabin. MacMahon instructed Grites not to cash this check until the logs for the cabin were delivered to the MacMahon property. Notwithstanding these instructions, Grites attempted to negotiate this check the same day at the Middleburg National Bank. Upon being advised that the bank would not cash this check without the approval of the bank\u2019s senior vice-president, John Palmer, Grites <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>left the bank and contacted Mrs. Anne MacMahon, John\u2019s mother and Dr. MacMahon\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Grites told Mrs. MacMahon that the bank would not cash Dr. MacMahon\u2019s check and asked her to exchange Dr. MacMahon\u2019s check for one of her checks drawn on her Middleburg Bank account. Mrs. MacMahon met Grites at the Middleburg Bank shortly before its closing hour and exchanged the checks. Mrs. MacMahon was aware her son and husband desired to purchase a log cabin from Grites and that her husband had given her son a check payable to Grites for this purpose. When she exchanged the checks she also was aware that \u201c[Grites] needed the cash for the next morning (Saturday), very early the next morning for the laborers to dismantle the cabin and return it, put it on a truck and bring it to our farm. [She] could not find John, nor his father, they both wanted this cabin, so . . ., [she] went up and exchanged checks with Mr. Grites, gave him a Middleburg check and took back Dr. MacMahon\u2019s check.\u201d Mrs. MacMahon\u2019s check in the amount of $3,000 payable to Grites is the check on which the charge against Grites was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">John Palmer was leaving the bank as Mrs. MacMahon exchanged checks with Grites. When Grites saw Palmer, Grites left without cashing the check. Palmer and Mrs. MacMahon discussed this transaction and at that point Mrs. MacMahon became \u201cconcerned.\u201d On the following day, Saturday, the MacMahons decided to rescind the purchase of the cabin and determined that as soon as the Middleburg Bank opened on Monday morning, April 27, they would place a \u201cstop payment order\u201d on Mrs. MacMahon\u2019s check. This was done by Mrs. MacMahon shortly after 9:00 a.m. on April 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Meanwhile, John MacMahon, a carpenter, met with Grites on' Saturday morning to assist Grites and his crew in the demolition of a building near the Winchester airport. This job was not completed at the request of the owner. John MacMahon, Grites and the crew then went to Middletown for the purpose of obtaining the cabin there. Because it was raining and the heavy equipment needed to load the logs would damage the yard, MacMahon and Grites decided to leave these logs until a subsequent day. MacMahon and Grites then proceeded to Fort Valley to load another cabin there. During the process of loading the logs for this cabin, one of the crew was seriously injured and the work was not com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>pleted. During these events John MacMahon reminded Grites not to cash Dr. MacMahon\u2019s check until the Middletown cabin was delivered. Grites did not mention that he had attempted to cash the check the previous evening or that Mrs. MacMahon had exchanged her check for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Later that Saturday afternoon when the totality of these events became known to the MacMahons, they decided to rescind their purchase of the cabin in Middletown. On three occasions over this weekend John MacMahon attempted to contact Grites by telephone to inform him the family no longer desired to purchase the cabin and that payment on the MacMahon\u2019s check was going to be stopped. At this time Grites lived in the home of Janie Alderson. A person named \u201cJim\u201d also lived in this home. John MacMahon was not able to talk with Grites but left messages for Grites with Alderson and Jim to the foregoing effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">On Monday morning, April 27, Grites and Alderson went to the First Virginia Bank in Strasburg (Strasburg Bank) shortly after the bank opened to deposit Mrs. MacMahon\u2019s check into Alderson\u2019s account there. Alderson was the sole signatory on this account. Grites and Alderson asked that Mrs. MacMahon\u2019s check be \u201cprocessed immediately,\u201d and Grites paid for a phone call to the Middleburg Bank \u201cto clear the check.\u201d Upon being advised by the Middleburg Bank that Mrs. MacMahon\u2019s check was good, the Strasburg Bank deposited the $3,000 to Alderson\u2019s account. This transaction was accomplished before the stop payment information had been processed by the Middleburg Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">On Tuesday, April 28, Alderson drew a check on her account payable to the Strasburg Bank in the amount of $2,600. A notation on this check indicated that this check was for \u201clog house, Leo Bernstein, Middletown, paid in full.\u201d In return for this check, the Strasburg Bank issued a cashier\u2019s check in the same amount payable to Leo Bernstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">On May 5, Mrs. MacMahon\u2019s check was returned to the Strasburg Bank with the notation that payment had been stopped by the Middleburg Bank. On May 9, the cashier\u2019s check payable to Leo Bernstein was returned by Alderson to the Strasburg Bank unnegotiated. When the cashier\u2019s check was returned to the Strasburg Bank unnegotiated, the Strasburg Bank was aware that payment had been stopped on the McMahon check. Despite that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>knowledge, the Strasburg Bank gave Alderson a new cashier\u2019s check in the same amount ($2,600) payable to another person. The evidence contains no information concerning the new payee. Neither Grites nor Alderson reimbursed the Strasburg Bank for the original $3,000 and Alderson\u2019s account did not contain sufficient funds from which the Strasburg Bank could recover the $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">On November 25, 1987, the grand jury returned an indictment charging Grites with obtaining money by false pretense from First Virginia Bank \u2014 Shenandoah Valley (Strasburg Bank) in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-178.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-178, in pertinent part, provides: \u201cIf any person obtain, by any false pretense . . . , from any person, with intent to defraud, money . . . , he shall be deemed guilty of larceny thereof.\u201d This statute requires the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt \u201can intent to defraud, an actual fraud, use of false pretenses for the purpose of perpetrating the fraud, and accomplishment of the fraud by means of the false pretenses used for that purpose.\u201d <em>Quidley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 963, 965, 275 S.E.2d 622, 624 (1981). The fraud is accomplished by means of the false pretenses where the false pretenses to some degree induced the owner to part with his property. The false pretense must be a representation as to any existing fact or past event. Merely showing that the accused knowingly stated what was false is not sufficient; there also must be proof that his intent was to defraud and that the fraudulent intent existed at the time the false pretenses were made. The conduct or representation of the accused may be considered to determine whether the intent to defraud existed at the time the act was committed. <em>Riegert </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 511, 518-19, 237 S.E.2d 803, 807-08 (1977). With these general principles in mind, we address Grites\u2019 specific challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Because he was indicted for obtaining money by false pretenses from the Strasburg Bank rather than from one of the MacMahons, Grites first argues that the evidence is not sufficient to support his conviction. He argues essentially that because Mrs. MacMahon\u2019s check was valid and backed by sufficient funds in her account when Grites presented this check to the Strasburg Bank, the bank was not defrauded. In addition, he argues that the Strasburg Bank could have \u201cprotected itself from loss\u201d by assert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>ing its rights as \u201ca holder in due course.\u201d In support of these arguments, Grites calls our attention to the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence that establishes that the Strasburg Bank verified the check with the Middleburg Bank before depositing it to Mrs. Alderson\u2019s account. In addition, Grites points out that when the Strasburg Bank learned that a stop payment had been placed on this check it could have prevented \u201cmost or perhaps all of the loss ... by the simple expedient of charging the Alderson account with the $3,000 on May 5, 1988\u201d rather than issuing a cashier\u2019s check to Alderson. We need not dwell on this unfounded argument. The simple fact established by the evidence is that the Strasburg Bank suffered a loss. In terms of Grites\u2019 criminal culpability under Code \u00a7 18.2-178, whether the Strasburg Bank could have prevented its loss or anyone\u2019s loss is immaterial. This statute does not shield one bent on criminal conduct by the quick response, astute business practices, or fortuitous circumstances of his intended victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Similarly, Grites also argues that even if he employed a false pretense the Commonwealth was limited to establishing that it related to the check drawn on Mrs. MacMahon\u2019s account. In this context he asserts that because Mrs. MacMahon\u2019s check was good when presented to the bank, his implied representation of that fact was true; thus, with regard to the Strasburg Bank, there was no false pretense. This argument also is without merit. \u201cThe victim of a fraudulent scheme need not be the person to whom the false pretense or misrepresentation is made.\u201d <em>Mosteller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 143, 148, 279 S.E.2d 380, 382 (1981). Thus, the Commonwealth correctly asserts that if the evidence establishes that Grites intentionally committed an actual fraud by use of false pretenses and obtained money thereby, the fact that the ultimate victim was not the one against whom the false pretenses were used would be no defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Finally, Grites argues that the evidence is not sufficient to prove that he intended to defraud the Strasburg Bank or the MacMahons. It is clear that Leo Bernstein, not Grites, owned the log cabin in question. In offering to sell the cabin to the MacMahons, a fair inference can be drawn from the evidence that Grites knowingly made a false representation concerning this fact.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">But merely showing that the accused knowingly stated what was false is not sufficient; there must also be proof that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>intent was to defraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">[I]n order to determine whether the intent to defraud existed at the time the act was committed, the conduct and representations of the accused must be examined since intent is \u201ca secret operation of the mind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-7\"><em>Orr v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 298, 301, 329 S.E.2d 30, 32 (1985) (quoting <em>Riegert </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 511, 518-19, 237 S.E.2d 803, 808 (1977)(citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The fact that Grites did not own the log cabin, standing alone, does not establish an intent to defraud. <em>See Fay v. Commonwealth, </em>69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 912 (1877). Under the reasoning of <em>Fay, </em>if a reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence that Grites intended to obtain ownership of the log cabin and ultimately to convey that ownership to the MacMahons, the evidence is not sufficient to establish Grites\u2019 intent to defraud when he presented the check in question to the Strasburg Bank. Accordingly, we review the evidence of the conduct of Grites on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, much of Grites\u2019 conduct is consistent with an intent to defraud. His attempt to negotiate Dr. MacMahon\u2019s check in disregard of specific instructions not to do so before delivering the logs; his arranging to exchange this check for Mrs. MacMahon\u2019s check and then not cashing it when the first opportunity was available at the Middleburg Bank; his insistence that Mrs. MacMahon\u2019s check be processed immediately by the Strasburg Bank soon after it opened on Monday morning even though several messages had been left for him at his residence that the MacMahons no longer desired to purchase the logs; and the fact that he did not deliver the logs or reimburse the Strasburg Bank are all evidence tending to support an inference that \u201cthe secret operation of his mind\u201d was one to defraud and obtain money for logs he did not own.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">In contrast, however, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence also established that Mrs. MacMahon knew that her check would be cashed the \u201cvery next morning\u201d to pay the laborers who were to put the logs on a truck and bring them to her property. In fact, Grites and John MacMahon attempted to do this the very next day but did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>not do so because it was raining and the heavy equipment would damage the owner\u2019s property. There is no direct evidence that Grites was told by Alderson or \u201cJim\u201d prior to Monday morning when Mrs. MacMahon\u2019s check was deposited that the MacMahons no longer desired to purchase the logs or that a stop payment order had been placed on this check. Finally, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established that a cashier\u2019s check was secured from the proceeds of this check payable to Leo Bernstein, the owner of the logs. These facts are consistent with the hypothesis that Grites intended to secure the logs from the proceeds of Mrs. MacMahon\u2019s check and ultimately to deliver them as he had promised.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">In short, the evidence supports the hypothesis that he intended to use the MacMahons\u2019 money to purchase the logs rather than to reimburse himself for the prior purchase of them. Such a scheme, while involving at least by inference false statements of existing facts, is not inconsistent with an intent ultimately to perform his contract with the MacMahons. Such a scheme is not inconsistent with a lack of intent to defraud. Moreover, \u201cwhether a criminal conviction is supported by evidence sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is not a question of fact but one of law. A conviction based upon a mere suspicion of guilt or probability of guilt, however strong, cannot stand.\u201d <em>Bridgeman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 523, 528, 351 S.E.2d 598, 601-02 (1986). Because the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence is consistent with Grites\u2019 innocence in that he lacked an intent to defraud, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence as a matter of law is insufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">For these reasons, the conviction is reversed, the indictment dismissed and final judgment is entered in favor of Grites.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Benton, J., and Duff, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
