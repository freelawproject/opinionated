Courtesy contends the decision should be reversed because: (1) the commissioner failed to apply the evidentiary standard required by Code \u00a7 46.1-547(d);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) the commissioner\u2019s decision was arbitrary and inconsistent with a prior decision; and (3) the commissioner\u2019s decision was not based upon substantial evidence. We disagree and affirm the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">Courtesy is a Ford dealership in Buena Vista, Virginia. A Ford dealership has been in continuous existence in Buena Vista since 1921. From 1945 to 1981, another Ford dealership also operated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>in Lexington, which is approximately six miles from Buena Vista and part of the same market area.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In February 1989, Ford decided to grant a franchise for a new dealership in Lexington. Courtesy was offered the new dealership but did not accept. When Ford gave Courtesy written notice that it planned to grant the franchise to a third party, Courtesy objected on the ground that the market area would not support two dealerships.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.1-547(d), a hearing officer appointed by a Commissioner of the Division of Motor Vehicles held a hearing on Courtesy\u2019s objection. Courtesy presented expert testimony indicating that the new automobile market in the Buena Vista-Lexington area was shrinking because of high unemployment, declining population in Lexington and a median family income below the state average. The expert testified that the addition of a second dealership to the market area would substantially reduce Courtesy\u2019s profitability.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Ford\u2019s evidence showed that the company\u2019s penetration of the new car market in the Buena Vista-Lexington area had been declining since 1977 and dropped sharply in 1982 and 1983 after the closing of the Lexington dealership. Though new car registrations increased by twenty and 18.4 percent in Lexington and Buena Vista, respectively, during 1983, Courtesy\u2019s new car sales decreased by 15.6 percent during the same year. Courtesy\u2019s new truck sales in 1983 increased by 47.1 percent, while new truck sales in Lexington and Buena Vista increased by 20.3 percent and 77.1 percent respectively. Courtesy\u2019s advertising expenditures have decreased steadily since 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The hearing officer reported that the evidence was \u201cinsufficient to find that the market will not support all of the dealerships.\u201d Copies of the hearing officer\u2019s recommended decision, findings of fact, conclusions of law and \u201cstatement of reasons\u201d submitted by counsel for each side were sent to the six members of the Motor Vehicle Dealers\u2019 Advisory Board for their review pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.1-550.1(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Each of the five board members who re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>sponded concurred in the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation. After consideration of the evidence produced at the hearing, the briefs and the board members\u2019 recommendations, the commissioner authorized Ford to grant the Lexington franchise. The Circuit Court of the City of Buena Vista affirmed his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We reversed on the ground that the appointment of one member of the Motor Vehicle Dealers\u2019 Advisory Board violated Code \u00a7 46.1-550.2(b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and therefore the commissioner had failed to obtain the recommendations of a lawfully constituted board. The Supreme Court overruled our decision, finding that the disqualification of one board member constituted harmless error. <em>See Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Courtesy Motors, </em>237 Va. 187, 375 S.E.2d 362 (1989). The case now returns to us for consideration of Courtesy\u2019s remaining assignments of error, which we did not previously address.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Courtesy first contends that the commissioner\u2019s decision was unlawful because he failed to apply the proper evidentiary standard. Code \u00a7 46.1-547(d) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">[N]o such additional franchise may be established in the trade area unless the Commissioner has determined . . . that there is <em>reasonable evidence </em>that after the grant of the new franchise, the market will support all of the dealerships in that line-make in the trade area, (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">In the second paragraph of the hearing decision, the commissioner states: \u201cI have further decided . . . that Petitioner has failed to show reasonable evidence that after the grant of a new franchise in Lexington, Virginia, the market will not support both of the dealerships in that line-make in the trade area.\u201d The commissioner went on to incorporate most of the hearing officer\u2019s report, including a statement under the heading \u201cConclusions of Law\u201d that \u201c[t]he evidence presented by Courtesy Motors is insufficient to establish that after the grant of the new franchise, the market will not support all of the dealerships in that line-make in the trade area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Courtesy argues that, despite the commissioner\u2019s reference to the \u201creasonable evidence\u201d standard in paragraph two of his decision, his reliance upon the hearing officer\u2019s report indicates that a sufficiency of the evidence standard was actually used to decide the case. We disagree. The hearing officer\u2019s findings and conclusion were recommendations. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:12. The commissioner stated in his opinion that he had considered the evidence produced at the hearing, the briefs and the recommendations of the Motor Vehicle Dealers\u2019 Advisory Board members in determining that Courtesy \u201cfailed to show reasonable evidence\u201d that the market would not support two dealerships. While the hearing officer failed to articulate the \u201creasonable evidence\u201d standard, we are satisfied that the commissioner applied that standard in reaching his decision. His incorporation of the hearing officer\u2019s reference to insufficient evidence, while confusing, does not refute the other evidence in the opinion showing that he was fully aware of Courtesy\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Next, Courtesy asserts that the commissioner\u2019s decision was arbitrary because it was inconsistent with a former commissioner\u2019s decision in <em>P. D. Waugh &amp; Co. v. American Motor Sales Corp., </em>a 1976 case. At the outset, we note that in its ordinarily accepted meaning, the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>is inapplicable when applied to the decisions of an administrative agency. \u201cAn agency may refuse to follow its own precedent, but it must not act arbitrarily in doing so.\u201d C. Koch, <em>Administrative Law &amp; Practice </em>\u00a7 6.57 (1985). Thus, the issue before us is not whether this case is or is not consistent with prior decisions of the commission or strictly speaking, distinguishable from earlier cases, but whether it is a departure and indistinguishable from decisions of the commission, and, if so, whether the commissioner acted arbitrarily in disregarding the precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In <em>P. D. Waugh, </em>the commissioner prohibited American Motors from granting a second Jeep franchise in Orange, Virginia, on the ground that the market area would not support two dealerships. Courtesy contends that the facts in the present case are so similar to those in <em>P. D. Waugh </em>that the commissioner was bound to reach a similar decision. The record before us contains only a copy of the two page decision issued by the commissioner in <em>P. D. Waugh </em>and the published opinion in a federal court case which resulted from the administrative adjudication. <em>See American Mo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>tors Sales Corp. v. Division of Motor Vehicles, </em>592 F.2d 219 (4th Cir. 1979). Without the complete record of <em>P. D. Waugh, </em>we have insufficient information upon which to conclude that the case is, in fact, indistinguishable. <em>See Walters </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 262, 266, 379 S.E.2d 749, 751 (1989). \u201cThere is no record here of what facts or issues were presented and decided by the court in the former case. They may have been different from those appearing here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Home Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>181 Va. 793, 799, 27 S.E.2d 188, 191 (1943)).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Judging from the limited evidence available to us, however, the two cases differ in many ways. <em>P. D. Waugh </em>was decided in 1976, under economic conditions which differed greatly from those in existence at the time of these proceedings. Each case involved a different market area, with distinct problems and needs. Unemployment in Orange had risen sharply at the time <em>P. D. Waugh </em>was heard, but the previously high unemployment in Buena Vista/ Lexington had declined when Courtesy objected to a new dealership. While the existing dealerships in the two cases may have been comparable in some ways, their business practices were not identical. For example, the dealer in <em>P. D. Waugh </em>advertised extensively, while Courtesy Motors sponsored only one weekly advertisement in a local newspaper. Based upon this record, we cannot conclude that the commission arbitrarily refused to follow its own precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Courtesy\u2019s final argument is that the commissioner\u2019s decision was not based on substantial evidence. Code \u00a7 46.1-541 provided the standard of review for decisions under the Motor Vehicle Dealers\u2019 Licensing Act (the Act) at the time Courtesy\u2019s case was heard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">[T]he court shall affirm the adjudication unless it shall find that the same is in violation of the constitutional rights of the appellant, or is not in accordance with law, or that any finding of fact made by the Commissioner and necessary to support his adjudication is not supported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Similarly, Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17 states that on review,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">the duty of the court with respect to issues of fact is limited to ascertaining whether there was substantial evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>agency record upon which the agency as the trier of the facts could reasonably find them to be as it did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u201cThe phrase \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 refers to \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind <em>might </em>accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia Real Estate Comm\u2019n </em>v. Bias, 226 Va. 264, 269, 308 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1983)(quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)). \u201c[T]he court may reject the agency\u2019s finding of fact \u2018only if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would <em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bias, </em>226 Va. at 269, 308 S.E.2d at 125 (quoting B. Mezines, <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 51.01 (1981))(emphasis in original). This standard is designed \u201cto give great stability and finality to the fact-findings of an administrative agency.\u201d <em>Bias, </em>226 Va. at 269, 308 S.E.2d at 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Courtesy maintains that the commissioner\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence because he relied in large part upon irrelevant evidence of Courtesy\u2019s sales performance in comparison with the potential for Ford sales in the market area.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We do not agree that this evidence was irrelevant. The issue posed by Code \u00a7 46.1-547(d) is whether the market area will support two Ford dealerships. Evidence that Courtesy has not fully penetrated the potential Ford market in the area is relevant to the question whether there was enough business to support two dealerships.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Courtesy also argues that much of the evidence produced by Ford was patently incredible, but we find nothing in the record to support this claim. The lone example Courtesy offers is Ford\u2019s projection that in 1984 Courtesy and the proposed new dealership could sell a combined total of 125 new Fords, a figure which Courtesy labels incredible because only eighty-three new Fords were registered in the market area in 1983. We do not find the projection unreasonable in light of other evidence showing that overall automobile sales for the trade area and the nation increased sharply during the first quarter of 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Our review of the record reveals substantial relevant and credible evidence in support of the commissioner\u2019s conclusion. For this and other reasons stated in this opinion, the decision of the commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Koontz, C.J., and Keenan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-14\"> This statute is now Code \u00a7 46.1-550.5:27(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b128-9\"> The commissioner\u2019s finding that Buena Vista and Lexington were in the same market area is not appealed by Courtesy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b128-10\"> Now Code \u00a7 46.1-550.5:32(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b129-9\"> This code section is now Code \u00a7 46.1-517.1; however, the clause requiring that no two board members be dealers of the same manufacturer has been eliminated by amendment. This clause was the basis of our decision that the board was not lawfully constituted since two Ford dealers were members.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b132-9\"> Courtesy claims that Ford\u2019s presentation of evidence demonstrating Courtesy\u2019s poor sales performance shows that Ford hopes to drive the dealership out of business by granting a second franchise. While Ford\u2019s hopes are not relevant to the issue at hand, we feel we must point out that Ford\u2019s first offer of the new dealership was to Courtesy itself. Only when Courtesy showed indifference did Ford offer the dealership to someone else.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
