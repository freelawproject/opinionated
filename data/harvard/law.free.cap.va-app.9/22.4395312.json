Rash\u2019s appeal presents an issue of first impression in Virginia: whether an unoccupied but furnished dwelling constitutes a \u201cdwelling house\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-89 when its last occupant has left with no intent to return and its owners plan to sell it. We conclude that it does not, and therefore find the evidence insufficient to support Rash\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Rash was indicted for burglary of \u201cthe dwelling house of John Powell, 512 Spencer Street.\u201d The evidence at trial, however, showed that the house was owned by both Powell and his sister, Margaret Sturgiss, neither of whom had ever lived there. Powell and Mrs. Sturgiss inherited the house and its furnishings from their sister, Virginia Musselwhite, who lived there until her death in January, 1986. Powell\u2019s nephew, James Sturgiss, lived in the house from the time of Mrs. Musselwhite\u2019s death until November, 1986. The house was unoccupied thereafter until the break-in, which occurred on June 1, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Powell testified that at the time of the break-in, he and Mrs. Sturgiss were preparing to put the house up for auction. It remained fully furnished, and Powell, who lived nearby, stated that he checked on it periodically and kept the grass mowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Rash moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on the ground that the house at 512 Spencer Street was not a \u201cdwelling house\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-89. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that \u201cthe term dwelling house is describing the nature or intended purpose of the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-89 describes an offense identical to common law burglary, save that the element of intent is expanded to include intent to commit a larceny.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute does not define <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>dwelling house, though Code \u00a7 18.2-78 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">No outhouse, not adjoining a dwelling house, nor under the same roof, although within the curtilage thereof, shall be deemed a part of such dwelling house, within the meaning of this chapter, <em>unless some person usually lodge therein at night.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-78 (emphasis added). Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-89 and 18.2-78 are within the same chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">In 1949, our Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">Burglary was, at common law, primarily an offense against the security of the habitation, and that is still the general conception of it. A difference is recognized between the crime of wrongfully entering in the night a house where people live and the crime of entering a house where chickens roost.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-9\"><em>Compton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>190 Va. 48, 55, 55 S.E.2d 446, 449 (1949). The theoretical basis of common law burglary was the ancient notion that a man\u2019s home was his castle and that he had the right to feel safe therein. This was especially true at night, when he was most vulnerable because he was asleep. 3 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 326 (1972); 13 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Burglary </em>\u00a7 2 (1969). Thus, at common law, \u201cdwelling house\u201d was interpreted to mean any structure which human beings regularly used for sleeping. 3 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, supra, </em>\u00a7 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">The theory behind common law burglary remains viable in terms of modern burglary statutes. California\u2019s Fifth District Court of Appeals has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-11\">Burglary laws are based primarily upon a recognition of the dangers to personal safety created by the usual burglary situation \u2014 the danger that the intruder will harm the occupants in attempting to perpetrate the intended crime or to escape and the danger that the occupants will in anger or panic react violently to the invasion, thereby inviting more violence. The laws are primarily designed, not to deter the trespass and the intended crime, which are prohibited by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>other laws, so much as to forestall the germination of a situation dangerous to personal safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Statler, </em>174 Cal. App. 46, 54, 219 Cal. Rptr. 713, 718 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">In construing Code \u00a7 18.2-89, we are mindful of the following principles of statutory construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">First and foremost among these principles is that the primary objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent. A related principle is that the plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction. Finally, because the statute in question is penal in nature, it must be strictly construed against the state and limited in application to cases falling clearly within the language of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-8\"><em>Turner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 456, 459, 309 S.E.2d 337, 338 (1983)(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">We conclude that in enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-89, the legislature intended to preserve the crime of common law burglary as an offense against habitation. Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-90 and 18.2-91 define other kinds of breaking and entering crimes, including those committed against buildings other than dwelling houses. The focus of Code \u00a7 18.2-89 remains the protection of people in their homes at night. Accordingly, we find that the term \u201cdwelling house\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-89 means a place which human beings regularly use for sleeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">Many states which use similar definitions of \u201cdwelling house\u201d for purposes of burglary statutes have considered the effect of an occupant\u2019s temporary absence on the character of the house. Most conclude that the house remains a dwelling house so long as the occupant intends to return. The Florida First District Court of Appeal said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-11\">The house must be occupied as a dwelling house, and not merely be suitable or intended for such purpose. The owner or occupant or some member of his family must sleep there. If it is so occupied the temporary absence of the occupant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>will not prevent it from being the subject of burglary as a dwelling house; but a house, although furnished as a dwelling house, loses its character as such for the purpose of burglary, if the occupant leaves it without intention to return.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-5\"><em>Tukes </em>v. <em>State, </em>346 So. 2d 1056, 1057 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1977); <em>see also Wallace </em>v. <em>State, </em>63 Md. App. 399, 406, 492 A.2d 970, 974 (1985)(apartment is not \u201cdwelling house\u201d because tenants had left with no intent to return); <em>Gillum </em>v. <em>State, </em>468 So. 2d 856, 859 (Miss. 1985)(intention of dweller is material consideration); <em>People </em>v. <em>Sheirod, </em>124 A.D.2d 14, 17, 510 N.Y.S.2d 945, 948 (1987)(whether the absence is temporary is determined by nature of structure, the intent of owner to return, and the conditions of structure); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferebee, </em>273 S.C. 403, _, 257 S.E.2d 154, 155 (1979)(no intent to return where former tenant abandoned partially furnished structure); <em>State v. Berry, </em>598 S.W.2d 828, 830 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1980)(intent to return is key). We find the reasoning in these cases persuasive, and therefore hold that a dwelling is no longer a \u201cdwelling house\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-89 when its occupants leave it without any intention to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The house at 512 Spencer Street was a dwelling house during the years Mrs. Musselwhite lived there and, after her death, during the months that Sturgiss was the occupant. But Sturgiss left the house, and there is no evidence in the record that he intended to return or that the owners of the house, Powell and Mrs. Sturgiss, intended to live there. In fact, they were preparing to sell the house. Under other circumstances, the fact that the house remained fully furnished might be relevant as evidence that the absent occupant intended to return. In this case, however, such an inference is negated by the testimony of the owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">We hold that the house was not a dwelling house within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-89, and the evidence is therefore insufficient to support Rash\u2019s conviction under that statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The conviction is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">Koontz, C.J., and Keenan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-9\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-89 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-10\">If any person break and enter the dwelling house of another in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony or any larceny therein, he shall be guilty of burglary, punishable as a Class 3 felony; provided, however, that if such person was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of such entry, he shall be guilty of a Class 2 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">At common law, burglary was defined as \u201cthe breaking and entering of the dwelling house of another in the nighttime with the intent to commit a felony.\u201d 3 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 326 (14th ed. 1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b51-11\"> We express no opinion whether the Commonwealth may now prosecute the appellant under Code \u00a7 18.2-91.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
