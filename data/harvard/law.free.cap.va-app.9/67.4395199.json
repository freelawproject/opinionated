Two issues are presented on appeal: (1) whether the trial court erred by overruling Lambert\u2019s objection to evidence used to impeach his witness, Linda Parks; and (2) whether the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction. Upon our consideration of the record, the briefs filed and arguments presented, we find no reversible error and affirm Lambert\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. The judgment of a trial court sitting without a jury is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). When so viewed, the evidence showed the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">On Thanksgiving morning, November 28, 1985, Karen Hamlette went to a Manassas, Virginia laundromat where she encountered Lambert, against whom she had initiated successful prosecutions for trespassing, assault and battery, and destruction of property, stemming from their stormy relationship over the previous two years. Lambert told Hamlette that he was coming to her house for dinner later that day. Having planned dinner for her twelve year old son and several friends, Hamlette advised him that she did not want him to come.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Lambert, nevertheless, arrived at Hamlette\u2019s home around 1 p.m. that afternoon, entered the house and sat down. He refused to leave when requested to do so. Hamlette did not call the police, as she \u201cjust wanted peace and quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Hamlette\u2019s invited guests were Jimmy Humes, Luther Washington and Linda Parks. After dinner, Humes and Washington walked to the latter\u2019s house to watch a football game. Lambert, who had been drinking heavily, remained and became very belligerent and abusive. At Hamlette\u2019s request, Linda Parks went to Washington\u2019s house to tell Jimmy Humes to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Upon his return, Humes found the defendant arguing and cursing at Hamlette. According to Humes, the defendant, \u201ctold her that he would kill her and he would burn the MF house down.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>He also said, \u201cyou have got a MF witness thereto prove it,\u201d pointing to Humes. According to Hamlette, the defendant also said he would return \u201cin the middle of the night,\u201d apply gasoline and burn her house down. When Lambert prevented Hamlette\u2019s son, Joseph, from leaving, Joseph climbed out a window and summoned the police, who responded and arrested the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">At trial, Lambert called Linda Parks as a witness on his behalf. Her testimony was in conflict in various respects with that given by the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses. On cross-examination the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney asked her if she had not at one time sworn out a warrant for the arrest of Luther Washington for an assault that had never occurred. Parks admitted that she had done so and that she had \u201cturned herself in\u201d to the magistrate. She testified that she was told that she could be charged with perjury, but that no charges were ever brought against her. Lambert\u2019s objection to this testimony was overruled, the court holding that it was proper impeachment of the witness\u2019 credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">This ruling presents for our review the first issue on appeal. Lambert contends that the law permits an attack on a witness\u2019 credibility only by proof of bad reputation in the community for truthfulness or by proof of appropriate prior criminal convictions. In short, he argues that unadjudicated perjury, even when admitted by the witness, is not a proper method of impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The Commonwealth concedes that the general rule prohibits impeachment of a witness\u2019 character by showing specific acts of untruthfulness. <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 787, 120 S.E.2d 270 (1961); <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 1126, 86 S.E.2d 828 (1955). It argues, however, that the rule is not without logical exceptions and cites <em>Clinebell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>235 Va. 319, 368 S.E.2d 263 (1988) where the Supreme Court observed that \u201cthe weight of authority recognizes more liberal rules concerning impeachment of complaining witnesses\u201d in cases involving sex offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 324, 368 S.E.2d at 265. <em>Clinebell </em>held not only that a complaining witness may be cross-examined about prior false accusations, but also that if the witness denies making the accusations, the defendant may submit proof thereof. <em>Id. </em>The Commonwealth urges that we adopt a similar exception for the impeachment of witnesses for proof of their unadjudicated, but admitted, prior perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Perjury constitutes uniquely probative evidence in the rules governing impeachment of witnesses. When questioning a criminal defendant about prior felony convictions, perjury is the only offense that may be named. This is because of its crucial probative value upon the issue of credibility. <em>Sadoski </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1069, 254 S.E.2d 100 (1979); <em>Harmon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 442, 185 S.E.2d 48 (1971). \u201c[I]f a prior conviction is for perjury, that offense may always be named.\u201d <em>McAmis v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 419, 422, 304 S.E.2d 2, 4 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The reason underlying the general rule prohibiting evidence of specific acts of untruthfulness \u201cis that the admission of evidence of specific acts, and the rebuttal evidence which would follow, injects collateral issues into the case which would divert the jury\u2019s attention from the real issue, the guilt or innocence of the accused.\u201d <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 355, 356-57, 218 S.E.2d 445, 446 (1975). The general rule prevents cross-examination as to collateral facts designed to lay a foundation to contradict the witness later by means of extrinsic evidence. <em>Clark, </em>202 Va. at 789, 120 S.E.2d at 272. In the record before us, however, the evidence of the prior untruthful act by the witness came from the witness herself, whose testimony on that point was considered by the court to be binding on the prosecution. As there was obviously a valid, factual basis for the cross-examination, there is no question concerning the \u201cgood faith and fair dealings\u201d on the part of the prosecution. <em>See Weimer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 47, 53, 360 S.E.2d 381, 384 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We believe, and so hold, that a narrowly limited exception to the general rule is warranted by the facts of this case. Such exception would provide the fact finder with highly probative evidence regarding the witness\u2019s credibility and at the same time would advance the policy concern of fairness. We hold that a witness\u2019s credibility may be attacked on cross-examination by inquiry into prior specific instances of unadjudicated acts of perjury. We further hold, however, that extrinsic proof of the perjury may not be adduced. This view finds support in E. Cleary, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>340 (3d ed. 1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">At present. . . it can be said generally that the majority of courts limit cross examination concerning acts of misconduct as an attack upon character to acts which have some relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>to the credibility of the witness. This is the view adopted by Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">In jurisdictions which permit character impeachment by proof of misconduct for which no conviction has been had, an important curb is the accepted rule that proof is limited to what can be brought out on cross-examination. Thus, if the witness stands his ground and denies the alleged misconduct, the examiner must \u201ctake his answer,\u201d not that he may not further cross-examine to extract an admission, but in the sense that he may not call other witnesses to prove the discrediting acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">For these reasons, we find that the trial court correctly allowed the Commonwealth to inquire on cross-examination regarding Parks\u2019 prior unadjudicated perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Turning to the second issue presented, Lambert asserts that the statute requires the Commonwealth to prove that he was fifteen years of age or older before he can be convicted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-83, under which the accused was indicted, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">Any person (a) who makes and communicates to another by any means any threat to bomb, burn, destroy or in any manner damage any place of assembly, building or other structure . . . shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony; provided, however, that if such person be under fifteen years of age, he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">We note that the language of this statute is in stark contrast to that employed where the defendant\u2019s age is an essential element of the offense itself. For example, Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-370, 18.2-370.1 and 18.2-371 each begin with the phrase, \u201cAny person eighteen years of age or older. . . .\u201d These statutes clearly make proof of the defendant\u2019s age an element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">If the intent of the General Assembly was to make the defendant\u2019s age an essential element of the offense defined in Code \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>18.2-83, we believe it would have employed the same language used elsewhere in the Code when such a result was intended. The purpose of the age provision in Code \u00a7 18.2-83 is to provide for mitigation of punishment when a defendant is of tender years.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Furthermore, in the recent decision of <em>Jewell v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 353, 382 S.E.2d 259 (1989), while reversed on other grounds, we held that a defendant\u2019s physical appearance was sufficient evidence that he was over eighteen years of age. In the case at bar the trial judge specifically noted that from appearance it was \u201cobvious that the was in excess of fifteen years of age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">For these reasons, the conviction appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Barrow, J., and Keenan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
