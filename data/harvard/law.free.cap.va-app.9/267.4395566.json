Chambliss contends that the Commonwealth exercised its four peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner when it struck four potential jurors of his race from the jury that convicted him. We conclude that the record does not support Chambliss\u2019 claim of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Chambliss was charged with possession of cocaine, possession of a firearm while possessing cocaine, and possession of drug paraphernalia. During jury selection, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney exercised four peremptory strikes to exclude prospective jurors Gregg, Townsend, Jones, and Phillips, all black males. In response to defense counsel\u2019s objection that the Commonwealth exercised its peremptory strikes in violation of <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79 (1986), the trial judge requested an explanation for the strikes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney indicated that he removed Gregg and Townsend because of their criminal records. The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">Mr. Troy Jones and Mr. Eric Phillips are what appeared to me the youngest individuals on the jury panel, although they are, in fact, black males. My experience has been that the majority of cases I prosecute in the drug area include young individuals, people who because of either school or people they hang around with \u2014 young people, in my opinion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>my experience, are more involved than older people. Although I realized when I struck those two individuals that they were, in fact, black, that was not my reasoning behind it. I\u2019m concerned with young people in today\u2019s society being more permissive with the drug use than an older person would be. Apparently there\u2019s a trend, at least one I\u2019ve made, that it\u2019s more common nowadays to have drugs used among younger individuals, and that\u2019s the reason I struck those. Everyone appeared, physically, looking older than the two individuals who were left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">I would also note for the record that Mr. Troy Jones was wearing what appeared to me to be some sort of sweat suit. I didn\u2019t think personally that was very appropriate attire for the court. It really doesn\u2019t, in my opinion, suggest a respectfully serving juror. That also was an additional concern on my behalf, Judge. That\u2019s why I struck Mr. Troy Jones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In response, defense counsel stated, \u201cI did not notice a sweat suit . . . he was wearing appropriate clothing for the weather and the occasion.\u201d That challenge to the Commonwealth\u2019s statement was not rebutted. Defense counsel, however, did not challenge the comments concerning the ages of Jones and Phillips.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">The trial judge denied defense counsel\u2019s motion, stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">I find no fault with Mr. McNally\u2019s reasoning for the strikes that he took, particularly in view of the makeup of the remaining panel. So I deny your motion in regard to there being anything improper with the strikes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The record reflects, and Chambliss does not dispute, that Gregg and Townsend were removed from the panel because of their criminal records. Chambliss directs our inquiry to the reasons stated for striking Jones and Phillips. He contends that \u201cthe prosecutor assumed a group bias and assumed it applied to Jones and Phillips without a shred of fact in the record to support either assumption.\u201d We conclude, however, that the Commonwealth provided racially neutral reasons for the strikes. <em>See </em>Batson, 476 U.S. at 98. The record contains no challenge concerning the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that Jones and Phillips were the youngest members of the jury panel. In addition, the record affirmatively reflects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>that Phillips was eighteen years of age and Jones was twenty-one years of age. Moreover, the Commonwealth\u2019s explanation bore a relationship to the particular case being tried. <em>See Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 176, 185, 380 S.E.2d 1, 6, <em>aff d en banc, 9 </em>Ya. App. 169, 384 S.E.2d 343 (1989). There has been no showing on this record that the explanation was related to racial considerations or was pretextual. <em>Id. </em>at 184, 380 S.E.2d at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Because the trial judge based his ruling upon both the reasons advanced by the Commonwealth and \u201cthe makeup of the remaining panel,\u201d we take this opportunity to reiterate a pertinent statement in <em>Jackson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">Nothing in <em>Batson </em>mandates, however, the \u201ccomplete exclusion of a racial group in order to prove discrimination.\u201d To the contrary, under <em>Batson, </em>the trial judge is required to consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to (1) a pattern of strikes against persons of the cognizable racial group included in the particular venire, which might give rise to an inference of discrimination, and (2) the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s questions and statements during voir dire examination and in exercising his challenges. Establishing some magic number or percentage to trigger a <em>Batson </em>inquiry would short circuit the case-by-case determination whether the \u201cfacts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference\u201d of discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">Just as the mere exclusion of one or more blacks from the jury does not always give rise to an equal protection violation, so too, the mere inclusion of blacks on a jury does not automatically preclude a finding of a <em>prima facie </em>case, especially where other facts and circumstances give rise to an inference of prosecutorial discrimination. \u201c \u2018A single invidiously discriminatory governmental act\u2019 is not \u2018immunized by the absence of such discrimination in the making of other comparable decisions.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">8 Va. App. at 183, 380 S.E.2d at 4-5 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">On this record, we conclude that the Commonwealth provided racially neutral reasons for the strikes, sufficient to rebut any pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>sumption that the strikes were motivated by racial considerations. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Cole, J., and Duff, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-12\"> We assume, for purposes of this opinion, that the trial judge found that a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination had been established.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
