B., in the said condition of the said writing obligatory mentioned, was and during the said time continued to be retained and employed by the said Morris Canal and Banking Company, as mentioned and contemplated in the said writing obligatory, as the cashier in the management and conduct of their banking and other financial <em>operations; </em>and that, during the said time the said A. B. was so retained and employed, at divers days and times, to wit, at Jersey City aforesaid, the said A.

B. aforesaid, to wit, on the first of September, 1836, at Jersey City aforesaid, applied to his own use, and never accounted for or paid the same, or any part thereof, to the said Morris Canal and Banking Company, but to do so made default, to wit, at Jersey City aforesaid. And the said A.

Nor what portion of the sum of $33,537, in the said replication mentioned, consisted of money and what portion of valuable securities. And also, that the said plaintiff has not in the said replication set forth and specified of what the securities, which in the said replication are called valuable securities, were composed ; or whether they, or any of them, were securities for the payment of money or the delivery of property, or what else; and if for the payment of money, whether they were notes, bills, bonds, certificates of stock, or other securities. And also, that the said plaintiff has not set forth in the said replication to whom the said securities, or any of them, belonged ; or to whom or by whom made or given, or in any manner or way described the same, so as to give this defendant an opportunity of answering the said breach and of showing that the said A. B. did not apply the same to his own use, and that the said plaintiff has not been damnified, as in the said replication is alleged; And also, that the said plaintiff has not in any way set forth in what way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>or manner the company became and was damnified by any malfeasance, wilful omission, neglect, and wrongful acts of the said A. B. in the said premises. And also, that the said plaintiff, in the said replication, has not alleged that the said plaintiff ever gave notice of the said misapplication, malfeasance, wilful omission, neglect, and wrongful acts of the said J. V. V., \u25a0 in his lifetime, or to this defendant, after his death, aud requested payment of the said last mentioned sum of money, or any part thereof.

B., in the said plea mentioned, was retained and employed by the plaintiff in its service as its cashier, and as such cashier during the time aforesaid, and there had the custody and charge of very large amounts of money and securities for money of the plaintiff, being then and there, by the plaintiff, confidentially intrusted therewith, as such cashier as aforesaid ; and the plaintiff avers that after the death of the said J. \"V. V., to wit, on the day and year last aforesaid, the said A. B. was by the plaintiff found to be, and then and there was a defaulter in his said office as cashier to a large amount, exceeding the sum of $100,000, to wit, to the sum of $121,-229.47, he, the said A. B., having during the time aforesaid, while acting in the capacity of the plaintiff\u2019s cashier as aforesaid, abstracted and converted to his own use divers large sums of money and securities for money of the plaintiff, so intrusted with him as its cashier as aforesaid, exceeding in the whole the said smn of $100,000, to wit, amounting to the said sum of $121,229.47, to wit., at Jersey City aforesaid; whereupon the said A. B., on the day and year last aforesaid, at Jersey City aforesaid, ceased to he retained and employed by the plaintiff in its service aforesaid. And the plaintiff avers that afterwards, to wit, on the 26th day of January, 1837, at Jersey City aforesaid, upon an investigation then and ihere had, a committee of the board of directors of the plaintiff into the accounts and transactions of the said A. B., as such cashier as aforesaid, and upon an accounting and settlement then and there had by and between him, the said A. B., as such cashier as aforesaid, and the plaintiff, the said defalcation of the said A. B., as such cashier as aforesaid, was found to be, and by the said settlement was then and there liquidated, settled, and stated at $121,229.47.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-5\">And the plaintiff avers, that afterwards, to wit, on the day and year last aforesaid, at Jersey City aforesaid, in partial reparation and satisfaction of such defalcation of the said A. B., he, the said A. B., paid to the plaintiff the sum of $3000, and gave up and conveyed to the said company certain lands and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>real estate situate in this state, of the value, as then and there settled and estimated, by and between the said A. B. and the plaintiff, of $80,000 : and, in further satisfaction of such defalcation the plaintiffs then and there, with the consent and approbation of the said defendant, administratrix as aforesaid, accounted and took the said bond in the said declaration mentioned at $10,000, the amount of the penalty thereof, and gave the said A. B. credit on his\u2018 said defalcation to that amount therefor. And for the balance of the said A. B.\u2019s said defalcation, to wit, the sum of $28,229.47, as liquidated and stated in the accounting and settlement aforesaid, he, the said A. B., afterwards, to wit, on the first day of February, 1837, to wit, at Jersey City aforesaid, made and delivered to the plaintiff his promissory note for the sum last before mentioned, bearing date the day and year last aforesaid, and payable to the order of the cashier of the plaintiff five years after the date thereof, without this, that the said A. B. made and executed the said supposed promissory note, in the said fourth plea in that behalf alleged, in full satisfaction and discharge of all and any money and securities unpaid or unaccounted for by the said A. B. to the plaintiff while he was retained and employed by the plaintiff or under authority, or in full of all damages or loss sustained by it by reason of any breach of the condition of the said bond, in manner and form as the said defendant hath above, in her said fourth plea in that behalf, alleged ; and this the plaintiff is ready to verify j wherefore, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-5\">To this replication the defendant also demurred, and assigned the following causes of demurrer, <em>viz:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-6\">That the inducement in the said replication contained does not go to the same point as the special traverse, also contained therein; and that the said inducement and traverse are not properly adapted to each other. And also, that the said traverse is imperfect and incomplete, and does not deny the material matters of defence contained in the defendant\u2019s plea, but merely traverses the averment, that the promissory note mentioned in the said plea was made and executed in full satisfaction and discharge of all and any money or securities unpaid or unaccounted for by the said A. B. to the said plaintiff, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>he was retained and employed by the plaintiff, or under authority, or in full of all damages or loss sustained by reason of any breach of the condition of the said bond, without in any wise traversing the acceptance of the said note by the said plaintiff, as in the said plea averred. And also, that the said replication is in other respects uncertain, informal, and insufficient.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-5\">The demurrers were argued before Justices Carpenter and Randolph,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AkO\">by <em>Vroom, </em>for defendant, and by <em>F. T. Frelinghuysen </em>and <em>Bradley, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b113-6\">Carpenter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Af-\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The second plea is <em>non damnifiaatus, </em>in the nature of a plea of performance: that the cashier, named in the condition of the bond, did well and faithfully serve the company, and that the said company did not suffer any loss by reason of any malfeasance, wilful neglect, or wrongful act of the said cashier. The plaintiff, in the replication to this plea, has undertaken to show how the company has been damnified by the wrongful acts of this officer. It is objected that the replication is too general, and that the breach of the condition is not sufficiently assigned. Such pleading has, however, been frequently sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">It is a rule of pleading, that when a subject comprehends multiplicity of matter, then, in order to avoid prolixity, the law allows of general pleading, as a bond to return all writs, &amp;c. <em>Buller, J., </em>1 <em>T. R. </em>753; <em>Steph. Pl. </em>355 (359 <em>1st ed.); 1 Saund. </em>411, <em>note 4.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Thus in debt on bond, the condition of which was that the agent of the regiment would duly pay over such sums of money as he should receive from the paymaster general for the use of the regiment, <em>non damnifiaatus </em>being pleaded, the replication was, that the defendant received from the paymaster general, for and on account of the said regiment, <em>several sums of money, amounting in the whole </em>to \u00a31400, which he had not paid over. On demurrer, it was held that the breach was sufficiently assigned, and that it was not necessary to set out the several days and times and circumstances, and thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>render the record prolix to no purpose. <em>Cornwallis </em>v. <em>Savery, </em>2 <em>Burr. </em>772.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">So in debt on bond conditioned that R. S. would render and pay to the plaintiff a true and just account of all moneys, bills, <em>&amp;e., </em>which he should receive as his agent, to a plea of perform- \u25a0 anee, replication that R. S. received <em>divers sums of money, amounting to \u00a32000, </em>belonging to the plaintiff\u2019s business- as agent, and had not rendered and paid, &amp;c., was held to be sufficiently certain. <em>Shum </em>v. <em>Farrington, </em>1 <em>B. &amp; P. </em>640.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">So in debt on bond conditioned that B. R. should account for and pay over to the plaintiffs, as treasurers of a charity, such voluntary contributions as he should collect for the-use of the society, a like general assignment of the breach in the replication was, on special demurrer, held to be sufficiently certain. <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>8 <em>T. R. </em>459.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">It may be proper to say, that in the case last cited a point was taken similar to one made by counsel in the present case. It was said that the defendants, executors of the surety, were strangers to the transaction, and had no means of knowing, from so vague a charge, what they were called upon to answer. But it was held, as must be very clear upon the slightest reflection, that the rule of law is the same as to all defendants; that the form of the pleading is the same, whether the suit is brought against the principal of the bond or against the surety, or against the executors of a surety. Greater certainty is not required in the one case than in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">So in debt on bond of deputy sheriff, when the plaintiff, in his replication to the plea of general performance, assigned for breach of the condition that the defendant had collected moneys, as under sheriff, to the amount of $1000, which he refused to account for or to pay, this was held sufficient. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Smith and Miller, </em>5 <em>John. </em>173. See <em>S. P. Calvert </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>7 <em>B. &amp; C. </em>809. See also 1 <em>Lev. </em>94, <em>cit. Com. Dig. Plead. </em>(c. 45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">But it was hardly necessary to cite cases. As said in one ease, unless such assignment were permitted, the whole benefit of the statute, by which a plaintiff is permitted to assign several breaches in his replication, would be done away, and it would be necessary in most cases to file a bill in equity .before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>ho could assign his breaches with sufficient certainty. Indeed it was admitted on the argument, that in suits on bonds, by which money collected was secured to be paid over, such general assignment had been held sufficient. It was attempted to distinguish those cases from the present; but the reason equally applies. This case is that of the bond of the cashier of a large money institution, who for several years received and disbursed its funds, and it would be equally impossible to specify what securities for money he had received and misapplied, as to specify what sums of money he had received, and from whom. Such pleading would be utterly impossible, and, if required, would be fatal to all attempts to prosecute upon those bonds. To attempt, then, to specify the securities, and from whom received, would be to state in pleading that which is more properly matter of evidence, and would be a greater particularity than, in this case, the nature of the duty and of the default will conveniently allow. Principle and authority seem equally to be against the distinction contended for.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">To some extent the same rule applies here as in covenant, where it has been held, that when matter lies generally within the knowledge of the covenantor, then a general allegation is sufficient. Thus in <em>Gale v. Reed, </em>8 <em>East </em>85, where some of the decisions cited were recognised, the covenant by a person relinquishing the business was not to carry on the business of a,.rope maker, except on government contracts, and not to employ any other person to make cordage, &amp;e., it was held that a breach for having made cordage for <em>divers persons, </em>other than for the government, and for employing <em>other persons </em>than the plaintiffs, was well assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Another case of demurrer, specially assigned, is that notice of the default by the cashier is not alleged to have been given to the surety ill his lifetime, or to his administratrix since bis death. It was admitted that the precedents are both ways, and the allegation being merely formal is obviously unnecessary. It has been before held in this ease that notice of the default was not necessary to charge the sureties. 1 <em>Zab. </em>100, 116, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The breach of the condition is sufficiently assigned by the plaintiff, and the replication is sufficient. .</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The defendant has also demurred specially to the replication to the fourth plea. The plea is, that the cashier made and executed his promissory note, payable to the company, five years after date, in full satisfaction and discharge of all moneys and securities unaccounted for, &amp;c.; which said note, so made and delivered as aforesaid, the said company accepted and received in full satisfaction, &amp;c. In the replication to this plea, the plaintiff, by way of inducement and in order to show that the note was not given and received in full satisfaction and discharge of the damages sustained by reason of the breach of the condition of the bond, avers that a settlement had been made by and between the company and the cashier; that the defalcation of the cashier was found, and admitted to amount to the sum of $121,229.47 <em>; </em>that, in partial satisfaction of this defalcation, the cashier paid to the company in cash the sum of $3000, and in land, by a transfer of real estate, the sum of $80,000; that in further satisfaction of the said damages, with the consent and approbation of the defendant, this bond was taken at $10,000, the amount of the penalty, and that the note of the cashier for $28,229.47 was taken in full satisfaction of the balance. The plaintiff then adds this traverse: without this, that the said cashier made and executed the said supposed promissory note in full satisfaction and discharge, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u25a0 It is said, on the part of the defendant, that the inducement to a special traverse, in order to be sufficient, must set up material facts repugnant to the allegation intended to be denied ; that it must lead to and support the traverse, which must properly be an inference from or a consequence of the inducement. <em>Gould Pl. ch. VII. secs. </em>14, 55, 64, <em>p. </em>382, &amp;c. It is urged that upon these principles the inducement is not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Undoubtedly the inducement to a special traverse must set up material facts repugnant to the allegation traversed ; but in our judgment such facts are here averred. The affirmative introductory matter in the pleading of the plaintiff, set out as the foundation of the traverse, seems to us to be material, and it is 'obviously inconsistent with what had been pi-eviously alleged by the defendant. If the facts thus averred by way of inducement be true in point of fact, most clearly the note in question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>was never given in full satisfaction and discharge of the damages which the company had sustained by reason of the breach of the condition of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">It is not necessary, in answer to what has been said by the counsel of the defendant, to enlarge upon the character and object of a special traverse. It is sufficient for the present to say that this form of denial seems to have been properly adopted on the present occasion. It was proper, by putting the denial- of what had been set up in the plea in this qualified form, slating the circumstances of the transaction in an inducement, to give the adverse party an opportunity to raise an issue at law for the adjudication of the court. It furnished him with an opportunity,-if he saw fit to embrace it, to question the validity of the transaction or to test its legal effect, upon which however, no point has been made. This mode of traverse has been moulded into a technical form, but, as was well observed by counsel, in substance it arises out of the very nature of things, and is to be found in some shape in every system of pleading. The party who resorts to such mode of pleading sets up his own statement of opposing facts, thus argumentatively denying the truth of what has been alleged by the adverse party, which he then follows by the direct denial necessary to form an issue, the denial being thus the direct result of the preceding statement. Here the plaintiff, after a statement of the circumstances under which, as he alleges, the note had been given, then in direct and formal terms denies that it had been made and executed for the purpose alleged by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">But again it is urged that the traverse itself is insufficient. It traverses that the note was made aud executed, and not that it was accepted and received in satisfaction. The making and executing the note in satisfaction is averred in substance, if not in terms, by the defendant, and a traverse may be well taken to what, though not expressly alleged, is necessarily implied. <em>Steph. Pl. </em>195 (218, <em>1st ed.) </em>If delivered for one purpose, could the note have been accepted for any other? If anything is given, it must be accepted as intended or declared by the giver.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>It is settled that the replication to the plea of accord and satisfaction may either deny the delivery of the thing in satisfaction or it may deny the acceptance, or indeed, as it would seem, the plaintiff may take issue on the entire allegation. <em>\u201c Quod non dedit in satisfactione,\u201d </em>is a good replication, for there must be a mutual payment and acceptance in satisfaction, and the one imports both. <em>Com. Dig. Accord </em>(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In <em>Young </em>v. <em>Rudd, </em>5 <em>Mod. </em>86, to <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>on a <em>quantum meruit, </em>the defendant pleaded in bar that he gave the plaintiff' a beaver hat, which he accepted in satisfaction of the debt. The plaintiff traversed, that he accepted it in satisfaction; and upon demurrer it was objected in behalf of the defendant, that it was an immaterial traverse, because the giving was the directing matter which ought to have been traversed. To which the answer was, and so the court held, that either the giving or the acceptance of what was given in satisfaction might be traversed. In <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Weatherby, </em>1 <em>Bing. N. Cas. </em>502, where the above case was cited as authority by the court, it was held that the receipt in satisfaction implied payment in satisfaction, and that the plaintiff might take issue on the entire allegation. It was contended in this case, as payment and acceptance were both material allegations, that the plaintiff ought to elect on which of them he would tender issue. The same principles were again recognised in <em>Ridley </em>v. <em>Tindall, </em>7 <em>Ad. &amp; Ell. </em>134. The precedents in 3 <em>Chit. P. </em>1156, 1 <em>Lil.
