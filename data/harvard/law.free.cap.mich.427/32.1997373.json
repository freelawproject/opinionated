[MCL 500.3135(1); MSA 24.13135(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>In each of these five cases, the plaintiff attempted to recover noneconomic damages by alleging that he had suffered a serious impairment of body function. Applying the rules articulated in <em>Cassidy v McGovern, </em>415 Mich 483; 330 NW2d 22 (1982), the Court of Appeals held in each case that the plaintiff had not incurred sufficiently serious injuries to meet the threshold requirements of \u00a7 3135(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Determining whether a person sustained a serious impairment of body function is a multifaceted problem. Since <em>Cassidy </em>was decided, the Court of Appeals has published approximately forty opinions on the subject. Some of these opinions have reached conflicting legal and factual conclusions. Since \u00a7 3135(1) limits noneconomic damages which are ordinarily recoverable in a tort cause of action, we must determine the parameters of those limitations with reference to the Legislature\u2019s intent, as expressed in the statutory language and legislative history. The conclusions we reach must then be articulated in a workable set of rules for the bench and bar. With these goals in mind, we have reviewed \u00a7 3135(1), <em>Cassidy, </em>and the cases interpreting them, and hold as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">1) The question whether the plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of body function must be submitted to the trier of fact whenever the evidence would cause reasonable minds to differ as to the answer. This is true even where there is no material factual dispute as to the nature and extent of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">2) In deciding motions for, and reviewing orders granting or denying, summary disposition, directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and determine:</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">a) whether a material factual dispute exists as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>to the nature and extent of the plaintiffs injuries, and</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">b) whether reasonable minds could differ regarding whether the plaintiff had sustained a serious impairment of body function.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">If the threshold issue was properly submitted to the trier of fact, its findings generally should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">3) The Legislature did not intend to limit recovery of noneconomic damages to the catastrophically injured. The \"serious impairment of body function\u201d threshold is a significant, but not extraordinarily high, obstacle to recovering such damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">4) The impairment need not be of the entire body function or of an important body function. Section 3135(1) bars recovery of noneconomic damages to those persons who suffered minor injuries, or injuries which did not seriously impair the ability of the body, in whole or in part, to function.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">5) The \"general ability to live a normal life\u201d test will no longer be used to determine whether the plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of body function.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">6) The \"serious impairment of body function\u201d threshold contains two inquiries:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">a) What body function, if any, was impaired because of injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident?</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">b) Was the impairment of body function serious? The focus of these inquiries is not on the injuries themselves, but on how the injuries affected a particular body function. Generally, medical testimony will be needed to establish the existence, extent, and permanency of the impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">7) In determining whether the impairment was serious, several factors should be considered: the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>extent of the impairment, the particular body function impaired, the length of time the impairment lasted, the treatment required to correct the impairment, and any other relevant factors. An impairment need not be permanent to be serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">8) When the threshold question is submitted to the jury, it should be instructed as to the two-fold nature of the \"serious impairment of body function\u201d threshold, and the factors to be considered in determining seriousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">9) Section 3135(1) and <em>Cassidy </em>require the plaintiff to prove that his noneconomic losses arose out of a medically identifiable injury which seriously impaired a body function. The interpretation of <em>Cassidy\u2019s </em>\"objectively manifested injury\u201d requirement adopted in <em>Williams v Payne, </em>131 Mich App 403; 346 NW2d 564 (1984), is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">10) To the extent that the above holdings are new or inconsistent with <em>Cassidy, </em>our decision applies to the five cases before us as well as to: (1) currently pending appeals in which an issue concerning the proper interpretation of the statutory phrase \"serious impairment of body function\u201d has been raised, (2) trials in which a jury is instructed after the date of this decision, and (3) cases in which summary disposition is entered after the date of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">I. HISTORY OF \u00a7 3135(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Approximately one-quarter of the states have enacted no-fault automobile insurance laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>basic feature of these acts is compulsory motor vehicle insurance, which permits the insured to recover benefits directly from his insurer, regardless of fault, for certain economic losses sustained as a result of a motor vehicle accident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In return, the injured person\u2019s common-law right to recover damages from the negligent owner or operator of the motor vehicle in a tort action is limited.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No-fault laws were designed to remedy the shortcomings of the traditional tort recovery system \u2014 overcompensation of minor injuries, undercompensation of serious injuries, long payment delays, overburdened court systems, and discrimination against those with low income and little education. Cassidy, 415 Mich 498-499; <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 578-579; 267 NW2d 72 (1978), cert den sub nom <em>Allstate Ins Co v Kelley, </em>442 US 934 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">One of the most controversial aspects of these laws is the limitations often placed on the injured person\u2019s right to recover damages for pain and suffering, mental anguish, inconvenience, and loss of consortium from the negligent owner or opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>tor. Some states place no restrictions on the ability to recover damages for these noneconomic losses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The remaining states, including Michigan, permit recovery only where the injuries sustained are sufficiently serious.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The precursor of Michigan\u2019s no-fault act, SB 782, was introduced on June 2, 1971.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 35 would have abolished all tort liability for bodily injury and property damage, regardless of the injuries sustained, except under very limited circumstances.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A substitute bill was recommended by the Senate Committee on Commerce on May 30, 1972,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and adopted by the Senate. The new tort liability provision was substantially different than that proposed in the original bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Senator Faxon proposed several amendments to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the provision limiting recovery of noneconomic damages to those who sustained certain injuries. He proposed, but later withdrew, an amendment which would have inserted after \"death\u201d the following threshold injuries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">permanent serious impairment of body function, permanent serious disfigurement or medical bills in excess of $5000.00.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Senator Faxon proposed two other amendments to the threshold requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">permanent, major, or extensive disability of body function, permanent loss of mental competency, or medical bills in excess of $5000.00;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">permanent serious disfigurement or an injury which is so extraordinarily severe as to render the legal remedy therefor under this statute inadequate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Neither amendment was adopted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">The Senate substitute bill was sent to the House on June 8, 1972.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The House Committee on Insurance proposed its own substitute bill, which was adopted by the House on September 26, 1972.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Like the substitute Senate bill, the House bill retained tort liability for noneconomic loss if the injured person died, or sustained a serious impairment of body function or permanent serious disfigurement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Several representatives protested the passage of the House substitute bill, particularly the limitations placed upon the recovery of noneconomic damages. Representative Kelsey stated that \"[a] limit of $10,000 before tort action could result would have been much more satisfactory . . . .\u201d Representative Clark criticized the entire bill partly because \"[t]he benefit will go to the wrong doer rather than the safe driver whose present right to recover for pain and suffering will be almost eliminated.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Representative Smeekens presented a lengthy article from the Detroit News describing the lobbyists\u2019 \"tug-of-war.\u201d The article included the following pertinent observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">[The bill] leaves the door open for lawyers to represent clients involved in accidents which result in death, permanent disability, serious disfigurement, losses in excess of benefits, or serious impairment of body functions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">The impairment clause was the key to how the bill would turn out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">\n<em>The insurance company lobbyists wanted it to read serious impairment of \"significant body functions. \u201d The lawyers opposed the word \"significant\u201d being included in the law.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">The committee finally reported the no-fault bill to the floor by a vote of 10-0, <em>but only after the insurance lobby lost out in its efforts to save the key clause.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\"><em>The lawyers </em>\u2014 many of whom make considerable incomes suing on this <em>basis </em>\u2014 didn\u2019t <em>want the word </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>\"significant\u201d in the law because it would make it more difficult to bring suit. </em>[Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The Senate did not concur in the House substitute bill.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> On October 5, 1972, a Senate conference committee recommended that the prior Senate substitute bill be adopted. Representative Cramp-ton objected to the recommendation because \"[t]his bill makes it possible \u2014 probable\u2014that innocent law abiding drivers will be clobbered by some careless or drunken driver plowing through a stop sign or stop light \u2014 and live in pain for the rest of their life with no chance to recover any damages.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the Senate and House adopted the recommendation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The no-fault act was signed on November 27, 1972, as 1972 PA 294,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and became effective on March 30, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In short, although a few opponents believed that \u00a7 3135(1) would eliminate most suits for noneconomic loss, the Legislature rejected proposals that would have made it much more difficult to sue for noneconomic damages. Specifically, it rejected a $5000 medical bill threshold, a requirement that the impairment of body function be permanent, major, or extensive, and a requirement that the body function impaired be a significant one. The Legislature thus did not intend to limit recovery only to catastrophically injured persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">II. THRESHOLD REQUIREMENTS IN OTHER STATES</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">An examination of other states\u2019 no-fault provisions which limit recovery of noneconomic dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>ages reveals that Michigan has the most open-ended and broadly worded threshold requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Section 5(a)(7) of the Uniform Motor Vehicle Accident Reparations Act permits recovery of damages for noneconomic detriment in excess of $5000,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">but only if the accident causes death, significant permanent injury, serious permanent disfigurement, or more than 6 months of complete inability of the injured person to work in an occupation. \"Complete inability of an injured person to work in an occupation\u201d means inability to perform, on even a part-time basis, even some of the duties required by his occupation or, if unemployed at the time of injury, by any occupation for which the injured person was qualified. [See 14 ULA 64.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The commissioners\u2019 comments state that the threshold requirements were designed to preserve actions for noneconomic loss \"only for persons who have suffered very serious injury.\u201d To discourage arguable claims with some settlement value, \u00a7 5(a)(7) requires a $5000 deduction from the amount awarded for noneconomic loss. <em>Id., </em>pp 68-69. Unlike Michigan\u2019s no-fault act, the umvara limits recovery to permanently injured persons, and those who are completely unable to perform their job for at least six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Every state which limits recovery of noneconomic damages, except Michigan, has enacted monetary thresholds, on the basis of the amount of medical expenses reasonably incurred as a result of the motor vehicle accident.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Several states also specify injuries which can be the basis of a noneconomic loss action. Fractures are mentioned in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>some statutes.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Kansas and Kentucky specifically require the fracture to be of a weight-bearing bone, or one which is compound, comminuted, displaced, or compressed. New Jersey does not permit recovery if the injured person sustained only soft tissue injuries and incurred less than $200 in medical expenses. \"Soft tissue injury\u201d is extensively defined to include sprains, strains, and tears to muscles, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Five states list specific periods of disability, ranging from ten days (Georgia) to 180 days (District of Columbia). Like the umvara, these statutes usually define what constitutes a disability.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Numerous states include loss or impairment of a body function as a threshold injury, but nearly all require the loss or impairment to be permanent.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Florida also requires that the body function impaired be an important one. As previously noted, the Michigan Legislature specifically rejected both requirements. Perhaps the threshold most akin to Michigan\u2019s \"serious impairment of body function\u201d threshold is that of New York \u2014 \"significant limitation of use of a body function or system.\u201d However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the New York statute also contains several more specifically worded threshold injuries.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Using these statutory provisions as guidelines, our Legislature could have easily clarified what types of injuries can be the basis of a suit for noneconomic damages. By choosing two rather amorphous thresholds, the Legislature apparently preferred that the parameters of \u00a7 3135(1) be developed through the judicial process. This has proven to be a difficult task for the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">III. <em>CASSIDY v MCGOVERN</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\"><em>Cassidy </em>was this Court\u2019s first attempt to define what constitutes a \"serious impairment of body function,\u201d what evidence is needed to meet this threshold, and when the issue should be submitted to the factfinder. The <em>Cassidy </em>Court concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">1) When there is no material factual dispute concerning the nature and extent of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, the question whether the plaintiff sustained a serious impairment of body function must be decided as a matter of law by the trial court. 415 Mich 488, 502. In making this determination, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Id., </em>p 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">2) The \"serious impairment of body function\u201d threshold is a significant obstacle to maintaining a tort action for noneconomic damages. It should be considered in conjunction with the other thresholds listed in \u00a7 3135(1), i.e., death and permanent serious disfigurement. <em>Id., </em>p 503. An injury need not be permanent to be serious, although permanency is a relevant consideration. <em>Id., </em>pp 505-506.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">3) The impairment must be of an important body function, but not necessarily the entire body function. <em>Id., </em>p 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>4) To determine whether plaintiff sustained a serious impairment of body function, an objective standard should be used, which \"looks to the effect of an injury on the person\u2019s general ability to live a normal life.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">5) Recovery for noneconomic loss cannot be predicated solely on pain and suffering. Recovery must be based on \"objectively manifested injuries\u201d that affect the functioning of the body. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">These rules were applied to two cases where the nature and extent of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were undisputed. In <em>Hermann v Haney, </em>the Court concluded, as a matter of law, that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were not sufficiently serious to meet the threshold. Plaintiff\u2019s bruises, which were not troublesome, cleared up within two months, while the bump on her head subsided within one month. Although she had missed a month of work due to back and neck pains, the pain diminished after that month, and presented no problems after two months. <em>Id., </em>p 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">In contrast, the injuries at issue in <em>Cassidy v McGovern </em>satisfied the threshold as a matter of law. Plaintiff had sustained two broken bones in the lower right leg, was hospitalized for eighteen days, and wore a cast for seven months. He suffered dizzy spells, which necessitated the use of a walker. He also suffered some residual pain one and one-half years after the accident. The Court concluded that the broken bones had impaired plaintiff\u2019s ability to walk, an important body function. The fact that plaintiff was a farmer who had to be on his feet for many hours was deemed an irrelevant consideration. In addition, plaintiff\u2019s claim was based on objectively manifested injuries (i.e., two broken bones), rather than general aches and pains. The Court further concluded that the impairment was serious, in light of the extensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>period of recuperation and minor residual problems. <em>Id., </em>pp 504-505.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The <em>Cassidy </em>Court recognized that the phrase \"serious impairment of body function\u201d is not readily definable and its character would have to be developed on a case-by-case basis. As more cases were decided, the Court hoped that it would become clearer what types of injuries are sufficiently serious to meet this threshold. <em>Id., </em>pp 502-503. Although approximately forty Court of Appeals opinions have since been published, the answer has not become much clearer.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In addition, <em>Cassidy </em>has spawned other problems. Court of Appeals panels have differed as to the standard for reviewing orders granting or denying summary disposition, directed verdict, and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The \"general ability to live a normal life\u201d standard has proven to be as difficult to apply as the threshold it was designed to clarify. It is also unclear what types of injuries are \"objectively manifested.\u201d Several panels have drawn a distinction between objectively manifested injuries and symptoms. This distinction often prevents persons who have sustained soft tissue injuries from recovering damages for noneconomic losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">We therefore believe it is necessary to reexamine and clarify each of the major holdings of <em>Cassidy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">IV. DECIDING SERIOUS IMPAIRMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\"><em>Cassidy </em>held that when there is no material factual dispute as to the nature and extent of the plaintiffs injuries, the trial court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the plaintiff sustained a serious impairment of body function. Previously, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of 1972 PA 294, </em>389 Mich 441, 477-478; 208 NW2d 469 (1973), had held that the phrases \"serious impairment of body function\u201d and \"permanent serious disfigurement\u201d provide sufficient standards for legal interpretation and are generally questions of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\">This Court holds that such phrases are capable of legal interpretation and, indeed, that juries or judges sitting without juries frequently have and do interpret comparable phrases bearing upon various facets of the law. Such findings result from denominated fact questions and thus are within the exclusive province of the triers of fact. Only when interpretation approaches or breaches permissible limits does it become a question of law for the Court. Such questions must be approached on a case by case basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"><em>Advisory Opinion </em>noted that triers of fact are routinely required to pass on equally difficult questions, e.g., reasonableness, proximate cause, gross negligence, and damages. <em>Id., </em>pp 478-481.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The Court of Appeals consistently heeded <em>Advisory Opinion\u2019s </em>statement that the jury should usually decide whether the plaintiff had suffered a serious impairment of body function.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It also recognized that, in certain instances, the trial court should decide as a matter of law whether the plaintiff had, or had not, established a threshold injury. Such a decision could be made where \"it can be said with certainty that no reasonable jury could view a plaintiffs impairment as serious.\u201d <em>Brooks v Reed, </em>93 Mich App 166, 171; 286 NW2d 81 (1979), lv den 411 Mich 862 (1981). If the injury was \"so minor\u201d or of a \"clearly superficial nature,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>summary judgment should be granted to defendant. <em>Id.; Vitale v Danylak, </em>74 Mich App 615, 620; 254 NW2d 593 (1977). Conversely, if the injury was so serious that no reasonable minds could differ as to whether the plaintiff had sustained a serious impairment of body function, the plaintiff should be granted summary judgment. <em>Watkins v City Cab Corp, </em>97 Mich App 723, 726; 296 NW2d 162 (1980); <em>Cassidy v McGovern, </em>86 Mich App 321, 325-326; 272 NW2d 644 (1978), rev\u2019d 415 Mich 483 (1982). In making this determination, the evidence was viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Gallagher v Parshall, </em>97 Mich App 654, 658-659; 296 NW2d 132 (1980); <em>Watkins, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The <em>Cassidy </em>Court dismissed the aforequoted language from <em>Advisory Opinion </em>because it was contained in a nonbinding advisory opinion, was made without discussion, and was based upon assumptions about trial procedure in trials that had not yet occurred. 415 Mich 497-498. The Court offered three reasons for holding that the serious impairment issue should generally be decided by the trial court. First, the phrase is not a commonly used term for which juries would have a clear sense of its intended meaning. Second, if the interpretation of the phrase must generally be submitted to the trier of fact, a trial would usually be necessary. This result would thwart the Legislature\u2019s intent to reduce litigation. Third, the Legislature could not have intended that the limitations it had created would vary according to the specific jury impaneled, or the part of the state in which the case was tried. Uniformity of application would be more attainable through statutory construction by appellate courts. <em>Id., </em>pp 501-502. The <em>Cassidy </em>Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>The responsibility of effectuating the legislative will is primarily a matter of law for the court and not properly left to determination by a jury. . . . Therefore, we conclude that the meaning of \"seri- . ous impairment of body function\u201d is a matter to be determined by statutory construction. We hold that when there is no factual dispute regarding the nature and extent of a plaintiff\u2019s injuries, the question of serious impairment of body function shall be decided as a matter of law by the court. Likewise, if there is a factual dispute as to the nature and extent of a plaintiff\u2019s injuries, but the dispute is not material to the determination whether plaintiff has suffered a serious impairment of body function, the court shall rule as a matter of law whether the threshold requirement of MCL 500.3135; MSA 24.13135 has been met. <em>[Id., </em>p 502.[<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The first two sentences suggest that the question whether the plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of body function is always a question of law for the court. This is not true in practice. If a material factual dispute exists concerning plaintiff\u2019s injuries, the jury resolves the factual questions <em>and </em>decides whether the plaintiff\u2019s injuries seriously impaired a body function. See SJI2d 36.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The remainder of the paragraph suggests that the threshold issue is a question of law only when there is no material factual dispute as to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. This language and logic is quite similar to that contained in GCR 1963, 117.2(3) (now MCR 2.116[C][10]), i.e., the trial court should grant a motion for summary judgment where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">After careful reconsideration, we find that <em>Cassidy </em>is somewhat inconsistent with general rules of civil procedure. Even where there is no material factual dispute, a motion for summary disposition (as well as directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict) should not be granted if the facts can support conflicting inferences. 73 Am Jur 2d, Summary Judgment, \u00a7 27, p 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">For example, in <em>McMillan v State Highway Comm, </em>426 Mich 46; 393 NW2d 332 (1986), there was no material factual dispute as to the circumstances surrounding the motor vehicle accident at issue, or the construction and placement of the utility pole which plaintiff struck. After concluding that a private utility company could be held liable for negligent placement of a utility pole, we remanded the case to the trial court. We instructed the court that if the utility company should move for summary disposition on the basis that there was no genuine issue of material fact, the court must determine whether reasonable minds could nevertheless differ as to whether the company had acted negligently. We noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">\"If the facts bearing upon other aspects of 'proximate cause\u2019 (that is, aspects other than causation in fact) are not in dispute and reasonable persons could not differ about the application to those facts of the legal concept of 'proximate cause,\u2019 the court determines that issue. <em>But if reasonable persons could differ, </em>either because relevant facts are in dispute <em>or because application of the legal concept of \u2019proximate cause\u2019 to the case at hand is an evaluative determination as to which reasonable persons might differ, the issue of \u2019proximate </em>cause\u2019 <em>is submitted to the jury with appropriate instruc</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>tions on the law.\u201d </em>[Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 45, p 321. Emphasis supplied. <em>Id., </em>p 63, n 8.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The same principles should be applied to the determination of whether the plaintiff sustained a \u00a7 3135(1) threshold injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">In retrospect, the reasons given in <em>Cassidy </em>for requiring courts to determine threshold issues are not as compelling as they initially appeared. Although the phrase \"serious impairment of body function\u201d is an uncommon one,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> juries are capable of understanding its component parts \u2014 \"seriousness,\u201d \"impairment,\u201d and \"body function.\u201d Furthermore, juries are permitted to decide the threshold issue where the nature and extent of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries are in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">As to the fear that automobile negligence litigation will dramatically increase, modifying this aspect of <em>Cassidy </em>will result in more noneconomicloss cases going to trial. However, the pre-Cassidy case law did not require a trial in every case. Moreover, no-fault acts were designed primarily to reduce the number of cases seeking damages for <em>economic </em>loss, e.g., wage loss, survivor\u2019s loss, and medical expenses. Although \u00a7 3135(1) was designed to eliminate lawsuits seeking noneconomic damages for minor injuries, it cannot be said that the Legislature intended to wipe out almost all noneconomic-loss cases. The legislative history indicates that less stringent thresholds were adopted as a concession to attorneys performing personal injury work.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">To those who argue that permitting more none<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>conomic-loss cases to go to trial will cripple the no-fault system, we note that limiting tort liability for noneconomic losses is not an essential feature of no-fault acts. Several no-fault states place no limitations on the ability to sue for these damages. We also note that <em>Advisory Opinion </em>was decided shortly after the no-fault act became effective. The Legislature was therefore aware that threshold issues would generally be submitted to juries. The Legislature did not attempt to rectify this situation, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The final reason given by the <em>Cassidy </em>Court was the belief that the Legislature did not intend to leave threshold issues to the vagaries of juries. No such legislative intent is evident from the statutory language or legislative history. Moreover, trial and appellate courts have proven to be no more consistent than juries would have been in determining whether a particular plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of body function. Conflicting results have been reached by different Court of Appeals panels reviewing the same case.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Conflict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>ing results have also arisen among cases involving similarly injured plaintiffs.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> This is undoubtedly because no two plaintiffs are injured or recover in precisely the same manner. These conflicting results indicate that threshold issues are often questions upon which reasonable minds can differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Properly instructed jurors are capable of weighing evidence and using their collective experiences to determine whether a particular plaintiff has suffered an impairment of body function and whether that impairment was serious. Their verdict represents the collective judgment of six people, as opposed to the views of one trial judge, and perhaps a panel of appellate judges reviewing a cold record. Without further guidance from the Legislature, we believe that juries are better suited to resolving threshold questions where reasonable minds can differ on the answer.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>We therefore modify that portion of <em>Cassidy </em>which held that the trial court must decide whether the plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of body function whenever there is no material factual dispute as to the nature and extent of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. If reasonable minds can differ as to whether the plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of body function, the issue must be submitted to the jury, even if the evidentiary facts are undisputed. Our holding marks a return to the rules articulated in <em>Advisory Opinion </em>and the Court of Appeals decisions which are consistent with that opinion. See <em>ante, </em>pp 50-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">V. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">In <em>Kelleher v Kuchta, </em>138 Mich App 45; 359 NW2d 224 (1984), the Court of Appeals attempted to articulate a standard for reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling as to whether a plaintiff had, or had not, suffered a serious impairment of body function as a matter of law. To avoid appellate \"second guessing\u201d and accord some deference to the judge who viewed the evidence firsthand, the <em>Kelleher </em>majority concluded that the trial court\u2019s ruling should be affirmed unless it was clearly erroneous. <em>Id., </em>p 47.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Judge Kelly disagreed with the \"clearly erroneous\u201d standard because it is generally used to review the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, rather than conclusions of law. He preferred a standard which would require both trial and appellate courts to view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and determine whether reasonable minds could differ as to whether the plaintiff had suffered a serious impairment of body function. Judge Kelly noted that this standard had been used in <em>pre-Cassidy </em>decisions. <em>Id., </em>pp 47-49,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Judge Kelly correctly articulated the standard for deciding motions for, and reviewing orders granting or denying, summary disposition, directed verdict, and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. If a material factual dispute existed, or reasonable minds could have differed on whether the plaintiff sustained a serious impairment of body function, the issue should have been submitted to the fact-finder. If the issue was properly submitted to the trier of fact, its findings generally should not be disturbed. In a bench trial, the judge\u2019s findings of fact must be affirmed unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Tuttle v Dep\u2019t of State Highways, </em>397 Mich 44, 46; 243 NW2d 244 (1976); MCR 2.613(C). In a jury trial, the jury\u2019s findings of fact, as reflected in its verdict, must be affirmed unless they are against the great weight of the evidence. <em>Tuttle, </em>pp 46-47, n 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">vi. \"serious impairment\u201d threshold is a SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">A few Court of Appeals opinions have suggested that only catastrophically injured persons can satisfy the \"serious impairment of body function\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>threshold.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> This limitation supposedly stems from the following language in <em>Workman v DAIIE, </em>404 Mich 477, 508-509; 274 NW2d 373 (1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">The legislative intent, inferable from the face of [\u00a7 3135] is clear: <em>the Legislature intended to allow the catastrophically injured victim </em>and the victim of extraordinary economic losses <em>compensation in addition to that provided by \u00a7\u00a7 3107 to 3110 of the act. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The <em>Workman </em>Court did not state that recovery of noneconomic damages was limited to the catastrophically injured. It was merely describing those persons who are clearly entitled to sue for losses not covered by the no-fault act. As previously noted, the Legislature specifically rejected amendments to \u00a7 3135(1) which would have required an \"extraordinarily severe\u201d injury, or a \"major or extensive\u201d disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The \"serious impairment of body function\u201d threshold is a significant, but not extraordinarily high, threshold. The three threshold injuries listed in \u00a7 3135(1) are not equivalent in severity. No disfigurement or injury is comparable to death. The \"permanent serious disfigurement\u201d and \"serious impairment of body function\u201d thresholds are not equivalent since the former contains a significant additional requirement \u2014 permanency. The Legislature refused to add this requirement to the latter threshold. The \"serious impairment of body function\u201d threshold was designed to eliminate suits based on clearly minor injuries, and those injuries which did not seriously affect the ability of the body, in whole or in part, to function._</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>VII. AN IMPORTANT BODY FUNCTION MUST BE IMPAIRED</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The <em>Cassidy </em>Court judicially engrafted the requirement that the body function impaired must be important. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">The language \"impairment of body function\u201d is ambiguous regarding whether the impairment must be of <em>any </em>body function or of the <em>entire </em>body function. On the one hand, if <em>any </em>body function were to be considered the intended meaning, arguably a serious impairment of the use of the little finger would meet the threshold requirement. On the other hand, if an impairment had to be of the entire body function, then arguably only life-threatening injuries would satisfy the requirement. We believe that neither of these options accurately reflect the legislative intent and that impairment of body function is better understood as referring to important body functions. [415 Mich 504.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">We agree that \u00a7 3135(1) does not require the entire functioning of the body to be seriously impaired. Such an interpretation would essentially limit recovery of noneconomic damages to the catastrophically injured. However, it is questionable whether the <em>Cassidy </em>Court should have imposed the requirement that the body function impaired be important. The legislative history indicates that a comparable threshold \u2014 \"serious impairment of <em>signi\u00f1cant </em>body functions\u201d \u2014 was rejected. Moreover, the Legislature recently used the phrase \"los[s of] a <em>vital </em>bodily function\u201d to describe one class of injuries which are not subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>$225,000 limit on noneconomic damages recoverable in medical malpractice actions.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Rather than judicially imposing a requirement which the Legislature clearly rejected, it would be preferable to focus on the Legislature\u2019s overall intent to bar recovery of noneconomic damages to those who suffered minor or superficial injuries. It may be possible to describe a minor injury as a serious impairment of <em>some </em>body function. However, we believe the judiciary is fully capable of weeding out trivial cases without having to determine whether the body function impaired is important.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">vm. \"general ability to live a NORMAL LIFE\u201d TEST</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">This test arose during the discussion of whether Leo Cassidy had suffered a serious impairment of body function:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">Walking is an important body function that for Leo Cassidy was impaired by his broken bones. This conclusion is not affected one way or the other by the fact that Leo Cassidy is a potato farmer who must be on his feet for long hours. We believe that the Legislature intended an objective standard that looks to the effect of an injury on the person\u2019s general ability to live a normal life. [415 Mich 505.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">The \"general ability to live a normal life\u201d test has been criticized by both plaintiffs\u2019 and defendants\u2019 attorneys.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The most obvious problem is defining what constitutes \"a normal life.\u201d The Court of Appeals has never attempted to define the phrase, since it usually concludes that the injuries sustained did not significantly affect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>plaintiff\u2019s </em>life style or daily activities.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> However, relief has been denied where the injuries did significantly affect the plaintiff\u2019s normal life style and activities.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The Court of Appeals has repeatedly stated that mere difficulty in performing activities is not sufficient to establish a serious impairment of body function.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In denying relief, panels often note that the plaintiff was not \"incapacitated\u201d or \"confined to bed.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Short shrift is usually given to the fact that the plaintiff is no longer able to engage in the recreational activities he previously enjoyed.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> However, if the plaintiff can still perform such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>activities, this indicates that he is able to live a normal life.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">If the plaintiff eventually returned to work, even after an absence of several months, the Court of Appeals has usually concluded that there has been no significant interference with the plaintiff\u2019s normal life.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> This is true even if permanent medical restrictions have been placed on plaintiff\u2019s ability to lift or perform certain types of work.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Restrictions imposed by the plaintiff, rather than his doctor, are usually ignored.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Relief has generally been denied to plaintiffs who eventually regained their full range of motion, even if the initial limitation was significant.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In short, the Court of Appeals has strictly applied the \"general ability to live a normal life\u201d test. If the plaintiff can perform common day-today activities, albeit with some difficulty, or can eventually return to work, the plaintiff is usually deemed not to have suffered a serious impairment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>of body function. The bottom line is that few plaintiffs have been given the opportunity to recover noneconomic damages since <em>Cassidy </em>was decided.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The \"general ability\u201d test was an attempt to devise an objective standard for evaluating the effect of an injury upon the body\u2019s ability to function. To the extent that the <em>Cassidy </em>Court refused to focus solely on how the . injury affected the particular plaintiff\u2019s way of life, we agree that this was not the intent behind \u00a7 3135(1). Unlike other states, the Legislature did not enact a threshold which looks at how the injury affected the plaintiff\u2019s ability to work or perform his normal activities. Instead, the relevant inquiries are whether the injury impaired a body function and, if so, whether that impairment was serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Focusing on the effect an injury has on a particular person\u2019s life can lead to anomalous results. Suppose a concert violinist sustains severe permanent injuries to his legs in an auto accident and is required to use a wheelchair. If the violinist previously lived a sedentary life and has a good mental outlook, the injury may not seriously affect his daily routine, work, or recreational activities. However, he has clearly suffered a serious impairment of body function.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Suppose the same violinist suffers a permanent loss of dexterity in his little finger. Although the injury does not prevent the violinist from perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>ing routine tasks with his hand, the injury has effectively ruined his performing career. The violinist undoubtedly suffers more mental anguish than a similarly injured soccer player. However, the \"serious impairment of body function\u201d threshold bars recovery of noneconomic damages for minor injuries, regardless of how seriously the injury affects a particular person\u2019s life. The violinist can only recover his medical expenses and wage loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">A test which merely compares the activities which the plaintiff could perform before and after the accident could reward the malingerer or hypochondriac, while penalizing the person who cannot afford to miss work or tries to function despite the pain.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> However, a test which attempts to compare the plaintiff\u2019s post-accident activities and abilities to a hypothetical person\u2019s \"normal life\u201d is equally flawed. Very simply, there is no such thing as \"a normal life.\u201d Determining which activities are essential to living a normal life is an equally impossible task.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The \"general ability to live a normal life\u201d test, as applied by the Court of Appeals, has proved to be an almost insurmountable obstacle to recovering noneconomic damages. Apparently, only plaintiffs who are bedridden, cannot care for themselves, or are unable to perform any type of work can satisfy this test. This was not the intent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Legislature. Rather than clarifying what injuries are sufficiently serious to meet the \"serious impairment of body function\u201d threshold, the test has obfuscated the true nature of the threshold inquiry. We therefore discard the test in favor of an objective approach which we believe is more consistent with the statutory language and legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">IX. DETERMINING WHETHER PLAINTIFF SUFFERED A SERIOUS IMPAIRMENT OF BODY FUNCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The \"serious impairment of body function\u201d threshold contains two straightforward inquiries:</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">1) What body function, if any, was impaired because of injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">2) Was the impairment serious?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">The focus of these inquiries is not on the injuries themselves, but how the injuries affected a particular body function. Generally, medical testimony will be needed to establish the existence, extent, and permanency of the impairment. Identifying which body functions were impaired is a relatively easy task. Determining whether the impairment was serious requires a much more complicated evaluation of factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">The extent of an impairment is often expressed in numerical terms. A person who suffers a permanent seventy-five-percent limitation in back movement has clearly suffered a serious impairment of back function, while a person with a permanent five-percent limitation probably has not. However, the particular body function impaired may also make a difference. A ten-percent permanent reduction in brain functioning is a more serious impairment of body function than a ten-percent limitation in neck motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>The length of time the impairment of body function lasts must also be considered. A person who is rendered unconscious for several minutes at the scene of the accident has suffered a substan-' tial impairment of brain functioning during those minutes. If there are no further problems, the impairment overall does not appear serious. A permanent impairment is more serious than a temporary impairment of like character. However, the fact that the plaintiff eventually makes a complete recovery should not negate the fact that he endured a serious impairment of body function for a significant period of time. A permanent impairment may or may not be serious, depending on the extent of the impairment and body function affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The type of treatment required to rectify the impairment may also be relevant. An impairment which can only be corrected by surgery may be more serious than one that can be remedied by bed rest. A comparison of the plaintiff\u2019s abilities and activities before and after the accident may be relevant insofar as it establishes the existence, extent, and duration of an impairment of body function. Additional relevant factors may also be considered in determining seriousness.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">We believe that this approach will not penalize the person who returns to favored work, or reward the malingerer who has little medical basis for his complaints. The effect of the injury on the plaintiff\u2019s body functions is the paramount considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>tion, rather than the effect of the injury on the plaintiff\u2019s (or a hypothetical person\u2019s) life.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The question whether the plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of body function must be submitted to the trier of fact whenever the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the answer. To ensure that the jury fully understands the nature of the threshold inquiry, the jury should be instructed on the following points:</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">1) To recover noneconomic-loss damages, the plaintiff must prove that the injuries he sustained in the motor vehicle accident impaired one or more body functions, and that the impairment of body function was serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">2) In determining whether the impairment of body function was serious, the jury should consider such factors as the extent of the impairment, the particular body function impaired, the length of time the impairment lasted, the treatment required to correct the impairment, and any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>relevant factors. An impairment need not be permanent to be serious.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">X. INJURY MUST BE \"OBJECTIVELY MANIFESTED\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">This requirement stems from the following discussion in <em>Cassidy:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">Another significant aspect of the phrase \"serious impairment of body function\u201d is that it demonstrates the legislative intent to predicate recovery for noneconomic loss on objectively manifested injuries. Recovery for pain and suffering is not predicated on serious pain and suffering, but on injuries that affect the functioning of the body. Leo Cassidy\u2019s injuries were not general aches and pains, but rather two broken bones. [415 Mich 505.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">In <em>Williams v Payne, </em>131 Mich App 403, 409-410; 346 NW2d 564 (1984), the Court of Appeals distinguished objectively manifested injuries from objectively manifested symptoms. After concluding that plaintiff wife\u2019s soft tissue injuries to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>thumb had not seriously impaired any important body function, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">Additionally, Mrs. Williams\u2019 soft tissue injuries were not subject to medical measurement. Thus, they are not \"objectively manifested\u201d in a scientific or medical context. The symptoms of her injuries, however, have found objective manifestation: pain makes certain activities difficult. The <em>Cassidy </em>opinion did not expressly designate which standard of manifestation to employ, objective medical measurements of injury or a patient\u2019s complaints of pain substantiated only by the patient\u2019s limited activities. We conclude that Mrs. Williams\u2019 injuries are not \"objectively manifested\u201d within the meaning of <em>Cassidy. </em>Medically unsubstantiated pain will always be present in a tort action for pain and suffering. The Legislature could not intend so low a threshold for avoiding the no-fault act\u2019s proscription against tort actions. General pain and suffering is not sufficient to meet the threshold. . . . Additionally, the <em>Cassidy </em>decision spoke of \"objectively manifested injuries,\u201d not symptoms. Mrs. Williams\u2019 injuries do not meet the \"objectively manifested\u201d requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Defendants urge us to adopt the <em>Williams </em>Court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Cassidy. </em>They believe that an injury wiiich cannot be directly demonstrated through the use of accepted medical tests or procedures, but must be diagnosed on the basis of the plaintiffs subjective complaints, a physician\u2019s clinical impressions, or the symptoms resulting from the injury, is not objectively manifested. Their reasoning is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">A physical examination yields subjective complaints and objective findings. Subjective complaints are those perceived only by the patient which cannot be otherwise measured, e.g., pain, nausea, and blurred vision. Objective findings are those which the physician can see for himself, e.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>swelling and inflammation. Some procedures involve a combination of subjective complaints and objective findings, e.g., range-of-motion tests, where the doctor manipulates the patient\u2019s body until the patient complains of pain or is unable to move further. Doctors use subjective complaints and objective findings to form clinical impressions and diagnoses. To verify these clinical impressions, the doctor usually orders tests, such as x-rays, arthrograms, CAT-scans, blood tests, and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Defendants argue that the injury itself (e.g., broken bones, torn cartilage, etc.) must either be directly perceivable (i.e., the doctor must be able to see, hear, or touch the injury), or the nature and extent of the injury must be demonstrated through a medically accepted test. Symptoms or effects caused by the injury (e.g., spasms, swelling, and pain) are supposedly insufficient to satisfy <em>Cassidy\u2019s </em>requirement of objectively manifested injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Thus, broken bones seen on x-rays clearly satisfy defendants\u2019 interpretation of <em>Cassidy. </em>However, injuries to soft tissues generally cannot be seen or felt. Seeing or feeling the symptoms of torn or stretched muscles or ligaments (e.g., spasms) is not enough. Nor are plaintiffs subjective complaints of pain or limited motion. Therefore, defendants believe that, in most cases, soft tissue injuries cannot be the basis of a finding that the plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of body function because these injuries are not objectively manifested.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The Court of Appeals has not always accepted this rigid distinction between injuries and symptoms. As a result, panels have disagreed on whether certain manifestations of soft tissue injuries, such as muscle spasms,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> swell<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>ing,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> tenderness,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> and loss of lordosis,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> satisfy <em>Cassidy. </em>Panels have also disagreed as to whether the conclusions drawn from range-of-motion tests are an objective manifestation of an injury. Some panels have summarily disregarded the results of these tests, especially if the plaintiffs x-rays were normal and no neurological problems were discovered.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Other panels have distinguished between \"active\u201d and \"passive\u201d range-of-motion tests. Under this approach, the results of an active test (i.e., a test where the plaintiff moves her body until she feels pain) are not considered an objective manifestation of an injury because the plaintiff can control the test results.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> However, the limitation of movement observed in passive tests is considered an objective manifestation of an injury.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The <em>Williams\u2019 </em>interpretation of <em>Cassidy\u2019s </em>\"objectively manifested injury\u201d language has proved to be an almost insurmountable obstacle to recovery of noneconomic damages in soft tissue injury cases. Judge Ravitz, dissenting in <em>Garris v Vanderlaan, </em>146 Mich App 619, 627-628; 381 NW2d 412 (1985), roundly criticized the <em>Williams </em>Court\u2019s reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>The \"medical measurement\u201d test espoused in <em>Williams </em>is a convenient method for reducing litigation in automobile cases. However, it is not rationally related to the Legislature\u2019s goal of preventing over-compensation for minor injuries. Soft-tissue injuries and psychiatric trauma are difficult or impossible to measure medically. Yet, persons who suffer with these injuries for years would certainly gladly trade places with those who suffer a badly fractured bone and are incapacitated for 6 or 7 months, but who thereafter are able to lead perfectly normal lives. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\"><em>Williams v Payne </em>suggests that the only alternative to the \"medical measurement\u201d test is the use of the \"patient\u2019s complaints of pain substantiated only by the patient\u2019s limited activities.\u201d 131 Mich App 410. Where the ordinary means of diagnosis and prescription of treatment are such subjective indications from a patient, a doctor\u2019s diagnosis of injury should suffice to satisfy the objective manifestation requirement announced in <em>Cassidy. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">... To deny recovery because such injuries are not capable of \"medical measurement\u201d denies compensation to a large class of individuals who suffer a greatly reduced quality of life as a result of automobile accidents. Clearly, the Legislature did not intend such an arbitrary hurdle as that imposed by the \"medical measurement\u201d test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">We agree that <em>Williams </em>misinterpreted <em>Cassidy. </em>The <em>Cassidy </em>Court was concerned that plaintiffs could recover noneconomic damages merely by testifying that they had suffered extreme pain following a motor vehicle accident. Recognizing that the Legislature only permitted recovery for injuries which seriously impair body functions, the Court required plaintiffs to establish that they had suffered such an injury. In other words, plaintiffs must introduce evidence establishing that there is a physical basis for their subjective complaints of pain and suffering. Neither <em>Cassidy </em>nor \u00a7 3135(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>limits recovery of noneconomic damages to plaintiffs whose injuries can be seen or felt.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">As noted in part ix, medical testimony generally will be required to establish the existence, extent, and permanency of the impairment of body function. We disapprove of those cases which have automatically disregarded certain types of evidence merely because it was based upon the plaintiff\u2019s subjective complaints or the symptoms of an injury. An expert\u2019s diagnosis and the basis for it (e.g., the plaintiff\u2019s complaints, the physician\u2019s observations, and test results) can be adequately challenged at trial through cross-examination and the presentation of contrary medical evidence. The \"serious impairment of body function\u201d threshold requires the plaintiff to prove that his noneconomic losses arose out of a medically identifiable injury which seriously impaired a body function. The <em>Cassidy </em>Court required no more than this.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">XI. LIMITED RETROACTIVE APPLICATION OF THIS DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Since several of today\u2019s holdings are new or inconsistent with those articulated in <em>Cassidy, </em>our decision applies to the five cases before us as well as to: (1) currently pending appeals in which an issue concerning the proper interpretation of the statutory phrase \"serious impairment of body function\u201d has been raised, (2) trials in which a jury is instructed after the date of this decision, and (3) cases in which summary disposition enters after the date of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">XII. APPLICATION OF LAW TO CASES</p>\n<p id=\"A_M\">A. <em>DlFRANCO v PICKARD</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s vehicle was struck from behind by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>defendant on May 20, 1978. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital, complaining of pain in his neck, shoulders, and lower back. Plaintiff was given a cervical collar and released with instructions to contact his personal physician if he experienced further problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">On May 24, 1978, plaintiff was examined by a physician. Muscle spasms were observed in plaintiff\u2019s neck and lower back. Active range-of-motion tests indicated a forty- to fifty-percent limitation in lower-back motion, and a thirty- to forty-percent limitation in neck motion. X-rays revealed a decreased lordosis in the cervical (upper) spine, and a mild rotary scoliosis of the thoracic (lower) spine. The physician concluded that these spinal abnormalities were due to muscle spasms, caused by the stretching or tearing of muscles and ligaments, as well as internal bruising. He gave plaintiff a muscle relaxant and a lumbosacral support.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Plaintiff was admitted to the hospital for diagnostic tests, physiotherapy, and traction from June 20 to 24, 1978. No neurological problems were found. Plaintiff continued treatment through July, 1978, and once during July, 1979, for continuing neck and back pain. He reexamined plaintiff on January 17, 1983, shortly before trial. Spasms were detected and x-rays again revealed a decreased cervical lordosis and a mild rotary scoliosis. Degenerative arthritis was also detected in the lower spine, which was secondary to the trauma suffered in the area. Plaintiff\u2019s range of motion had improved, but he still suffered a five-to fifteen-percent loss of neck motion, and a ten- to fifteen-percent loss of lower-back motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s doctor described plaintiff\u2019s condition as chronic. He could neither confirm nor deny the possibility of a disc injury. The doctor noted that plaintiff had previously suffered neck and back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>problems, which had made him more susceptible to injury. However, he believed that plaintiffs current problems were directly related to the auto accident. Hot baths and home traction could relieve plaintiffs pain somewhat, but his arthritis would inevitably progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Plaintiff stated that he was twenty-two years old at the time of the accident and had previously led an active life. He testified as to the continued stiffness and pain in his neck and lower back, the curtailment of most of his sports activities, and the inconveniences he experienced in his daily life. He treated himself frequently with hot baths, heating pads, and massage. He occasionally used a home-traction device when he overexerted himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Plaintiff returned to his job as a hospital x-ray technician two months after the accident, with his doctor\u2019s permission. No work restrictions were imposed, although plaintiff performed lifting activities cautiously. He left this job in October, 1978, to become a service representative for a copying machine company. This job occasionally entailed moving or crawling under large machines. Other than the two-month absence immediately following the accident, plaintiff had not been absent from his job because of his back and neck problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The case was tried shortly after <em>Cassidy </em>was decided. Defendant admitted negligence and did not contest plaintiffs medical evidence. However, he maintained that plaintiff had not suffered a serious impairment of body function. The district court denied motions by plaintiff and defendant for a directed verdict, believing that reasonable minds could differ on the threshold issue. The jury found that defendant\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries, but that plaintiff had not suffered a serious impairment of body function. The Macomb Circuit Court affirmed the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>for defendant. The Court of Appeals denied plaintiffs application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The undisputed medical evidence demonstrated that plaintiff sustained soft tissue injuries to the muscles and ligaments of his neck and back. These injuries impaired two of plaintiffs body functions \u2014the ability to move his neck and lower back. Since the nature and extent of plaintiffs injuries were not disputed, it must be determined if reasonable minds could differ as to whether the impairment was serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">We conclude that the district court properly denied plaintiffs motion for a directed verdict. Plaintiffs overall impairment was not so extensive or long term that all reasonable minds would conclude that it was serious. Although plaintiffs injuries initially impaired his ability to move his lower back by forty to fifty percent, and his neck by thirty to forty percent, his limitations at the time of trial were relatively slight (five to fifteen percent). He was also able to return to work within two months with no medical restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Although it is a closer question, we conclude that the district court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. Plaintiffs initial impairment was substantial, lasted two months, and required traction and physiotherapy. The residual impairment is permanent. Plaintiffs inability to move his lower back will steadily increase as his arthritis progresses. We cannot say that all persons would conclude that plaintiffs impairment was not serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Therefore, the threshold issue was properly submitted to the jury. Since the jury found that plaintiff had not sustained a serious impairment of body function, and this finding is not against the great weight of the evidence, we affirm the judgment for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"A95\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\n<em>B. BURK v WARREN</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\">On June 1, 1976, plaintiff was hit by defendant\u2019s truck as he was traveling thirty miles per hour on his motorcycle. He suffered a fractured right clavicle (collarbone), as well as abrasions and bruises on his hand, knee, and shoulder. Plaintiff was taken to the hospital, treated, and released. The fracture was set by closed reduction. Plaintiff wore a brace cast for four to six weeks, which completely immobilized his right shoulder and arm. The fracture healed properly without complications.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Plaintiff testified that he was able to do very little and could not sleep during the week following the accident. He contacted a family physician, who prescribed medication to ease the pain and help plaintiff sleep. After the cast was removed, plaintiff gradually resumed most of his physical activities, including jogging, tennis, and yard work. However, he still experienced pain when he engaged in certain activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s physician testified that clavicle fractures generally do not cause future problems, although the patient may suffer occasional slight pain several months after the injury healed. The brace cast prevented plaintiff from using his right shoulder and arm. When he examined plaintiff six weeks after the accident, the fracture had healed and there was no tenderness at the fracture site. Plaintiff still experienced some pain and had a slight protuberance on his collarbone, but these were normal conditions which would subside. No restrictions were placed on plaintiff\u2019s activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The case was tried in September, 1979. Neither party moved for a directed verdict. The jury found that defendant was negligent and had proximately caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries. However, the jury con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>eluded that plaintiffs injuries did not cause a serious impairment of body function. Plaintiff moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial, claiming that he had sustained a serious impairment of body function as a matter of law. The Ingham Circuit Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The Court of Appeals found that for the relatively short period of time plaintiff was convalescing, the use of his arm and shoulder was greatly reduced. The Court refused to impose a requirement that the serious impairment be permanent or lengthy. It also noted that the no-fault statute is remedial and should be liberally construed in favor of accident victims. The Court concluded that plaintiff had sustained a serious impairment of body function as a matter of law. 105 Mich App 556; 307 NW2d 89 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal was held in abeyance pending this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cassidy. </em>The case was thereafter remanded to the circuit court with instructions to proceed in the manner outlined in <em>Cassidy. 417 </em>Mich 959 (1983). The circuit court found, as a matter of law, that plaintiff had suffered a serious impairment of body function. It awarded $3000 in damages plus costs, interest, and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">On appeal, a different Court of Appeals panel found that the injury was objectively manifested and that the functioning of the shoulder and arm is an important body function. However, the Court noted that plaintiff could use his right hand and had no trouble eating. He did not sustain a compound fracture and wore a brace cast for only one month. Moreover, there was no permanent or long-range effect from the injury. The second panel concluded that plaintiff had not suffered a serious impairment as a matter of law. 137 Mich App 715; 359 NW2d 541 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>The undisputed evidence established that plaintiff suffered an injury which prevented him from moving or using his right shoulder and arm. This total impairment of body function lasted four to six weeks. As evidenced by the disparate results reached by the Court of Appeals, however, reasonable minds could differ as to whether plaintiffs impairment <em>overall </em>was serious. As the first panel noted, a fractured clavicle is a relatively common injury, which generally requires only a brace cast and heals with few complications. Plaintiff in fact healed quickly and suffered no permanent residual impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">We conclude that the case was properly submitted to the jury. Since the jury\u2019s finding that plaintiff did not sustain a serious impairment was not against the great weight of the evidence, it should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">C. <em>PAUPORE vROUSE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Plaintiff was a passenger in a car owned by defendant Betty Rouse and driven by her son, Gerald Rouse, when it was involved in a serious one-car accident on September 11, 1980. Plaintiff sustained a severe fracture of his right and left lower jaw, and a displaced wisdom tooth. Plaintiff presented several doctors at his April, 1983, trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">David Howard, D.D.S., testified that he examined plaintiff at the hospital shortly after the accident. Plaintiff was hospitalized for six days. During this period, plaintiffs wisdom tooth was surgically removed from his throat and the broken portions of his jaw were repositioned and wired together. Arch bars were inserted onto plaintiffs teeth and his mouth was wired together. The swelling from the surgery made eating and talking difficult for one week. Thereafter, plaintiff could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>speak and consume a liquid diet relatively well, although he could not chew.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Dr. Howard unwired plaintiffs mouth on October 23, 1980, but left the arch supports in place. Plaintiff\u2019s mouth was rewired one week later because of some movement at the fracture site. The wires were permanently removed on December 22, 1980. Dr. Howard stated that plaintiff\u2019s jaw had healed satisfactorily.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Because plaintiff could not adequately clean his mouth while it was wired, an infection developed where the wisdom tooth had been displaced. Three other wisdom teeth had to be extracted, one surgically. Dr. Howard acknowledged that these teeth might have needed to be removed regardless of the accident. Since wisdom teeth are nonfunctional, their removal did not interfere with the functioning of plaintiffs mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Stephen Beeker, D.D.S., testified that he examined plaintiff in 1981 after his jaw had healed. Because plaintiff\u2019s teeth did not fit together properly, he recommended comprehensive orthodontic treatment, which could include further surgery on the jaw. The active phase of treatment would last eighteen to twenty-four months. (Plaintiff did not undergo this treatment.) Dr. Beeker believed that earlier injuries to plaintiff\u2019s jaw might have caused some malocclusion, but the problem became more evident to plaintiff after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Because of fluid build-up behind the eardrums, plaintiff temporarily lost thirty percent of his hearing. When Dr. Denton Nelson examined plaintiff on December 15,1980, he recommended conservative treatment, i.e., decongestant nasal sprays and attempts to inflate air into the ears. By January 19, 1981, Dr. Nelson suggested making incisions into the eardrums and inserting tubes to permit drainage. By February 4, 1981, the problem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>with the left ear had cleared. Dr. Nelson decided not to perform surgery on the right ear. Plaintiff did not return for further treatment. On cross-examination, defendant attempted to show that the fluid build-up could have been caused by problems not related to the accident. Nevertheless, Dr. Nelson believed that plaintiff\u2019s hearing loss was related to the trauma of the fractured jaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Plaintiff testified that he lost fifteen to twenty pounds due to his liquid diet. His jaw was swollen for almost one month. To reduce the pain, he consumed three bottles of codeine elixir. He continued to experience occasional pain in his mouth, ears, and back.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Defendants presented Brenda Moyer, a friend with whom plaintiff resided for one and one-half months after he was released from the hospital. She testified that plaintiff\u2019s life style did not change significantly after the accident. He worked on his van, danced, and drank at a local bar shortly after he was discharged from the hospital, and spent much of his time at the beach. Plaintiff could talk and sing with his mouth wired together and did not appear to be in pain. Ms. Moyer acknowledged that plaintiff took pain medication during this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Plaintiff moved for a directed verdict on the issues of negligence, proximate cause, and serious impairment. The Grand Traverse Circuit Court denied the motion because a material factual dispute existed. The jury found that Gerald Rouse had been negligent and that his negligence had proximately caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries. However, the jury concluded that plaintiff had not suffered a serious impairment of body function or permanent serious disfigurement.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>defendants.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to defendants, the Court found that there was a material factual dispute as to the nature and extent of plaintiffs injuries which precluded a directed verdict on the serious impairment issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Contrary to the Court of Appeals conclusion, the nature and extent of plaintiffs injuries were not disputed. The undisputed evidence showed that plaintiff had sustained a fractured jaw, ultimately lost four wisdom teeth, experienced temporary hearing difficulties, and had some residual misalignment of his teeth. Defendants argued that the loss of three teeth, the malocclusion, and hearing problems were not proximately caused by the accident. For purposes of deciding the motion for directed verdict, defendants\u2019 argument must be accepted. Nevertheless, the cause of plaintiffs fractured jaw, the treatment required to set it, and the limitations on plaintiffs ability to use his mouth were not disputed. Surgery was required to set the jaw, and plaintiff\u2019s mouth was wired together for nearly three months. He could not chew, lost twenty pounds because of the liquid diet, and could talk only through clenched teeth. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to defendants, plaintiff clearly suffered an impairment of body function \u2014 the ability to use his mouth for eating and speaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Nevertheless, the trial court properly denied plaintiffs motion for directed verdict because reasonable minds could differ on whether the impairment was serious. Plaintiff was able to eat, drink, and talk while his mouth was wired. The fracture healed satisfactorily within three to four months. Assuming that plaintiffs malocclusion was caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>by his prior injuries, there was no residual impairment of mouth function. Since the jury\u2019s finding that plaintiff had not suffered a serious impairment of body function was not against the great weight of the evidence, it should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">We note that plaintiffs ability to work on his van, go to the beach, and dance at a local bar after the accident was not relevant to the question whether he had sustained a serious impairment of his mouth function. Unlike the \"general ability to live a normal life\u201d test, the focus of the threshold inquiry must be on the extent a particular body function was impaired, not on how the impairment affected plaintiffs daily life.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\n<em>D. KUCERA v NORTON</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">On October 24, 1980, defendant struck plaintiffs truck from the rear. Plaintiff was thrown forward by the impact into the steering wheel. In addition, the rear window of the cab popped out and hit plaintiffs head. Plaintiff drove home, but went to a hospital several hours later because of sharp pains in his neck and back. He was x-rayed, given muscle relaxants, and released. Plaintiff rested during the ensuing weekend and returned to work the following Monday.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Plaintiff testified that he repaired pumps, wells, and motors for a well drilling company. This job often entailed lifting pumps weighing 60 to 120 pounds. Since the accident, plaintiff was restricted from lifting objects weighing over thirty to thirty-five pounds. To accommodate this restriction, plaintiff\u2019s employer provided helpers to do heavy lifting. Plaintiff acknowledged that he had missed very little work because of his injuries. He maintained that he went to work even when his back hurt. He continued to experience pain in his neck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>and between his shoulder blades. He explained how the injury prevented him from pursuing his prior recreational activities (skiing, snowmobiling, and hunting) and curtailed several other activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Plaintiff was examined by a chiropractor one month after the accident. He testified that plaintiff complained of chest pain, an inability to breathe deeply, and pain between the shoulder blades. Muscle spasms were observed. X-rays taken on the date of the accident, plaintiff\u2019s initial visit (November 18, 1980), and the date of trial (February 28, 1983) revealed a subluxation (i.e., partial dislocation) of the sixth thoracic vertebra and scoliosis. The chiropractor stated that these abnormalities were the result of plaintiff\u2019s impact with the steering wheel, which caused the ligaments and muscles holding the vertebrae in place to be stretched and torn. The injuries were such that the ligaments and muscles would not be able to resume their normal function.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Initially, plaintiff received chiropractic treatment every other day for six to eight weeks. Plaintiff was advised to take time off work, not stand on his feet for more than four hours per day, and not lift more than twenty-five pounds. Subsequent treatments were less frequent, although plaintiff was still being treated at least once every two weeks. Plaintiff generally sought help when he had difficulty breathing and experienced spasms in the midthoracic region. This generally occurred whenever plaintiff lifted heavier objects. It was the opinion of plaintiff\u2019s chiropractor that plaintiff\u2019s lifting restriction would be permanent and that he would need chiropractic treatment for the rest of his life. Ultimately, his condition would degenerate and arthritis would develop.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Defendant\u2019s medical expert presented an entirely different story. His examination of plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>on February 11, 1982, uncovered no evidence of spasm, nerve damage, fracture, or disc disease. Plaintiffs range of motion was not limited. This doctor detected an asymmetry of plaintiffs chest which could cause back pain. However, he did not believe that this condition was causally related to the accident. Defendant\u2019s expert found no condition which warranted chiropractic treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the threshold issue was taken under advisement. The jury found in plaintiffs favor and awarded $10,000 in damages. Defendant immediately moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Likening plaintiffs injuries to those described in <em>Hermann v Haney, </em>the Grand Traverse Circuit Court concluded that plaintiff had not sustained a serious impairment of body function as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment for defendant. It found that the use of the back in lifting is an important body function, but that plaintiff had not sustained a serious impairment. The Court noted that plaintiff had missed very little work, was given a helper, and had not suffered any loss of wages or earning capability. Although plaintiffs social activities had been hindered, the injury was not akin to death or permanent serious disfigurement. The panel questioned whether plaintiffs injuries were objectively manifested, but did not decide the issue because the impairment was not serious. 140 Mich App 156; 363 NW2d 11 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Unlike the other cases before this Court, a factual dispute existed as to the nature and extent of plaintiffs injuries. This dispute warranted sending the threshold issue to the jury, unless it can be said that defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff. Plaintiffs medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>evidence established that he had suffered a soft tissue injury to his back, which prevented him from lifting more than thirty-five pounds or engaging in certain activities. Thus, plaintiff\u2019s injury impaired a body function \u2014 the ability to use his back in lifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">As to whether the impairment was serious, reasonable minds could differ on the basis of plaintiff\u2019s evidence. Plaintiff was previously able to lift at least 120 pounds unassisted. According to plaintiff\u2019s expert, this seventy-percent impairment of lifting ability is a permanent condition which will gradually deteriorate. Chiropractic treatment will probably be necessary for the rest of plaintiff\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Therefore, the circuit court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Since the jury\u2019s finding that plaintiff sustained a serious impairment of body function is not against the great weight of the evidence, the verdict for plaintiff must be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">The Court of Appeals incorrectly focused on plaintiff\u2019s lack of absenteeism and wage loss. The fact that plaintiff continued to work despite the pain, and that his employer provided a helper, does not negate the fact that plaintiff\u2019s back function was significantly impaired. The Court of Appeals reasoning would penalize persons who returned to favored work. The Court should have focused instead on the extent and permanency of plaintiff\u2019s impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">\n<em>E. ROUTLEY v VAULT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">On June 25, 1980, plaintiff was driving a tractor-trailer when he struck defendant\u2019s car from the rear. (The parties disputed whose negligence caused the accident.) Plaintiff was thrown about the passenger compartment, but maintained his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>grip on the steering wheel. As a result, he sustained a bilateral inguinal hernia.</p>\n<p id=\"A5_\">Plaintiff first sought medical help on July 7, 1980. In his deposition, plaintiff\u2019s doctor stated that plaintiff\u2019s chief complaint was pain in his left groin, which radiated into the left thigh.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> A small inguinal impulse was discovered and plaintiff was advised not to work. When plaintiff was reexamined one week later, the impulse was more prominent. The doctor concluded that plaintiff had sustained a hernia as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Surgery was performed on July 24, 1980, to repair the hernia. Plaintiff was hospitalized for five days. Although plaintiff initially obtained some relief, he again experienced pain due to scar tissue surrounding the ilioinguinal nerve. A second operation was performed on April 2, 1981, to remove the scar tissue. Plaintiff was discharged from the hospital five days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Plaintiff experienced pain soon after the second operation. His doctor opined that the pain could be caused by scar tissue from the second operation irritating a nerve. However, he did not contemplate performing further surgery. He suggested that plaintiff gradually return to his normal activities, as long as they did not involve lifting more than thirty to forty pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In his deposition, plaintiff stated that he suffered constant pain, which intensified when he performed many physical activities. Operating heavy equipment caused pain in his back, groin, and legs. He could not stand on his feet for eight hours. Lifting a gallon of milk or climbing a flight of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>stairs caused severe pain. He could not perforin household chores or pursue his prior recreational activities. The pain also interfered with his ability to engage in sexual relations and to play with his children. Plaintiff believed that he could perform sedentary work, but could not return to his logging job.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The circuit court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the threshold issue. Although plaintiff had undergone two operations, the court believed that the Legislature and <em>Cassidy </em>Court would not view a hernia as a serious impairment of body function.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The Court of Appeals affirmed in a two-to-one decision. The majority observed that plaintiff\u2019s ability to walk and lift was somewhat restricted. However, he was not incapacitated for an extended period of time or prohibited from engaging in his normal daily activities. In fact, plaintiff. was encouraged by his doctor after the . second operation to return to employment which did not involve heavy lifting. The majority declined to consider the fact that plaintiff\u2019s logging job involved some heavy lifting. 140 Mich App 190, 195; 363 NW2d 450 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">In his dissent, Judge Kelly argued that summary judgment was improper because reasonable minds could differ as to the seriousness of the impairment when the evidence was viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff. He noted that plaintiff still suffered chronic pain as a result of the two operations. Although plaintiff\u2019s physician encouraged him to return gradually to his normal level of activity, plaintiff had not accomplished this goal. In addition, reasonable minds could differ on whether plaintiff\u2019s injury restricted his ability to walk and lift. <em>Id., p 196.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">We concur with Judge Kelly\u2019s reasoning. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>undisputed that plaintiff suffered a hernia due to the accident, underwent two operations, and was hospitalized for nearly two weeks. Plaintiff\u2019s ability to walk and lift is impaired by the residual effects of the surgery. Thus, plaintiff suffered an injury which impaired body functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">On the basis of the evidence contained in the depositions of plaintiff and his treating physician, reasonable minds could differ on whether the impairment of body function was serious. Plaintiff cannot lift more than thirty to forty pounds, and has experienced severe pain lifting a gallon of milk. Although plaintiff did not state how much weight he could lift prior to the accident, his prior employment undoubtedly required him to lift more than forty pounds. Plaintiff also experienced severe pain after climbing stairs, standing on his feet for long periods, and engaging in certain activities. Plaintiff\u2019s doctor did not foresee the need for further surgery, but he did not state that plaintiff\u2019s condition would substantially improve in the near future. The fact that plaintiff underwent, and recuperated from, two operations performed under general anesthesia also weighs in favor of finding a serious impairment. Summary judgment for defendant was therefore inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">XIII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Without further guidance from the Legislature, we believe that the factfinder is better able to determine whether the plaintiff sustained a serious impairment of body function in those cases where reasonable minds could differ on the answer. In each of the instant cases, the threshold issue should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">In <em>DiFranco, </em>the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>In <em>Burk, </em>the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">In <em>Paupore, </em>the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In <em>Kucera, </em>the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

We have not adopted the <em>Hermann </em>Court\u2019s reasoning verbatim because it tends to focus on the seriousness of the <em>injuries, </em>rather than the seriousness of the <em>impairment </em>of body function caused by the injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b121-9\"> New York courts employ a similar analysis in determining what constitutes a \"significant limitation of use of a body function or system.\u201d In <em>Licari v Elliott, </em>n 32 <em>supra, </em>p 235, plaintiff sustained a concussion, acute cervical sprain, acute dorsal lumbar sprain, and chest contusion. He was initially examined at a hospital for two hours, but was readmitted two days later for further tests. One doctor testified that plaintiff had suffered only \"a very mild limitation\u201d of back and neck movement. Plaintiff returned to his job as a cab driver twenty-four days after the accident. He testified that he could not help fares with their luggage or his wife with certain household tasks. He also suffered from occasional headaches and dizziness, which were relieved by aspirin.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">The New York Court of Appeals held that plaintiff had offered no evidence as to the extent of the limitation of movement. At most, plaintiff established that he had suffered a painful sprain, which limited his back and neck motion somewhat. There was no evidence that his injuries had caused a significant limitation of body function. The court focused primarily on the lack of medical testimony as to the extent of plaintiff\u2019s limitations, rather than the way the injuries had inconvenienced him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b122-8\"> These jury instructions are substantially more detailed than those contained in SJI2d 36.01:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">The law in Michigan provides that plaintiff may recover (noneconomic loss) damages in this case if he suffered serious impairment of body function.

Four years after this Court issued its opinion in <em>Cassidy v McGovern, </em>415 Mich 483; 330 NW2d 22 (1982), the majority sees fit to overrule the decision of five members \u00f3f a six-member court and adopt the position of the dissent in that case. I cannot accept the premise that such action assists the bench and bar in construing the phrase, \"serious impairment of body function\u201d or is conducive to the progress of orderly jurisprudence in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">Even in view of the short shrift given to the doctrine of stare decisis, I might be inclined to sign the majority opinion if I were persuaded that it corrected an earlier misinterpretation of the will of the Legislature. I cannot reach that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">The principal conclusions of the majority, with which I disagree, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-11\">1) The question whether the plaintiff suffered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>serious impairment of body function must be submitted to the trier of fact whenever the evidence would cause reasonable minds to differ as to the answer. This is true even where there is no material factual dispute as to the nature and extent of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-4\">4) The impairment need not be ... of an important body function.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">5) The \"general ability to live a normal life\u201d test will no longer be used to determine whether the plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of body function. <em>[Ante, </em>pp 38-39.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">As to the first conclusion, there appears to be no compelling reason to depart from the normal rule that the judge construes the law and the jury decides on the facts. The proposition that \"[t]he question whether the plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of body function must be submitted to the trier of fact whenever the evidence would cause reasonable minds to differ as to the answer\u201d even where there is no material dispute of fact sidesteps the very reason for which this Court granted leave to appeal in these cases. These cases were taken in an effort to give the bench and bar further definition of the legislative phrase, \"serious impairment of body function.\u201d The majority itself recognizes the need for further definition, and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">By choosing two rather amorphous thresholds, the Legislature apparently preferred that the parameters of \u00a7 3135(1) be developed through the judicial process. <em>[Ante, </em>p 48.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Rather than using <em>Cassidy </em>as a starting point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>for the further development of a working definition of serious impairment of body function, the majority eliminates the aids to construction adopted by the Court in that case, without substituting any similar aids. Henceforth, decisions as to what constitutes a serious impairment of body function will be rendered by juries and no body of law will have been or will be created in the future to aid the bench and bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Even if we were to accept the majority\u2019s conclusion that the meaning of the phrase shall now be left to the jury, the jury will still have to be instructed in its duty to interpret the phrase. The majority does nothing to guide the trial courts in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The meaning of the \u00a7 3135 language is a matter of statutory construction. It is a well-settled principle of law that statutory construction is a matter for the courts and not for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Second, I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Legislature did not intend to limit recovery of noneconomic damages to the catastrophically injured. The majority\u2019s recitation of the legislative history demonstrates that the lawmakers rejected language which would perhaps have raised the threshold so high that only the catastrophically injured could successfully overcome it. The quoted comments of Representatives Clark and Crampton <em>(ante, </em>pp 44, 45), however, indicate that those legislators, at least, believed that the threshold, as it was finally drafted, was still a substantial obstacle to suit. In my opinion, <em>Cassidy </em>was consistent with this history in limiting recovery to those suffering serious impairment of <em>important </em>body functions, and in its holding that Leo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Cassidy, who suffered complete breaks of both bones in his lower leg, wore casts for seven months and was almost completely recovered after one and one-half years, did indeed suffer a \"serious impairment of body function\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Therefore, I can see no reason to discard the <em>Cassidy </em>rule that \"serious impairment of body function\u201d contemplates the impairment of an important body function. In the statutory language, \"serious impairment of body function\u201d appears with the other threshold requirements of \"permanent serious disfigurement\u201d and \"death,\u201d leaving the strong implication, under the rule of ejusdem generis, that while the impairment need not be permanent or fatal, it was not to be transient or trivial either.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">While perhaps not definitive by itself, the legislators\u2019 use of the words, \"serious impairment of body function\u201d rather than \"serious impairment of a body function\u201d helps persuade me of the correctness of the <em>Cassidy </em>Court\u2019s conclusion that the legislators did not mean serious impairment of <em>any </em>body function.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">As to the \"general ability to live a normal life\u201d test, while I do not regard it as exclusively definitive, I do regard it as useful. The question is whether there has been a serious impairment of body function. Medically there are scientific tests to measure this. But there are practical tests that may also be useful. A person\u2019s ability to walk, talk, lift, and perform normal daily activities is an important consideration in determining the seri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>ousness of an injury. While these matters in many cases depend upon the credibility of the plaintiff, judges and juries resolve questions of credibility every day.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">GENERAL CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">In conclusion, while I agree with the results in each of these cases, I would hold, consistently with <em>Cassidy, </em>that where there is no factual dispute regarding the extent of a plaintiff\u2019s injuries the court is to decide as a matter of statutory construction whether plaintiff has suffered a serious impairment of body function. Where there is a factual dispute which straddles the line demarcating those injuries which constitute serious impairment of body function, and those which do not, the factual dispute is to be submitted to the jury which should be instructed that, if it finds the facts to be as the plaintiff claims, it must also find a serious impairment of body function.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Therefore, in <em>DiFranco, Burk, </em>and <em>Paupore, </em>in which juries found no serious impairment, I agree with the results, but hold that the trial courts should have found no serious impairment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">In <em>Kucera </em>and <em>Routley </em>the factual disputes, in my view, \"straddled the line\u201d and therefore presented jury questions. In <em>Kucera, </em>the jury resolved the dispute in plaintiff\u2019s favor. The trial court, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict to defendant. While the trial judge was correct in assuming the duty to determine whether the plaintiffs claimed injuries constituted a serious impairment, I agree that the court\u2019s conclusion was in error and the jury\u2019s verdict should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>In <em>Routley, </em>the trial court granted summary judgment for the defendant. In my view, plaintiffs complaint that the accident caused a continuing disability in which lifting a gallon of milk or climbing a flight of stairs resulted in severe pain, if believed by a jury, described a serious impairment of body function. I therefore agree that summary judgment was inappropriate. When the matter is tried, it is my view that the jury should be instructed that, if it finds the facts to be as plaintiff, contends, it must find a serious impairment of body function.</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-4\">Riley, J., concurred with Williams, C.J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b149-5\">Levin, J. I concur with Chief Justice Williams for the reasons stated in part l of his opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-7\"> Therefore, I find it difficult to agree with the majority\u2019s statement <em>(ante, </em>p 65) that \"the relevant inquiries are whether the injury impaired <em>a </em>body function and, if so, whether that impairment was serious.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
