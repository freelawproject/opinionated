The requirements of the zoning ordinance are either reasonable standards designed to assure favorable comparison of mobile homes with site-built housing or constitute a reasonable exercise of police power for the protection of the public. Moreover, the zoning ordinance does not preclude other reasonable uses of the land. Plaintiff cannot establish a confiscation by simply showing a disparity in value between uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">We further hold that by virtue of expenditures in the development of the land as a residential subdivision, plaintiff has not established a tangible change by way of preparation for the actual use of the property as a single-wide mobile home plat. The property, as developed, is suitable for site-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>built, double-wide, and single-wide mobile homes. Although approximately one-fourth of the back lots in the plat are occupied by single-wide mobile homes, an apparent use of the property as a single-wide mobile home plat has not been established when the remaining back lots could be used for site-built or mobile homes at the plaintiff\u2019s option.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Finally, we hold that the federal and state laws do not preempt portions of the zoning ordinance. The zoning ordinance regulates the location and conditions of mobile home placement and therefore does not conflict with the construction and industry regulations set forth by the federal and state laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Accordingly, the decisions of the trial court and the Court of Appeals upholding the zoning ordinance are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The plaintiff platted approximately twenty acres of a 103-acre tract along the northwest shore of Payne Lake. This plat, \"Gackler\u2019s Payne Lake Plat,\u201d was approved by the township and consists of fifty-four lots. The zoning in effect at that time permitted mobile, prefabricated, and site-built homes on the lots. After the plat was approved, restrictions were recorded excluding mobile homes from the twelve lots which bordered the lake. Through 1972, eleven single-wide mobile homes had moved onto the back lots in the plat.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">In 1972, the defendant township enacted a zoning ordinance which restricted mobile homes to mobile home parks. Pursuant to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Robinson Twp v Knoll, </em>410 Mich 293; 302 NW2d 146 (1981), the township amended its zoning ordinance to permit mobile homes meeting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>definition of \"dwelling\u201d in any zoning classification where site-built or modular single family residences were allowed. \"Dwelling\u201d was defined in the zoning ordinance as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">1. It complies with the minimum square footage requirements [720 square feet].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">2. It has a minimum width along any exterior side elevation of 24 feet and a minimum internal height of seven and one-half feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">3. It is firmly attached to a solid foundation constructed on the site in accordance with the township building code, which shall be a fully enclosed basement or crawl space ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">4. It does not have exposed wheels, towing mechanisms, undercarriage or chassis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-10\">5. The dwelling is connected to a public sewer and water supply or to such private facilities approved by the local health department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-11\">6. The dwelling contains storage area(s) either in a basement located under said dwelling, in an attic area, in a closet area or in a separate fully enclosed structure on the site, . . . equal to not less than 15% of the interior living area of the dwelling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-12\">7. The dwelling is aesthetically compatible in design and appearance to conventionally on-site constructed homes ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-13\">8. The dwelling contains no additions of rooms or other areas which are not constructed with similar materials and are similar in appearance and with similar quality of workmanship as in the original structure ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-14\">9. The dwelling complies with all pertinent building and fire codes . . . .[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] [138 Mich App 1, 7-8; 359 NW2d 226 (1984).]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>The effect of this ordinance was to exclude single-wide mobile homes from placement on plaintiff\u2019s lots unless the foregoing requirements were met. The plaintiff challenged this portion of the zoning ordinance as unconstitutional on its face and as applied to plaintiff, and because it was preempted in part by state and federal law. Plaintiff also averred that it had established a prior nonconforming use in the property as a single-wide mobile home plat. Following a bench trial, the trial court upheld the ordinance as to these requirements and rejected plaintiff\u2019s claim that it had established a nonconforming use. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">I. IS THE ZONING ORDINANCE CONSTITUTIONAL ON ITS FACE AND AS APPLIED TO PLAINTIFF?</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Plaintiff contends that the township zoning ordinance is unconstitutional on its face because it operates to exclude all single-wide mobile homes from areas other than mobile-home parks. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In <em>Robinson Twp v Knoll, supra, </em>310, this Court held that \"[t]he per se exclusion of mobile homes from all areas not designated as mobile-home parks has no reasonable basis under the police power, and is therefore unconstitutional.\u201d We also held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">[A] municipality need not permit all mobile homes, regardless of size, appearance, quality of manufacture or manner of on-site installation, to be placed in all residential neighborhoods. A mobile home may be excluded if it fails to satisfy reasonable standards designed to assure favorable comparison of mobile homes with site-built housing which would be permitted on the site, and not merely because it is a mobile home. [Id.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The requirements for a \"dwelling\u201d within the definition of the zoning ordinance are set forth in the facts stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">We initially note that these regulations do not treat mobile homes materially different than site-built homes. We further find that the requirements, as stated, are either reasonable standards designed to assure favorable comparison of mobile homes with site-built housing, or constitute a reasonable exercise of police power for the protection of the safety, health, morals, prosperity, comfort, convenience, and welfare of the public or a substantial part of the public. <em>Robinson Twp, supra, </em>312.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Nor are we persuaded that the zoning ordinance is unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff. We believe the trial court properly summarized the plaintiff\u2019s argument in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">The thrust of plaintiffs argument is that because there are already existing on the land in question as nonconforming uses 11 mobile homes, any ordinance that prevents the placing of similar mobile homes on the remaining lots is unreasonable. The reasons for this conclusion are that (1) because mobile homes are situated on the plat in question that are nonconforming, aesthetics cannot be a proper concern of the township, at least in regard to the requirement that dwellings have an interior ceiling height of <em>IV2 </em>feet, and an external width of 24 feet, and (2) that because there is no indication that any of the existing mobile homes will be vacating, it is not reasonable for the township to continue to classify these homes as nonconforming uses, which must be replaced with conforming uses when their useful life is over, and to require conforming uses on the as yet unsold lots. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">Plaintiff [further] argues that (1) the ordinance restricts a reasonable use of the land (that being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>used as a site for placing mobile homes thereon) and (2) plaintiff cannot sell the remaining plots at the price he is asking for any use other than mobile home sites because no one will want to purchase land to build next to mobile homes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The following principles of law are applicable to plaintiffs claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">The plaintiff must show:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">\"[F]irst, that there is no reasonable governmental interest being advanced by the present zoning classification itself ... or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq_\">\"[S]econdly, that an ordinance may be unreasonable because of the purely arbitrary, capricious and unfounded exclusion of other types of legitimate land use from the area in question.\u201d <em>[Kirk v Tyrone </em>Twp, 398 Mich 429, 434; 247 NW2d 848 (1976).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">There are four rules for applying these principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">1. \" '[T]he ordinance comes to us clothed with every presumption of validity.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">2. \" '[I]t is the burden of the party attacking to prove affirmatively that the ordinance is an arbitrary and unreasonable restriction upon the owner\u2019s use of his property .... It must appear that the clause attacked is an arbitrary fiat, a whimsical <em>ipse dixit, </em>and that there is no room for a legitimate difference of opinion concerning its reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-11\">3. \"Michigan has adopted the view that to sustain an attack on a zoning ordinance, an aggrieved property owner must show that if the ordinance is enforced the consequent restrictions on his property preclude its use for any purposes to which it is reasonably adapted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-12\">4. \" 'This Court, however, is inclined to give considerable weight to the findings of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>judge in equity cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Kirk, supra, </em>439-440. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">We disagree with plaintiff that the existence of eleven single-wide homes in the plat renders the ordinance unreasonable to plaintiff. Notwithstanding the eleven mobile homes, the zoning ordinance will improve the aesthetics of the area, thereby advancing a reasonable government interest. Moreover, the state may properly provide for the limitation and eventual elimination of a nonconforming use in order to advance the goals of the zoning plan. <em>Austin v Older, </em>283 Mich 667, 676; 278 NW 727 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">We also conclude that plaintiff has not carried its burden of establishing that if the ordinance is enforced, any purpose to which the land is reasonably adapted is precluded. As the trial court found, \"the ordinance did not deprive plaintiff of other uses of his land, since the evidence indicated that the vacant lots would sell for conventional or modular home occupancy if the asking price was realistic and if screening was provided for the existing mobile homes.\u201d We further agree with the Court of Appeals that plaintiff cannot establish a confiscation by simply showing a disparity in value between uses. <em>Brae Burn, Inc v Bloomfield Hills, </em>350 Mich 425; 86 NW2d 166 (1957); <em>Kirk v Tyrone Twp, </em>398 Mich 429; 247 NW2d 848 (1976). Justice Smith pointed out in <em>Brae Burn, Inc </em>v <em>Bloomfield Hills, supra, </em>433-434:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">Disparity in values between residential and commercial uses will always exist. ... If such a showing serves to invalidate an ordinance the efforts of our people to determine their living conditions will be hopeless. To avoid \"confiscation\u201d in this sense (the obtaining of the highest dollar for one particular lot) will result in confiscation of far greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>scope in property values in the municipality as a whole due to its inability to control its growth and development.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">We stress that this is not a situation where the property is unsuitable for the uses allowed by the zoning ordinance and has little or no value if so restricted. Compare <em>Fenner v Muskegon, </em>331 Mich 732; 50 NW2d 210 (1951). Therefore, the issue of confiscation is not properly before us. See <em>Brae Burn, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In summary, we find that plaintiff has not established that the zoning is unconstitutional either on its face or as applied to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">II. HAS PLAINTIFF ESTABLISHED A NONCONFORMING USE IN THE PROPERTY AS A SINGLE-WIDE MOBILE HOME PLAT?</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Plaintiff asserts that it has established a vested nonconforming use as a mobile home plat in advance of the existence of the zoning ordinance, by virtue of the following facts: (1) a road was constructed, (2) the plat was surveyed and monuments were erected, (3) grading and excavation work was completed, and (4) eleven mobile homes were installed. Plaintiff further argues that the plat must be viewed as a whole and that, when so viewed, the pattern of development of the plat as a mobile home plat was well-established prior to the enactment of the zoning ordinance. Even viewing the plat as a whole, we are not so persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">A claim to a prior nonconforming use does not test the reasonableness of a zoning ordinance. \"A prior nonconforming use is a vested right to continue the lawful use of real estate in the manner it was used prior to the adoption of a zoning ordinance.\u201d <em>Dusdal v City of Warren, </em>387 Mich 354, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>359; 196 NW2d 778 (1972). A zoning ordinance cannot operate to oust the property owner of his vested right even though the ordinance is reasonable. <em>Id. </em>\"An ordinance requiring immediate cessation of a nonconforming use may be held to be unconstitutional because it brings about a deprivation of property rights out of proportion to the public benefit obtained . . . <em>Austin v Older, supra, </em>676. However, an ordinance prohibiting the enlargement of a nonconforming use is not subject to the same challenge. <em>Id. </em>This more limiting restriction is within the police power of the state and has for its purpose the elimination of the inconsistency brought to bear by the nonconforming use in a zoning classification. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">To establish a nonconforming use, \"there must be work of a 'substantial character\u2019 done by way of preparation for an actual use of the premises.\u201d <em>Bloomfield Twp v Beardslee, </em>349 Mich 296, 307; 84 NW2d 537 (1957). The actual use which is nonconforming must be apparent and manifested by a tangible change in the land, as opposed to intended or contemplated by the property owner. In this regard, preliminary operations such as order<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>ing plans, surveying the land, and the removal of old buildings are insufficient to establish a nonconforming use. <em>Id.; Lansing v Dawley, </em>247 Mich 394, 397; 225 NW 500 (1929). The test in each case is not whether a little or a lot has been spent in reliance upon the past zoning classifications, but, rather, \" 'whether there has been any tangible change in the land itself by excavation and construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">In the case at bar, the dissent would hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">[T]he subdivision development should be viewed as a whole, as a structure only part of which had been completed, analogous to a building that is partially completed or to a nonconforming use that is established in a portion but not in all of a building before an amendment to a zoning ordinance rendering such structure or use nonconforming. It has been said that \"the extension of the nonconforming use is permissible if the design of the building indicates that at the time of the passage of the zoning restriction it was intended that the building be dedicated in its entirety to such use.\u201d <em>[Post, </em>p 587, quoting 8A McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d rev ed), \u00a7 5.208, p 118.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">We find this analogy inapposite. This is not a situation where construction of a project before completion is halted by the enactment of a zoning ordinance and to disallow completion of the project would work a clear injustice. Compare <em>Eklund v Clackamas Co, </em>36 Or App 73, 82; 583 P2d 567 (1978). In this case, development of the plat is virtually complete save for sewer and water hookups on the back lots which have no bearing on whether the land will be used for \"dwellings\u201d under the ordinance or as a single-wide mobile home plat. Moreover, it is undisputed that the improvements to the property have made the lots as suitable for \"dwellings\u201d under the ordinance as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>they are for single-wide mobile homes. Further, on twelve of the lots, mobile homes are prohibited by covenant. Therefore, there is no concrete manifestation that development of the plat was dedicated in its <em>entirety </em>to the use as sites for single-wide mobile homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The dissent writes, \"A property owner who claims a vested right to a nonconforming use need not show that the land cannot feasibly be used in conformity with the changed zoning.\u201d <em>(Post, </em>p 584.) While this statement may be true in general, whether the land is suitable for the uses permitted in the zoning ordinance is relevant to the question whether a nonconforming use exists at the time the zoning ordinance is enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">In this case, the improvements to the land by way of the road construction, surveying, setting of monuments, grading, and excavation work have rendered the lots in the plat equally suitable for the placement of single-wide mobile homes and conventional dwellings. These improvements, therefore, do not constitute work of a substantial character which makes apparent an actual use of the plat as a single-wide mobile home plat. Nor does the fact that approximately one-fourth of the back lots are occupied by single-wide mobile homes establish the nonconforming use. The trial court found, and we agree, that the vacant lots would sell for conventional or modular home occupancy if the asking price were realistic and if screening were provided for the existing mobile homes. The presence of the existing mobile homes, therefore, does not create an actual use in the vacant lots for placement of single-wide mobile homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Because an insubstantial number of lots in the plat are occupied by mobile homes, and the lots are suitable for more than single-wide mobile housing, this case is distinguishable from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>trailer park cases where use of the vacant spaces for trailers was readily apparent. See <em>Patchak v Lansing Twp, </em>361 Mich 489; 105 NW2d 406 (1960); <em>Richards v City of Pontiac, </em>305 Mich 666; 9 NW2d 885 (1943); <em>Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs v Petsch, </em>172 Neb 263, 268; 109 NW2d 388 (1961); <em>Blundell v West Helena, </em>258 Ark 123, 131; 522 SW2d 661 (1975). We further note that in <em>Patchak </em>and <em>Blundell </em>only that portion of the tract clearly used for trailer park purposes was established as a nonconforming use. Extension of the nonconforming use to the entire tract was denied in each case because actual use of the entire tract as a trailer park had not been established at the time the zoning ordinance was enacted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Were it not for the zoning ordinance at issue, plaintiff would hold the option to sell the unsold unrestricted lots for the use which would command the highest price. Plaintiff claims that it can obtain a substantially higher price if the property is sold for mobile home use. Plaintiff therefore intends to sell the lots for that purpose. Accordingly, what plaintiff actually and understandably seeks here is preservation of an option to sell the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>unsold lots as sites for <em>future </em>nonconforming uses. However, plaintiff may be deprived of this option without offending the Due Process Clause as long as the zoning ordinance is not arbitrary or unreasonable. <em>Austin v Older, supra, </em>677; <em>Patchak v Lansing Twp, supra, </em>497-498. To hold that plaintiff must abide by the zoning ordinance in this case does not amount to a clearly confiscatory taking where the use of the <em>entire </em>plat as a single-wide mobile home plat rests solely within the owner\u2019s contemplation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Nor are we convinced by plaintiffs suggestion that the township is estopped from enacting the zoning restrictions because it had notice of plaintiffs plans to sell the property as sites for single-wide mobile homes by virtue of the plat restrictions recorded in the Barry County Register of Deeds. The trial court found that the township approved plaintiffs plat without being aware of the plat\u2019s restrictions. Moreover, plaintiff has not asserted any authority on appeal to this Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>support the proposition that the township is bound by these restrictions incurred privately by plaintiff with other parties. Therefore, this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">in. is the zoning ordinance invalid because it is</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAW AND WAS NOT ENACTED PURSUANT TO THE MICHIGAN MOBILE HOME COMMISSION ACT?</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The plaintiff also contends that certain portions of the zoning ordinance are preempted by federal and state law, specifically, the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act, 42 USC 5401 <em>et seq., </em>the State Construction Code Act, MCL 125.1519, 125.1520; MSA 5.2949(19), 5.2949(20), and the Mobile Home Commission Act, MCL 125.1101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 19.855(1) <em>et seq. </em>Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals disagreed with plaintiff, finding that the various acts provide construction and safety standards, not standards concerning proper land use, which is the thrust of zoning laws. We believe the lower courts have properly interpreted these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">The purpose of the federal act is set forth in 42 USC 5401:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-10\">The Congress declares that the purposes of this chapter are to reduce the number of personal injuries and deaths and the amount of insurance costs and property damage resulting from manufactured home accidents and to improve the quality and durability of manufactured homes. Therefore, the <em>Congress determines that it is necessary to establish Federal construction and safety standards for manufactured homes and to authorize manufactured home safety research and development. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Further, \u00a7 5403(d) provides that no state or political subdivision thereof may establish a standard regarding <em>construction or safety </em>of any manufactured home covered under the act. The requirements of the zoning ordinance in the case at bar are not standards regulating the construction and safety of mobile homes. Rather, they have for their purpose the regulation of where mobile homes may be placed and under what conditions. These requirements are for the purpose of regulating land use and therefore do not conflict with standards promulgated under the federal National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act. Accord <em>Brookside Village v Comeau, </em>633 SW2d 790 (Tex, 1982), cert den 459 US 1087 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The same reasoning applied to the Michigan State Construction Code compels a similar conclusion under that code. Further, MCL 125.1502(m); MSA 5.2949(2)(m) specifically excludes from the definition of \"construction regulation\u201d under the code \"a zoning ordinance or rule issued pursuant to a zoning ordinance and related to zoning.\u201d Therefore, we find that the Legislature has manifested an intention to specifically exclude from the code\u2019s coverage ordinances like the ordinance at issue which have for their purpose the implementation of zoning goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Finally, we have carefully considered the briefs of plaintiff and amicus curiae, but are not persuaded that zoning ordinances which regulate the conditions and locations of mobile homes outside mobile home parks are included within the scope of the Mobile Home Commission Act. Our review of MCL 125.1105; MSA 19.855(5) reveals that the rules which are to be promulgated under that act relate to the construction of mobile home <em>parks </em>and the regulation of mobile home <em>industries. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Moreover, by enacting \u00a745, subsection 2 of the act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we perceive that the Legislature intended to save ordinances validly enacted under the Township Rural Zoning Act, MCL 125.271; MSA 5.2963(1), from the provisions of the act. Therefore, we are not persuaded that the zoning ordinance at issue is invalid because those provisions establishing conditions for the placement of mobile homes outside of mobile home parks were not first submitted to the Mobile Home Commission for its review.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b633-6\">Brickley, Cavanagh, and Riley, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-16\"> Additional requirements were established for mobile homes placed in the best residential zoning classifications in the township. These latter requirements, as well as a requirement that all mobile homes located outside of mobile home parks secure special use permits, were invalidated by the trial court. No appeal having been taken by the township on this ruling, these requirements are not at issue in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\"><em> </em>\"The ultimate purpose of zoning ordinances is to confine certain classes of buildings and uses to certain localities. The continued existence of those which are nonconforming is inconsistent with that object, and it is contemplated that conditions should be reduced to conformity as completely and speedily as possible with due regard to the special interest of those concerned, and where suppression is not feasible without working substantial injustice, that there shall be accomplished 'the greatest possible amelioration of the offending use which justice to that use permits.\u2019 'The accepted method of accomplishing this result is as follows: The nonconformity is in no case allowed to increase.

Gackler Land Company, Inc., platted a twenty-acre strip of a larger tract into fifty-four lots and additional outlots. Restrictions were recorded limiting the use of the twelve lots fronting on Payne Lake to site-built homes and permitting the use of the remaining forty-two lots for mobile or prefabricated homes. A paved road serving all the lots was constructed in accordance with county road commission standards through the center of the strip, the lots were surveyed, graded and filled, monuments were set, excavation work for drainage was completed, and sewers were installed for some of the lots.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">When the plat was recorded in 1969, the township zoning ordinance permitted the construction of mobile or prefabricated homes on the back lots. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>In 1972, the township amended its zoning ordinance to restrict mobile homes as there defined to mobile home parks. Single-wide (fourteen foot) mobile or prefabricated homes had by then been placed on eleven back lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Gackler commenced this action, challenging the zoning restriction banning mobile or prefabricated homes except in mobile home parks. A few days before this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Robinson Twp v Knoll, </em>410 Mich 293, 310; 302 NW2d 146 (1981), the circuit judge found that the zoning restriction was reasonable, and that Gackler was not entitled to use the remaining back lots for single-wide prefabricated homes as a nonconforming use. In <em>Robinson Twp, </em>this Court held that the exclusion per se of mobile homes from all areas not designated as mobile home parks was not a permissible exercise of the police power. After <em>Robinson Twp </em>was decided, the judge granted a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Also after <em>Robinson Twp, </em>the township amended its zoning ordinance to permit mobile or prefabricated homes in residential zoning districts provided, among other criteria, the minimum width of the home was twenty-four feet. Over eighty-five percent of all the mobile or prefabricated homes sold are single wide, fourteen feet being the greatest width permitted on the highway. All the prefabricated homes placed in the subdivision were single wides.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The judge found that the new zoning standards respecting mobile or prefabricated homes located outside of mobile home parks were by and large valid. Addressing the twenty-four-foot width requirement, however, he said that the concern cannot be health or safety because both the federal and state governments<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> permit the construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>prefabricated homes less than twenty-four feet wide. The judge said the concern is aesthetics, but aesthetics would not justify application of a twenty-four-foot width requirement in this subdivision \"already one-third full of fourteen foot wide trailers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The judge ruled against Gackler because it had failed to establish that the restrictions imposed on the use of the Gackler property by the new zoning standards precluded use of the property for any purpose for which it was reasonably adapted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since the evidence indicated that the vacant lots would sell \"for conventional or modular home occupancy if the asking price was realistic and if screening was provided for the existing mobile homes,\u201d the \"plight of plaintiff here simply does not rise to the level of confiscation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The Court of Appeals agreed and affirmed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">[Although plaintiff presented evidence that the lots could be sold for the asking price of $3,500 if the buyers could use single-wide mobile homes, there was contradictory testimony that the lots were far overpriced and that the lots could be (and had been) used for modular and custom built homes.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">We would reverse because Gackler had estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>lished, before the zoning ordinance was amended to prevent the use of the remaining back lots for single-wide prefabricated homes, a vested right to sell the lots for use as sites for single-wide prefabricated homes as a nonconforming use. We therefore find it unnecessary to comment on the standards enacted by the township after <em>Robinson Twp, </em>limiting the placement of mobile or prefabricated homes in residential zoning districts to those that are at least twenty-four feet wide and meet other criteria.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">A property owner who claims a vested right to a nonconforming use need not show that the land cannot feasibly be used in conformity with the changed zoning. The inquiry is whether the nonconforming use was established before the enactment of the zoning that would bar the use. If so, government may not interfere with the use without regard to whether the property can, consistent with the change in zoning, be used for another purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Land development and building construction generally stretch out over a period of time. The question is at what point will a court recognize that the developer is entitled to protection from a change in zoning that would bar a use permitted when development or construction was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">This Court has indicated that a vested right to a nonconforming use is established when there has been a tangible change in the land by excavation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>and construction or work has been done of a \"substantial character.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6Q\">A landowner who has reached a stage of substantial construction or action on the basis of existing zoning has the right to complete the development and to use the property in accordance with the zoning extant when the work was begun without regard to zoning amendments that thereafter become effective. Developers are thus assured that investments calculated on the basis of prevailing regulations will be protected.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Land is developed and buildings are constructed by private entrepreneurs for contemplated profit. The zoning of property often determines whether development or construction might be profitable. Absent the expectation of the contemplated profit, development and construction generally will not occur. The opportunity to earn the contemplated profit becomes an investment-backed expectation when the development reaches the point of substantial construction and cannot thereafter be thwarted or confiscated by a change in zoning on the premise that the property is not worthless as rezoned or could, consistent with the revised zoning, be devoted to a marginal or less profitable use.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Allowing that a nonconforming use with respect to the lots on which the eleven prefabricated homes had been installed might have been established, the township asserts that the right to a nonconforming use applies only to those lots on which prefabricated homes were in place at the time of the zoning change. There is no sewer service to a number of the back lots and no improvements specific to these lots. The township argues that the road construction, grading, and excavating were undertaken mainly for the benefit of the lakefront lots and do not justify permitting the nonconforming use of the remaining lots.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>We agree with Gackler that the subdivision development should be viewed as a whole, as a structure only part of which had been completed, analogous to a building that is partially completed or to a nonconforming use that is established in a portion but not in all of a building before an amendment to a zoning ordinance rendering such structure or use nonconforming. It has been said that \"the extension of the nonconforming use is permissible if the design of the building indicates that at the time of the passage of the zoning restriction it was intended that the building be dedicated in its entirety to such use.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Gackler had lawfully commenced this development in 1969 \u2014 before the change in zoning \u2014 and substantial sums of money had been spent in carrying out the construction plan. The pattern of development in this subdivision was well established by the time the township adopted the amendatory ordinance in 1972.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>decision ruling against Gackler on the nonconforming use issue, stating that the township did not know of the recorded restrictions permitting the use of the back lots for mobile or prefabricated homes when it approved the plat.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The knowledge of the township might be important if Gackler could only prevail on the theory that the township had misled it by conduct and was therefore es-topped from taking contrary action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Gackler, however, established a vested right to a nonconforming use on the basis of expenditures and development in the subdivision, not on the basis of conduct by the township.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Gackler relies on <em>Richards v City of Pontiac, </em>305 Mich 666; 9 NW2d 885 (1943), where this Court found a vested right to continue operation of a trailer camp although in violation of a zoning ordinance because the owners had purchased the property and operated it as a trailer camp for one year before the enactment and subsequent amendment of a zoning ordinance and had spent $8,000 in improving the trailer camp. Gackler argues that in <em>Richards </em>there was no investigation whether each of the trailers in the park was in place before the passage of the ordinance; rather, the development was viewed as a whole. The township distinguishes <em>Richards </em>on the'basis that the issue there did not concern a subdivision with individually platted lots, but a trailer camp._</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>In <em>Patchak v Lansing Twp, </em>361 Mich 489; 105 NW2d 406 (1960), the question was whether the nonconforming use applied to the entire fifteen acres of a trailer park owned by the plaintiffs or only to five acres. The trial court found that the trailer park was in operation only on the north five acres. The court noted that a license to operate the entire fifteen acres as a trailer park had not been sought; the fee paid with the application for the license was $25, which was the fee for each ten acres or fraction thereof. <em>Patchak </em>does not compel the result sought by the township.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The disposition of this issue by other state supreme courts is instructive. In <em>Sarpy Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs v Petsch, </em>17 Neb 263, 268; 109 NW2d 388 (1961), the Supreme Court of Nebraska held that an owner of a trailer court had acquired a vested right to a nonconforming use of a three-acre tract. Before the zoning ordinance, the owner had used part of the three-acre tract as a trailer park and had installed thirteen trailers and staked out spaces for fifty-nine trailers. Water and sewer lines, power and telephone lines were made available for the entire tract. In allowing the owner to complete his project for fifty-nine trailers, the court said that \"where a trailer-court project is partially completed when zoning regulations become effective, and the evidence is clear as to the extent of the project, the completed project will ordinarily determine the scope of the nonconforming use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">In <em>Blundell v West Helena, </em>258 Ark 123, 131; 522 SW2d 661 (1975), the landowner purchased a five-acre tract. Twelve mobile home spaces were laid out on the east side. A twenty-foot road was built to serve those spaces and thirteen additional spaces were laid out on the west side. Subsequently, a newly adopted zoning ordinance would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>have barred use of the property as a mobile home park. Mobile homes had been placed on four or five lots before adoption of the zoning restrictions. The Supreme Court of Alabama allowed the completion and use of the twenty-five spaces because the spaces were actually leveled, the road between them was constructed, and water and sewer service were available. Although all twenty-five spaces had not been occupied by mobile homes, the court concluded that \"their state of development at that time, constituted a use of the property for a mobile home park\u201d under the \"substantial use\u201d test.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>In <em>Eklund v Clackamas, </em>36 Or App 73, 82; 583 P2d 567 (1978),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Oregon Court of Appeals ruled that a land developer had \"established a vested right to complete\u201d as a nonconforming use the fourth stage of a subdivision development where a water system capable of supplying water to houses to be built in the fourth stage had been completed, and the water supply line had been laid up to the land comprising the fourth stage. In the instant case, the paved road had been laid throughout the Gackler subdivision and other work had been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">It is apparent that a land developer may acquire a vested right to a nonconforming use of improved vacant lots if the developer has the same kind of investment-backed expectation in a nonconforming use of improved lots that the owner of a nonconforming structure might have. A property owner is deemed to have acquired a vested right to a nonconforming use when he has made substantial expenditure in respect to the improvement of the property before the change in zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Under each of the tests stated by the courts\u2014 \"substantial use,\u201d \"tangible change in the land,\u201d \"integral part\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u2014 Gackler had acquired a vested right to sell for use as sites for single-wide prefabricated homes all the back lots that had been improved with a paved road._</p>\n<p id=\"A79V\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Gackler\u2019s recorded plan of development contemplated sale of the lakefront lots for site-built houses and the back lots for mobile or prefabricated homes. The road was constructed and other improvements were made on the basis of that plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The remaining back lots could, indeed, as the Court of Appeals observed, be used consistent with the recorded restrictions either for site-built or mobile or prefabricated homes. It is apparent, however, from the recorded restrictions placed on the land, that Gackler expected to market the back lots for mobile or prefabricated homes. The placement of single-wide prefabricated homes on eleven lots before the change in zoning substantiates that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">After eleven lots were devoted to the single-wide use, the remaining back lots were in a subdivision that had taken on the ambiance of a single-wide prefabricated home subdivision. The presence of single-wide prefabricated homes in the subdivision might be a positive factor for a potential buyer interested in purchasing a lot for a single-wide prefabricated home, but might be a negative factor for a potential buyer who might otherwise be interested in purchasing a lot to construct a site-built home.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">All appear to agree that while the back lots could indeed have been used for site-built houses, and might have been saleable as sites for site-built homes if the price of the lots were reduced, they were more valuable if they could be used for a single-wide prefabricated home. Inherent in the concept of a vested right in a nonconforming use is that the landowner is not limited to the value that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>would be realized upon use in a manner conforming to the change in zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The asserted justification for the twenty-four-foot-wide requirement is aesthetics, not health or safety.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Implicit in that justification for requiring a width greater than fourteen feet should be recognition that once a subdivision has taken on the character of a single-wide prefabricated home subdivision, the remaining lots will be more readily saleable for single-wide prefabricated homes than for double wide or site-built homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Where land has been subdivided and improved as sites for single-wide prefabricated homes, there have been substantial expenditures for land improvements, and single-wide prefabricated homes have been placed on the land before a change in zoning, the land developer has established a vested right to use all the lots so subdivided and improved as a nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Land is developed for a specific use or market. Roads and other costly improvements are installed on the basis of existing zoning because zoning is a major factor in deciding whether the economics justify making any improvements at all. Just as an owner or builder relies on the existing zoning in commencing construction of a building, expecting to be able to use it upon completion for a particular use, a land developer, in constructing roads or other improvements, also relies on existing zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>and expects to be permitted to sell the improved lots for the use permitted by the zoning when he begins substantially to improve the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">When Gackler began substantial construction of the road and other improvements on the basis of the existing zoning, which permitted sale of the lots for use as sites for single-wide prefabricated homes, it made the kind of substantial expenditure that requires a finding that a vested right to a nonconforming use of the back lots was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The majority opinion states that because the road, sewer and other improvements to Gackler\u2019s property made the back lots \u201cas suitable for 'dwellings\u2019 under the ordinance as they are for single-wide mobile homes,\u201d there is \u201cno concrete manifestation that development of the plat was dedicated in its <em>entirety </em>to the use as sites for single-wide homes.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.) It is stated, similarly, that the improvements \u201crendered the lots in the plat equally suitable for the placement of single-wide mobile homes and conventional dwellings\u201d and therefore the improvements \"do not constitute work of a substantial character which makes apparent an actual use of the plat as a single-wide mobile home plat.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is said that Gackler is seeking \"preservation of an option to sell the unsold lots as sites for <em>future </em>nonconforming uses\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (emphasis in original) and that \u201cthe use of the <em>entire </em>plat as a single-wide mobile home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>plat rests solely within the owner\u2019s contemplation.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The nature of sewer, water, and road improvements is that they may be adapted to more than one use. Sewer and water mains and roads are needed for commercial, industrial, and residential uses. It is not a sufficient response to a land developer who has made expenditures for such improvements in reliance on existing zoning to say that the improvements have made the land as \"suitable\u201d or even \"equally suitable,\u201d however that might be defined, for a use consistent with the change in zoning as a use permitted under the former zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Suppose a foundation for a high-rise office building is completed before a change in zoning. Or that sewer or water mains and roads are installed before a change in zoning increasing minimum lot size from 80 to 120 feet. A foundation for a highrise office building might and probably would be suitable for another use, say a high-rise apartment building. Sewer and water mains and roads constructed when zoning permits 80-foot lots are suitable (or equally suitable) for 120-foot lots. See <em>Wood v North Salt Lake, </em>15 Utah 2d 245; 390 P2d 858 (1964), discussed in n 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Construction of those improvements might and most likely would not, however, have been economically justified where the land so improved is located if an apartment house must be constructed on the foundation rather than the contemplated office building or if the minimum lot size is 120 feet rather than 80 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Suppose the community changes the minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>floor area of the home that may be constructed. When the sewer, water, road and other land improvements were made, the minimum floor area was 1,000 square feet, now it is 1,500 square feet. There might not be a market or as good a market in the area for homes of 1,500 square feet at a price that justifies the investment. Had the developer known that he would be required to build 1,500 square-foot houses, he would not have invested a dime in the land improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Suppose the community decides, after sewer, water, road and other land improvements have been made, that there is a need for low-cost housing, and changes the zoning so that in the future homes cannot be built on the land so improved having a floor area in excess of 1,000 square feet. Again, from an economic standpoint, the developer might not have developed the land at all if that limitation had been imposed before he made his investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">A developer, whether building structures above the ground or making underground or surface improvements, decides initially whether to invest at all in part on the basis of existing zoning. Just as a landowner might not invest in sewer or water mains or roads if the zoning provides for a minimum of 120-foot lots, a minimum of 1500 square feet, or a maximum of 1000 square feet, and the developer of a high-rise office building might not have proceeded if he could only build a high-rise apartment building, so too Gackler might not have proceeded to develop the back lots or the subdivision at all with road and other improvements unless it could market the back lots as sites for single-wide prefabricated homes. Gackler\u2019s investment-backed expectation is as much entitled to protection as a lot developer confronted with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>change in lot size or floor area or an office building developer.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Until a home is actually under construction, no lot developer can make \"apparent\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> at the site an actual use of a lot. Until construction is under way, he could bow to a requirement increasing lot size from 80 to 120 feet, minimum floor area from 1,000 to 1,500 square feet, or establishing a maximum floor area of 1,000 square feet. Requiring an \"apparent\u201d actual use of each lot would mean that the investment-backed expectations of a lot developer cannot, until a home is actually under construction, give rise to a vested right in a use permitted when the investment is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Gackler\u2019s effort in this litigation to secure the right to sell the back lots as sites for the construction of single-wide prefabricated homes has been characterized in the majority opinion as an effort to preserve an option to sell the unsold lots as sites for \"future\u201d nonconforming uses. Whenever a structure is under construction and has not been completed before the change in zoning occurs, the proposed use will be inchoate at the time the change in zoning is enacted. Merely because the use has not come into fruition does not constitute it a \"future\u201d nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The nature of land development is such that unsold lots will, in a sense, always be sites for future uses. This Court cannot in principle justifiably deny to land developers the same protection of their expenditures made on the basis of existing zoning as is secured to persons who make land improvements above the ground. Merely because a land developer might change the contemplated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>use, in whole or in part, to a use permitted by the change in zoning does not justify denying him protection if he wishes to develop the land in accordance with the zoning as it was when he made his investment. Although dwellings have not been built on the \"entire\u201d plat before the change in zoning, development in accordance with the prior zoning does not rest \"solely within the owner\u2019s contemplation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">While a high-rise office building developer would have plans and a building permit showing that he intended to construct an office building, a land developer will be able to point to other evidence\u2014 as can Gackler \u2014 of his intention to use the land for a use permitted by the former zoning no longer permitted as a result of the change in zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Gackler\u2019s intention to use the entire plat as a single-wide prefabricated home plat did not rest solely within its contemplation. Single-wide prefabricated homes had been placed on eleven back lots by the time the change in zoning occurred. The recorded restrictions permitted construction on back lots of prefabricated homes and did not permit the construction of prefabricated homes on the lakefront lots. Gackler, of course, might have restricted the use of the back lots to the construction of prefabricated homes, but that would have been, in a sense, bootstrapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">It is, I think, clear that Gackler planned the development of the back lots with prefabricated homes when it recorded the restrictions. Be that as it may, when it sold eleven lots for the construction thereon of prefabricated homes, it gave the area the ambiance or character of a prefabricated-home subdivision. Gackler had both invested in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the construction of a road and utility lines, and had given the area a certain character before the change in zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The underlying rationale of the vested right/ nonconforming use exception is that a property owner should be protected in making an investment on the basis of existing zoning to improve the land. Many nonconforming uses could be adapted by the expenditure of money, and some without any financial expenditure, to a use consistent with a use permitted following the change in zoning. Nevertheless, the owner is not required to change the use or to incur any financial loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">A dwelling house in a residential neighborhood might have been converted into a small neighborhood store before there was any zoning. The store could readily be converted back to a dwelling. The owner is not required to do so merely because the structure is suitable for use as a dwelling and could be readily reconverted for that use.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Gackler\u2019s selling experience indicates that it will suffer an economic loss if required to sell the back lots in conformity to the change in zoning. Instead of the price obtainable if the back lots can be sold as sites for single-wide prefabricated homes, it will obtain a lesser amount upon their sale for site-built homes. There is no difference in principle between requiring Gackler to reduce the price of the lots so that they can be sold for the construction of site-built homes than in asking the owner of any other nonconforming use to adapt it so that it can be used consistent with the change in zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Gackler is asked, as might the owner of any nonconforming use, to take an economic loss after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>an investment in the property on the basis of existing zoning has been made so that the community can bring about a different kind of development or use than was formerly permitted. There is no difference between asking Gackler to pay for the cost of installing screening, as suggested by the trial judge and referred to in the majority opinion, to hide the existing prefabricated homes than in asking the owner of the foundation for a high-rise office building or of the house converted into a store to make the changes that are needed so that the foundation can be used for an apartment building and the store once again as a dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">All such changes could be made. It is just a question of money. But that is what vested rights/ nonconforming uses are about \u2014 money, the owner or land developer\u2019s money. If one focuses on the concept that an investment made on the basis of existing zoning should be protected, one will not indulge in artificial distinctions that ignore the underlying rationale of the vested right/nonconforming use exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">A land or lot developer should be permitted to use the property for a use permitted when improvements are made unless<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the court can properly find that the investment was made without regard to the zoning. This Court has no basis for concluding that Gackler would have constructed the road and other improvements if the back lots could not have been sold as sites for single-wide prefabricated homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Gackler\u2019s selling experience would suggest that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>it would not have been a prudent investment to improve the back lots for construction of site-built homes. If Gackler is required to reduce the asking price to a \"realistic price,\u201d as the majority opinion requires, Gackler\u2019s investment may, by virtue of the change in zoning and the majority opinion, become unrealistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">We would reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b653-6\">Williams, C.J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b653-7\">Archer, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-11\">The lots fronting on Payne Lake are all on the east side of the road.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\"> See National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Standards Act of 1974, 42 USC 5401 <em>et seq., </em>and the State Construction Code Act, MCL 125.1501 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2949(1) <em>et seq. </em>The federal regulatory scheme is extensive, covering a variety of areas involving health and safety, and interior and exterior specifications.
