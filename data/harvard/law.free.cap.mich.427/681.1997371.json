The car was impounded by the police after the defendant was arrested by the Grand Rapids Police Department at the Kent County Airport. The police had been alerted by authorities in San Diego, California, that the package picked up by the defendant contained cocaine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>The car was parked by the air freight office and the defendant\u2019s purse was left on the front seat of the car. The trial court in this case found the evidence admissible, but the Court of Appeals reversed the decision and remanded for a new trial on the ground that the evidence was unlawfully obtained in an improper impoundment.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that the impoundment and inventory of Sandra Krezen\u2019s car did not violate the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and that therefore the cocaine found in her purse consequent to the inventory was validly admitted into evidence. The impoundment in this case was in accord with departmental procedures, the departmental procedures were within the constitutionally mandated power of the municipality, and no violation of the state or federal constitution occurred. The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the trial court\u2019s admission of the evidence obtained during the inventory of Krezen\u2019s car is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">I. THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION IS NOT VIOLATED BY THE POLICE IMPOUNDMENT AND INVENTORY OF KREZEN\u2019S CAR</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">In <em>South Dakota v Opperman, </em>428 US 364; 96 S Ct 3092; 49 L Ed 2d 1000 (1976), the United States Supreme Court upheld an inventory of a lawfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>impounded vehicle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The police inventoried the car according to standard procedure, after observing a \"number of valuables inside the car\u201d in plain view. <em>Id., </em>pp 375-376. The inventory was seen as a care-taking function rather than an investigative search. A majority of the Court found that the police conduct<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. In determining whether the warrantless inventory in <em>Opperman </em>was unconstitutional, the Court looked \"to all the facts and circumstances of this case,\u201d <em>Cooper v California, </em>386 US 58, 59; 87 S Ct 788; 17 L Ed 2d 730 (1967), to determine that the police conduct was not \"unreasonable\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">The inventory itself was prompted by the presence in plain view of a number of valuables inside the car. As in <em>Cady </em>[v <em>Dombrowski, </em>413 US 433; 93 S Ct 2523; 37 L Ed 2d 706 (1973)], there is no suggestion whatever that this standard procedure, essentially like that followed throughout the country, was a pretext concealing an investigatory police motive. [428 US 375-376.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>The actual inventory in the instant case was carried out in conformity with <em>Opperman. </em>The police acted according to departmental procedure, completing a standard inventory form. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s purse was located in plain view on the front seat of the car. The inventory \" 'was a routine administrative caretaking function performed pursuant to standard departmental procedures ....\u2019\u201d <em>People v Long (On Remand), </em>419 Mich 636, 647; 359 NW2d 194 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The true issue is whether the initial impoundment of Krezen\u2019s car was a constitutional violation. The impoundment occurred within the context of a standard departmental policy that, upon arrest of the driver, all vehicles not released to another driver were to be impounded. The defendant argues that the policy is unconstitutionally overbroad, since it does not allow an exercise of discretion by the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The actual departmental policy is unclear. One officer testified that impoundment was required when the owner/driver is arrested \"unless that car is released to another person by authority of the owner.\u201d Another officer testified that when an arrest is made, the car is impounded \"if it is not released to another party in the vehicle.\u201d If the policy is written, it was never entered into evidence as an exhibit. The Court of Appeals decision described the Grand Rapids policy as \"to impound and inventory all motor vehicles following the arrests of their drivers . . . .\u201d 143 Mich App 34, 40; 371 NW2d 882 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">If the departmental policy is indeed that all arrests require impoundment, regardless of the surrounding factual circumstances, there may well be situations in which an impoundment would violate the Fourth Amendment as an unreasonable seizure. However, the actual policy is unclear, <em>and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>the specific facts in this case render the impoundment decision eminently reasonable. Since this is not an alleged First Amendment violation, the reasonableness of the impoundment as applied to the facts of this case is what is determinative \u2014 the mere fact that the regulation might in some case be overbroad is not pertinent where the police activity vis-\u00e1-vis this defendant was constitutional. See, e.g., <em>United States v Raines, </em>362 US 17, 21; 80 S Ct 519; 4 L Ed 2d 524 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The simple fact that the impoundment occurred without a warrant does not make it unconstitutional per se. In <em>Cooper v California, supra, </em>p 59, the United States Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">[W]hether a search and seizure is unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case[;] . . . searches of cars that are constantly movable may make the search of a car without a warrant a reasonable one although the result might be the opposite in a search of a home, a store, or other fixed piece of property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">While the issue in this case deals with impoundment \u2014 a species of \"seizure\u201d rather than of \"search\u201d \u2014 the analysis used in relation to searches is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">In <em>Cady, </em>the Court upheld the \"search\u201d of the trunk of an automobile which, after being in an accident, was towed to a private garage. The search was instituted because the defendant was a Chicago policeman and the Wisconsin police did not want his service revolver, which might have been in the car, to fall into the wrong hands and endanger public safety. <em>Id., </em>p 443. In the course of looking for the revolver, the police found other incriminating evidence which led to the defendant\u2019s conviction for murder. The Court deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>mined that lack of a warrant was not fatal and that the trunk search was reasonable under the facts of the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">The Court\u2019s previous recognition of the distinction between motor vehicles and dwelling places leads us to conclude that the type of caretaking \"search\u201d conducted here of a vehicle that was neither in the custody nor on the premises of its owner, and that had been placed where it was by virtue of lawful police action, was not unreasonable solely because a warrant had not been obtained. The Framers of the Fourth Amendment have given us only the general standard of \"unreasonableness\u201d as a guide in determining whether searches and seizures meet the standard of that Amendment in those cases where a warrant is not required. Very little that has been said in our previous decisions . . . and very little that we might say here can usefully refine the language of the Amendment itself in order to evolve some detailed formula for judging cases such as this. Where, as here, the trunk of an automobile, which the officer reasonably believed to contain a gun, was vulnerable to intrusion by vandals, we hold that the search was not \"unreasonable\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>[Id., </em>pp 447-448.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In the instant case, the impoundment of Krezen\u2019s car without a warrant was not unreasonable per se. As in <em>Cady, </em>the car was not on the premises of its owner, and, once the arrest occurred, it was no longer in the owner\u2019s actual possession. While \"impounding\u201d a house without a warrant just because the defendant was arrested outside of the house could, under certain circumstances, be unreasonable per se, a car is a different matter. Its very nature as a transportable nonfixed item makes it and its contents more subject to theft or damage. <em>Cady, </em>pp 441-442. A number of courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>have recognized that the possibility of theft or vandalism is a valid reason for impounding a car upon the arrest of the driver, especially where no other person is present to take control of the car. See, e.g., <em>United States v Staller, </em>616 F2d 1284 (CA 5, 1980); <em>United States v Scott, </em>665 F2d 874 (CA 9, 1981); <em>Cabbler v Superintendent, Virginia State Penitentiary, </em>528 F2d 1142 (CA 4, 1975); <em>State v Sims, </em>426 So 2d 148 (La, 1983). Other courts have recognized that leaving a car parked in a private location may be a nuisance. <em>United States v Brown, </em>787 F2d 929 (CA 4, 1986). The impoundment was a caretaking function rather than an investigative one, instituted according to standard departmental policy to protect the defendant and the police from unnecessary thefts, recriminations, and civil suits. The trial court found the following as true:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">It is the opinion of this Court that the search of the vehicle was an inventory search and obviated the need for a warrant; that the reason for the search was to protect the items from being stolen or protect the police against any claims of loss or stolen property; that it was not for the pretext of trying to unearth any further criminal activity upon the part of the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The impoundment, even without a warrant, was likewise not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the people describe in brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">The officers were arresting the defendant prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>erly for a serious felony. It was Saturday morning. They knew the defendant would not be arraigned until Monday. Her car was parked away from the main part of the airport. Her purse was plainly visible on the front seat of her car. The officers had been sued in the past for not following police policy in this area. How can the actions of the police in impounding the defendant\u2019s vehicle and conducting an inventory of its contents, under all these circumstances, be held unreasonable?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The Court of Appeals was concerned that a less intrusive means could have been used to obtain the same insurance against theft, vandalism, and suit against the police. <em>People v Krezen, </em>143 Mich App 41-42. However, as the United States Supreme Court observed in <em>Cady, supra, </em>p 447, \"[t]he fact that the protection of the public might, in the abstract, have been accomplished by 'less intrusive\u2019 means does not, by itself, render the search unreasonable.\u201d See also <em>United States v Sharpe, </em>470 US 675, 687; 105 S Ct 1568; 84 L Ed 2d 605 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The impoundment of Krezen\u2019s car in this case was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable given the surrounding circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, it did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>violate the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">II. THE MICHIGAN CONSTITUTION WAS NOT VIOLATED BY THE IMPOUNDMENT AND INVENTORY OF KREZEN\u2019S CAR</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Once it has been determined that the federal constitution does not require suppression of the cocaine residue found in Krezen\u2019s purse, the plain language of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11 prohibits exclusion of the evidence under the Michigan Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">The person, houses, papers and possessions of every person shall be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures. No warrant to search any place or to seize any person or things shall issue without describing them, nor without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation. <em>The provisions of this section shall not be construed to bar from evidence in any criminal proceeding any narcotic drug, \u00f1rearm, bomb, explosive or any other dangerous weapon, seized by a peace officer outside the curtilage of any dwelling house in this state.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">While some state courts have construed their state constitutions as barring evidence obtained in inventory searches valid under the federal constitution,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the plain language of art 1, \u00a7 11 prohibits such a result: \u201cThe provisions of this section shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>not be construed to bar from evidence in any criminal proceeding any narcotic drug . . . seized by a peace officer outside the curtilage of any dwelling house in this state.\u201d Cocaine was discovered in an inventory of Krezen\u2019s car which occurred at the Grand Rapids airport. Thus, there is no basis for excluding this evidence under the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">III. THE GRAND RAPIDS POLICE HAD AUTHORITY TO IMPOUND KREZEN\u2019S CAR</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The officers acted in conformity with the standard procedure of the police department of impounding all vehicles where the defendant was placed under arrest and there was no other driver present in the vehicle to take control of the vehicle. The reason for this policy, according to the officers who testified at the suppression hearing, was to protect officers<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> from claims filed by persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>who suffered, or claimed to have suffered, thefts or other losses involving vehicles not impounded while the driver was under arrest.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under our constitution, the powers granted generally to municipalities, and the specific powers granted by the Grand Rapids charter to its police, the Grand Rapids police had basic authority to impound the car of Sandra Krezen.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Const 1963, art 7, \u00a721 requires the Legislature to provide for the incorporation of cities and villages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">The legislature shall provide by general laws for the incorporation of cities and villages. Such laws shall limit their rate of ad valorem property taxation for municipal purposes, and restrict the power of cities and villages to borrow money and contract debts. Each city and village is granted power to levy other taxes for public purposes, subject to limitations and prohibitions provided by this constitution or by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The Legislature has indeed provided for the incorporation of villages, MCL 61.1; MSA 5.1201, cities of the fourth class, MCL 81.2; MSA 5.1592, and cities of the fifth class and home rule cities, MCL 117.7; MSA 5.2086. For villages<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>class cities,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Legislature specifically provides statutes delineating the authority of the local governing bodies over their police and the general powers of the police. For fifth class and home rule cities, the Legislature provides two relevant provisions. First, MCL 117.3(j); MSA 5.2073(j) provides that a mandatory charter provision is \"[f]or the public peace and health and for the safety of persons and property.\u201d MCL 117.4j; MSA 5.2083 provides more generally for municipal powers:</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Each city may in its charter provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">(1) For the establishment of any department that it may deem necessary for the general wel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>fare of the city, and for the separate incorporation thereof: Provided, however, That these provisions shall not be construed to extend to and include public schools;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-4\">(2) For altering, amending or repealing any special act affecting any municipal concerns or existing municipal department, but the department in control of the public schools shall not be construed to be a municipal department;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">(3) <em>For the exercise of all municipal powers in the management and control of municipal property and in the administration of the municipal government, whether such powers be expressly enumerated or not; for any act to advance the interests of the city, the good government and prosperity of the municipality and its inhabitants and through its regularly constituted authority to pass all laws and ordinances relating to its municipal concerns subject to the constitution and general laws of this state. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The general grant of power to municipalities which is authorized by Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 21, and which is activated in the various state statutes concerning the charters for local municipalities, is further highlighted in Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 22:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">Under general laws the electors of each city and village shall have the power and authority to frame, adopt and amend its charter, and to amend an existing charter of the city or village heretofore granted or enacted by the legislature for the government of the city or village. Each such city and village shall have power to adopt resolutions and ordinances relating to its municipal concerns, property and government, subject to the constitution and law. No enumeration of powers granted to cities and villages in this constitution shall limit or restrict the general grant of authority conferred by this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">There is simply no basis to assume that Grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Rapids does not have the power to authorize, implicitly or expressly, its police department to engage in activities incident to valid arrests such as impounding vehicles. Art 7, \u00a7 22 expressly states that such cities \"have power to adopt resolutions and ordinances relating to its municipal concerns, property and government, subject to the constitution and law.\u201d The Convention Comment to art 7, \u00a7 22 states that \"[t]he new language is a more positive statement of municipal powers, giving home rule cities and villages full power over their own property and government, subject to this constitution and law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The Grand Rapids City Charter establishes the city manager as the director of public safety, in charge of the police department. Grand Rapids Charter, \u00a7 96(a). The city manager \"shall prescribe all rules and regulations for the control and management of the police force ....\u201d\u00a7 96(d). Most important is the general grant of authority given by the charter to police officers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">The Director of Public Safety and all City police officers and detectives shall have and possess the power and authority usually conferred upon metropolitan police. [\u00a7 96(g).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">So long as the local municipalities and their agents, such as the police in the instant case, do not circumvent the constitution or a preeminent state statute, the constitutional authority of the municipality is not abridged. Absent such a violation, this Court cannot hinder the local government\u2019s exercise of the police power. In the instant case, the parties have not briefed or argued whether or not the Grand Rapids police possess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>the basic power to impound cars.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Given the constitutional framework and the apparent grants of authority to the police, there is no basis in this case for abridging that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">There was no constitutional or statutory violation by the Grand Rapids police in their impoundment and inventory of Sandra Krezen\u2019s car. Under the facts of this case, the police activity was reasonable. The impoundment and inventory were part of a normal caretaking function, carried out pursuant to standard departmental policy which was within the constitutionally mandated authority of the municipal government. We would, therefore, reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b749-6\">Brickley and Riley, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-7\"> The Court discussed some of the typical circumstances in which impoundments occur:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">In the interests of public safety and as part of what the Court has called \"community caretaking functions,\u201d <em>Cady v Dombrowski </em>[413 US 433, 441; 99 S Ct 2523; 37 L Ed 2d 706 (1973)], automobiles are frequently taken into police custody. Vehicle accidents present one such occasion. To permit the uninterrupted flow of traffic and in some circumstances to preserve evidence, disabled or damaged vehicles will often be removed from the highways or streets at the behest of police engaged solely in caretaking and traffic-control activities. Police will also frequently remove and impound automobiles which violate parking ordinances and which thereby jeopardize both the public safety and the efficient movement of vehicular traffic. The authority of police to seize and remove from the streets vehicles impeding traffic or threatening public safety and convenience is beyond challenge. <em>[Id., </em>pp 368-369. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\"> The <em>Opperman </em>Court did not determine whether the inventory was a \"search.\u201d 428 US 370, n 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b740-8\"> Even if we were to hold that the police should have left Krezen\u2019s car in the parking lot, the police could not have reasonably left her purse sitting in plain view on the front seat. The purse would most likely have been returned to Krezen\u2019s possession, which would require a protective search for weapons at the site of the arrest and an inventory search at the station subsequent to her booking, see <em>Illinois v Lafayette, </em>462 US 640; 103 S Ct 2605; 77 L Ed 2d 65 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\"> Krezen was not parked in the long-term parking lot at the Kent County Airport \u2014 she parked outside the air freight offices, housed in a building only one-hundred feet long. While she originally testified that the parking area was \"huge,\u201d she later said that no more than around seven cars \u2014 a few cars \u2014 were parked there. She also said that she parked \"directly in front of the air freight office.\u201d The only inference to be drawn from the record is that this was a small parking area intended for vehicles parked temporarily while the drivers made a quick trip into one of the air cargo offices. No references in the record indicate that people customarily leave their cars there for days on end.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Justice Levin asserts that \"[t]he 'caretaking\u2019 rationale for impoundment is inapposite when the person arrested does not desire that the police safeguard the person\u2019s property and accepts responsibility for possible losses.\u201d The issue here is whether the police decision to impound the car was reasonable \u2014 the police purpose is certainly a relevant factor in such a determination. Had the trial court found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>that the impoundment was a pretext to search Krezen\u2019s car, surely Justice Levin would consider the police purpose to be relevant in determining reasonableness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b742-9\"> Justice Levin, p 717, misstates the holding of this opinion: that under the facts and circumstances in the instant case, the police conduct was not unreasonable under either the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b742-10\"> See <em>South Dakota v Opperman (On Remand), </em>247 NW2d 673 (SD, 1976); <em>Wagner v Commonwealth, </em>581 SW2d 352 (Ky, 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b743-7\"> Justice Levin asserts that there is no police liability under <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567; 363 NW2d 641 (1984), for lost or damaged property where the police make an arrest and fail to impound personal property. That question has, of course, not yet been decided by this Court, and its relevance relates to whether the police belief that there might be some form of civil liability adds to the reasonableness of the impoundment. The two officers in this case were sued for damage to an unimpounded car by a person arrested by them. Ironically, the officers failed to impound the car solely at the request of the arrestee. Furthermore, even if governmental immunity protected the officers from a state law tort claim for property damage or loss, it clearly cannot immunize them from suit under federal law. It is an understatement to observe that the current state of federal law is unclear on whether such an omission is a \"deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and the laws . . . .\u201d 42 USC 1983. The United States Supreme Court has not yet decided whether the absence of a state remedy because of sovereign immunity would make that remedy \"inadequate\u201d for \u00a7 1983 purposes. <em>Daniels v Williams, </em>474 US 327, \u2014, n 1; 106 S Ct 662, 669, n 1; 88 L Ed 2d 662, 669, n 1 (1986). Thus, under the circumstances of the instant case, the asserted fear of civil suit was hardly unreasonable.

Justice Levin\u2019s proposed rule is not, however, an exercise of a power vested in the judiciary. No violation of the state or federal constitutions by the Grand Rapids police is found to justify the proposed judicial alteration of an apparently reasonable police power regulation.

They acknowledged that the automobile was legally parked. Because it was in an area away from the main parking area, there was relatively little traffic.

In <em>Cady v Dombrowski, supra, </em>pp 442-443, the police had also properly \"exercised a form of custody or control over the\u201d vehicle. It had been \"disabled as a result of [a one-car] accident, and constituted a nuisance along the highway. Respondent, being intoxicated (and later comatose), could not make arrangements to have the vehicle towed and stored. At the direction of the police, and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>elemental reasons of safety, the automobile was towed to a private garage.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">In <em>People v Long, supra, </em>p 649, this Court said that when \"a motor vehicle has been lawfully impounded,\u201d the Fourth Amendment does not bar the police from conducting an inventory \u2018search pursuant to established standard procedures.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The Court of Appeals observed that impoundment and inventory procedures have been justified \"on three distinct grounds: (1) the protection of property while held in police custody; (2) protection of the police against claims over lost or stolen property; and (3) protection of the police from potential danger.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The Court of Appeals said that \"the standard policy of the Grand Rapids Police Department to impound and inventory all motor vehicles following the arrests of their drivers\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was \"simply too broad when viewed against the backdrop of the Fourth Amendment. Instead of allowing an officer to exercise his individual discretion, such blanket policies encourage police to impound and inventory each and every vehicle whose driver is taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>into custody, regardless of whether such action is necessary or reasonable under the circumstances. Procedures to safeguard both motor vehicle and the police in such situations can and must be better tailored to fit the dictates of our state and federal constitutions.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The Court said that \"[t]he burden is on the state to show that any impoundment is both necessary and reasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The \"mere possibility of theft or vandalism to the contents of a vehicle left unattended, which, if realized, may in turn lead to claims against the police for loss or damages, does not compare in importance with the preservation of basic constitutional guarantees.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">[W]here the owner or permissive user of a motor vehicle is present and not incapacitated, it is imminently reasonable for the arresting officer to first obtain the owner\u2019s consent to impound and search the vehicle or otherwise allow the owner a reasonable opportunity to make alternate arrangements to secure the vehicle.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The Court further held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-8\">impoundment is not necessary where a car is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>lawfully parked, does not impede the regular flow of traffic, and does not otherwise pose any threat to public safety. If an owner or permissive user neither requests that his car be impounded nor gives his consent, he will be presumed to have assumed the risk for any claims of loss or damage that may arise.[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The Court concluded that the decision to impound Krezen\u2019s automobile was neither necessary nor reasonable and, therefore, that the subsequent inventory search was invalid. Accordingly, Krezen\u2019s conviction based on possession of the brown vial containing cocaine residue was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The Court also concluded that Krezen\u2019s conviction of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver should be reversed and remanded for a new trial because it could not say that the introduction of the evidence obtained as a result of the search of Krezen\u2019s purse was harmless. Krezen testified that she thought the package she had picked up at the airport contained money owed her by her boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The dissenting judge thought that Krezen\u2019s \"purse may have offered an attractive incentive to potential thieves.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \"Furthermore, as defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>was taken into custody on Saturday morning, she was going to be detained until her arraignment on Monday morning at least.

Her automobile was legally parked in a nearby parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">There was no basis for a search of Krezen\u2019s automobile as an incident to her arrest. There is no suggestion that it was necessary to impound the vehicle, or to inventory its contents, or to search Krezen\u2019s purse, to protect the police from potential danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">In <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567; 363 NW2d 641 (1984), this Court provided governmental agencies and employees, including police officers, with broad immunity from tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">1986 PA 175<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> amended the governmental tort liability act to define broadly the scope of government immunity.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The act also provides governmental employees with broad immunity from tort liability.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Before Krezen\u2019s automobile was impounded, neither the automobile nor the purse was in the custody of the police. Absent the impoundment, there would be no bailment and the police would have had no responsibility for the care of Krezen\u2019s property. No claim could properly have been asserted against the police for loss or theft of property that was not in the custody of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">While the courts are open to the filing of both valid and invalid claims, it would be disproportionate to hold that the law authorizes the police to impound personal property they have no duty to. safeguard simply to protect against unfounded claims that they should have safeguarded the property. It would be chimerical to suggest that the City of Grand Rapids or the police officers would have been held liable in damages for loss or damage to Krezen\u2019s automobile or purse if they had not volunteered to take steps to protect such property._</p>\n<p id=\"AsO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Courts generally have concluded that to justify impoundment something more must be shown than simply that the vehicle would otherwise be left unattended.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Courts generally have said that, even where impoundment might in the circumstances be lawful, the owner or possessor of a vehicle, if available and physically and mentally capable, must be given a reasonable opportunity to make an alternative disposition of the vehicle before the police may impound it for the sole or primary purpose of protecting it and the contents from danger, and that the failure to permit such alternate disposition renders an impoundment and subsequent inventory search invalid.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Many courts have said that impoundment is ordinarily unlawful where the vehicle is legally parked, particularly if it is parked off-street.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Krezen\u2019s automobile was legally parked in an off-street lot at the time of her arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">It also has been said that impoundment is unlawful where the person arrested is not near the automobile when arrested.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Krezen was not near her automobile when arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Still other courts have said that the police may not impound an automobile solely to protect it and its contents. In <em>People v Miller, </em>7 Cal 3d 219, 223-224; 101 Cal Rptr 860; 496 P2d 1228 (1972), the California Supreme Court said that the danger of theft from leaving defendant\u2019s electronic equipment visible in the vehicle did not justify impoundment when the vehicle was parked in a private lot. In <em>Gunn v State, </em>336 So 2d 687, 689 (Fla App, 1976), a Florida appeals court said that even where there is a possibility that a vehicle will be damaged, a driver should be allowed to assume that risk and the responsibility for any damage rather than have the vehicle impounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Locking and leaving a vehicle is considered a reasonable alternative disposition where a vehicle is legally parked; in <em>Tolbert v State, </em>348 So 2d 623 (Fla App, 1977), where an automobile was lawfully parked in an alley in a high-crime area, a Florida appeals court held that simply leaving the locked vehicle would have been a reasonable alternative to impoundment.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Impoundment was found to have been proper in exceptional circumstances.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AK0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The danger of theft or vandalism because Krezen\u2019s purse was visible on the front seat of her automobile did not justify impoundment of her automobile or of the purse. The police had no obligation to concern themselves with the safekeeping of Krezen\u2019s property. When they did so, Krezen should have been given the choice of what to do, including leaving the automobile where it was rather than for it to be impounded. An officer might have offered to place her purse in the trunk of her automobile, or to hand it to her after it had been searched for weapons.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The police neither inquired what Krezen wished to be done with her automobile or her purse, nor made any effort to allow her to provide for their safekeeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">In sum, the police had no duty or need to impound Krezen\u2019s automobile either to protect her purse or other contents of the automobile or the automobile itself. We conclude that the police were not authorized to impound Krezen\u2019s automobile or her purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">vi</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">We do not invoke either the federal<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> or state<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>constitutional limitations on search or seizure in reaching that conclusion.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Before one reaches the question whether police conduct is violative of a constitutional limitation, there is the preliminary question whether the police conduct is authorized by statute or by judicial decision declaring the common law of this state. The police are creatures of statute, and no authority is conferred on them under the constitution of this state. The police have no authority except such as may be conferred expressly by statute or necessary implication or by judicial decision declaring the common law of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">In contrast with the detailed statutory provisions spelling out the authority of the police and others to make arrests,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> the statutory authority to search and seize<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> is sparse. There is nothing pertaining to impoundment or inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">No statute or judicial decision authorizes or empowers the police to impound or seize private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>property without limitation except such as the federal or state constitutions impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">In the absence of statutory authority, it becomes a matter for judicial or common-law decision whether the police are authorized to impound or move private property in a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">In some cases it will be clear, considered as a question of common law, that the police are empowered to act, as where a disabled vehicle or a parked vehicle represents a hazard to users of a street or highway, or where the owner or driver is disabled or intoxicated and cannot properly move the vehicle or consent or refuse to consent to removal, or where the vehicle has been vandalized or stripped or reported as stolen.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> In the instant case, the police were not authorized by the law of this state to impound or move Krezen\u2019s legally parked automobile.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Although the police had no obligation to concern themselves with the safekeeping of Krezen\u2019s property, it would have been entirely proper for them to offer to assist, or respond affirmatively to a request for assistance from, her in safeguarding her property. Whenever the police choose to offer to assist, or to respond affirmatively to a request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>for assistance from, an arrested person in safeguarding his property, they should advise the arrested person, unless so intoxicated or disabled that he cannot act on advice, that he will be given an opportunity at the station house<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> to make his own arrangements for safeguarding his property if he prefers to do so, or that he may entrust the property to a person of suitable age and condition who may be accompanying him. In those cases where they are authorized by law to do so, the police should advise the arrested person before impounding or moving private property, unless so intoxicated or disabled that he cannot act on advice, that he may entrust the property to such a person accompanying him or, if there is time to make alternative arrangements before the property must or will be removed, that he will be given an opportunity at the station house to make his own arrangements for safeguarding his property if he prefers to do so.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The people do not separately state a question or argue that the admission in evidence of the drug paraphernalia and the brown vial found by the police in Krezen\u2019s purse was harmless error. That issue, not having been briefed or argued, is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The lead opinion, in stating that the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>constitution was not violated by the impoundment and inventory of Krezen\u2019s automobile relies on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>South Dakota v Opperman, supra, </em>where, in the words of the lead opinion, \"the United States Supreme Court upheld an inventory of a lawfully impounded vehicle.\u201d (The vehicle had been impounded for violation of a municipal parking ordinance.) The lead opinion continues stating that \"The inventory [in Opperman] was seen as a care-taking function rather than an investigative search.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The \"caretaking\u201d function analysis is not, however, applicable unless there has been a lawful impoundment.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The concurring opinion, acknowledging that <em>South Dakota v Opperman </em>did not authorize the impoundment of a lawfully parked automobile that was not in any way impeding traffic or threatening public safety and convenience, appears to advert to the \"caretaking\u201d function in stating \"that the police could not have reasonably left\u201d Krezen\u2019s purse in plain view on the front seat of her \u2022 automobile.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has not recognized a \"caretaking\u201d function under the Fourth Amendment except in the context of a lawful impoundment; unless the vehicle has been lawfully impounded, an inventory search and seizure cannot be justified on the basis of the Fourth Amendment caretaking rationale elucidated by the United States Supreme Court. Here there was no lawful impoundment.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The lead opinion acknowledges that \"[t]he true issue is whether the initial impoundment of Krez<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>en\u2019s car was a constitutional violation.\u201d Reliance is then placed on an \"unclear\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Grand Rapids police departmental policy. The opinion states that while impoundment might constitute an unreasonable seizure and violate the Fourth Amendment in particular factual situations, \"the specific facts in this case render the impoundment decision eminently reasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Reference is then made to <em>Cooper v California, </em>386 US 58, 62; 87 S Ct 788; 17 L Ed 2d 730 (1967), where the United States Supreme Court said, \"[W]e cannot hold unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment the examination or search of a car <em>validly held by officers for use as evidence in a forfeiture proceeding.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) <em>Cooper, </em>thus, like <em>Opperman, </em>upheld the inventorying of an automobile that had been validly seized by the police and lends no support for the conclusion of the lead opinion on the \"true issue\u201d of whether the initial impoundment of Krezen\u2019s automobile was a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The lead opinion next refers to <em>Cady v Dombrowski, </em>where the Court upheld a search of the trunk of an automobile. <em>Cady, </em>too, is inapposite because the police had the undoubted right, as the United States Supreme Court said, to exercise a form of custody or control over the vehicle which had been disabled as a result of a one-car accident and constituted a nuisance along the highway; the respondent was so intoxicated, as the United States Supreme Court carefully noted, that he could not make arrangements to have the vehicle towed and stored.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The lead opinion then states its conclusion, which rests on the inapposite <em>Cady </em>decision and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>five decisions of other courts, all but one of which are distinguishable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-4\">In the instant case, the impoundment of Krezen\u2019s car without a warrant was not unreasonable per se. As in <em>Cady, </em>the car was not on the premises of its owner, and, once the arrest occurred, it was no longer in the owner\u2019s actual possession. While \"impounding\u201d a house without a warrant just because the defendant was arrested outside of the house could, under certain circumstances, be unreasonable per se, a car is a different matter. Its very nature as a transportable nonfixed item makes it and its contents more subject to theft or damage. <em>Cady, </em>pp 441-442. A number of courts have recognized that the possibility of theft or vandalism is a valid reason for impounding a car upon the arrest of the driver, especially where no other person is present to take control of the car. See, e.g., <em>United States v Staller, </em>616 F2d 1284 (CA 5, 1980); <em>United States v Scott, </em>665 F2d 874 (CA 9, 1981); <em>Cabbler v Superintendent, Virginia State Penitentiary, </em>528 F2d 1142 (CA 4, 1975); <em>State v Sims, </em>426 So 2d 148 (La, 1983). Other courts have recognized that leaving a car parked in a private location may be a nuisance. <em>United States v Brown, </em>787 F2d 929 (CA 4, 1986). The impoundment was a caretaking function rather than an investigative one, instituted according to standard departmental policy to protect the defendant and the police from unnecessary thefts, recriminations, and civil suits.[<footnotemark>44</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The lead opinion thus would hold that impoundment of Krezen\u2019s automobile was justified on the bases \"that the possibility of theft or vandalism is a valid reason for impounding a car upon the arrest of the driver\u201d or that \"leaving a car parked in a private location may be a nuisance.\u201d The only case cited which might be said to support allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>impoundment on those leases is <em>United States v Staller, supra, </em>1290, where the Court held an impoundment reasonable where the automobile was legally parked in a mall parking lot; no valuables were visible but the police felt that \"a car parked overnight in a mall parking lot runs an appreciable risk of vandalism or theft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The other four cases cited do not support the propositions advanced in the lead opinion. The automobile in <em>United States v Scott </em>could not be locked nor the windows closed to safeguard the contents. A United States treasury check was removed by the police for safekeeping. The defendant had failed to secure his property although he had assured the police that he had done so. Krezen was not given the option to secure her automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">In <em>Cabbler v Superintendent </em>the automobile was parked in a hospital emergency driveway when the driver was arrested. Clearly, an automobile in a hospital emergency driveway is distinguishable from an automobile, such as Krezen\u2019s, that was legally parked in an airport parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">While the Court in <em>State v Sims </em>noted that the automobile might possibly have been vandalized, it also was stated that an officer was concerned that the automobile was obstructing the view of drivers turning onto a highway. Krezen\u2019s automobile was, again, legally parked and not obstructing the views of drivers. Further, the Supreme Court of Louisiana considers as a factor whether the driver was asked if he consented to a search, if the automobile contained valuables, or if he had consented to the failure to afford him the protection of an inventory search.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">In <em>United States v Brown </em>the driver had pulled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>into a small parking lot; The court said it was reasonable to impound the automobile because it would present a nuisance if it remained there until the next day or longer. Krezen\u2019s automobile was not parked in a small lot serving nearby businesses and apartments, but in an airport parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The lead opinion does not distinguish Fourth Amendment decisions, which represent the clear weight of authority,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> stating that a person who is arrested must be given the option of leaving a legally parked automobile where it is, even when valuables are visible. The \"caretaking\u201d rationale for impoundment is inapposite when the person arrested does not desire that the police safeguard the person\u2019s property and accepts responsibility for possible losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">If the safeguarding-visible-valuables rationale were to be adopted, an effort might be made to extend that rationale to allow impoundment of automobiles that contain expensive car stereo systems, telephones, or other expensive accessories. If the value of the property is a factor, that rationale might be extended to justify the impoundment of all late-model automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Since the Krezen automobile could not have been impounded as an incident to her arrest, I fail to see the difference between Krezen\u2019s automobile and an automobile that is parked for several days in an airport parking lot by a citizen who is not arrested\u2014some persons leave their automobiles for over a week, or several weeks, at airport parking lots. Suppose the airport parking attendants who periodically check automobiles parked for ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>tended periods of time observe valuables in plain view. No one has been arrested. The automobile is legally parked. Do they have the obligation or right to call the police; do the police have the obligation or right to enter the automobile and \"safeguard\u201d the valuables? Of course not. On what basis then do the police have that obligation or right or authority in the instant case? If it be said that here Krezen was arrested and that that gave rise to a \"caretaking\u201d responsibility for the safety of her property, it would once again be relevant that the \"caretaking\u201d rationale was developed in respect to lawfully impounded automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">It also is again relevant that the police have no civil duty and are not subject to liability, under <em>Ross, </em>for failing to safeguard a citizen\u2019s property.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The concurring opinion states that while impoundment of the automobile was improper, the impoundment of the purse was proper because the police could not have reasonably left it there in plain view, and could not be expected to hand it to Krezen (presumably because it might contain a weapon) without checking the contents, and upon checking the contents they would have found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>incriminating evidence. Assuming for the moment that the police have the right or obligation to safeguard Krezen\u2019s property, there was another alternative. The police had demanded and obtained the keys to her automobile. The purse could have been put in the trunk of the automobile for safekeeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The purse was Krezen\u2019s property. It was her property that the police assert they were seeking to protect. Assuming that the police had some obligation or right in respect to safeguarding the purse because it was in plain view, they would have discharged that obligation by asking her if she wished to leave it there in plain view (running the risk of theft), or to have it placed in the trunk, or to have it returned to her after it had been searched for weapons. Having in mind that we are talking about safeguarding Krezen\u2019s property, she should have been given those options. The clear weight of authority is that arrested persons should be given the option of having the police \"safeguard\u201d their property or of leaving it at risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">We would affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b774-7\">Cavanagh and Archer, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b750-12\"> MCL 333.7403; MSA 14.15(7403).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b750-13\"> <em>People v Krezen, </em>143 Mich App 34; 371 NW2d 882 (1985).

The person who was arrested claimed that when he went to pick up his automobile his valuables were gone, and then commenced an action against the officer claiming that the failure to follow departmental procedures regarding the impounding of the automobile was a cause of the loss.

In <em>Jones v State, </em>407 So 2d 870 (Ala Crim App, 1981), impoundment was found reasonable where the driver ran away, the passenger was incoherent, and the vehicle was blocking a private driveway. In <em>State v Greenway, </em>15 Wash App 216; 547 P2d 1231 (1976), impoundment was found proper where a driver was arrested on a felony charge, his vehicle was parked in a restricted area where vehicles were removed from time to time due to a sewer project, and the court was concerned that he would be incarcerated for a considerable length of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">In <em>State v Callaway, </em>106 Wis 2d 503; 317 NW2d 428 (1982), the Wisconsin Supreme Court found impoundment reasonable where a vehicle was stopped in a no-parking area. Although on-street parking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>was allowed until 2 a.m., some twenty feet away, the court decided that the arrestee\u2019s inability to pay his fine meant the vehicle would have been illegally parked. In <em>Villarreal v State, </em>703 SW2d 301 (Tex Crim App, 1985), the court decided that the police would have been derelict in their duty if they had left a vehicle on the street, unprotected, with the keys in it when defendant was arrested for a serious offense and was unlikely to return shortly,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b764-10\"> Because Krezen might have properly asked a police officer who made such an offer to place her purse in the trunk of the automobile it does not appear that the drug paraphernalia or brown vial would have been inevitably discovered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b764-11\"> US Const, Am IV.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"ARu\"> Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b765-8\"> It is a familiar principle that courts avoid grappling with constitutional questions if the cause can be decided on other grounds.

This I expect is a result of the leadership of the federal courts in imposing limitations on police conduct on the basis of the federal constitution before the state courts had developed a search and seizure jurisprudence in the exposition of the state\u2019s statutory, common, or constitutional law. The analysis and structure provided by the federal decisions tended to be adopted, in the absence of a developed state jurisprudence, as part of state jurisprudence without recognition either that the authority of the police to search and seize might be analyzed as a question of state law (common law, statutory law, or constitutional law) or that the limitation imposed by the Fourth Amendment did not preclude the development of state search and seizure jurisprudence (common law, statutory law, or constitutional law) that did not authorize conduct proscribed by the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b765-10\"> MCL 764.1-764.24; MSA 28.860-28.883.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b765-11\"> MCL 764.25-764.25b; MSA 28.884-28.884(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\"> These are examples, and no effort has been made to anticipate or compile an exhaustive list.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b766-9\"> Since the police were not authorized to impound Krezen\u2019s automobile, they were not authorized to examine or inventory the contents of her purse, and the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the evidence obtained when her purse was opened should be suppressed.

Since the lead opinion would so decide the Fourth Amendment question not decided by the United States Supreme Court, it should, to the extent reversal of the Court of Appeals is predicated on the fear of civil suit rationale, first also address the state and federal law questions that it states are still open.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
