The trial court sustained defendant\u2019s demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint, without leave to amend. This appeal followed. For reasons explained in the opinion, we agree with the trial court\u2019s determination that plaintiffs have not stated any cause of action against defendant, nor is there any reasonable possibility that the defects in their complaint can be cured by amendment. Treating the order sustaining the demurrer as a judgment of dismissal, we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>FACTS<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">In the mid-1980\u2019s, plaintiffs built a solar home on their property in Los Gatos, after obtaining permits to do so from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">In 1991, defendant acquired a parcel of land that adjoins plaintiffs\u2019 property, and defendant placed that land in a parks reserve. There is a grove of five or six trees growing on defendant\u2019s land. Since 1991, those trees have been growing at the rate of 10 to 15 feet per year. By 2004, the trees were about 100 feet taller than when defendant acquired the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">In 1997, plaintiffs\u2019 solar system began to malfunction because the trees on defendant\u2019s land interfered with the sunlight reaching their solar panels. Despite numerous requests from plaintiffs, and notwithstanding verbal promises by \u201ccertain officials and certain individuals that this situation would be corrected,\u201d defendant did not trim or remove the trees.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">In April and May 2004, plaintiffs filed tort claims with defendant. According to plaintiffs, \u201cthere was no time limit\u201d for filing these claims, because their injury was of a \u201ccontinuing\u201d nature. Defendant rejected the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">In May 2004, plaintiffs brought this action against defendant. The verified complaint asserted causes of action for nuisance, trespass, statutory violations constituting negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. As to their negligence claim, plaintiffs alleged that defendant violated various statutes, including the Solar Shade Control Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">In July 2004, defendant demurred to the complaint. In support of its demurrer, defendant asked the trial court to take judicial notice of a Santa Clara County ordinance entitled \u201cExemption from Solar Shade Control Act.\u201d Plaintiffs opposed the demurrer, but not defendant\u2019s request for judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">In September 2004, after a hearing on the matter, the trial court sustained defendant\u2019s demurrer, granting plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint within 20 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">Plaintiffs filed a verified first amended complaint in September 2004. Among other things, the amended complaint asserted a new cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>for breach of contract, as well as plaintiffs\u2019 previous claims for nuisance, negligence, trespass, violation of statute, and emotional distress. As to their new contract claim, plaintiffs alleged a contract with defendant based on its grant of building permits for their solar home. Plaintiffs attached the permits as an exhibit to the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The first amended complaint drew another demurrer, which defendant filed in October 2004. Again, plaintiffs opposed the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Following a hearing held in December 2004, the trial court entered its formal order sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend. Defendant gave notice of the order in January 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">THRESHOLD ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Before analyzing the substantive issues raised in this appeal, we first address two threshold procedural questions: whether we may review the challenged order at all, and if so, what standards govern that review.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">\n<em>Appealability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">Although plaintiffs\u2019 form notice of appeal refers to a judgment of dismissal, the appellate record contains no judgment. This appeal thus appears to have been taken from the order sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint, without leave to amend. \u201cOrders sustaining demurrers are not appealable.\u201d <em>(Hill </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1684, 1695 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 125].) But \u201can appellate court may deem an order sustaining a demurrer to incorporate a judgment of dismissal.\u201d <em>(Molien v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 916, 920 [167 Cal.Rptr. 831, 616 P.2d 813].) It is particularly appropriate to do so when the absence of a final judgment results from inadvertence or mistake. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 921.)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">In this case, defendant does not argue for dismissal of the appeal, and the issues are fully briefed. (See <em>Gu </em>v. <em>BMW of North America, LLC, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th 195.) Under the circumstances, we will decide this case on its merits by treating the order as incorporating a judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-13\">\n<em>Standard and Scope of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">We review a trial court\u2019s decision to sustain a demurrer for an abuse of discretion. (See, e.g., <em>Hendy v. Losse </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 723, 742 [1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 543, 819 P.2d 1].) We likewise review a trial court\u2019s denial of leave to amend for an abuse of discretion. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cAs a general rule, if there is a reasonable possibility the defect in the complaint could be cured by amendment, it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.\u201d <em>(City of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445, 459 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 329]. See also, e.g., <em>Schifando v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1074, 1081 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 457, 79 P.3d 569]; <em>Gu v. BMW of North America, LLC, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th 195.) \u201cNevertheless, where the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is clear, and under substantive law no liability exists, a court should deny leave to amend because no amendment could change the result.\u201d <em>(City of Atascadero, </em>at pp. 459-460.)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">In analyzing the existence of liability under the governing substantive law, \u201cwe exercise our independent judgment about whether the complaint states a cause of action as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Montclair Parkowners Assn. v. City of Montclair </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 784, 790 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 598].)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">\u201cIn reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer, we are guided by long-settled rules. \u2018We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. [Citation.] We also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.\u2019 [Citation.] Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.\u201d <em>(Blank v. Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58].)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">On appeal, \u201cthe plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the trial court erred.\u201d <em>(Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 879 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 151].) If the claimed error is the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit amendment of the complaint, the \u201cplaintiff has the burden of proving that an amendment would cure the defect.\u201d <em>(Schifando </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 1081.)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">In this case, plaintiffs bear the further burden of particularity in pleading their tort-based causes of action, since defendant is a public entity. \u201cUnder the Government Tort Liability Act, all liability is statutory. Hence, the rule that statutory causes of action must be specifically pleaded applies, and every element of the statutory basis for liability must be alleged.\u201d (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Pleading, \u00a7 579, pp. 675-676. See, e.g., <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 780, 792-793 [221 Cal.Rptr. 840, 710 P.2d 907].)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">With those principles in mind, we consider the sufficiency of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint under the governing substantive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we address each of the six asserted causes of action of plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint. We conclude that none is viable nor is there any reasonable possibility of cure. In the published portion of this opinion, we discuss only plaintiffs\u2019 third cause of action, which asserts negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">\n<em>First Cause of Action-Second Cause of Action:</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">\n<em>Third Cause of Action: Negligence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">One essential element of a cause of action for negligence is a legal duty. <em>(Potter v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 965, 984 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 550, 863 P.2d 795].) \u201cThat duty may be imposed by law, be assumed by the defendant, or exist by virtue of a special relationship.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 985.) In this case, plaintiffs base their negligence claim on the asserted breach of a statutory duty arising under the Solar Shade Control Act. (See Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25980-25986.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">\n<em>Governing Substantive Law: The Solar Shade Control Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">\u201cThe Solar Shade Control Act . . . provides limited protection to owners of solar collectors from shading caused by trees on adjacent properties.\u201d (Sher <em>v. Leiderman </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 867, 880 [226 Cal.Rptr. 698], fn. omitted.) Enacted in 1978, the act has been described as \u201cprotecting active or passive solar energy systems (SES\u2019s) against obstruction by later-planted or later-grown trees and foliage . . . .\u201d <em>(Kucera </em>v. <em>Lizza </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1152 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 582], statutory citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">In pertinent part, the act provides: \u201cAfter January 1, 1979, no person owning, or in control of a property shall allow a tree or shrub to be placed, or, if placed, to grow on such property, subsequent to the installation of a solar collector on the property of another so as to cast a shadow greater than 10 percent of the collector absorption area\u201d during midday hours as specified in the statute. (\u00a7 25982; see generally 11 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>Equity, \u00a7 137 p. 820.)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">The act permits local jurisdictions to exempt themselves from its operation. The exemption provision states: \u201cAny city, or for unincorporated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>areas, any county, may adopt, by majority vote of the governing body, an ordinance exempting their jurisdiction from the provisions of this chapter. The adoption of such an ordinance shall not be subject to the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (commencing with Section 21000).\u201d (\u00a7 25985.)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">\n<em>The Parties\u2019 Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The parties disagree on whether the Solar Shade Control Act applies in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under defendant\u2019s interpretation of the act, there can be no liability here because defendant did not plant or \u201cplace\u201d the trees for purposes of the statute. In other words, there is no statutory violation because these were not \u201clater-planted\u201d trees. <em>(Kucera v. Lizza, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at p. 1152.) Plaintiffs dispute that interpretation, urging that defendant is liable under the Act, because it permitted the trees to grow. As plaintiffs see it, liability attaches for these \u201clater-grown\u201d trees. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The parties also disagree about the statutory exemption. Defendant asserts that it is exempt from the act, having adopted an ordinance as authorized by section 25985. Plaintiffs argue against application of the exemption here, asserting \u201cthat there was already in existence a continuing duty on the part of the County\u201d when it adopted the ordinance and a continuing breach of that duty when plaintiffs\u2019 solar system began to fail. Plaintiffs thus contend; \u201cThe County should be liable for any of the damages they had already caused.\u201d They characterize defendant\u2019s use of the exemption provision as \u201ca quasi-ex post facto application on the part of the County.\u201d As we understand it, the essence of plaintiffs\u2019 argument on this point is that defendant\u2019s ordinance offends constitutional principles because it operates retroactively, defeating their preexisting damage claims. Defendant does not specifically meet that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">As we now explain, plaintiffs\u2019 statutory claim cannot be maintained because defendant is exempt from the Solar Shade Control Act by virtue of its adoption of a qualifying ordinance, as permitted by section 25985. Given that determination, we need not address the parties\u2019 differing interpretations of other provisions of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>\u201c \u2018In passing on the validity of an ordinance or a statute it will be presumed that it is valid.\u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Industry v. Willey </em>(1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 658, 663 [89 Cal.Rptr. 922].)  \u201cWe interpret ordinances by the same rules applicable to statutes.\u201d <em>(Carson Harbor Village, Ltd. </em>v. <em>City of Carson Mobilehome Park Rental Review Bd. </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 281, 290 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 569].)</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Here, plaintiffs do not make a facial attack on the validity of either the ordinance or the enabling statute. Instead, they object to defendant\u2019s use of the statutory exemption to the extent that it operates retrospectively to extinguish their statutory claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">\u201cAlthough the courts normally construe statutes to operate prospectively, the courts correlatively hold under the common law that when a pending action rests solely on a statutory basis, and when no rights have vested under the statute, \u2018a repeal of such a statute without a saving clause will terminate all pending actions based thereon.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Governing Board </em>v. <em>Mann </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 819, 829 [135 Cal.Rptr. 526, 558 P.2d 1].) In other words, where \u201cthe Legislature has conferred a remedy and withdraws it by amendment or repeal of the remedial statute, the new statutory scheme may be applied to pending actions without triggering retrospectivity concerns . . . .\u201d <em>(Brenton </em>v. <em>Metabolife Internat., Inc. </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 679, 690 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 702].) Furthermore, legislative action \u201ccan effect a partial <em>repeal </em>of an existing statute.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c \u2018The justification for this rule is that all statutory remedies are pursued with full realization that the legislature may abolish the right to recover at any time.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Governing Board, </em>at p. 829.) That common law principle has been codified in California, as follows: \u201cAny statute may be repealed at any time, except when vested rights would be impaired. Persons acting under any statute act in contemplation of this power of repeal.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 9606.)  The substance of the legislation determines whether it constitutes a repeal. <em>(Southern Service Co., Ltd. v. Los Angeles </em>(1940) 15 Cal.2d 1, 13 [97 P.2d 963].)</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">Applying the foregoing principle to the case at hand, we conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action was eliminated by defendant\u2019s ordinance. In reaching that conclusion, we consider four factors: the statutory nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim; the unvested nature of plaintiffs\u2019 claimed rights; the timing of the elimination of those rights; and the nature of the mechanism by which the right of action was eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">Addressing the first factor, we observe that plaintiffs\u2019 claim is wholly statutory, arising as it does from defendant\u2019s asserted violation of the Solar Shade Control Act. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim is \u201ca cause of action unknown at the common law . . . created by statute . . . .\u201d <em>(Department of Social Welfare </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number><em>Wingo </em>(1946) 77 Cal.App.2d 316, 320 [175 P.2d 262].) It derives from special remedial legislation. (See <em>Southern Service Co., Ltd. v. Los Angeles, supra, </em>15 Cal.2d at p. 12.) In other words, plaintiffs \u201cpossessed no right or remedy . . . which existed apart from the statute itself and which the legislature could not cut off by repeal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 11 [right to tax refund or credit \u201cis purely statutory\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">We next consider whether the nature of plaintiffs\u2019 rights prevents abolition of their claim. Repeal of a remedial statute destroys a pending statutory action unless \u201cvested or contractual rights have arisen under\u201d the statute. <em>(Department of Social Welfare v. Wingo, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.2d at p. 320; see Gov. Code, \u00a7 9606.) In this case, no such rights have arisen. As explained in the unpublished portion of the opinion, plaintiffs have no contractual rights against defendant. Nor do plaintiffs have any vested right in maintaining their statutory claim. \u201c \u2018No person has a vested right in an unenforced statutory penalty or forfeiture.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Department of Social Welfare, </em>at p. 320. Accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>One 1953 Buick </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 358, 366 [19 Cal.Rptr. 488, 369 P.2d 16]; <em>Chapman v. Farr </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 1021, 1024\u20141025 [183 Cal.Rptr. 606].) Until it is fully enforced, a statutory remedy is merely an \u201c \u2018inchoate, incomplete, and unperfected\u2019 \u201d right, which is subject to legislative abolition. <em>(People </em>v. <em>One 1953 Buick, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at p. 365.)</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The third factor in determining whether a statutory claim has been extinguished is timing. Whenever the Legislature eliminates a statutory remedy \u201cbefore a judgment becomes final,\u201d the legislative act \u201cdestroys the right of action.\u201d <em>(Department of Social Welfare v. Wingo, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.2d at p. 320.) Repeal thus \u201cwipes out the cause of action unless the same has been merged into a final judgment.\u201d <em>(Wolf </em>v. <em>Pacific Southwest etc. Corp. </em>(1937) 10 Cal.2d 183, 185 [74 P2d 263].) \u201c \u2018If final relief has not been granted before the repeal goes into effect it cannot be granted afterwards, even if a judgment has been entered and the cause is pending on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Southern Service Co., Ltd. v. Los Angeles, supra, </em>15 Cal.2d at p. 12. See also, e.g., <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Farr, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1024-1025.) As explained in the unpublished portion of the opinion, plaintiffs have no contractual rights against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Finally, we turn to the legislative mechanism by which the right of action is abolished. Typically, that mechanism is repeal or amendment of the remedial statute. (See, e.g., <em>Brenton </em>v. <em>Metabolife Internat., Inc., supra, </em>116 Cal.App.4th at p. 690.) But we know of no rule of law that limits the Legislature to those methods. To the contrary, as our high court has observed, even where \u201cthe words of the . . . statute are not expressly words of repeal without a saving clause, ... tire effect is the same in so far as the application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>of the principles is concerned when the legislature by apt expression has withdrawn the right and remedy in particular cases, including all pending actions based thereon.\u201d <em>(Southern Service Co., Ltd. v. Los Angeles, supra, </em>15 Cal.2d at p. 13.) The critical point is that \u201cthe legislature may take away the right of action itself.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Our high court thus has alluded to the Legislature\u2019s \u201cpower to enact a statute which would cut off the right theretofore accorded the plaintiff. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 12.) It also has spoken of the Legislature\u2019s power to \u201cwithdraw\u201d a statutory right or remedy. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 11, 12; <em>International etc. Workers v. Landowitz </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 418, 421 [126 P.2d 609].) As noted <em>ante, </em>we look to the substance of the legislation\u2014 not its label\u2014to determine whether it operates as a repeal. <em>(Southern Service Co., Ltd. v. Los Angeles, supra, </em>15 Cal.2d at p. 13.) The pivotal issue is whether the legislation constitutes \u201ca substantial reversal of legislative policy\u201d that represents \u201cthe adoption of an entirely new philosophy\u201d vis-a-vis the prior enactment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>One 1953 Buick, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at p. 363.)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">In this case, we conclude, the statutory right of action was eliminated by the exemption provision, which operated as a valid repeal method. Here, at the very time that the Legislature created the statutory right of action under the Solar Shade Control Act, it expressly empowered cities and counties to foreclose such actions against them. In this case, once defendant exercised that power, plaintiffs\u2019 statutory cause of action was abolished. Just as surely as if the Legislature had repealed the Solar Shade Control Act in its entirety, the \u201cstatutory authority for [plaintiffs\u2019] action . . . has now been withdrawn.\u201d <em>(International etc. Workers v. Landowitz, supra, </em>20 Cal.2d at p. 421 [right to enjoin violation of ordinance was lost upon repeal of the enabling statutes].) Put another way, \u201cthe legislature by apt expression has withdrawn the right and remedy\u201d that otherwise would be available to plaintiffs under the Solar Shade Control Act. <em>(Southern Service Co., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, supra, </em>15 Cal.2d at p. 13.) That legislative choice embodies \u201ca substantial reversal of [the] legislative policy\u201d that underpins the remainder of the act and \u201can entirely new philosophy\u201d concerning its mandatory application to local jurisdictions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>One 1953 Buick, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at p. 363.) In short, we conclude, the exemption provision\u2014put in place by the Legislature and adopted by defendant\u2014is a valid mechanism for extinguishing a statutory claim under the Solar Shade Control Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">To sum up, plaintiffs\u2019 statutory cause of action is abolished. Plaintiffs enjoyed no vested rights in this statutory claim, which was unknown at common law, and which was not pursued to final judgment before its elimination by defendant\u2019s use of the exemption provision. That exemption operated as a form of repeal when defendant adopted it, extinguishing plaintiffs\u2019 statutory right of action. Because the mechanism of repeal was authorized by the Legislature, the elimination of plaintiffs\u2019 claim under these circumstances does not implicate retrospectivity concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>\n<em>Fourth Cause of Action:-Sixth Cause of Action:</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">CONCLUSION*</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Treating the trial court\u2019s order as incorporating a judgment of dismissal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Bamattre-Manoukian, Acting P.

In 1979, the Solar Shade Control Act took effect. (\u00a7 25982.) In 1984-1985, plaintiffs built their solar home with county permits. In 1991, defendant acquired the adjoining parcel of land, with the trees already on it, and it placed that land in a parks reserve. In 1997, plaintiffs\u2019 solar system began to fail. In 2002, defendant adopted an ordinance exempting itself from the Solar Shade Control Act. In 2004, plaintiffs filed this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b824-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1013.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
