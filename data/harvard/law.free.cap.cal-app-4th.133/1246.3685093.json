(Mother) and Russell G. (Father) appeal from the order denying rehearing of an order approving the placement of their minor child, I.G., with a maternal cousin, K.W. They argue that the court abused its discretion by placing I.G. with K.W. rather than with her paternal aunt, who they maintain had placement preference under Welfare and Institutions Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 361.3. Mother and Father also claim that the department failed to comply with the Indian Child Welfare Act (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901 (ICWA)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>The San Francisco County Department of Human Services (the Department) moves to dismiss the appeal on the basis that the issues are moot. The Department also filed a motion to introduce additional evidence on appeal pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 909, and for judicial notice. We address these motions with the appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by placing I.G. with K.W. However, in the published portion we agree with Mother and Father that there has been a failure to comply with ICWA requiring remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">The factual and procedural background of this case is detailed in our unpublished opinion (Jan. 24, 2005, A105340). We set forth here only the background relevant to the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">I.G., bom in 2001, initially was found to come within the provision of section 300, subdivisions (b) (failure to protect) and (j) (abuse of sibling). The petition described Mother\u2019s substance abuse, emotional problems, criminal history (including convictions for child cmelty and drug-related offenses), and Mother\u2019s failure to reunify with six other dependent children. The Department detained I.G. two days after her birth, and the court ordered her continued detention on May 24, 2001. Over the next 27 months, I.G. was placed at various times with both parents, Mother, and in out-of-home placements. Reunification services for Father were terminated on February 21, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">The Department again detained I.G. on August 26, 2003, due to allegations that Mother abandoned I.G. and had an untreated substance abuse problem. Father filed a section 388 petition on October 2, 2003, seeking to place I.G. with T.G., Father\u2019s sister. On October 11, 2003, the Department placed I.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>with K.W., a maternal cousin in Compton.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Counsel for I.G. moved to decrease visitation. The court granted the motion on October 27, 2003, and ordered monthly visitation for both parents, with transportation costs paid for by the Department. The court denied Father\u2019s section 388 petition. On January 12, 2004, the court terminated reunification services for Mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Following the hearings on Father\u2019s section 388 petition and the section 387 disposition, the juvenile court acknowledged that T.G. was \u201ca relative entitled to preferential consideration under section 361.3,\u201d but denied the petition on the basis that it was not in the best interests of I.G. at that time. The court continued I.G.\u2019s placement with K.W., and continued the monthly visitation schedule for both parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">Mother and Father filed a motion for rehearing. The juvenile court indicated that T.G. was \u201ca preferred relative under [section] 361.3[, subd.] (c)(2). Mother\u2019s cousin [K.W.] is not.\u201d Nevertheless, the court held that \u201cthe commissioner was obligated to make an independent determination utilizing the criteria set forth in [section] 361.3 to determine which placement would be in [I.G.\u2019s] best interest, regardless of whether one of the placements was a preferred relative and the other was a non-preferred relative.\u201d The court denied the application for rehearing, noting that \u201c[a]lthough [T.G.] may be a \u2018preferred relative\u2019 under [section] 361.3[, subd.] (c)(2), she is not the better placement for [I.G.].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">In our January 24, 2005 opinion in case No. A105340, we ordered the juvenile court to set a section 366.26 hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On February 7, 2005, the juvenile court held a hearing in this matter. As indicated at that hearing, \u201cwe are on calendar for a settlement conference on a number of issues, including a 388, parental visitation, and a 366.26 hearing.\u201d The court indicated that \u201cWe have had brief discussions. I think that we all are on the same page at this point, and I want to reiterate what the agreement is and make the orders so that people are comfortable with it.\u201d The court granted the section 388 petition filed by LG.\u2019s paternal aunt, T.G., changing I.G.\u2019s placement from the home of K.W. to T.G.\u2019s home in Concord. The court ordered that the parents continue to have monthly visits with I.G., supervised by T.G., and weekly telephone calls. Finally, pursuant to our opinion, it issued an order setting the section 366.26 hearing for June 15, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>in.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">A. Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">1. <em>Placement of LG. with K.W.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">2. <em>Compliance with ICWA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">Mother and Father argue that the prior placement order must be vacated because the Department failed to comply with the notice provisions of ICWA (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902). They do not identify any order in which the court addressed compliance with ICWA. Instead, noting that the issue of compliance with ICWA may be raised at any time, they assert that the \u201cDepartment and juvenile court violated the ICWA because there is no evidence that the social worker made any further inquiry or, at the very least, sent notice to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. . . . This is not a case of adequate proof of notice before the juvenile court, but of no notice at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">The Department first received information that Mother might have Native American heritage in April 2003. Mother told a social worker in Reno, Nevada that she was part Native American, which she claimed was \u201cpart of the reason\u201d for her alcohol problem. \u201c[Wjhen the juvenile court knows or has reason to believe the child may be an Indian child, notice must be given to the particular tribe in question or the Secretary. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a); [citations].) . . . [I]t was actually the duty of the [Department] to notify the Tribe or the Secretary [of the Interior] of the filing of the petition by registered mail, return receipt requested. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a).)\u201d <em>(In re Desiree F. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 460, 471 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 688].) Rule 1439(f) of the California Rules of Court<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> mandates the following notice procedure: \u201c(1) Notice . . . must be sent ... by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, and additional notice by first class mail is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>recommended. (2) Notice to the tribe must be to the tribal chairperson unless the tribe has designated another agent for service. (3) Notice must be sent to all tribes of which the child may be a member or may be eligible for membership. (4) If the identity or location of the parent or Indian custodian or the tribe cannot be determined, notice must be sent to the specified office of the Secretary of the Interior, which has 15 days to provide notice as required . . . .\u201d Subdivision (g)(1) provides that \u201cA tribe\u2019s determination that the child is or is not a member of or eligible for membership in the tribe is conclusive.\u201d (Rule 1439(g).) Substantial compliance with the notice requirements of ICWA may be sufficient under certain circumstances. <em>(In re Christopher I. </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 533, 565 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 122].) \u201cThe failure to provide the necessary notice requires this court to invalidate actions taken in violation of the ICWA and remand the case unless the tribe has participated in or expressly indicated no interest in the proceedings. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Desiree F., supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at p. 472.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">The Department is required to file with the court \u201ca copy of the notice sent and the return receipt, as well as any correspondence received from the Indian entity relevant to the minor\u2019s status.\u201d <em>(In re Marinna J. </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 731, 739-740, fn. 4 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 267].) Notice to the Bureau of Indian Affairs is required only if \u201cthe identity or location of the parent or Indian custodian or the tribe cannot be determined . . . .\u201d (Rule 1439(f)(4); see 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">The Department has filed a motion to consider additional evidence on appeal on this issue. This additional evidence consists of copies of letters and forms sent by the Department to various Indian tribes and to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the responses to these letters, as well as the transcript of a November 30, 2004 hearing at which the court mentioned ICWA issues.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">At the November 30, 2004 hearing, the court indicated that \u201cThere were some possible Indian Child Welfare Act noticing issues. The Department has sought to correct those issues by re-noticing. Part of our off-the-record discussions included a somewhat informal discussion regarding Mother\u2019s interest in attempting to determine whether or not she is related culturally to any of the existing tribes at this point. I have suggested to counsel and I will suggest to . . . Mother if she is further interested, if she has other tribes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>notice, we will be happy to notice them for her, meaning the Department. . . . So at this point I think the noticing issues have been addressed. So I am a hundred percent clear, if . . . Mother has other tribes she wishes to have noticed, those tribes will be identified and given to [the Department] and they will be noticed also.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">The Department maintains that the juvenile court made an \u201cimplied finding\u201d that ICWA did not apply, and that the additional evidence it seeks to be considered on appeal constitutes substantial evidence supporting this \u201cimplied\u201d ruling. In <em>In re Nikki R. </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 844 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 256], the court considered a similar situation. There, the social worker had likewise sent notices to one Native American tribe and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and received negative responses to the queries of whether the minor was an Indian child in relation to the tribe and whether any other tribe to which the child might belong could be identified. On appeal, the Orange County Social Services Agency filed a motion to take additional evidence, consisting of the notices to the tribe and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and their responses. The court held: \u201cIt is a trial court function to receive evidence of [the Department\u2019s] notice efforts and to determine if they measure up to ICWA standards. ...[][] [The Department\u2019s] apparent practice of holding onto the evidence of its notice efforts and revealing it only when an issue arises on appeal is unacceptable. \u2018Making the appellate court the trier of fact is not the solution. \u2019. . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 852-853, citing <em>In re Jennifer A. </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 692, 703 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 54].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">Here, the Department seeks to introduce evidence of notice to various tribes and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The record does not demonstrate that any of these documents were introduced in evidence in the juvenile court. Consequently, we deny the Department\u2019s motion to consider this additional evidence. Whether or not we consider the court\u2019s statements at the November 30, 2004 hearing to be \u201cimplied finding[s],\u201d the court did not have sufficient evidence before it to make a finding that ICWA did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">B. Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">As earlier noted, I.G. was originally detained by the Department in 2001 when she was two days old. Now she is four and a half years old, and still there is no permanent placement plan yet ordered. When we filed our prior decision in case No. A105340 on January 24th of this year, we ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>the juvenile court to set a section 366.26 hearing. We were recently informed, in connection with a writ proceeding filed by Mother,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that the section 366.26 hearing has finally been set for December 5th of this year, <em>almost 11 months </em>after we ordered the juvenile court to conduct such a hearing. It is well recognized that timeliness is of vital importance in juvenile dependency matters because delay usually does not serve a child\u2019s interests. (See <em>In re Emily L. </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 734, 743 [260 Cal.Rptr. 810].) Only last year our Supreme Court reminded juvenile and appellate courts of this state of \u201cthe strong countervailing interest, expressed by the Legislature itself, that dependency actions be resolved expeditiously. [Citations.])\u201d <em>(In re Jesusa V. </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 588, 625 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 205, 85 P.3d 2].) The delay in these proceedings is inexcusable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">Additionally, now we have an ICWA problem, apparently occasioned by the inattention of both the Department and the juvenile court to the stringent requirements of that federal law. We are most mindful of the potential adverse impact from any deficiency in complying with ICWA given the fact that noncompliance can invalidate the actions of the juvenile court, including placement orders. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914 [tribe may petition to invalidate action on showing of violation of notice requirements]; <em>In re Desiree F., supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at p. 475 [trial court orders invalidated at the request of the tribe because notice had not been given in compliance with ICWA]; rule 1439(n)(2) [final decree of adoption may be set aside for noncompliance with ICWA].) Consequently, we agree with those courts that have emphasized the importance of strict compliance with ICWA notice requirements and, if necessary, have remanded the matter for the juvenile court to ensure that proper notice is given. <em>(In re Karla C. </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 166, 178-179 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 205]; <em>In re Nikki R., supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at pp. 855-856; <em>In re H.A. </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 1206, 1214 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 12].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">Noncompliance with ICWA has been a continuing problem in juvenile dependency proceedings conducted in this state, and, by not adhering to this legal requirement, we do a disservice to those vulnerable minors whose welfare we are statutorily mandated to protect. The virtual epidemic of cases where reversals have been required because of noncompliance with ICWA was noted by one of our Fourth District, Division Three colleagues almost three years ago: \u201cIn at least five opinions published in the last two months, appellate courts have admonished juvenile courts and social services agencies for giving the ICWA notice provisions short shrift. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Antoinette S. </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1417 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 15] (dis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>opn. of Moore, J.).) Since then, reversals continue, seemingly at an unabated rate. (See <em>In re Jonathon S. </em>(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 334 [28 Cal.Rptr.3d 495]; <em>In re Glorianna K. </em>(2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 1443 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 582]; <em>In re Merrick V. </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 235 [19 Cal.Rptr.3d 490]; <em>In re Elizabeth W. </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 900 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 514]; <em>In re Gerardo A. </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 988 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 798]; <em>In re S.M. </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1108 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 606]; <em>In re Louis S. </em>(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 622 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 110]; <em>In re Karla C., supra, </em>113 Cal.App.4th 166; <em>In re D.T. </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1449 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 893]; <em>In re Nikki R., supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th 844; <em>In re Asia L. </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 498 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 733].) In addition to these published opinions, there have been \u201c \u2018numerous appellate complaints of non-compliance with ICWA,\u2019 \u201d leading to 72 <em>unpublished cases statewide in this year alone </em>reversing, in whole or in part, because of noncompliance with ICWA.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (See <em>In re Elizabeth W., supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 906.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">While this panel lacks the ability to stem the tide of this disgraceful statewide record, we can exercise our judicial power to lend assistance to young I.G. Accordingly, in the interests of justice upon remand, we direct that all further proceedings be conducted before the Supervising Judge of the Unified Family Court of the San Francisco Superior Court, and that this case be afforded the expeditious and diligent attention it so clearly deserves and needs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">The motion for additional evidence on appeal is denied.

In some of the cases where reversals or vacations of juvenile orders were required, the reversals were \u201cconditional,\u201d meaning that if the trial courts on remand determined that there had been compliance with ICWA, the vacated orders could be reinstated. (See <em>In re H.A., supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 1215.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">One can hardly blame this chronic problem on the state\u2019s Judicial Council or its educational arms, the Center for Judicial Education and Research (CJER), and the Center for Families, Children, and the Courts, which offer regular courses (including online courses) and written materials dealing with ICWA compliance. (See Appen. to Cal. Rules of Court (2005) Standards of Judicial Administration Recommended by the Judicial Council, \u00a7\u00a7 25.2 [Judicial Education For Judicial Officers in Particular Judicial Assignments] &amp; 25.3 [Judicial Education Curricula Provided in Particular Judicial Assignments] (Standards of Judicial Administration); &lt;http://serranus.courtinfo.ca.gov/education&gt;. [As of Nov. 4, 2005.]) The sheer volume of cases demonstrating noncompliance with ICWA provides reason enough for supervising juvenile court judges throughout this state to take immediate steps to ensure that all judicial officers under their supervision avail themselves of these educational opportunities. Indeed, continuing education for juvenile law judicial officers is mandated by section 25.2 of the Standards of Judicial Administration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1031-8\"> Under Code of Civil Procedure section 187, courts have wide latitude to carry out their authority to enter such an order by \u201cany suitable process or mode of proceeding ... which may appear most conformable to the spirit of this Code.\u201d The power to direct such proceedings have been applied, in other contexts, to proceedings before the juvenile court.
