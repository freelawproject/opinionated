He was the guardian of Barryn Davis, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-13\">During the 1999 Thanksgiving holiday, Davis, Sr., developed an upper respiratory infection. Davis, Sr., then developed bronchitis, which spread to the heart. The virus caused a viral myocarditis that led to Davis, Sr.\u2019s sudden death by heart attack at his home on December 15, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b788-15\">\n<em>Procedure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b788-16\">Cynthia Jackson, as the guardian ad litem for Barryn Davis, Jr., filed an application for adjudication of claim asserting that Davis, Sr.\u2019s heart attack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>arose out of and in the course of his employment. In those proceedings, Jackson invoked the presumption contained in Labor Code section 3212.2, which provides in relevant part: \u201cIn the case of officers and employees in the Department of Corrections having custodial duties, ... the term \u2018injury\u2019 includes heart trouble which develops or manifests itself during a period while such officer or employee is in the service of such department or hospital. [j[] . . . [j[] Such heart trouble so developing or manifesting itself in such cases shall be presumed to arise out of and in the course of the employment. This presumption is disputable and may be controverted by other evidence, but unless so controverted, the appeals board is bound to find in accordance with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">The matter was submitted on the police report, the coroner\u2019s report, and the reports of two physicians concerning Davis, Sr.\u2019s heart trouble. On the applicant\u2019s behalf, Robert A. Blau, M.D., stated he believed that Davis, Sr.\u2019s heart attack stemmed from upper respiratory infection. Dr. Blau\u2019s report concluded that under Labor Code section \u201c3212[.2], heart disease developing, manifesting or progressing during an individual\u2019s employment as a peace officer is considered to be an industrial injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The Department of Corrections submitted a report by Eugene Ogrod, M.D. Dr. Ogrod conceded that Davis, Sr., died of a heart problem that derived from his respiratory illness. Dr. Ogrod, however, argued that the viral process \u201ccan be acquired in the course of a variety of daily activities in which there is contact with the public. So, there is nothing specific about the patient\u2019s occupation that would lead us to conclude that his viral infection and the secondary myocarditis was occupationally related.\u201d The doctor continued, \u201cabsent the application of the heart problem presumption, we would consider this a nonoccupational medical problem.\u201d Dr. Ogrod\u2019s report concluded, \u201c[t]here would be nothing in the sequence of events that would be linked to a specific occupation or to suggest that his occupation placed him at greater risk for developing this set of problems. If the heart problem presumption is applied, it is applied on an administrative basis. I am not saying it is inappropriate to apply it on that basis. I am simply saying that there is no medical basis that would justify linking this patient\u2019s acute medical problems to his occupation, absent an administrative decision to apply the presumption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded that Dr. Ogrod\u2019s medical opinion did not overcome the presumption of Labor Code section 3212.2 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>found that Davis, Sr.\u2019s injury was industrial. The Department of Corrections filed a petition for reconsideration of the ALJ\u2019s decision. The WCAB granted the petition for reconsideration. The WCAB concluded that the medical evidence that the cause of death was \u201cthe non-industrial viral infection that led to the development of the myocarditis\u201d constituted sufficient evidence \u201cto rebut the presumption of industrial causation.\u201d Jackson filed a petition for a writ and we issued a writ of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">\u201cIn our appellate review of the decisions of the appeals board, which exercises a long-acknowledged administrative expertise, we have required that the record contain substantial evidentiary support for the appeals board\u2019s decisions.\u201d <em>(LeVesque v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 627, 635 [83 Cal.Rptr. 208, 463 P.2d 432].) We thus \u201creview the entire record to determine whether the board\u2019s conclusion was supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 637.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">There is no dispute here that Davis, Sr., was an employee of the Department of Corrections with custodial duties who had heart trouble and therefore was entitled to the presumption contained in Labor Code section 3212.2. Thus, the question becomes whether there was substantial evidence to overcome that presumption that Davis, Sr.\u2019s heart trouble arose out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The heart trouble presumption contained in Labor Code section 3212 et seq. (including Lab. Code, \u00a7 3212.2) \u201cwas adopted as a response to the \u2018 \u201cpersisting cleavage in medical theory itself\u2019 ... as to the relationship between stress, physical exertion and progressive heart disease.\u2019 [Citation.] Formerly, \u2018the fate of an individual worker\u2019s claim generally did not turn on the facts of his particular employment or heart attack, but rather was decided almost fortuitously on the basis of which of the two competing schools of medical thought [i.e., those who accept and those who reject the view that stress or exertion can contribute to the development of heart trouble] the lay referee or appeals board decided to endorse in the particular case.\u2019 [Citation.] For 20 years the statute did not prevent proof of preexisting disease, and the Legislature found that in such form it \u2018failed to alleviate the gross inequities and unfairness which flowed from the inevitable and inconclusive \u201cbattle of the experts\u201d . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] The preclusion was adopted as a solution.\u201d <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 770, 775-776 [210 Cal.Rptr. 28].)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>The heart trouble presumption is a presumption affecting the burden of proof and is rebuttable. <em>(Reeves v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 22, 30 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 74].) It imposes the burden on the employer to prove that the applicant\u2019s heart trouble did not arise out of and in the course of his employment. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The heart trouble presumption for some public safety workers contains what is called an \u201canti-attribution clause.\u201d For example, in Labor Code section 3212.5 (which is applicable to police officers and highway patrol members), the anti-attribution clause further qualifies the heart trouble presumption: \u201cSuch heart trouble .... so developing or manifesting itself in such cases shall in no case be attributed to any disease existing prior to such development or manifestation.\u201d Examining the effect of section 3212.5, the appellate court in <em>Parish v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 92, 98 [258 Cal.Rptr. 287], concluded it was the employer\u2019s burden to show \u201cwhat \u2018. . . contemporaneous nonwork-related event . . . ,\u2019 if any, was the sole cause of applicant\u2019s heart trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Stated another way, the presumption \u201c \u2018does not guarantee [covered] employees that they will recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits for a heart attack which occurs during the course of their employment, but leaves the employer free to rebut the statutory presumption by proving that some <em>contemporaneous </em>nonwork-related event\u2014for example, a victim\u2019s strenuous recreational exertion\u2014was the sole cause of the heart attack.\u2019 [Citation.] That is, an employer may rebut the presumption, but only with proof of causation by a nonindustrial event occurring at the same time as the heart trouble developed or manifested itself.\u201d <em>(Johnson v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>163 Cal.App.3d at p. 776.)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Thus, in <em>Geoghegan v. Retirement Board </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1525, 1528 [272 Cal.Rptr. 419], the employer presented evidence that the employee\u2019s heart attack was caused by the cold and altitude he encountered on a skiing vacation to Vail, Colorado. The appellate court concluded this medical evidence was sufficient to overcome the presumption that the employee\u2019s heart trouble was job related. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1530-1531.)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">The heart trouble presumption applicable to correctional officers contained in Labor Code section 3212.2 does not contain an antiattribution clause.  \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018The words of the statute must be construed in context, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>keeping in mind the statutory purpose, and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent possible.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Barajas v. Oren Realty &amp; Development Co. </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 209, 216-217 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 62].) Because the correctional officers\u2019 statute (\u00a7 3212.2) does not prohibit the attribution of heart trouble to \u201cany disease existing prior to such development or manifestation,\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3212.4) the employer of a correctional officer may rebut the heart trouble presumption in a second way. It may present evidence that the heart trouble was attributable to preexisting disease unrelated to the officer\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Here, substantial evidence does not support the WCAB\u2019s finding that Davis, Sr.\u2019s heart trouble was unrelated to his job. The only evidence on this subject was presented by Dr. Ogrod in his report. There, the doctor conclusively stated \u201cthere is nothing specific about the patient\u2019s occupation that would lead us to conclude that his viral infection and the secondary myocarditis was occupationally related.\u201d The doctor also stated, \u201c[t]here would be nothing in this sequence of events that would be linked to a specific occupation or to suggest that his occupation placed him at greater risk for developing this set of problems.\u201d Simply pointing out that there is nothing specific about his job that caused his heart attack or put him at a greater risk for this condition does not satisfy the Department of Correction\u2019s burden to prove that a contemporaneous non-work-related event was the sole cause of the heart attack in question. Moreover, this \u201cevidence\u201d does not demonstrate the heart trouble here was attributable to a preexisting nonindustrial disease. Stated another way, there was no evidence in the record that Davis, Sr.\u2019s respiratory illness was not related to his job as a correctional officer. The conclusion that there is \u201cno medical basis that would justify linking this patient\u2019s acute medical problems to his occupation\u201d further failed to establish that any non-work-related event was the sole cause of this heart attack or that this heart disease was the result of a preexisting disease unrelated to his job. Without any such evidence to controvert the presumption of Labor Code section 3212.2, that presumption controls. We, therefore, cannot uphold the WCAB\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The WCAB\u2019s \u201cOpinion and Order Granting Reconsideration and Decision After Reconsideration\u201d is annulled. The matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Scotland, P. J., and Cantil-Sakauye, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
