(Landlord) appeals a judgment in favor of defendant Fard, Inc. (Tenant) in Landlord\u2019s unlawful detainer action against Tenant. On appeal, Landlord contends: the trial court erred in (1) interpreting the lease and its amendment as not requiring Tenant to install new roofs; and (2) allowing Tenant to rely on affirmative defenses not pleaded in its answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">On March 19, 1997, Jim Lin (Landlord\u2019s predecessor-in-interest) and Tenant entered into a 10-year lease (Lease) for certain commercial property located on El Cajon Boulevard in La Mesa (Premises).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The term of the Lease was from April 1, 1997, to March 31, 2007. Paragraph 3 of the Lease provided that Tenant would use the Premises \u201cfor auto sales, repair, auto related business, or other uses . . . .\u201d Paragraph 4 of the Lease provided: \u201c4. REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE: <em>Tenant shall maintain at his sole expense </em>and without contribution from Landlord, <em>the [Premises in good and safe condition, </em>including, but not limited to[,] plate glass, electrical wiring, plumbing and heating installation.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">On July 15, 2000, Lin and Tenant entered into a first amendment to the Lease (Amendment), providing Tenant with a $500 reduction in monthly rent for the remainder of the Lease\u2019s term. The Amendment added the following provision to paragraph 3 of the Lease regarding use of the Premises:</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">\u201cTenant agrees to comply with any and all requirements, laws, ordinances or other mandates of the City of La Mesa and at Tenant\u2019s expense to cure any condition, use or perform any necessary modification, maintenance or repairs as may from time to time be required by the City of La Mesa, or Landlord, within sixty (60) days of receipt of written notice that such a defect, violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>or other condition exists which is unacceptable to the City of La Mesa or Landlord. Tenant\u2019s failure to make any improvement, correct any condition, or otherwise comply with any written notice shall constitute a breach of this Lease if Tenant permits such condition, violation or use to continue on or after the sixty-first (61st) day after receipt of such notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">The Amendment also replaced paragraph 4 of the Lease with the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1039-6\">\u201c4. REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE: <em>Tenant shall maintain at his sole expense </em>and without contribution from [Ljandlord, <em>the [PJremises in good and safe condition, </em>including, but not limited to[,] [the] <em>roof, </em>plate glass, electrical wiring, plumbing and heating installation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1039-7\">\u201c(a) [Tenant] shall comply with any and all zoning regulations, laws, ordinances and other requests of the City of La Mesa concerning the use, repair and maintenance of the [Premises] as set forth in the correspondence received from the City of La Mesa and any future correspondence which concern[s] the use and/or maintenance and repair of the [Premises. In addition to correcting the existing violation as of the date of [the Amendment], Tenant agrees to submit a plan (\u2018Plan\u2019) as requested by the City of La Mesa for the remodel of the building to include, but not [be limited to,] the installation of handicap access and other changes as may be required by the City of La Mesa. Such Plan shall be submitted to Landlord for Landlord\u2019s consent prior to Tenant submitting the Plan for approval by the City of La Mesa. After the Plan is approved by the City of La Mesa, Tenant agrees that it shall implement the Plan at Tenant\u2019s sole cost and expense, except [that] Landlord agrees that upon approval of the Plan by the City of La Mesa, he shall. . . pay Tenant the sum of $1000.00 as Landlord\u2019s contribution [toward] the actual cost of construction required under the approved Plan. Any additional cost or expense in order to implement the Plan, complete the construction or otherwise comply with the Plan or to cure any existing or future violations as noted by the City of La Mesa or Landlord shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Tenant.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1039-8\">The Amendment also provided: \u201cAll other terms and conditions as set forth in the . . . Lease remain in full force and effect except as modified as in this First Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-9\">In 2003 Lin sold the Premises to Landlord. On May 19 Landlord hired Dennis Parra, a building consultant, to inspect the Premises. Among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>observations or deficiencies, Parra found the two roofs of the Premises\u2019 buildings were leaking badly and needed to be replaced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">On June 26 Landlord sent Tenant a letter demanding that Tenant complete 11 specific \u201cmodifications, maintenance or repairs\u201d within 60 days. On or about November 10 Landlord sent Tenant a \u201cthree-day notice\u201d demanding that Tenant complete the modifications, maintenance and repairs or quit its possession of the Premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">On November 26 Landlord filed the instant unlawful detainer action against Tenant, alleging Tenant did not comply with the three-day notice. Following a bench trial, the trial court entered judgment for Tenant, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-6\">\u201c1. That the parties entered into a Lease in 1997 and an amendment to that in 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-7\">\u201c2. From the [AJmendment the court gathers that there were some issues with the City of La Mesa, some code violations that were likely cited and that the [Ljandlord was concerned that the [T]enant should take care of those issues and that an Amendment was crafted and signed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-8\">\u201c3. In 1978 it appears the roof was put on the building by the testimony of [Landlord\u2019s] expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-9\">\u201c4. The life expectancy of that roof at the outside was 15 years according to that expert. That would take us to 1993.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-10\">\u201c5. The [L]ease was not entered into until 1997, already beyond the life expectancy of this roof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-11\">\u201c6. The expert testified this roof could not be repaired, could not be maintained and had to be replaced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-12\">\u201c7. The court does <em>not </em>find that the language in Paragraph 4 of the Amendment requiring the [Tjenant to maintain in a good and safe condition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>the roof, among other things, had the same meaning as the [TJenant must replace a roof that had already exceeded its life expectancy at the time [Tenant] took [possession.]\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1041-4\">The court subsequently issued supplemental findings and a statement of decision, making the following additional findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-5\">\u201cThe [Amendment], drafted in 2000 by [Landlord\u2019s] (predecessor\u2019s) attorney, provided for [Tenant] to maintain the roof, plate glass, electrical wiring, plumbing and heating installation. The Court does not find that \u2018maintain\u2019 means to replace or to install initially. Thus, the Court finds [Tenant] had no obligation to install a new roof or to install heating or air conditioning. When [Tenant] entered this tenancy, the life of the roof was already expired and no heating or air conditioning had ever been installed. The Court finds these were structural issues and the responsibility of the Landlord, not the Tenant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-6\">\u201cBased upon the testimony of [Landlord\u2019s] expert, the Court finds that [Tenant] could not further repair the men\u2019s or women\u2019s bathroom, a supplemental roof or the exterior until the roof was repaired. The Court finds that [Tenant] repaired/maintained the asphalt and all other requested corrections listed in the June 23, 2003, letter. The Court does not find that the [L]ease and [the Amendment] required [Tenant] to improve or modify anything and everything the Landlord requested. The bargained-for exchange between the parties was that [Tenant] brought the property into compliance with the City of La Mesa\u2019s codes and expended $30,000\u2014$50,000 maintaining the leasehold. [][]... [1]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-7\">\u201cThe language of the [Amendment] is less than clear and must be construed against the drafter\u2014[Landlord]. The Court will not read into the [A]mendment any more than it states. It does not say that [Tenant] must <em>replace the roof. </em>When the [A]mendment was drafted, the testimony of the witnesses was that replacing the roof was not discussed.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1041-8\">Landlord timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">\n<em>Standards of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-6\">The trial court\u2019s judgment and statement of decision in this case contain both findings of fact and conclusions of law. \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. [Citation.] To the extent the trial court drew conclusions of law based upon its findings of fact, we review those conclusions of law de novo. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Westfour Corp. v. California First Bank </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1554, 1558 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 394].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-7\">Under the substantial evidence standard of review, \u201cwe must consider all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference, and resolving conflicts in support of the [findings]. [Citations.] [f] It is not our task to weigh conflicts and disputes in the evidence; that is the province of the trier of fact. Our authority begins and ends with a determination as to whether, on the entire record, there is <em>any </em>substantial evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, in support of the judgment. Even in cases where the evidence is undisputed or uncontradicted, if two or more different inferences can reasonably be drawn from the evidence this court is without power to substitute its own inferences or deductions for those of the trier of fact, which must resolve such conflicting inferences in the absence of a rule of law specifying the inference to be drawn. . . . [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Howard </em>v. <em>Owens Corning </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 621, 630-631 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 386].) To be substantial, the evidence must be of ponderable legal significance, reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 631; <em>Oregel </em>v. <em>American Isuzu Motors, Inc. </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1100 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 583].) However, substantial evidence is not synonymous with <em>any </em>evidence. (Oregel, supra, at p. 1100; <em>Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 864, 871 [269 Cal.Rptr. 647].) \u201cThe ultimate test is whether it is reasonable for a trier of , fact' to make the ruling in question in light of the whole record.\u201d <em>(Roddenberry v. Roddenberry </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 634, 652 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 907].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-9\">We generally apply an independent, or de novo, standard of review to conclusions of law regarding interpretation of the Lease and the Amendment. \u201cThe precise meaning of any contract, including a lease, depends upon the parties\u2019 expressed intent, using an objective standard. [Citations.] When there is ambiguity in the contract language, extrinsic evidence may be considered to ascertain a meaning to which the instrument\u2019s language is reasonably susceptible. [Citation.] . . . [][] We review the agreement and the extrinsic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>evidence de novo, even if the evidence is susceptible to multiple interpretations, unless the interpretation depends upon credibility. [Citation.] If it does, we must accept any reasonable interpretation adopted by the trial court. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Golden West Baseball Co. v. City of Anaheim </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 11, 21-22 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 378], fns. omitted.) \u201c[W]here ... the extrinsic evidence is not in conflict, construction of the agreement is a question of law for our independent review. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Appleton </em>v. <em>Waessil </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 551, 556 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 676]; see <em>Schaefer\u2019s Ambulance Service v. County of San Bernardino </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 581, 586 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 385] [\u201c[T]o the extent the evidence is not in conflict, we construe the instrument, and we resolve any conflicting inferences, ourselves.\u201d].) In contrast, \u201c[i]f the parol evidence is in conflict, requiring the resolution of credibility issues, we would be guided by the substantial evidence test. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Appleton, supra, </em>at p. 556.) However, extrinsic evidence is not admissible to ascribe a meaning to an agreement to which it is not reasonably susceptible. <em>(Wells Fargo Bank v. Marshall </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 447, 453 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 507].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">In this case extrinsic evidence on the parties\u2019 intended meaning of language in the Lease and Amendment was ultimately <em>admissible </em>only if it was relevant to show a meaning to which that language is reasonably susceptible. <em>(Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. v. G. W. Thomas Drayage etc. Co. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 33, 37 [69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641]; <em>Winet v. Price </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1165 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554].) In <em>Winet, </em>we stated: \u201cThe decision whether to admit parol [or extrinsic] evidence involves a two-step process. First, the court provisionally receives (without actually admitting) all credible evidence concerning the parties\u2019 intentions to determine \u2018ambiguity,\u2019 i.e., whether the language is \u2018reasonably susceptible\u2019 to the interpretation urged by a party. If in light of the extrinsic evidence the court decides the language is \u2018reasonably susceptible\u2019 to the interpretation urged, the extrinsic evidence is then admitted to aid in the second step\u2014interpreting the contract. [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">\u201cDifferent standards of appellate review may be applicable to each of these two steps, depending upon the context in which an issue arises. The trial court\u2019s ruling on the threshold determination of \u2018ambiguity\u2019 (i.e., whether the proffered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language is reasonably susceptible) is a question of law, not of fact. [Citation.] Thus the threshold determination of ambiguity is subject to independent review. [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">\u201cThe second step\u2014the ultimate construction placed upon the ambiguous language\u2014may call for differing standards of review, depending upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>parol evidence used to construe the contract.\u201d <em>(Winet </em>v. Price, supra, 4 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1165-1166.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">\u201c[W]e may affirm a trial court judgment on any [correct] basis presented by the record whether or not relied upon by the trial court. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Day </em>v. <em>Alta Bates Medical Center </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 243, 252, fn. 1 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 606].) \u201cNo rule of decision is better or more firmly established by authority, nor one resting upon a sounder basis of reason and propriety, than that a ruling or decision, itself correct in law, will not be disturbed on appeal merely because given for a wrong reason. If right upon any theory of the law applicable to the case, it must be sustained regardless of the considerations which may have moved the trial court to its conclusion.\u201d <em>(Davey v. Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1897) 116 Cal. 325, 329 [48 P. 117].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">\n<em>Trial Court\u2019s Interpretation of the Lease and Amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">Landlord contends the trial court erred in interpreting the Lease and Amendment not to require Tenant to install new roofs. Landlord argues Tenant breached the Lease and Amendment by not replacing the roofs of the Premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-9\">\u201cThe purpose of the law of contracts is to protect the reasonable expectations of the parties.\u201d <em>(Ben-Zvi </em>v. <em>Edmar Co. </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 468, 475 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 12].) A lease agreement establishing a landlord-tenant relationship is a contract and is subject to the general rules governing the formation and interpretation of contracts. <em>(Medico-Dental etc. Co. v. Horton &amp; Converse </em>(1942) 21 Cal.2d 411, 418-419 [132 P.2d 457]; <em>Vallely Investments v. BancAmerica Commercial Corp. </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 816, 822 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 689].) Formation of a contract requires parties capable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>of consent, the consent of those parties, a lawful object, and sufficient consideration. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1550.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cMutual assent or consent is necessary to the formation of a contract. [Citations.] Mutual assent is determined under an objective standard applied to the outward manifestations or expressions of the parties, i.e., the reasonable meaning of their words and acts, and not their unexpressed intentions or understandings. [Citation.] Mutual assent is a question of fact. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Alexander v. Codemasters Group Limited </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 129, 141 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 145].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">\u201cThe fundamental rules of contract interpretation are based on the premise that the interpretation of a contract must give effect to the \u2018mutual intention\u2019 of the parties. \u2018Under statutory rules of contract interpretation, the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation. [\u00a7 1636.] Such intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract. [\u00a7 1639.] The \u201cclear and explicit\u201d meaning of these provisions, interpreted in their \u201cordinary and popular sense,\u201d . . . controls judicial interpretation. [\u00a7 1638.]\u2019 [Citations.] . . . [L]anguage in a contract must be interpreted as a whole, and in the circumstances of the case, and cannot be found to be ambiguous in the abstract. [Citation.] Courts will not strain to create an ambiguity where none exists. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 18-19 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619].) Interpretation of a contract \u201cmust be fair and reasonable, not leading to absurd conclusions. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sayble </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1562, 1566 [239 Cal.Rptr. 201].) \u201cThe court must avoid an interpretation which will make a contract extraordinary, harsh, unjust, or inequitable. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Strong </em>v. <em>Theis </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 913, 920-921 [232 Cal.Rptr. 272].) Section 1643 provides: \u201cA contract must receive such an interpretation as will make it lawful, operative, definite, reasonable, and capable of being carried into effect, if it can be done without violating the intention of the parties.\u201d In the event other rules of interpretation do not resolve an apparent ambiguity or uncertainty, \u201cthe language of a contract should be interpreted most strongly against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist.\u201d (\u00a7 1654.) \u201cStipulations which are necessary to make a contract reasonable ... are implied, in respect to matters concerning which the contract manifests no contrary intention.\u201d (\u00a7 1655.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">At trial, the court received, at least provisionally, extrinsic evidence on the parties\u2019 intended meaning of language in the Lease and Amendment relevant to Tenant\u2019s obligation to maintain the two roofs of the Premises. Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>it <em>may </em>have admitted some or all of that extrinsic evidence in resolving any ambiguity of language reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we first apply an independent standard of review in determining whether the extrinsic evidence in this case shows the language of the Lease or Amendment is ambiguous (i.e., reasonably susceptible to two different meanings). <em>(Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. v. G. W. Thomas Drayage etc. Co., supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 37; <em>Winet v. Price, supra, </em>4 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1165-1166.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">In appellate briefs, each party cites certain extrinsic evidence supporting its interpretation of the Lease and Amendment. Because it is not our responsibility to scour the appellate record for evidence to support a party\u2019s position, we consider only evidence cited by the parties in independently determining whether the language of the Lease and Amendment is ambiguous regarding Tenant\u2019s purported obligation to replace the roofs. In support of Landlord\u2019s argument that Tenant was contractually obligated to replace the roofs, Landlord cites extrinsic evidence that in 1997 Tenant knew the roofs needed replacement and, pursuant to the Amendment in 2000, Tenant received a $40,000 rent reduction over the remaining term of the Lease. Landlord argues that rent reduction supports an inference Tenant agreed to replace the roofs (and make other improvements) in exchange for the rent reduction. Landlord cites Lin\u2019s testimony, in which he stated Tenant told him the roof was leaking and Tenant\u2019s rent was reduced accordingly pursuant to the Amendment. Lin testified that Tenant told him it \u201cwould take care of the problems there the City [of La Mesa] was asking <em>[sic] </em>and the roof leaking . . . .\u201d Landlord also cites Parra\u2019s testimony that the roofs\u2019 life expectancies were 12 to 15 years, yet the roofs were about 25 years old.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">Noting Tenant entered possession of the Premises in 1993 (about the time the roofs\u2019 life expectancies expired), Landlord argues Tenant, in assuming obligations in the Lease in 1997 and Amendment in 2000 to <em>maintain </em>the roofs, necessarily must be obligated to <em>replace </em>them because at those points in time they presumably were unmaintainable. However, Landlord does not cite any testimony necessarily showing the roofs were unmaintainable in 1997 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>2000. Furthermore, although Parra and apparently one or more roofing contractors concluded the roofs needed to be replaced, those opinions do <em>not </em>show Tenant\u2019s maintenance obligation necessarily includes a duty to replace the roofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">In response to Landlord\u2019s argument Tenant was contractually obligated to replace the roofs, Tenant cites extrinsic evidence supporting a finding it had no such obligation, including other testimony by Lin (Landlord\u2019s predecessor-in-interest). Lin testified that in negotiating the Amendment he and Tenant never agreed Tenant would make improvements to or increase the value of the Premises. Also, he and Tenant did not discuss the need for the roofs to be replaced, but discussed only Tenant\u2019s obligation to maintain and repair the roofs. Tenant also cites testimony of Pour (apparently Tenant\u2019s president and/or owner), in which he stated that at the time he negotiated the Amendment (and presumably the Lease), he never thought Tenant would be expected to install a roof, but only to maintain the roofs. Pour testified that Tenant had maintained the roofs over the term of the Lease and had receipts showing completed roof repair work. Furthermore, prior to execution of the Lease, although one roofing contractor told him a new roof was required, Tenant hired another contractor who repaired the roof. When Pour was asked whether he understood at the time of negotiating the Amendment Tenant would be required to improve the Premises, he answered, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">The primary purpose of the Amendment was to provide for Tenant\u2019s correction (in exchange for the rent reduction) of various code violations in the Premises found by the City of La Mesa (e.g., electrical, fencing, disability regulation compliance, etc.). As the trial court found, \u201c[f]rom the [A]mendment the court gathers that there were some issues with the City of La Mesa, some code violations that were likely cited and that the [LJandlord was concerned that the [T]enant should take care of those issues and that an Amendment was crafted and signed.\u201d The court further found: \u201cThe bargained-for exchange between the parties was that [Tenant] brought the [Premises] into compliance with the City of La Mesa\u2019s codes and expended $30,000\u2014$50,000 maintaining the leasehold.\u201d Landlord apparently does not challenge that aspect of the trial court\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">Considering the extrinsic evidence in this case, Tenant\u2019s duty of maintenance under the Lease and Amendment can <em>only </em>be reasonably construed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>requiring Tenant to maintain the roofs in their conditions as of the time those written agreements were executed in 1997 and 2000 (i.e., in their then-dilapidated conditions). Had the parties intended Tenant to assume the obligation to <em>replace </em>the roofs, one would reasonably expect the Lease and/or Amendment to <em>expressly </em>so state rather than merely stating Tenant was required to <em>maintain </em>the roofs (and other parts of the Premises).</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">Case law supports a conclusion that, absent an express provision (or undisputed extrinsic evidence) showing a tenant has an obligation to replace a roof, a tenant\u2019s obligation to maintain or repair the premises (including a roof) does <em>not </em>include an obligation to replace an old, dilapidated roof with a new roof at tenant\u2019s expense. In <em>Iverson v. Spang Industries, Inc. </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 303 [119 Cal.Rptr. 399], a lease required the tenant to leave the premises in good order, condition and repair except for reasonable use and wear. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 310.) <em>Iverson </em>stated: \u201cSuch covenants are generally reasonably interpreted to avoid placing any unwarranted burden of improvement on the [tenant].

In <em>Haupt v. La Brea Heating etc. Co. </em>(1955) 133 Cal.App.2d Supp. 784 [284 P.2d 985], a lease required the tenant to \u201c \u2018make whatever repairs are necessary to the floor\u2019 and \u2018to repair the floor to a usable state.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p.

Exch. </em>(1957) 147 Cal.App.2d 395 [305 P.2d 73], a lease provided the tenant was required to maintain the premises (including the sidewalk) in good order and repair. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 397.) In that case, the court stated: \u201cIt is thus clear that all that the [tenant] was required to do under the lease was to \u2018maintain\u2019 the sidewalk [involved in a personal injury action]. To <em>maintain </em>means to repair or keep in good condition things that <em>exist, </em>and not the creation of something new.

(See, e.g., <em>Calderon v. Johnson </em>(La.Ct.App. 1984) 453 So.2d 615, 618 [\u201c \u2018Simple maintenance\u2019 does not include the replacement of a system worn out because of age.\u201d]; <em>Chow Tim v. Lopez </em>(1953) 40 Haw. 55, 62 [\u201cA covenant to keep the leased premises in repair does not obligate the tenant to keep the building up as new buildings; the extent of the repairs he is obliged to make necessarily depends upon the age and the class of the buildings. He need not give the [landlord] the benefit of a new replacement.\u201d]; <em>Scott v. Prazma </em>(Wyo. 1976) 555 P.2d 571, 576-579.) In <em>Scott, </em>which involved a 10-year lease that commenced in 1972 and required the tenant to keep the premises in good repair and condition as they then were, the Wyoming Supreme Court stated: \u201cThe lease in this case had about seven and a half years to run at the time [the tenant] quit the premises. This is a relatively short time to justify the extensive repairs by the [tenant], the greater benefit of which would revert to the [landlord], and which are obviously inequitable and not within the contemplation of the parties. The [landlord] is not entitled to a remodeled building. The building had been constructed in 1939 or 1940 and as nearly as can be determined from the record, the roof and roof structure are the original, as are the eaves, rain gutters, window frames and windows, other than glass replaced. It appears that the listed original items would have a life of somewhere around 30-35 years. [][]... [f]</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">\u201c. . . We cannot believe that the parties ever intended at the time of the execution of the lease here that the [tenant] would be burdened with an immediate $60,000.00 obligation for a roof and related structure by himself, let alone the other items, to substantially restore the [landlord\u2019s] building ....</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">\u201c. . . [Landlord\u2019s] position is obviously unfair because it would give [landlord] a better, fully reconstructed building than he leased, the life of which improvements would extend far beyond the [tenant\u2019s] remaining term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>of less than eight years. It would become far superior to its condition at the date of the lease. By the express terms of the agreement, [the tenant\u2019s] obligation was only to keep it in its lease-date condition. It had taken over 30 years for the building to reach its present dilapidated state. ... [][]... [1]</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\"><em>\u201cAn ordinary covenant to keep the premises in good repair does not include the restoration of a part of a building which has become so run-down that it cannot be repaired. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Scott v. Prazma, supra, </em>555 P.2d at pp. 576-579, italics added, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">We conclude that although there is evidence supporting a finding both Landlord and Tenant knew, when the Lease and Amendment were executed in 1997 and 2000, the roofs needed to be replaced, that knowledge does <em>not </em>support a reasonable inference they intended, absent express language in the Lease or the Amendment, Tenant be required to <em>replace </em>the already dilapidated roofs. Although Landlord apparently assumes the Amendment allowed it to require Tenant to make certain improvements to the Premises (e.g., replacement of the roofs), Landlord does not show the language of the Amendment is reasonably susceptible to that interpretation. Furthermore, the extrinsic evidence cited by Landlord, discussed <em>ante, </em>does not support that interpretation. On the face of the Amendment, Tenant\u2019s primary obligations to maintain the Premises are set forth in the language of paragraph C of the Amendment, which deleted former paragraph 4 of the Lease and replaced it with the language quoted <em>ante. </em>The Amendment to the Lease added certain language to paragraph 3 of the Lease regarding Tenant\u2019s use of the Premises and included the word \u201cimprovement.\u201d The <em>only </em>reasonable construction of that word in the context of the entire Amendment is that it refers to Tenant\u2019s other obligations, as expressly stated in the Amendment, to maintain the Premises and correct various code violations found by the City of La Mesa. Landlord does <em>not </em>show that in 2000 the City of La Mesa required <em>replacement, </em>in contrast to repair, of the roofs. Furthermore, the word \u201cimprovement\u201d in paragraph B of the Amendment is part of a sentence regarding the period in which Tenant must cure a default after Landlord\u2019s notice to the Tenant. Accordingly, the word \u201cimprovement,\u201d in that context, does not create an independent obligation for Tenant, but rather refers to Tenant\u2019s obligations to maintain the Premises and cure any code violations found by the City of La Mesa, expressly set forth in the Amendment. Based on the language of the Lease and Amendment and the extrinsic evidence discussed <em>ante, </em>we conclude the word \u201cimprovement\u201d in the Amendment is <em>not, </em>as a matter or law, reasonably susceptible to an interpretation that Tenant was required to <em>replace </em>the roofs. Accordingly, we conclude, as a matter of law, Tenant was <em>not </em>required to <em>replace </em>the roofs of the Premises pursuant to either the Lease or the Amendment. Therefore, we reject Landlord\u2019s assertion Tenant breached the Lease and Amendment by not replacing the roofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Assuming arguendo the extrinsic evidence was conflicting and would have reasonably supported different interpretations of the Lease and Amendment regarding Tenant\u2019s purported obligation to replace the roofs, we nevertheless would conclude there is substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding in favor of Tenant\u2019s interpretation of those agreements. The trial court could reasonably infer the parties knew, when the Lease and Amendment were executed in 1997 and 2000, the roofs were dilapidated. The court could also infer, from the parties\u2019 omission of any express language requiring Tenant to replace\u2014in contrast to merely maintain or repair\u2014those roofs, no mutual intent to impose a replacement obligation on Tenant. Applying the substantial evidence standard of review, we conclude there is substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding Tenant did not have an obligation to replace the roofs under either the Lease or the Amendment. <em>(Howard v. Owens Corning, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.4th at pp. 630-631.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">\n<em>Remaining Contention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">Landlord also contends the trial court erred by allowing Tenant to rely on affirmative defenses it did not properly plead in its answer to Landlord\u2019s unlawful detainer complaint (i.e., the defenses of impossibility and unenforceability).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, to the extent the court allowed Tenant to assert or rely on those purported affirmative defenses, that error is harmless because the court did not rely on those defenses in reaching its decision and, in any event, we would affirm the judgment on the grounds set forth in part E.B., <em>ante.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> (Davey v.

In Landlord\u2019s brief, it cites testimony of Lin (its predecessor-in-interest) to support its assertion that Tenant began its possession of the Premises in 1993. However, based on the phrasing of the questions posed, Lin\u2019s testimony is not a definitive statement that Tenant began its possession in 1993. At trial, Landlord\u2019s counsel asked Lin: \u201c[D]id you own the [Premises] between 1993 and 2003 sir?\u201d Lin replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Landlord\u2019s counsel then asked: \u201c[D]uring 1993 and 2003, did the [Premises] have a tenant?\u201d Lin replied, \u201cYes,\u201d and then identified that tenant as Amir Pour (who apparently is the president and/or owner of Tenant). Based on the phrasing of counsel\u2019s question, Lin\u2019s affirmative answer could mean either that Tenant was in possession of the Premises <em>at some point </em>during 1993 and 2003 <em>or </em>that Tenant was in possession during that <em>entire </em>period. For purposes of this appeal, we assume Tenant entered into possession of the Premises in 1993, albeit not pursuant to the Lease in 1997 or its subsequent amendment in 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1040-13\"> Parra\u2019s written inspection report stated that: \u201c12.

However, Landlord complains the court did not note Tenant originally entered possession of the Premises in 1993, instead referring only to the commencement of the Lease in 1997. Given the fact that the roofs\u2019 life expectancies ended in 1993, the purported disparity in Tenant\u2019s date of possession (i.e., 1993 versus 1997) does not have probative value in determining the issue in this case. It is undisputed the roofs were dilapidated whenever Tenant took possession of the Premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1047-8\"> Contrary to Landlord\u2019s argument, it is a mere coincidence the $40,000 rent reduction negotiated by Landlord and Tenant in 2000 for Tenant\u2019s correction of various code violations was approximately the same amount (i.e., $39,485) as the total of Parra\u2019s 2003 estimate of the cost of repairs needed for the Premises. Landlord does not show Parra\u2019s recommended repairs in 2003 were the same (or substantially the same) as the work required to correct the code violations previously found by the City of La Mesa in 2000 (which the trial court found Tenant had completed).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1051-9\"> Because we affirm the judgment on the grounds set forth in part II, <em>ante, </em>we need not address <em>Tenant\u2019s </em>assertion that Landlord\u2019s appeal is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1051-10\"> In any event, we are not persuaded by Landlord\u2019s interpretation of the trial court\u2019s judgment and statement of decision. Although the court found the roofs could not be repaired because they were already beyond their life expectancies in 1997 and therefore required replacement, in so doing the court was not relying on the defense of impossibility or unenforceability regarding Tenant\u2019s contractual obligation to maintain the roofs. Rather, it was merely concluding neither the Lease nor the Amendment required Tenant to replace the roofs in the circumstances of this case. Likewise, we are not persuaded by Landlord\u2019s interpretation of a sentence in the trial court\u2019s findings of facts and statement of decision, in which the court stated: \u201cThe Court does <em>not </em>find that the [L]ease and [the Amendment] required [Tenant] to improve or modify anything and everything the Landlord requested.\u201d (Italics added.) That statement does <em>not </em>show the trial court misconstrued Landlord\u2019s argument at trial to be that, under the Lease and Amendment, Tenant was required to make <em>any and all </em>improvements to the Premises as Landlord requested.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
