On appeal, Moore raised various issues, including whether the trial court erred by admitting a portion of a 911 tape over defense counsel\u2019s objections it was not probative and was cumulative, time-consuming, and prejudicial, as well as its admission violated his right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">On December 19, 2002, in the unpublished opinion <em>People v. Meza </em>(Dec. 19, 2002, D037249), we affirmed Moore\u2019s convictions, concluding, among other things, that Moore had waived his confrontation claim on appeal because he had failed to make a timely objection on that ground at trial and his other contentions regarding the 911 tape had no merit. Moore\u2019s petition for review was denied by our Supreme Court on February 15, 2003. On October 6, 2003, the United States Supreme Court denied Moore\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">On March 8, 2004, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004) 541 U.S. 36 [158 L.Ed.2d 177, 124 S.Ct. 1354] <em>(Crawford), </em>which announced a new rule regarding the effect of the confrontation clause on the admission of hearsay statements in criminal prosecutions. (541 U.S. at p. 71.) On September 27, 2004, citing <em>Crawford </em>in support, Moore filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the superior court, claiming his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to the admission of the 911 tape on grounds it would violate his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. The court denied the petition on November 23, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Moore filed this instant petition for habeas corpus relief on December 17, 2004, raising the same ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim as raised in his earlier petition before the superior court again relying on <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. 36. After receiving an informal response, we issued an order on March 4, 2005, to show cause why the relief prayed for in Moore\u2019s petition should not be granted. After reviewing the briefing and record filed in this matter, we requested supplemental briefing on whether <em>Crawford </em>applies retroactively in this case, or at all in a habeas corpus proceeding. We conclude it does not apply retroactively in this case, and accordingly, we find that Moore has failed to meet his burden of showing he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel under the law applicable at the time of his trial and deny his petition for habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Because our opinion in <em>People v. Meza, supra, </em>D037249, sets forth in detail the facts supporting Moore\u2019s convictions, we will only briefly summarize them to set the scene for our discussion below. Moore was convicted of committing four of his forcible sex crimes on his victim, Autumn T., on March 9, 2000, in concert with his codefendant Luis Carlos Meza. Earlier that date, Autumn and Joel Holmes had been drinking with a group of friends in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. On the way back to their car after crossing the border, Autumn and Holmes got separated from the group and could not find Holmes\u2019s car. When Moore and Meza approached them in a car Meza was driving, Holmes asked if they could give them a ride and help them find Holmes\u2019s car. Moore and Meza agreed and after about 10 minutes of driving around, Meza stopped and ordered Holmes out of the car at gunpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">When Autumn attempted to leave with Holmes, Moore closed the door and told her to put her head down. After getting back in the car, Meza threatened Autumn with the gun and drove to a motel where he and Moore forced her to engage in various sex acts. When they were done, they put Autumn back in the car, drove her to a trolley station and dropped her off. Autumn told the people at the station she had been raped. A man called 911 for Autumn, relaying information she provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">In defense, Moore claimed Autumn voluntarily went to the motel with him and Meza, consented in many of the sexual acts, and only started crying and becoming hysterical after Meza attempted to have further sexual encounters with her and she complained of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>During trial, the court admitted two and one-half minutes of the over-six-minute 911 tape, which was edited to include only the parts where Autumn\u2019s voice was audible over her crying along with the voice of a man identified as Douglas on the tape who relayed the dispatcher\u2019s questions to Autumn and Autumn\u2019s answers back to the dispatcher. Douglas did not testify at trial. Over defense counsel\u2019s objections, the court found the tape relevant to the issue of consent because it showed Autumn\u2019s demeanor, including her crying, which corroborated her claim she had not consented to the sexual acts, found it to be admissible as an excited utterance and prior consistent statement, both exceptions to the hearsay rule, and found it was more probative than prejudicial. The court also ordered all references to Autumn\u2019s crying deleted from the transcript of the redacted tape. Moore\u2019s trial counsel did not make any objection to the 911 call based upon the right of confrontation or seek a curative instruction regarding Douglas\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\n<em>The Legal Framework</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Although a defendant will generally be procedurally barred from raising \u201con habeas corpus an issue that could have been presented at trial\u201d <em>(In re Seaton </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 193, 200 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 633, 95 P.3d 896], italics omitted), a defendant has recourse from such bar when his rights are violated at trial and defense counsel does not object. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cIf counsel\u2019s omission falls \u2018below an objective standard of reasonableness . . . under prevailing professional norms\u2019 <em>(Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687-688 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 104 S.Ct. 2052]), the defendant may assert the error in a habeas corpus petition \u2018clothed in \u201cineffective assistance of counsel\u201d raiment.\u2019 [Citation.] The defendant would be entitled to habeas corpus relief if there is a \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 [citation] that defense counsel\u2019s incompetence in not objecting affected the trial\u2019s outcome.\u201d <em>(Seaton, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 200, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Thus, even though Moore has dressed his claim of confrontation clause violation, which was not raised at trial in this case, in \u201cineffective assistance of counsel\u201d clothing, he will only be entitled to habeas corpus relief if he meets his burden of showing that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was both professionally deficient and that there is a \u201c \u2018reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result . . . would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Ledesma </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 171, 217-218 [233 Cal.Rptr. 404, 729 P.2d 839] <em>(Ledesma).) </em>In other words, Moore must show that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance rendered the result of the trial unreliable or the proceeding fundamentally unfair before his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel will have merit. <em>(Lockhart v. Fretwell </em>(1993) 506 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>U.S. 364 [122 L.Ed.2d 180, 113 S.Ct. 838] (Fretwell).) Where the record on review sheds no light on why counsel failed to do or not do any challenged thing, \u201cunless counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, or unless there simply could be no satisfactory explanation,\u201d claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are generally unsuccessful on review. <em>(People v. Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412, 426 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859].)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\"><em>Retroactivity of </em>Crawford v. Washington</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Before we can proceed to examine whether counsel was deficient in his representation of Moore at trial by failing to object on grounds the admission of the 911 tape segment violated Moore\u2019s right to confrontation, we must determine what law was applicable to the admissibility of such evidence. Moore maintains the new rule announced in <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. 36 is applicable because it was decided while his case was on direct review and \u201ca new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final____\u201d <em>(Griffith v. Kentucky </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 314, 328 [93 L.Ed.2d 649, 107 S.Ct. 708].) Alternatively, he relies on the recent Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case, <em>Bockting v. Bayer </em>(9th Cir. 2005) 399 F.3d 1010, 1021-1024 <em>(Bockting), </em>which held by a two-to-one vote that <em>Crawford </em>was a new watershed rule of criminal procedure entitled to retroactive application, to assert <em>Crawford </em>is applicable to cases like his on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">As the Attorney General correctly points out in his supplemental briefing, the record clearly shows Moore\u2019s case was final and he had exhausted his direct appeal avenues at the time the decision in <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. 36, announced a new rule of procedural constitutional law. Because the holding in <em>Bockting, supra, </em>399 F.3d 1010, is not binding on this court, and is in conflict with every other federal circuit court that has addressed the issue of whether <em>Crawford </em>is to apply retroactively to a habeas corpus proceeding after direct review is final (see <em>Mungo v. Duncan </em>(2nd Cir. 2004) 393 F.3d 327, 334-336 <em>(Mungo); Dorchy v. Jones </em>(6th Cir. 2005) 398 F.3d 783, 788; <em>Murillo </em>v. <em>Frank </em>(7th Cir. 2005) 402 F.3d 786, 790; <em>Bintz v. Bertrand </em>(7th Cir. 2005) 403 F.3d 859, 867-869 <em>(Bintz); Evans </em>v. <em>Luebbers </em>(8th Cir. 2004) 371 F.3d 438, 444-445; <em>Brown v. Uphoff( </em>10th Cir. 2004) 381 F.3d 1219, 1227 <em>(Uphoff)), </em>we review the matter de novo to determine if the decision in <em>Crawford </em>should be given retroactive effect in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Generally, when a decision of the United State Supreme Court results in a new rule, i.e., one that \u201cbreaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the States or the Federal Government [citations] . . . [or] was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>(Teague </em>v. <em>Lane </em>(1989) 489 U.S. 288, 301 [103 L.Ed.2d 334, 109 S.Ct. 1060], italics omitted <em>{Teague)), </em>it applies only in limited circumstances \u201c[a]s to convictions that are already final. . . .\u201d <em>(Schriro </em>v. <em>Summerlin </em>(2004) 542 U.S. 348 [159 L.Ed.2d 442, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 2522] <em>(Schriro).) </em>Although new substantive rules generally apply retroactively, new rules of procedure generally do not. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 2522-2523.) The high court in <em>Teague </em>held that new rules of constitutional law are not retroactive to habeas corpus petitions unless they \u201cplace[] \u2018certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,\u2019 \u201d or establish \u201cwatershed rules\u201d of criminal procedure. <em>(Teague, supra, </em>489 U.S. at p. 311.) As the United States Supreme Court recently explained in <em>Schriro, </em>new rules of procedure \u201cdo not produce a class of persons convicted of conduct the law does not make criminal, but merely raise the possibility that someone convicted with use of the invalidated procedure might have been acquitted otherwise. Because of this more speculative connection to innocence, we give retroactive effect to only a small set of \u2018 \u201cwatershed rules of criminal procedure\u201d implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\u2019 [Citations.] That a new procedural mle is \u2018fundamental\u2019 in some abstract sense is not enough; the rule must be one \u2018without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished.\u2019 [Citation, italics omitted.] This class of rules is extremely narrow, and \u2018it is unlikely that any . . . \u201cha[s] yet to emerge.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Schriro, supra, </em>542 U.S. at p. 352 [124 S.Ct. at p. 2523].)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">We agree with the parties here that <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. 36, announced a new rule of procedural constitutional law regarding the admission at trial of testimonial hearsay evidence. Before <em>Crawford, Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 56 [65 L.Ed.2d 597, 100 S.Ct. 2531] <em>(Roberts) </em>provided the procedure for determining whether the admission of hearsay statements violated the confrontation clause. (See <em>Roberts, </em>at pp. 66-70.) The court in <em>Crawford </em>noted <em>Roberts </em>was inconsistent with its conclusion testimonial hearsay statements offered as evidence against a defendant are admissible under the confrontation clause only if the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. <em>(Crawford, supra, </em>at p. 60.) In overruling <em>Roberts, </em>the court in <em>Crawford </em>made a clean break from the line of precedent established by <em>Roberts </em>and rejected its continuing application. <em>(Crawford, supra, </em>pp. 62-69.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The conclusion that <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. 36, announced a new rule of procedural constitutional law, however, does not end our inquiry whether <em>Crawford </em>should be retroactively applied in this case. Such application depends on whether either of the two exceptions to nonretroactivity articulated by the high court in <em>Teague </em>are met by <em>Crawford. </em>Because <em>Crawford </em>did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>not place any primary, private conduct beyond the power of lawmaking authorities to proscribe or prohibit any category of punishment currently in use for specific offenses, the first exception of <em>Teague </em>clearly does not apply. (See <em>Saffle </em>v. <em>Parks </em>(1990) 494 U.S. 484, 494 [108 L.Ed.2d 415, 110 S.Ct. 1257] <em>(Saffle); Teague, supra, </em>489 U.S. at p. 311.)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Nor do we believe the second exception to nonretroactivity of <em>Teague </em>applies. As noted above, this narrowly defined exception is for \u201c \u2018watershed rules of criminal procedure\u2019 implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>(Saffle, supra, </em>494 U.S. at p. 495; see <em>Teague, supra, </em>489 U.S. at p. 311.) To qualify as a \u201cwatershed rule of criminal procedure,\u201d the rule must not only relate to the accuracy of the conviction, but also must \u201c \u2018 \u201calter our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements\u201d \u2019 essential to the fairness of a proceeding.\u201d <em>(Sawyer v. Smith </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 227, 242-243 [111 L.Ed.2d 193, 110 S.Ct. 2822], italics omitted.) Recognizing that retroactive application of new procedural rules not existing at the time a conviction became final \u201cseriously undermines the principle of finality which is essential to the operation of our criminal justice system\u201d <em>(Teague, supra, </em>489 U.S. at p. 309), the high court in <em>Teague </em>emphasized the rarity of such watershed rules. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 313.) \u201cWhatever the precise scope of this exception, it is clearly meant to apply only to a small core of rules requiring \u2018observance of \u201cthose procedures that... are \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citations.] As the plurality cautioned in <em>Teague, </em>\u2018[b]ecause we operate from the premise that such procedures would be so central to an accurate determination of innocence or guilt, we believe it unlikely that many such components of basic due process have yet to emerge.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Graham v. Collins </em>(1993) 506 U.S. 461, 478 [122 L.Ed.2d 260, 113 S.Ct. 892], quoting <em>Teague, supra, </em>489 U.S. at p. 313.)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly used <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 335 [9 L.Ed.2d 799, 83 S.Ct. 792] <em>(Gideon), </em>which applied the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to the states and held that indigent defendants have a right to court-appointed counsel in all criminal prosecutions, as an example of a watershed rule. <em>(Beard v. Banks </em>(2004) 542 U.S. 406 [159 L.Ed.2d 494, 124 S.Ct. 2504] <em>(Beard); Saffle, supra, </em>494 U.S. at p. 495; see also <em>O\u2019Dell v. Netherland </em>(1997) 521 U.S. 151 [138 L.Ed.2d 351, 117 S.Ct. 1969].) Since 1989, when the exceptions to nonretroactivity in <em>Teague, supra, </em>489 U.S. 288, were announced, the United States Supreme Court has declined to apply any new rule of criminal procedure retroactively on habeas corpus review when measured against the criteria for the second <em>Teague </em>exception. (See <em>In re Markel </em>(2005) 154 Wn.2d 262, 270, fn. 2 [111 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>P.3d 249, 252].) As the high court recently observed in <em>Beard </em>regarding the retroactive application of new criminal procedural rules, \u201cwe have yet to find a new rule that falls under the second <em>Teague </em>exception.\u201d <em>(Beard, supra, </em>542 U.S. at p. 417 [124 S.Ct. at pp. 2513-2514].)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\"><em>Crawford </em>does not rise to the level of <em>Gideon, supra, </em>372 U.S. 335, under the watershed rule test. Although it is important, being based upon the confrontation clause which is recognized as a \u201cbedrock procedural guarantee\u201d <em>(Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. at p. 42), this does not mean that the rules concerning its implementation necessarily constitute bedrock procedural rules. (See <em>Johnson v. McKune </em>(10th Cir. 2002) 288 F.3d 1187, 1199.) <em>Crawford </em>\u201cdoes not introduce any fundamentally new concepts to address the fairness or accuracy of a trial; instead it calls for a complete implementation of a protection that already exists\u2014the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>(Bintz, supra, </em>403 F.3d at p. 867.) For decades this clause has been recognized as providing an essential component of trials in American courts, the right to confrontation. (Po<em>inter v. Texas </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 400, 406 [13 L.Ed.2d 923, 85 S.Ct. 1065].) <em>Crawford </em>does not alter this right. Nor does it define new rights or constitutional guarantees. Rather <em>Crawford </em>simply sets out a new standard for the admission of hearsay evidence, which may or may not improve the accuracy of convictions. (See <em>Mungo, supra, </em>393 F.3d at pp. 335-336.) Essentially, the difference between the rule in <em>Crawford </em>as compared to that in <em>Roberts </em>is the manner in which each effectuates a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation. Thus, similar to a rule that shifts the factfinding responsibility from a judge to the jury, a rule that redefines the way a court admits evidence does not \u201cso \u2018seriously diminish[]\u2019 accuracy that there is an \u2018 \u201cimpermissibly large risk\u201d \u2019 of punishing conduct the law does not reach.\u201d <em>(Schriro, supra, </em>542 U.S. at pp. 355-356 [124 S.Ct. at p. 2525], italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Moreover, violations of the new rule announced in <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. 36, are subject to harmless error analysis, and are not considered structural errors as in <em>Gideon, supra, </em>372 U.S. 335. (See <em>U.S. v. Manfre </em>(8th Cir. 2004) 368 F.3d 832; <em>Uphoff, supra, </em>381 F.3d at pp. 1226-1227.) It would, therefore, be difficult to conclude that the rule in <em>Crawford </em>alters fundamental due process rights. (See <em>Tyler v. Cain </em>(2001) 533 U.S. 656, 667, fn. 7 [150 L.Ed.2d 632, 121 S.Ct. 2478]; <em>U.S. v. Mora </em>(10th Cir. 2002) 293 F.3d 1213, 1219 [because error under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348] can be excused as harmless where the evidence is overwhelming, it cannot be considered a watershed decision].)  Accordingly, we conclude <em>Crawford </em>is not a watershed decision under the second <em>Teague </em>exception and, therefore, does not apply retroactively to petitions for habeas corpus review like Moore\u2019s that collaterally challenge convictions already final on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Because we have determined <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. 36, does not apply to Moore\u2019s petition, we proceed to analyze his claim trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the admission of the 911 tape on the ground such violated his right to confrontation under <em>Roberts. </em>The court in <em>Roberts </em>recognized the confrontation clause \u201cwas intended to exclude some hearsay\u201d <em>(Roberts, supra, </em>448 U.S. at p. 63), but that it allows \u201chearsay marked with such trustworthiness that \u2018there is no material departure from the reason of the general rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 65, quoting <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts </em>(1934) 291 U.S. 97, 107 [78 L.Ed. 674, 54 S.Ct. 330].) The court in <em>Roberts </em>stated reliability could be established either through \u201ca showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness,\u201d or be inferred from the fact the evidence fell \u201cwithin a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d <em>(Roberts, supra, </em>448 U.S. at p. 66.) An excited utterance, or spontaneous statement exception to the hearsay rule has been held not to violate the confrontation clause. <em>(White v. Illinois </em>(1992) 502 U.S. 346, 355 [116 L.Ed.2d 848, 112 S.Ct. 736]; <em>People v. Jones </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 653, 664 [202 Cal.Rptr. 289].) Moore acknowledges this fact, conceding the portions of the 911 tape with Autumn\u2019s \u201cexcited\u201d voice on it did not violate his right to confrontation because it fell within such established exception to the hearsay rule, and noting further she testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Moore only claims the statements of the third party who assisted Autumn with the 911 call violated his confrontation rights and that the failure of his trial counsel to specifically object on such ground, or to ask for some curative instruction regarding the unknown man provided him ineffective assistance. Moore did not raise the issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on appeal, and has not provided any declaration of trial counsel as to why he did not object in such matter or seek such curative instruction. Because he did not do so and the record sheds no light on why counsel failed to do so, we can only guess why trial defense counsel did not object to the portion of the 911 tape of which Moore now complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Clearly, as the trial court found, the short portion of the tape played for the jury was relevant to the issue of consent, was more probative than prejudicial after being carefully edited by the court, and was admissible for the nonhearsay purpose of showing Autumn\u2019s demeanor during the call as well as to corroborate her account of what happened. Autumn\u2019s statements, as already conceded by Moore, also fell under the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d exception to the hearsay rule. The statements of the unknown man added no information of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>his own. Rather he acted as a conduit of information, repeating the dispatcher\u2019s questions to Autumn and then relaying her answers to the 911 operator. As such, his statements merely provided some context to Autumn\u2019s excited utterances. Because such statements may have been admissible for the purpose of providing a complete picture of Autumn\u2019s call to the police (Evid. Code, \u00a7 356), we do not believe a reasonably competent attorney would have been ineffective for failing to object to them on right to confrontation grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Moreover, on this record, where Moore had testified he and Meza had taken Autumn to the trolley station after having sex with her at the motel because she had started crying and was hysterical, Moore\u2019s trial counsel may have had a tactical reason for not objecting to the brief portion of the tape, which showed Autumn\u2019s demeanor was consistent with Moore\u2019s testimony. In addition, counsel may have had a tactical reason for not pressing for a curative instruction, which would have only emphasized the evidence again. Moore has simply not shown his counsel\u2019s failure to object was not within the reasonable tactical choices of a competent attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">However, even assuming there was error in admitting the 911 tape and Moore\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance was thus deficient, he has not shown \u201c \u2018a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional error[], the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ledesma, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 217-218.) Autumn had testified at trial she did not consent to the sex acts and had called 911 right away to report she had been raped. A police officer testified she had been crying and shaking at the time she was interviewed about the crimes. Both Autumn and Holmes testified Moore\u2019s codefendant Meza had had a gun during the encounter. Because the totality of this testimony alone shows the elements of nonconsensual sex for Moore\u2019s convictions, it is not reasonably probable the trial would have ended differently had Moore\u2019s trial counsel objected to the 911 tape on grounds it violated his right to confrontation and the tape had been excluded or admitted with an admonishment to ignore the statements of the unknown man.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">We conclude Moore has not met his burden of showing his counsel\u2019s performance rendered the result of his trial unreliable or fundamentally unfair. <em>(Fretwell, supra, </em>506 U.S. 364; <em>Ledesma, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 217-218.) Therefore, Moore\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails and we deny his petition for habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Haller, J., and Aaron, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
