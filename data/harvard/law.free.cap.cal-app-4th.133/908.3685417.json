She claims the Criminal Division of the South Central <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>District of the Los Angeles County Superior Court enforces an invalid local rule requiring all pretrial motions, regardless of nature or type, be both filed and heard 30 days before trial, and for this reason the court refused to calendar her <em>Pitchess </em>motion filed 30 days before trial. We conclude the court\u2019s apparent practice of requiring all motions to be filed and heard 30 days before trial is invalid because it was not properly promulgated in accordance with statute or with the California Rules of Court. We further conclude that to the extent the court is not making individualized assessments of the needs and complexities of each case before setting dates for hearing motions the court\u2019s local practice or policy is similarly suspect. Accordingly, we will issue a writ of mandate to grant the requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">An undercover vice officer arrested petitioner Hall for prostitution on April 14, 2005. An information filed on May 25, 2005, charged petitioner with one felony violation of prostitution with prior convictions for prostitution after having tested positive for the HIV virus.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a second count the information charged petitioner with the crime of attempted unlawful sex while infected with HIV.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Petitioner was arraigned in the south central district of respondent superior court on May 25, 2005, and pled not guilty. The arraignment court set a trial date of July 25, 2005, on the \u201clast\u201d or 60th day.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court set an early pretrial date of June 21, and set a motion cutoff date of 30 days before trial, or June 27. The court set the motion cutoff date without inquiring whether either counsel intended to file any pretrial motions, and if so, which. The court simply stated, \u201cMotion cut-off will be 30 days prior to trial, June 27th. Please have any motions calendared and heard on or before that date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">On June 27 defense counsel filed a <em>Pitchess </em>motion with the clerk and requested it be calendared for July 22. The next day the clerk telephoned defense counsel to advise the trial court did not permit the clerk to calendar his <em>Pitchess </em>motion for July 22 because the motion cutoff date of June 27 had passed. The clerk informed defense counsel the court required a declaration showing good cause why the motion should be heard after the 30-day motion cutoff date. The clerk cited rule 4.100 of the California Rules of Court as authority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>On June 29 defense counsel contested the court\u2019s order requiring a declaration under penalty of perjury showing good cause why the motion should be calendared for a date after the motion cutoff date. The court refused to calendar the <em>Pitchess </em>motion without such a declaration. According to defense counsel, the court cited a local \u201c30-day motion cutoff rule\u201d as authority for refusing to calendar the <em>Pitchess </em>motion absent a declaration demonstrating good cause. Defense counsel protested a declaration showing good cause was not required by either court rule or statute and argued he was not seeking a continuance of the trial or of any scheduled hearing date.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Counsel urged the court to reconsider, arguing the motion could be calendared and heard within the statutory 60 days because sufficient time remained before the scheduled trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Thereafter defense counsel learned the source of the so-called 30-day motion cutoff rule was a memo dated October 31, 2002, directed to attorneys from Judge John Cheroske, the supervising judge in the Compton courthouse. This memo states \u201call motions are to be calendared and heard at least 30 days prior to the trial date.\u201d The memo cites as authority California Rules of Court, rule 4.100 on arraignments<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and a local rule, since repealed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Petitioner filed this petition for writ of mandate alleging the Compton court had no authority to impose or enforce an automatic and arbitrary 30-day motion cutoff rule. She requests an order directing the court to allow her to file her <em>Pitchess </em>motion and to thereafter determine the motion on the merits. We stayed the trial court proceedings and issued an order directing respondent court to show cause why it should not be compelled to accept petitioner\u2019s <em>Pitchess </em>motion for filing and to schedule a hearing on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">I. <em>THE COMPTON COURT\u2019S APPARENT PRACTICE OF REQUIRING ALL MOTIONS TO BE FILED AND HEARD 30 DAYS BEFORE TRIAL IS THE FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT OF A LOCAL RULE AND AS SUCH IT IS INVALID BECAUSE IT WAS NOT PROPERLY PROMULGATED OR ADOPTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTE AND THE RULES OF COURT</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Petitioner asserts the Compton court\u2019s 30-day motion cutoff rule is invalid and unenforceable because it was not promulgated and adopted pursuant to procedures dictated by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Respondent court affirmatively asserts it has no such rule. However, respondent court provided no positive evidence in the form of declarations or otherwise to support its assertion. We may thus deem its denial merely a response to join the issues raised in the petition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, we may take judicial notice this is the third time a petition for writ of mandate has been filed in the Court of Appeal to challenge the validity of the Compton court\u2019s alleged policy of universally requiring all motions be both filed and heard 30 days before trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>In any event, respondent court\u2019s affirmative assertion no such rule exists corroborates petitioner\u2019s claim the Compton court\u2019s policy, which in practical effect amounts to a 30-day motion cutoff rule was not adopted or properly promulgated in accordance with the statutes governing the promulgation and adoption of local rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Code of Civil Procedure section 575.1 prescribes the procedures for enacting and adopting valid local court rules. Any rule proposed by the presiding judge must be submitted for consideration to all the judges of the court. The rule must be published and submitted to local bar associations and others, as specified by the Judicial Council, for consideration and recommendations. Once a majority of the judges have officially adopted the rule, then it must be filed as specified in Government Code section 68071 and as specified in the California Rules of Court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The proposed rule must then be available for public examination and published for general distribution in accordance with the California Rules of Court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">These same requirements apply even if a proposed rule pertains only to a particular judge\u2019s courtroom or only to a particular branch or district of the superior court. The statute specifies individual judge\u2019s rules and branch and district rules are local rules of court and subject to the adoption, publication, comment, and filing requirements specified by statute and the California Rules of Court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Government Code section 68070 similarly authorizes courts to make rules for their own governance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, Government Code section 68071 directs, \u201cNo rule adopted by a superior court shall take effect until January 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>or July 1, whichever comes first, following the 30th day after it has been filed with the Judicial Council and the clerk of the court, and made immediately available for public examination. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">If the memo from Supervising Judge John Cheroske directing all motions be both filed and heard 30 days before trial constitutes a local rule for felony matters heard in the Compton court then it is invalid because there is nothing to suggest such rule went through the procedures mandated by Code of Civil Procedure section 575.1 or Government Code sections 68070 and 68071. Thus, the trial court erred if it relied on what would be an invalid local rule when it refused to calendar petitioner\u2019s <em>Pitchess </em>motion absent a declaration showing good cause.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Absent proper adoption the purported local rule or policy could not provide authority for either rigidly adhering to a preset motion cutoff date or for requiring a declaration showing good cause why permission should be granted to file the motion beyond the cutoff date. As petitioner argues, the good cause declaration requirement would amount to no more than an unwritten exception to an invalid local rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Moreover, even properly adopted local rules are only valid to the extent they do not conflict with existing law or the California Rules of Court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This is true of a local courtroom rule,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> as well as of an informal court policy.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cWhile trial judges have \u2018inherent power to control litigation before them, . . .\u2019 they have \u2018 \u201cno authority to issue local courtroom rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>which conflict with any statute\u201d or are \u201cinconsistent with the law.\u201d . . .\u2019 <em>(Rutherford </em>v. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 967 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 16, 941 P.2d 1203], citations omitted.) If a trial court adopts a rule that \u2018conflicts with any statewide statute, rule of law, or Judicial Council rule, then it is an inappropriate exercise of that court\u2019s powers. . . .\u2019 <em>(Ibid., </em>citations omitted; see also <em>Sierra Craft, Inc. v.

Evidence Code section 1043, subdivision (a) specifies <em>Pitchess </em>motions must be filed in conformity with Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. Code of Civil Procedure section 1005 states written notice must be given 16 court days before the hearing (with different days\u2019 notice for mail or other service).  Rule 4.111 of the California Rules of Court, on the other hand, only states motions must be served and filed at least 10 calendar days prior to the hearing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">These provisions discuss the required written notice of a hearing. However, none purports to state when a <em>Pitchess </em>motion must be heard or how far before the trial date a <em>Pitchess </em>motion should be heard. More specifically, none of these provisions requires a <em>Pitchess </em>motion to be <em>both filed and heard </em>30 days before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Rule 4.112 of the California Rules of Court concerns \u201creadiness conferences\u201d and gives some indication when pretrial motions can be heard. As relevant here, subdivision (a) of rule 4.112 states in felony cases the court may hold a readiness conference \u201cwithin 1 to 14 days before the date set for trial.\u201d Subdivision (b) is entitled \u201cMotions,\u201d and provides, \u201cExcept for good cause, the court should hear and decide any pretrial motion in a criminal case <em>before or at </em>the readiness conference.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In contrast with the Compton court\u2019s apparent policy or practice of requiring all motions to be both filed and heard 30 days before trial, rule 4.112 of the California Rules of Court would seemingly permit the hearing of <em>Pitchess </em>motions as close to the trial date as the day before. Moreover, rule 4.112 reflects a policy of granting more leeway regarding when motions must be heard than does the Compton court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>alleged practice of imposing and enforcing an automatic and universal date of 30 days before trial to file and hear any motions. It thus appears a local policy or practice which has the effect of automatically cutting off a defendant\u2019s right to file and have hearings on motions at the 30-day mark before trial is inconsistent with the California Rules of Court and would also be invalid on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">II. <em>THE ARRAIGNMENT COURT SHOULD MAKE AN INDIVIDUALIZED CONSIDERATION OF EACH CASE BEFORE SETTING DATES FOR FILING AND HEARING MOTIONS.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">A local rule or policy must be consistent with due process in order to be valid.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Application and enforcement of any automatic 30-day motion cutoff date has the potential to deprive a criminal defendant of procedural due process and in turn to a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">In light of the minimum 16-cowri-day written notice required for <em>Pitchess </em>motions, defense counsel would be required in all cases to file a written motion and serve the required notice within a week or so of the defendant\u2019s arraignment to comply with the court\u2019s automatic 30-day cutoff date for filing and hearing motions. This places an unduly onerous burden on defense counsel to do all that is required within such a short period of time on penalty of forfeiting his or her client\u2019s right to potentially significant discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Moreover, the information to suggest a <em>Pitchess </em>motion should be filed may not be immediately available to defense counsel even if he or she had the time and ability to file other pretrial motions directly after the arraignment. Absent timely receipt of copies of police reports, witness statements and like discovery, defense counsel would be in no position to realize a <em>Pitchess </em>motion was called for in the circumstances until it was too late. For example, counsel is required to wait at least 15 days to seek a court order for discovery in the event opposing counsel fails to provide discovery in compliance with an informal discovery request.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Under any automatic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>30-day motion cutoff rule counsel could not timely satisfy the 16-court-days\u2019 notice requirement in this scenario and would be entirely foreclosed from having the motion heard before the mandated 30-day cutoff. Indeed, if defense counsel received the information even only a week after arraignment, the 16-court-day written notice requirement for a <em>Pitchess </em>motion could still not be satisfied in order to secure a hearing date within the mandated 30 days before the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cThat counsel for a defendant has a right to reasonable opportunity to prepare for a trial is as fundamental as is the right to counsel.\u201d [Citations.] It is also as fundamental as the defendant\u2019s right to be advised of the charges against him [or her], for the latter right is illusory if he then is denied sufficient time to prepare to meet such charges. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> A local policy, practice or rule which impinges on the fundamental rights of an accused to receive a fair trial and which interferes with the accused\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel is constitutionally infirm.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Court rules should be designed to accomplish the ends of justice, to protect rights, and to implement the substantive law. When a policy, practice or rule operates instead to defeat these purposes, and deprives an accused of a fair trial or determination on the merits, then the policy, practice or rule must give way.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">To avoid impinging on a defendant\u2019s procedural due process rights courts should instead make an individualized assessment of the complexity and needs of each case. For some motions, especially <em>Pitchess </em>motions requiring 16 court days\u2019 notice, setting a date only 30 calendar days from the arraignment date might present procedural due process issues absent special accommodation to hear such motions somewhat closer to the trial date. Motions to suppress evidence under Penal Code section 1538.5 may similarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>require special consideration, for example, in instances where numerous witnesses need to be subpoenaed and available to testify. Alternatively, the necessity for a <em>Pitchess </em>or suppression motion may only become apparent after a review of available discovery. When the prosecution has not made discovery available in a timely manner courts may have to accommodate late requests to hear pertinent motions made relevant and necessary only by the late-received discovery. To the extent the Compton court\u2019s local policy or practice does not make this type of individualized determination of the particular needs of a given case before setting dates for hearing motions, it presents the risk of impinging on a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">At oral argument petitioner argued filing and hearing dates set by an arraignment court under rule 4.100 of the California Rules of Court should be sufficiently flexible preclusion should never be a sanction for failing to comply with dates set for filing and hearing motions. We are not persuaded. Such a limitless rule has the potential for interfering with the orderly administration of justice as well as the potential for interfering with a trial court\u2019s power to enforce its proper orders. All courts have the statutory power to compel obedience to their judgments and orders.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Moreover, all courts have \u201cfundamental inherent equity, supervisory, and administrative powers, as well as inherent power to control litigation before them.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, when an arraignment court makes an individualized assessment of the case, and makes case-specific orders regarding the most appropriate dates for filing and hearing pretrial motions based on this individualized assessment, then those court orders are valid and enforceable. Case specific orders based on an individualized assessment of the case are ignored at counsel\u2019s peril. If counsel does not comply with such a case specific order setting a deadline for filing and/or hearing a motion then he or she will face the risk of not having his or her motion heard\u2014absent some showing of good cause why the motion should be heard beyond this case specific date.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Respondent court asserts it is immaterial whether it has or enforces an invalid local rule because it claims the 30-day motion cutoff date imposed in this case was in fact a case-specific order imposed by the court at arraignment. Respondent court asserts the arraignment court set the hearing cutoff date\u2014not in reliance on an invalid local rule\u2014but instead in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>rule 4.100 of the California Rules of Court directing arraignment courts to set dates for trial, the readiness conference and for filing and hearing motions.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">A review of the transcript of the arraignment hearing belies respondent court\u2019s argument. There was no discussion regarding the potential complexity of the case, nor any discussion of what discovery counsel sought, or of which motions either counsel contemplated filing before the arraignment court imposed the 30-day motion cutoff date.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The court simply directed, \u201cMotion cut-off [ric] will be 30 days prior to trial, June 27th. Please have any motions calendared and heard on or before that date.\u201d The court imposed this 30-day date even before the prosecutor informed the court she intended to file \u201can 1101 motion\u201d and needed to call witnesses regarding the prior convictions. The total lack of discussion regarding any aspect of the case or of the motions counsel proposed to file before imposing the 30-day motion cutoff date is strong circumstantial evidence the court automatically imposed the date based solely on what appears to be a local policy or practice of automatically imposing a 30-day motion cutoff date rather than for any case-specific reason. Moreover, we note the reason articulated by the trial court in rejecting the <em>Pitchess </em>motion for calendaring was because the late filing violated the local practice of requiring all motions be filed and heard 30 days before the trial date. In his declaration in support of the petition, defense counsel stated in rejecting the motion for calendaring the trial court did not mention any other reason for its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In short, the record in this case supports petitioner\u2019s assertion the arraignment court in setting the deadline for hearings was simply implementing an apparent automatic policy of requiring all motions to be filed and heard 30 days before trial. There is nothing in this record to suggest the arraignment court imposed the date as an exercise of its discretion based on any discussion of the case or any factual finding the particular date was the most suitable for the case. Accordingly, we do not find respondent court\u2019s argument persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The petition is granted. Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the superior court to calendar petitioner\u2019s <em>Pitchess </em>motion and to thereafter rule on the merits of the motion; and further to preclude any further enforcement of the rule or policy setting presumptive motion cutoff date. Our stay of the proceedings in the underlying criminal action will be vacated upon finality of this opinion. Good cause appearing, this opinion shall become final within five days of the date hereof.
