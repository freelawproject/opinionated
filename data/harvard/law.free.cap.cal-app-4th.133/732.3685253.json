Miller was injured when the horse she was riding slipped on a portion of a public riding trail that crosses over the driveway of Janice and Jeffrey Weitzen (together the Weitzens). In this appeal, we must determine whether Civil Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 846, which immunizes property owners from liability arising from the recreational use of their property, applies to protect the Weitzens and, if so, whether the statutory exception for persons who enter property \u201cfor a consideration\u201d is triggered by Miller\u2019s payment of trail maintenance fees to her riding club. In addition, we must determine whether the trial court properly instructed the jury on the appropriate standard of care required of persons protected by section 846. As we resolve each of these questions in favor of the Weitzens, and in accordance with the challenged rulings of the trial court, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">On November 3, 2001, Miller was riding her horse along a public riding trail adjacent to San Elijo Road in San Diego County. The horse lost its footing on the surface of the trail at the point where the trail crossed over the Weitzens\u2019 driveway. Both horse and rider fell to the ground, and Miller seriously injured her wrist and hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">Miller sued both the Rancho Santa Fe Association, the organization responsible for maintaining the trail (the Association), and the Weitzens. At trial, Miller put on evidence that about two months before her accident, Jeffrey Weitzen had resurfaced the driveway, including the portion that crossed the riding trail, with a common driveway resurfacing product. He did not obtain a permit prior to doing the resurfacing as was required by San Diego County (the County). The evidence also showed that after the resurfacing, but prior to Miller\u2019s accident, the Association had been notified that another horse had fallen in that location. As a result, the Association placed notices on either side of the Weitzens\u2019 driveway, warning riders of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>slippery condition. The Weitzens testified that they regularly saw the signs, but did not inquire as to why they were there; Miller testified that she did not see the signs prior to her fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">It is undisputed that the riding trail that passes alongside the Weitzens\u2019 home is on land owned by the County. By virtue of their home ownership, the Weitzens held an encroachment permit issued by the County that allowed them to construct a driveway across the trail. A County public works coordinator and former trails coordinator testified that by virtue of this permit, the Weitzens and any future owners of their property possess a right to use the driveway to travel to and from the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Miller testified that she paid dues to the Rancho Santa Fe Riding Club (Riding Club) where she boarded her horse. These dues included a \u201ctrail maintenance fee,\u201d which Miller asserts \u201cshe was advised was used to help maintain the forty . . . miles of riding trails throughout the community of Rancho Santa Fe.\u201d Although the Riding Club does not maintain the trail at issue in this case, it occasionally gives money to the Association, which does maintain the trails, and pays the Association $1 a year to rent an acre of land on which its physical facility sits. While some trails in Rancho Santa Fe are on private property and can only be used by Riding Club members, trails that are on County land, such as the trail in front of the Weitzens\u2019 house, are open to any member of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">At the close of the evidence, the trial court determined, as a matter of law, that section 846 applied to protect both the Weitzens and the Association. It further determined that Miller\u2019s evidence regarding payments for trail maintenance (if credited by the jury) was sufficient to abrogate section 846 immunity as to the Association, but not as to the Weitzens. The court therefore instructed the jury that if it determined that consideration was paid, it could find the Association liable for Miller\u2019s injuries under ordinary negligence principles. Under the court\u2019s instructions, however, the jury could only find the Weitzens liable if it found their failure to warn or prevent Miller\u2019s injury was \u201cwillful or malicious\u201d\u2014the heightened burden required for proving liability against persons protected by section 846 recreational use immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">After the jury issued, and the trial court responded to, a number of notes indicating confusion about the consideration exception to section 846 recreational use immunity, the jury returned a special verdict, finding Miller had paid consideration to use the trails, and that the Association was liable for Miller\u2019s injuries. The jury found that the Weitzens were not liable under the heightened \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d standard. The jury determined that Miller\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>damages were $94,603.81, with liability apportioned 0 percent for the Weitzens, 60 percent for the Association and 40 percent for Miller\u2019s own negligence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Section 846 immunizes property owners from liability arising from the recreational use of their property. The statute has two exceptions relevant to this appeal. A property owner can still be liable for injuries to recreational users (i) where a failure to warn or guard against a danger was \u201cwillful or malicious\u201d or (ii) where consideration was paid in return for permission to enter the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Miller claims that the trial court improperly applied section 846 to limit the Weitzens\u2019 liability for her injuries because: (i) Section 846 immunity does not apply to the Weitzens as they are not property owners subject to the protection of the statute; (ii) even if the Weitzens are considered property owners under section 846, the statutory exception for recreational users who enter \u201cfor a consideration\u201d strips them of its protection; and (iii) even if section 846 immunity properly applies to the Weitzens, the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury defining the heightened \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d standard for liability was improper because it deviated from an available Judicial Council of California Civil Jury Instructions (CACI) form instruction. We address each of these contentions in turn.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">\n<em>The Weitzens\u2019 Rights to the Property at the Intersection of Their Driveway and the Trail Constitute an \u201cInterest in Real Property\u201d Under Section 846</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Miller\u2019s contention that the Weitzens\u2019 interest in the property where she was injured is insufficient to come within the protection of section 846 fails to recognize the section\u2019s \u201cexceptionally broad and singularly unambiguous\u201d definition of protected property \u201cinterests.\u201d <em>(Ornelas v. Randolph </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1095, 1102-1103 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 594, 847 P.2d 560].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 846 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>applies to protect any \u201cowner of any estate or any other interest in real property, whether possessory or nonpossessory.\u201d Miller attempts to sidestep the broad sweep of this statutory language by highlighting the legislative purpose of section 846\u2014to open up private land for public recreational use. (See <em>Delta Farms Reclamation Dist. v. Superior Court </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 699, 707 [190 Cal.Rptr. 494, 660 P.2d 1168] [\u201cThe purpose of section 846 is to encourage property owners \u2018to allow the general public to recreate free of charge on <em>privately </em>owned property\u2019 \u201d].) She contends that this purpose would not be served by protecting the Weitzens because the portion of their driveway at issue is on County-owned property already open to the public, and the Weitzens cannot \u201cexercise control\u201d over it \u201cin terms of allowing persons to use the equestrian trail.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Miller\u2019s contention is directly refuted by <em>Hubbard v. Brown </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 189, 197 [266 Cal.Rptr. 491, 785 P.2d 1183] <em>(Hubbard). </em>In <em>Hubbard, </em>our Supreme Court explicitly disapproved an earlier case, <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 253, 258-259 [193 Cal.Rptr. 336], which erroneously had ruled section 846 inapplicable because the land at issue was state owned, and the defendant, a power company, could not exclude recreational users. <em>(Hubbard, </em>at p. 197.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To the contrary, the court held that section 846 serves to \u201cimmunize owners of <em>any </em>interest in real property, regardless of whether the interest includes the right of exclusive possession.\u201d <em>(Hubbard, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 197, italics added.) Thus, the court determined in <em>Hubbard </em>that the holder of a permit to graze livestock on federal lands was an owner of an \u201cinterest in real property\u201d under section 846, even though the land covered by the grazing permit was \u201cpublicly owned and evidently already open to the public for recreational purposes.\u201d <em>(Hubbard, </em>at pp. 196-197.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>This sweeping scope of section 846 is a result of a 1980 amendment to the statute that came in response to two Court of Appeal cases, one of which, <em>Darr </em>v. <em>Lone Star Industries, Inc. </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 895 [157 Cal.Rptr. 90] <em>(Darr), </em>is directly analogous to the case at hand. <em>(Hubbard, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 194-195.) In <em>Darr, </em>the Third District Court of Appeal held that \u201ca right of way over [state] property\u201d-\u2014a bridge constructed on public land to enable the transport of gravel from one side of a publicly owned river to the other\u2014was not covered by section 846. <em>(Darr, </em>at p. 900.) The court determined that the right of way constituted a nonpossessory easement which although an \u201cinterest in real property,\u201d was not a possessory \u201cestate\u201d as required by the text of the pre-1980 section 846. <em>(Darr, </em>at p. 901 [\u201c \u2018While an easement is clearly an \u201cinterest in land\u201d ... it is equally clearly never an \u201cestate in land,\u201d \u2019 \u201d quoting 3 Powell on Real Property (1977) Easements and Licenses, ch. 34, \u00a7 405].) In response, the Legislature amended section 846 to cover \u201cany . . . interest in real property,\u201d whether \u201cpossessory or nonpossessory,\u201d specifically to \u201cnegate\u201d the outcome in <em>Darr. (Hubbard, </em>at pp. 194\u2014195, citing Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 1966, 4 Stats. 1980 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) Summary Dig., p. 110; and Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Liability-Recreational Use of Land, (Feb. 11, 1980).)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">It would, thus, fly in the face of the unambiguously expressed legislative intent to rule that section 846, as amended, does not apply to the Weitzens\u2019 property interest. That interest (an improved right-of-way over a public trail) clearly fits within the statutory language of \u201cany . . . interest in real property,\u201d and is indistinguishable from the property interest in <em>Darr </em>(an improved right-of-way over a public river) that the Legislature explicitly sought to protect by the amendment. (See <em>Moyer v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224] [noting \u201cfundamental rule\u201d that a court \u201c \u2018should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Hubbard, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 197 [\u201cthe Legislature clearly intended ... to immunize private owners of easements . . . from tort liability to recreational users\u201d]; cf. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1117 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 831] [upholding section 846 immunity for utility company that held easement for placement of utility poles on private land of another].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>In light of the broad statutory language and unambiguous legislative intent to protect virtually every species of property \u201cowner\u201d under section 846, we conclude the trial court properly determined that the section applies to protect the Weitzens in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">\n<em>The Consideration Exception to Section 846 Does Not Apply to Abrogate the Weitzens \u2019 Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Miller contends that even if the Weitzens possess the requisite property interest, her payment of dues to the Riding Club, and the club\u2019s subsequent payments to the Association, which maintained the riding trails, constitute sufficient consideration to trigger the statutory exception to section 846. She adds that these payments had a \u201cdirect present and actual benefit\u201d to the Weitzens by contributing to an improved trail system in the area in which they lived and decreasing their proportional maintenance payments for the same. We disagree with Miller\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">To trigger the consideration exception of section 846, payment must be made in exchange for <em>\u201cpermission to </em>enter\u201d the property or \u201creceived from others for the same purpose.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) Consistent with this text, the few published California cases interpreting the consideration exception have noted that for the exception to apply, consideration must generally be paid \u201cin the form of an entrance fee.\u201d <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.4th at pp. 316-317 [\u201cas regards section 846, we are aware of no cases in which consideration did not involve the actual payment of an entrance fee by plaintiff to defendant\u201d]; <em>Moore v. City of Torrance </em>(1979) 101 Cal.App.3d 66, 72 [166 Cal.Rptr. 192] [\u201cClearly, consideration means some type of entrance fee or charge for permitting a person to use specially constructed facilities,\u201d such as \u201camusement facilities in government-owned parks that charge admission fees\u201d], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Delta Farms Reclamation Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at pp. 707, 710.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> No such entrance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>fee was required to use the property at issue here. The trail that crossed over the Weitzens\u2019 driveway is analogous to a public sidewalk; it is open to any member of the public without charge of any kind. Accordingly, neither Miller nor anyone else paid consideration for \u201cpermission to enter\u201d that property (\u00a7 846), and the consideration exception to section 846 does not apply. (See <em>Collins v. Martella </em>(1st Cir. 1994) 17 F.3d 1, 5 [holding, under analogous recreational use immunity statute, that payments to homeowners association that maintained property where plaintiff was injured did not constitute consideration for entry where homeowners could enter property regardless of payment of fees].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Miller\u2019s reliance on <em>Johnson, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.4th 310, 316, for the proposition that the consideration exception is \u201cnot limited solely to direct payment of entrance fees,\u201d but instead is triggered whenever a defendant receives a benefit from a payment, is unconvincing. The quoted language from <em>Johnson </em>emphasizes that consideration in the form of an entrance fee need not be <em>\u201cdirect,\u201d </em>not that it can take a form unrelated to the statutory requirement that consideration be paid <em>in exchange for \u201cpermission to enter\u201d </em>the property. In fact, in <em>Johnson </em>the court ruled that section 846 immunity applied despite the fact that the plaintiff had paid a third party to provide food and entertainment on the property. <em>(Johnson, </em>at p. 317.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The trial court, thus, properly determined that the consideration exception did not apply to strip the Weitzens of section 846 recreational use immunity because neither Miller nor anyone else paid consideration for \u201cpermission to enter\u201d the property on which Miller was injured.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">\n<em>The Trial Court\u2019s Jury Instruction Defining \u201cWillful and Malicious\u201d Conduct Does Not Constitute Reversible Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Huffman, Acting P.

The Weitzens, however, do not claim that they come under the protection of section 846 by virtue of their repairs to the driveway, but rather by virtue of their property interest in land used for recreational purposes.

The issue here is whether section 846 applies to <em>immunize </em>a person who holds an interest in land used for recreational purposes from ordinary principles of liability under California law\u2014such as those recognized in <em>Selger </em>and <em>Swanberg.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b593-10\"> Miller\u2019s argument here is analogous to that advanced in <em>Moore v.
