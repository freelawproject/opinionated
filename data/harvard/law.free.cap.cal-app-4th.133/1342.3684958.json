J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApYh\">Defendant and appellant, Donald Wiege, Jr., appeals from the judgment entered following his conviction, by jury trial, for receiving stolen property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496d, subd. (a)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sentenced to state prison for two years, he now appeals, claiming there was trial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-12\">Viewed in accordance with the usual rule of appellate review <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ochoa </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199, 1206 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 23, 864 P.2d 103], the evidence established the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-13\">1. <em>Prosecution evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-14\">On May 4, 2004, Ana Robles drove her 1995 Chevy Tahoe Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) to her 6:00 a.m. shift at the Robinsons-May distribution center in the City of Industry. She parked in the company parking lot. Around 10:00 a.m., Robles was notified her SUV had been stolen. She checked, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>found it was missing from the parking lot. She had not given anyone permission to use it. When she retrieved her vehicle that afternoon, she found the dashboard frame broken and her car\u2019s stereo equipment ripped out and thrown into the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">At about 9:35 a.m. that same morning, police officers went to East 25th Street in Los Angeles. At the rear of this residence, they found Robles\u2019s stolen SUV. Defendant Wiege was in the backseat and he appeared to be busy doing something. As one officer described the scene, \u201cThe interior of the vehicle was obviously stripped. The stereo equipment was pulled out\u2014was laying on the seats inside the vehicle. It looked like somebody had ransacked the interior of the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">Wiege asked one of the arresting officers, \u201cYou got me with Lo-Jack, huh?\u201d Wiege said he was going to get $2,000 for the car, but \u201che wanted to keep the rims because they were nice rims.\u201d As he was being taken to a patrol car, Wiege said he couldn\u2019t get a job because he had been shot in the leg the year before, \u201cand that\u2019s why he does this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-7\">2. <em>Defense evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-8\">Wiege did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-9\">Denise Calderon testified she and Wiege were living together in May 2004. On the day he was arrested, she had given him a ride to a friend\u2019s house at about 9:25 or 9:30 a.m. on her way to work. The friend\u2019s house was on 25th Street, just a few blocks from where she and Wiege were living.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-10\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-11\">1. The trial court erred by denying Wiege\u2019s <em>Faretta </em>motion to represent himself. <em>(Faretta v. California </em>(1975) 422 <em>U.S. 806 </em>[45 L.Ed.2d. 562, 95 S.Ct. 2525].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-12\">2. The trial court erred by requiring that Wiege either be the first defense witness or not testify at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-14\">1. <em>The trial court did not err by denying the Faretta motion.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>2. <em>The trial court did not require Wiege to testify first or not at all.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">Wiege contends the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment and fair trial rights by requiring that he either be the very first defense witness or that he not testify at all. This claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">a. <em>Procedural background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">Before the start of jury voir dire on Tuesday, September 21, defense counsel told the trial court he had a witness who could only testify on Thursday morning. The trial court said, \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for Thursday morning, if you have a witness. No problem with that.\u201d The People finished presenting their witnesses on Wednesday in the midaftemoon. The trial court then expressed its displeasure about losing the rest of the afternoon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-8\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019m not totally happy that we\u2019re adjourning now. What was the story why your witness was not able to come today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-9\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: I planned\u2014I thought they were going to talk longer, and she\u2019s working. So I said she could come tomorrow morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-10\">\u201cThe Court: Is there any other witnesses you intend to call?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-11\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: To be candid, her and, if it doesn\u2019t go well, I may have to put my client on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-12\">\u201cThe Court: Well, you have to put your client on now. If you\u2019re going to call him, you have to put him on now, because I agreed that she could come tomorrow, but there\u2019s no reason for him\u2014for me to just stop and do this tomorrow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-13\">\u201cIf you want me to take a break, and you want to talk to him, you can talk to him, but I\u2019m not waiting until tomorrow for him. I only agreed that this last witness could testify . . . tomorrow.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1121-14\">After discussing some other issues, the trial court said, \u201cI\u2019ll take a brief break. You talk to him. I want to know this afternoon if he\u2019s going to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-15\">Following this recess, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-16\">\u201cThe Court: We\u2019re on the record. I indicated to the defense to let me know whether his client is going to take the stand. Is he going to []take the stand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>\u201c[Defense counsel]: Your Honor, for the record, I\u2019m going to object to . . . being forced to decide whether today he has to testify or not. I was going to determine whether the witness tomorrow was sufficient. If the witness tomorrow is not sufficient, then I was considering putting him on tomorrow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-5\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019ll consider that, Mr. Lopez, but . . . ['][] ... [][].. . can you explain to me: What is it about that witness that will change whether your client is going to testify or not? What is it he\u2019s going to say? I mean, whether he\u2019s going to be a good witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-6\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: Your Honor, it just depends on what comes out in testimony. If the Court is asking me to decide today, my decision is he won\u2019t testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-7\">\u201cThe Court: You\u2019ll have to convince me tomorrow that there\u2019s some need to put him on. It\u2019s 3:05. We have another hour and 20 minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-8\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: I talked to that witness and . . . it\u2019s kind of what counsel said. I mean, what she\u2019s going to testify to is she\u2019s the girlfriend of the defendant . . . and she dropped him off about 9:20 in the morning, which would be about 15 minutes before the officers responded. And so, therefore, that\u2019s sort of counts 1 and 4 that it\u2019s an alibi for. I can\u2019t imagine what else\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-9\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: That should be sufficient. If that is what comes out, Your Honor, probably the odds are I won\u2019t call him. I just don\u2019t want anything\u2014I don\u2019t want to be precluded in case something\u2014cases have gone bad before, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-10\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t know. As I said, I asked you to put him on now. I don\u2019t think you get to decide the order of testimony. You made your record. I made my record, and I reserve the right not to allow him to testify tomorrow if I choose not to, because I\u2019m prepared right now to hear him, and you\u2019re not calling him now; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-11\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: Correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-12\">After asking Wiege if he understood he had a right to testify, the trial court said, \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll hold off. If there\u2019s not some changed circumstance told to me why he didn\u2019t testify today, he isn\u2019t testifying, because I\u2019m ready to go right now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-13\">The next morning, Denise Calderon testified she gave Wiege a ride to his friend\u2019s house about 9:25 or 9:30 a.m. on the day Robles\u2019s SUV was stolen. After Calderon was excused, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>\u201c[The Court:] Does the defense have any additional witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-5\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-6\">\u201cThe Court: Does the defense rest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-7\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: Yes, we do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1123-8\">On the People\u2019s motion, the trial court subsequently dismissed the two counts<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that were contradicted by Calderon\u2019s alibi testimony, and Wiege was convicted only on the charge of receiving stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-9\">b. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-10\"><em>Brooks v. Tennessee </em>(1972) 406 U.S. 605 [32 L.Ed.2d 358, 92 S.Ct. 1891] <em>(Brooks), </em>struck down a Tennessee statute which required any criminal defendant who wanted to testify to do so before any other defense testimony could be heard by the jury. <em>Brooks </em>concluded the statute violated the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and his due process right to have the full assistance of his attorney in planning his defense. \u201cAlthough a defendant will usually have some idea of the strength of his evidence, he cannot be absolutely certain that his witnesses will testify as expected or that they will be effective on the stand. They may collapse under skillful and persistent cross-examination, and through no fault of their own they may fail to impress the jury as honest and reliable witnesses.\u201d (406 U.S. at p. 609.) \u201cBecause of these uncertainties, a defendant may not know at the close of the State\u2019s case whether his own testimony will be necessary or even helpful to his cause. Rather than risk the dangers of taking the stand, he might prefer to remain silent at that point, putting off his testimony until its value can be realistically assessed. Yet, under the Tennessee rule, he cannot make that choice \u2018in the unfettered exercise of his own will.\u2019 [The statute] exacts a price for his silence by keeping him off the stand entirely unless he chooses to testify first. This, we think, casts a heavy burden on a defendant\u2019s otherwise unconditional right not to take the stand. The rule, in other words, \u2018cuts down on the privilege [to remain silent] by making its assertion costly.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Brooks, </em>at pp. 610-611, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-11\">Wiege argues the trial court\u2019s requirement that he testify first or not at all violated <em>Brooks. </em>The People argue there was no violation of <em>Brooks </em>because, although the trial court initially said Wiege had to testify on Wednesday <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>afternoon or not at all, the trial court effectively revised this ruling after defense counsel objected. The People argue, \u201cIn response [to defense counsel\u2019s objection], the trial court indicated it would entertain a request to call appellant as a witness the next day .... The trial court thus left open a door for appellant\u2019s counsel to call appellant as a witness the following day\u2014if there was some need to do so. On the next day, however, after [Calderon] completed her testimony, appellant\u2019s counsel did not raise the subject of calling appellant as a witness. Moreover, when the trial court asked whether the defense had any additional witnesses, appellant\u2019s counsel said it did not and rested ....[][] By not requesting to testify in spite of the trial court\u2019s indication that it would entertain such a request, appellant has forfeited [his <em>Brooks </em>claim].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">Wiege disputes this interpretation of the trial court\u2019s comments and argues the trial court never changed its ruling that he had to testify before Calderon. We disagree. It appears to us that, although the trial court was unhappy with losing part of an afternoon\u2019s court time, the trial court said it would reconsider the matter following Calderon\u2019s testimony. The record shows that immediately after defense counsel objected, the trial court retreated, saying: \u201cI\u2019ll consider that, Mr. Lopez,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll have to convince me tomorrow that there\u2019s some need to put him on,\u201d and \u201cI reserve the right not to allow him to testify tomorrow if I choose not to.\u201d Then, after further argument, the trial court clearly signaled it would entertain a request to have Wiege testify after Calderon, saying: <em>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll hold off. If there\u2019s not some changed circumstance </em>told to me why he didn\u2019t testify today, <em>he isn\u2019t testifying, </em>because I\u2019m ready to go right now.\u201d (Italics added.) As it turned out, there appears to have been no reason for defense counsel to put Wiege on the stand after hearing Calderon\u2019s testimony. If anything, Calderon gave testimony that was even more favorable to Wiege than what he had expected. Hence, there was no reason to put Wiege on the stand after his alibi witness testified.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">Because the trial court ultimately retreated from its initial directive that Wiege either testify first or not at all, the trial court did not violate the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Brooks </em>that a defendant\u2019s constitutional right against self-incrimination cannot be so burdened.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">Croskey, J., and Kitching, 1, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1119-15\"> All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1120-15\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1342.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1123-12\"> Count 1 had charged grand theft auto; count 4 had charged burglary of a vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1124-7\"> Defense counsel indicated he thought it would be \u201csufficient\u201d if Calderon testified she dropped Wiege off at his friend\u2019s house at 9:20 a.m. on the day of the offense. In fact, Calderon testified she drove Wiege to the friend\u2019s house at 9:25 or 9:30 a.m. The later she fixed the time of dropping him off, the better for Wiege.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
