J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahc4\">Jim Beam Brands Co. (Jim Beam) appeals from a grant of summary judgment in favor of the Franchise Tax Board (FTB) in a tax refund action. Jim Beam brought the action below after the State Board of Equalization (SEE) ruled that the gain from Jim Beam\u2019s sale of the stock of a wholly-owned subsidiary constituted \u201c \u2018[bjusiness income\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of Revenue and Taxation Code section 25120, subdivision (a). The trial court sustained the SBE\u2019s decision and held that income from the sale was apportionable to California. In this court, Jim Beam argues that the income from the sale of its subsidiary does not qualify as \u201cbusiness income\u201d under the statute. In the alternative, Jim Beam contends that even if the gain was business income, it is entitled to an adjustment of its tax basis in the stock to reflect certain undistributed earnings and profits. We disagree with both arguments and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Jim Beam is a distiller of bourbon whiskey. It also produces, or imports, and markets a wide variety of distilled spirits, including bourbon and other whiskeys, cordials, gin, and vodka. Prior to December 1987, Jim Beam was part of a unitary business group<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that consisted of Jim Beam, Taylor Food Products, Inc. (Taylor Food), Clear Spring Distilling Corporation (Clear Spring), Regal China Corporation, Berkeley Manufacturing Company, and Wood Terminal Company. In addition to Jim Beam\u2019s alcoholic beverage business, through its subsidiaries, Jim Beam engaged in other enterprises. Regal China Corporation and Berkeley Manufacturing Company produced and marketed decanter bottles, china lamp bases, and specialty ceramic items. Wood Terminal Company was engaged in leasing trucks. In the court below, the parties stipulated that Taylor Food produced various cocktail mixes, tomato juice, and margarita salt. It also imported and distributed mineral water.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Jim Beam owned all of the stock of Clear Spring, and Clear Spring in turn owned the stock of Taylor Food. Prior to its sale, Taylor Food\u2019s operations were an integral part of Jim Beam\u2019s regular trade or business operations. Income from Taylor Food\u2019s business was combined with the income from other members of Jim Beam\u2019s unitary group and apportioned as part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>income of the unitary business group. During the time that Taylor Food was part of Jim Beam\u2019s unitary business, its income was reported to California as apportionable business income and taxed by this state. Significantly for the purposes of this case, the parties stipulated that Jim Beam\u2019s acquisition, control, and use of Taylor Food contributed materially to Jim Beam\u2019s production of business income prior to the sale of Taylor Food.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">In December 1987, through Clear Spring, Jim Beam sold all of its stock in Taylor Food. Jim Beam\u2019s stated reason for selling Taylor Food was that the subsidiary no longer fit the long-range strategic plans of American Brands, Inc., Jim Beam\u2019s parent company and sole shareholder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Clear Spring realized a gain on the sale of its Taylor Food stock, and it distributed the entire proceeds of the sale to its parent, Jim Beam, which in turn distributed the proceeds to American Brands. Clear Spring classified the gain as \u201cnonbusiness income\u201d and allocated 100 percent of the gain to Kentucky, the state of its domicile. Clear Spring reported a tax basis of $6,517,158 in its Taylor Food stock. This figure included $5,928,020 in undistributed Taylor Food earnings. For its part, Jim Beam reported the income from the sale of Taylor Food as \u201cnonbusiness income\u201d on its California franchise tax return for 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The FTB audited Jim Beam\u2019s tax return for the 1987 tax year. Based on its audit, the FTB reclassified the income from the sale of Taylor Food as \u201cbusiness income.\u201d The FTB also reduced the basis in the Taylor Food stock without regard to the undistributed earnings, thus increasing the amount of income reported to California. The FTB then issued a notice of proposed assessment to Jim Beam, which Jim Beam timely protested. The FTB denied Jim Beam\u2019s protest and issued a notice affirming its proposed assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Jim Beam appealed the matter to the SEE. After the SBE issued a decision sustaining the FTB\u2019s action, Jim Beam paid the proposed assessment and filed a claim for refund. The FTB denied Jim Beam\u2019s claim, and Jim Beam sued the FTB for a refund in San Francisco Superior Court. After stipulating to a number of facts pertinent to the legal issues presented, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The superior court granted the FTB\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Jim Beam\u2019s motion. Jim Beam filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Jim Beam presents two arguments in this appeal. First, it contends that the gain from the sale of Taylor Food does not fall within the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>\u201c \u2018[b]usiness income\u2019 \u201d in Revenue and Taxation Code section 25120, subdivision (a). Second, it argues that even if the proceeds from the sale of Taylor Food are business income, the amount of taxable gain should be offset by the extent to which the undistributed earnings of Taylor Food have already been taxed by California. We address these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The Definition of \u201cBusiness Income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">A. <em>Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">This case presents an issue of statutory construction, and the parties agree that we review the question de novo. (See <em>Regents of University of California v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 509, 531 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 257, 976 P.2d 808] [appellate court exercises de novo review of ruling on summary judgment motion and underlying statutory construction issues].)  Although the courts bear the ultimate responsibility for the construction of the statute, we will accord great weight and respect to the administrative construction. <em>(Hoechst Celanese Corp. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 508, 524-525 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 22 P.3d 324] <em>(Hoechst </em>Celanese) [relying on SBE decisions interpreting the statutory definition of \u201cbusiness income\u201d].) Deference is appropriate where the administrative agency\u2019s expertise indicates that it has a comparative interpretive advantage over the courts. <em>(Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 1, 12 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 960 P.2d 1031].) As this court noted in <em>Citicorp, </em>the SBE\u2019s \u201cexpertise in tax matters is not subject to dispute[.]\u201d <em>(Citicorp, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at p. 1419.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">A healthy respect for the SBE\u2019s interpretation is particularly appropriate in this case. The definition of business income in Revenue and Taxation Code section 25120 mirrors section 1, subdivision (a) of the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act. (7A pt. 1 West\u2019s U. Laws Ann. (2002) U. Div. of Income for Tax Purposes Act, \u00a7 1, p. 147 (UDITPA).) The drafters of UDITPA derived their definition of business income from an earlier line of SBE decisions. <em>(Hoechst Celanese, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 523-524.) Thus, to the extent that they bear on the issue presented, the Supreme Court has suggested that SBE decisions predating California\u2019s enactment of UDITPA may be controlling, \u201cbecause the Legislature presumably enacted the UDITPA with the understanding that it did not alter existing California [decisional] law.\u201d (25 Cal.4th at p. 535.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">B. <em>The Statutory Scheme.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">California is one of a number of states that have adopted UDITPA. California\u2019s version of the uniform act is found in Revenue and Taxation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Code sections 25120 through 25141. Under this statute, the income of multistate corporations is divided into either \u201c \u2018[b]usiness income\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018[njonbusiness income.\u2019 \u201d (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 25120, subds. (a) &amp; (d).) Business income is apportionable to each state in which the corporation or unitary business group does business; nonbusiness income is allocable only to the taxpayer\u2019s commercial domicile. <em>(Hoechst Celanese, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 513, 518; <em>Citicorp, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at p. 1411.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The statute defines the term \u201cbusiness income\u201d as \u201cincome arising from transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business and includes income from tangible and intangible property if the acquisition, management, and disposition of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations.\u201d (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 25120, subd. (a).) \u201c \u2018Nonbusiness income\u2019 means all income other than business income.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In <em>Hoechst Celanese, </em>the Supreme Court held that section 25120 establishes both a \u201ctransactional test\u201d and a \u201cfunctional test\u201d for business income. <em>(Hoechst Celanese, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 520-526.) Under the transactional test, the controlling factor for identifying business income is the nature of the income-producing transaction. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 526.) To generate business income under the transactional test, the transaction must occur in the regular course of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c[I]ncome arising from \u2018extraordinary\u2019 events, such as a \u2018complete liquidation [or] cessation of business,\u2019 cannot satisfy the transactional test.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 526-527.) The functional test, in contrast, focuses on the income-producing property. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 527.) In applying the functional test, the \u201ccritical inquiry\u201d is the \u201crelationship between this property and the taxpayer\u2019s \u2018business operations.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The parties agree that the income from the sale of Taylor Food is not business income under the transactional test. The issue before us is whether the sale of Taylor Food generated business income for Jim Beam\u2019s unitary business group under the statute\u2019s functional test. In <em>Hoechst Celanese, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th 508, the Supreme Court both explained the operation of the functional test and provided a detailed interpretation of the statutory language that is at issue here. The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Hoechst Celanese </em>therefore guides our decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">C. <em>The Gain from the Sale of Taylor Food is \u201cBusiness Income\u201d Under Revenue and Taxation Code Section 25120, Subdivision (a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">In contending that the gain realized from the sale of Taylor Food is not business income under the statute, Jim Beam renews the arguments that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>made before the SBE. It contends that the \u201cplain language\u201d of Revenue and Taxation Code section 25120, subdivision (a) requires a finding of nonbusiness income because, Jim Beam asserts, the statute requires that the \u201cacquisition, management, <em>and </em>disposition\u201d of Taylor Food must each be integral to Jim Beam\u2019s regular trade or business operations. Furthermore, it relies on a number of cases from other UDITPA states that have held that the gains that result from the partial liquidation or cessation of a business are not business income under UDITPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The SBE rejected both of these arguments. Relying on its own earlier decisions, it disagreed with Jim Beam\u2019s \u201ctechnical linguistic analysis\u201d of the statute. It held that its prior decisions had essentially rejected Jim Beam\u2019s argument that there existed \u201can additional independent test for business income upon the disposition of assets[.]\u201d The SBE quoted from <em>Appeal of Borden, Inc. </em>(Feb. 3, 1977) (1971-1978 Transfer Binder) Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) paragraph 205-615, pages 14,897-57 to 14,897-58 <em>(Borden), </em>in which it had held that \u201c \u2018[t]he underlying principle in these cases is that any income from assets which are integral parts of the unitary business is unitary income. It is appropriate that all returns from property which is developed or acquired and maintained through the resources of and in furtherance of the business should be attributed to the business as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>Appeal of W.J. Voit Rubber Corp. </em>(May 12, 1964) (1962-1966 Transfer Binder) Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 202-435, p. 12,443.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The SBE also rejected Jim Beam\u2019s partial liquidation argument. It declined to follow case law from other UDITPA states that treat the gains realized from the liquidation of a line of business as nonbusiness income. The SBE concluded that acceptance of Jim Beam\u2019s argument would conflict with the results it had reached in cases with similar facts and with the rationale underlying those cases. (See <em>Appeal of Triangle Publications, Inc. </em>(June 27, 1984) (1981-1984 Transfer Binder) Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) <em>\u00b6 </em>400-905, p. 23,346 <em>(Triangle Publications) </em>[rejecting argument that income from liquidation of separate corporate divisions is nonbusiness income].)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">We hold that the SBE\u2019s construction of the statute was correct and that the gain from the sale of Taylor Food is business income under the statute\u2019s functional test.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">1. <em>The Requirements of the Functional Test.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">In contrast to the transactional test, which focuses on the \u201c \u2018nature of the particular transaction\u2019 that generates the income,\u201d the functional test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>focuses on the income-producing <em>property. (Hoechst Celanese, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 526, 527.) According to our Supreme Court, the \u201ccritical inquiry\u201d for purposes of the functional test is \u201cthe nature of the relationship between this property and the taxpayer\u2019s \u2018business operations.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 527.) The relationship necessary to a finding of business income is defined by the conditional clause of Revenue and Taxation Code section 25120, subdivision (a). (25 Cal.4th at p. 528.) That is, income from tangible and intangible property is business income \u201cif the acquisition, management, and disposition of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations.\u201d (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 25120, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">As <em>Hoechst Celanese </em>explains, the statutory language requires essentially a two-part inquiry. First, the phrase \u201c \u2018acquisition, management, and disposition\u2019 \u201d directs us to examine \u201cthe taxpayer\u2019s interest in and power over the income-producing property.\u201d <em>(Hoechst Celanese, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 528.) Second, if we conclude that the taxpayer has a sufficient interest in the income-producing property for the purposes of the statute, we next review whether \u201cthe taxpayer\u2019s control and use of the property [are] an \u2018integral part[] of the taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 529, quoting Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 25120, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Jim Beam concedes that the first requirement of the functional test is met. In its opening brief, it states that \u201c[i]t is undisputed that Jim Beam \u2018acquired, managed, and disposed\u2019 of the stock of Taylor Food. Accordingly, the requirements of the first phrase are satisfied.\u201d Jim Beam disputes only the conclusion that its acquisition, management, and disposition of Taylor Food were integral to its regular trade or business operations. We therefore turn to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">2. <em>Jim Beam\u2019s Control and Use of Taylor Food Were an Integral Part of Its Regular Trade or Business Operations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Before the acquisition, management, and disposition of the property will be considered integral to the taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations, \u201cthe taxpayer\u2019s <em>control and use of the property </em>must contribute materially to the taxpayer\u2019s production of business income so that the property becomes interwoven into and inseparable from the taxpayer\u2019s business.\u201d <em>(Hoechst Celanese, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 529, italics added.) The statutory phrase \u201c \u2018regular trade or business operations\u2019 \u201d requires that \u201cthe taxpayer\u2019s control and use of the income-producing property ... be part of the taxpayer\u2019s normal or typical business activities.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 530.) The word \u201cregular\u201d does not refer to the nature of the transaction, and thus \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>extraordinary nature or infrequency of the income-producing transaction is irrelevant.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>A taxpayer\u2019s control and use of the property will be considered \u201cintegral\u201d to its regular trade or business operations if there exists \u201can organic unity between the taxpayer\u2019s property and business activities whereby the property contributes materially to the taxpayer\u2019s production of business income.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, the necessary \u201cintegral\u201d relationship \u201cexists when the taxpayer controls and uses the property to contribute materially to the taxpayer\u2019s production of business income.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 532.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Here again, Jim Beam has essentially conceded that this portion of the statutory test is satisfied. In the court below, it stipulated that its \u201cacquisition, control and use of Taylor Food contributed materially to taxpayer\u2019s production of business income.\u201d In addition, Jim Beam further stipulated that \u201c[p]rior to the sale of Taylor Food, Taylor Food\u2019s business operations were an integral part of taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations.\u201d As the FTB correctly argues, this falls squarely within the <em>Hoechst Celanese </em>definition of the term \u201cintegral.\u201d (See <em>Hoechst Celanese, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 532.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">3. <em>The Disposition of the Proceeds of the Sale Does Not Affect the Finding of Business Income.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Despite its stipulation, Jim Beam contends that the income from its sale of Taylor Food cannot be business income because, in Jim Beam\u2019s view, the statute requires that the \u201cacquisition, management, and disposition\u201d of Taylor Food must <em>each </em>be integral to its regular trade or business operations. Jim Beam argues that its disposition of Taylor Food \u201cwas wholly unrelated and did not \u2018contribute,\u2019 materially or otherwise, in any way to Jim Beam\u2019s unitary business.\u201d As evidence of this, Jim Beam cites the fact that all of the proceeds of the sale were distributed to American Brands, which was not part of Jim Beam\u2019s unitary business group. In addition, Jim Beam notes that Taylor Food was not a drag on earnings, was in fact profitable, and was sold only because it \u201cno longer fit with the long-range strategic plans of American Brands[.]\u201d Thus, according to Jim Beam, the sale of Taylor Food did not contribute to Jim Beam\u2019s business, and the disposition was not an integral part of Jim Beam\u2019s regular trade or business operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">We reject this argument for a number of reasons. First, we agree with the FTB that this line of reasoning improperly focuses the analysis on the income-producing <em>transaction </em>rather than on the income-producing <em>property, </em>as <em>Hoechst Celanese </em>requires. As discussed earlier, the Supreme Court has made clear that the critical inquiry is \u201cthe nature of the relationship between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>this property and the taxpayer\u2019s \u2018business operations.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hoechst Celanese, supra, </em>at p. 527.) The <em>Hoechst Celanese </em>analysis does not focus on the use of the proceeds of the disposition or on the reasons behind the sale.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Accord, <em>Appeal of Occidental Petroleum Corporation </em>(June 21, 1983) (1981-1984 Transfer Binder) Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 400-394, p. 22,616, fn. 3 <em>(Occidental </em>Petroleum) [\u201cwe do not attach any particular significance to the taxpayer\u2019s eventual use of the proceeds from stock sales\u201d].) <em>Hoechst Celanese </em>makes clear that nothing more is required than what Jim Beam has already conceded\u2014that its control and use of the property contributed materially to Jim Beam\u2019s production of business income. <em>(Hoechst Celanese, supra, </em>at p. 532.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Second, Jim Beam\u2019s argument is based on a reading of the words \u201cacquisition, management, and disposition\u201d that cannot be squared with the interpretation given them by the Supreme Court. In <em>Hoechst Celanese, </em>the Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe phrase \u2018acquisition, management, and disposition of the property\u2019 establishes that the taxpayer must: (1) obtain some interest in and control over the property; (2) control or direct the use of the property; and (3) transfer, or have the power to transfer, control of that property in some manner.\u201d <em>(Hoechst Celanese, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 528-529.) This statutory language does not establish a requirement that each element\u2014acquisition, management, and disposition\u2014individually be integral to the taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations before the proceeds from property will be held to be business income. Rather, the Supreme Court interpreted these words \u201cto refer to the taxpayer\u2019s interest in and power over the income-producing property.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 528.) Thus, this language \u201cencompasses the myriad of ways that corporations may control and use the rights and privileges commonly associated with property ownership.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 529.) Jim Beam\u2019s attempt to derive a three-part test from the phrase in question is simply inconsistent with our Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute. \u201cBecause the [Taylor Food business] contributed materially to [Jim Beam\u2019s] production of business income\u201d prior to sale of the subsidiary, \u201cthe \u2018acquisition, management, and disposition of\u2019 [Taylor Food] \u2018constitute integral parts of\u2019 [Jim Beam\u2019s] \u2018business operations.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 536.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Finally, on a conceptual level, Jim Beam does not explain why property that admittedly generated unitary business income for years prior to its disposition should not also generate business income when it is sold. Such a position is at odds with the SBE\u2019s pre-UDITPA rule that \u201c \u2018any income from assets which are integral parts of the unitary business is unitary income.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Borden, supra, </em>(1971-1978 Transfer Binder) Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 205-615, p. 14,897-58, quoting <em>Appeal of W.J. Voit Rubber Corp., supra, </em>(1962-1966 Transfer Binder) Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) <em>\u00b6 </em>202-435, p. 12,443.) It is also inconsistent with the comments of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws explaining section 1 of UDITPA, the source of section 25120. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Hoechst Celanese, </em>the comments \u201ccontemplate the apportionment of gains realized from <em>any </em>sale of property used in the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business.\u201d <em>(Hoechst Celanese, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 531, italics added, citing Comrs. Corns., UDITPA, com. foil. \u00a7 1, subd. (a).) \u201cIndeed, the comment ostensibly makes all income from the disposition of property used in the taxpayer\u2019s business apportionable even if the disposition does not occur \u2018in the regular course of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hoechst Celanese, supra, </em>at p. 524.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">We therefore conclude that the SBE was correct in rejecting Jim Beam\u2019s statutory construction argument. Consequently, this argument furnishes no basis for reversal of the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the FTB.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">D. <em>The Partial Liquidation Exception.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Jim Beam argues that \u201cthe treatment of gains from a liquidation of a line of business followed by a distribution of the liquidation proceeds to the taxpayer\u2019s shareholders is an issue of first impression in California,\u201d and it urges that in such circumstances the gains should be treated as nonbusiness income. The SBE rejected this argument, and it refused Jim Beam\u2019s invitation to carve out what it termed a \u201c \u2018partial liquidation exception\u2019 \u201d to the functional test. In this court, Jim Beam contends that there is a \u201cconsensus\u201d among courts in other UDITPA states holding that where the sale of an asset of a unitary business results in the cessation of that line of business activity, the proceeds from that sale are treated as nonbusiness income. In support of this argument, Jim Beam cites cases from six other states that have adopted UDITPA. All of these cases have concluded that the gains from the complete or partial liquidation of a business are nonbusiness income.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>At the outset, we note that the issue Jim Beam raises is not truly one of first impression. At least one California case has held that a corporation\u2019s sale of the stock of its subsidiary generates business income under Revenue and Tax Code section 25120, subdivision (a). <em>(Times Mirror, supra, </em>102 Cal.App.3d at pp. 877-878 [holding that \u201cproceeds, which include any capital gains income received by Times Mirror, constitute business income, as a matter of law\u201d].) In addition, the SBE has confronted similar facts on more than one occasion, and it has uniformly held that the gains from the sale of a corporate subsidiary constitute business income. <em>(Triangle Publications, supra, </em>(1981-1984 Transfer Binder) Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 400-905, at p. 23,346 [income from sale of corporate divisions, which allegedly resulted in liquidation of separate businesses, held business income]; <em>Occidental Petroleum, supra, </em>(1981-1984 Transfer Binder) Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6[ 400-394, at pp. 22,614-22,616 [gain from sale of shares in unitary subsidiary held business income].) Thus to the extent that California decisions have considered the question, they have supported the view that the sale of stock in a unitary subsidiary is business income under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Moreover, even in the absence of the California decisions just cited, we could not follow the out-of-state cases Jim Beam cites because an examination of their reasoning demonstrates that it conflicts with the SBE\u2019s longstanding interpretation of the term \u201cbusiness income\u201d and with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Hoechst Celanese. </em>We cannot accept Jim Beam\u2019s argument without repudiating the analysis underlying California\u2019s functional test.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The earliest case upon which Jim Beam relies is <em>McVean &amp; Barlow. </em>In that case, the taxpayer had been engaged for many years in the business of laying both large and small diameter pipe. <em>(McVean &amp; Barlow, supra, </em>543 P.2d at p. 490.) It then liquidated its large diameter pipeline business. <em>{Ibid.) </em>The New Mexico Court of Appeals held that income from the taxpayer\u2019s sale of its large-diameter pipeline business was not business income under New Mexico\u2019s version of UDITPA. <em>(McVean </em>v. <em>Barlow, </em>at p. 492.) In so holding, <em>McVean &amp; Barlow </em>relied on the Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Western Natural Gas Company </em>v. <em>McDonald </em>(1968) 202 Kan. 98 [446 P.2d 781] <em>(Western Natural Gas). (McVean &amp; Barlow, supra, </em>at p. 491.) To support its interpretation of the term \u201cbusiness income,\u201d the <em>McVean &amp; Barlow </em>court quoted a passage from <em>Western Natural Gas </em>that illustrates the analytical conflict between California\u2019s approach to the business income definition and the approach taken in the cases Jim Beam cites; \u201c \u2018It is not the use of the property in the business which is the determining factor under the statute. <em>The </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number><em>controlling factor by which the statute identifies business income is the nature of the particular transaction giving rise to the income. </em>To be business income the transaction and activity must have been in the <em>regular course </em>of the taxpayer\u2019s business operations.\u2019 \u201d <em>(McVean &amp; Barlow, supra, </em>543 P.2d at p. 491, quoting <em>Western Natural Gas, supra, </em>446 P.2d at p. 783, italics added by <em>McVean &amp; Barlow </em>court.) The other out-of-state cases all adopt a similar approach by focusing on whether the <em>disposition of the property, </em>as opposed to the income-producing property itself, constitutes an integral part of the taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">From our earlier discussion of <em>Hoechst Celanese, </em>it should be evident that such an approach is contrary to California decisional law, for it focuses on the nature of the transaction, rather than on the relationship between the property sold and the taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations. (See <em>Hoechst Celanese, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 527, 530 [focus of functional test is on relationship between income-producing property and taxpayer\u2019s business operations; extraordinary nature of transaction is irrelevant]; see also <em>Triangle Publications, supra, </em>(1981-1984 Transfer Binder) Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) ] \u00b6 400-905, at p. 23,346 [expressly rejecting <em>McVean &amp; Barlow </em>and <em>Western Natural Gas].) </em>Acceptance of Jim Beam\u2019s argument would require us to apply the functional test in a manner inconsistent with <em>Hoechst Celanese </em>and the SBE decisions on which that case relied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Furthermore, as the FTB points out, and Jim Beam readily concedes, the holdings of these cases have been superseded by legislative enactment in at least five of the six states in question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although it acknowledges that most of the out-of-state cases it cites have been superseded by statute, Jim Beam <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>argues that our interpretation of section 25120, subdivision (a) should reflect the holdings of these cases rather than the policies adopted by the legislatures of our sister UDITPA states. According to Jim Beam, \u201cthe only way that Section 25120(a) would be consistent with the statutes in these states [that have amended their definition of business income] is if the California law, too, was amended.\u201d We reject this argument because in <em>Hoechst Celanese </em>our Supreme Court noted that the objective of UDITPA is \u201c \u2018to promote uniformity in allocation <em>practices.\u2019 \u201d (Hoechst Celanese, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 518, italics added.) Indeed, in <em>Hoechst Celanese, </em>the Supreme Court did precisely what Jim Beam contends we may not do\u2014it adopted a construction of the statute consistent with the amendments adopted by legislatures in other states and rejected judicial decisions that had refused to recognize the functional test. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 526.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Finally, we point out that our position on this issue follows the regulations drafted by the Multistate Tax Commission.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Those regulations provide that \u201c[ijncome that is derived from . . . transactions made in liquidation or the winding-up of business, is business income, if the property is or was used in the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business operations.\u201d (MTC Reg. IV.1.(a)(5)(B).) These regulations strengthen our conclusion that our view of the issue is better suited to achieve the uniformity that is the objective of UDITPA than is Jim Beam\u2019s. (See Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 25138.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">We therefore conclude that the gain from the sale of the stock of Taylor Food is properly considered business income within the meaning of Revenue and Taxation Code section 25120, subdivision (a). As a result, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the FTB on Jim Beam\u2019s first cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The Adjustment to Basis</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Having concluded that the gain from the sale of the stock of Taylor Food was business income, we turn to Jim Beam\u2019s contention that it was entitled to reduce its gain on the sale of the stock by adjusting its basis to reflect certain undistributed earnings and profits. Jim Beam sought this basis adjustment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>its second cause of action below. Jim Beam contended that such a basis adjustment is proper because these undistributed earnings have already been taxed by California. The trial court disagreed and granted summary judgment to the FTB on this cause of action. We disagree with Jim Beam and conclude that the trial court properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">As a general rule, the basis of property is the cost of that property. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 24912.) The Revenue and Taxation Code does permit various adjustments to basis, but we are aware of no provision granting an adjustment to basis because of undistributed corporate earnings and profits. In fact, Jim Beam cites no statute that would permit the basis adjustment it seeks. It relies instead on what it claims is one of the \u201cmajor policies\u201d of corporate taxation\u2014that corporate income should not be taxed more than once at the corporate level. It claims that this principle is embodied in Revenue and Taxation Code section 24402. But that section deals with the deduction of dividends received by one corporation from another corporation which it owns. (See Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 24402, subd. (b).) Jim Beam also cites FTB Legal Ruling No. 376, but that ruling, too, deals with statutes governing the taxation of intercompany dividends, not with the taxation of income realized from the sale of the subsidiary of a unitary business.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">As the FTB correctly argues, the SBE has previously rejected the very same argument Jim Beam makes here. In <em>Appeal of Rapid-American Corporation </em>(May 8, 1997) (1995-1999 Transfer Binder) Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 402-934, p. 28,867, the SBE held that a taxpayer corporation that sold its stock in its unitary subsidiaries was not entitled to increase its basis in the stock by the amount of earnings and profits held in the subsidiaries that had previously been reported to California on the taxpayer\u2019s combined unitary report. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 28,868.) As the SBE explained, \u201c[i]f the subsidiary did not distribute its earnings and profits as a dividend to the parent, California would tax the income of the subsidiary, and would also tax a subsequent capital gain realized by the parent on a sale of the subsidiary.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The SBE concluded that \u201cthere is no statutory, regulatory or case law basis in California to support an adjustment upward in the basis of stock on account of undistributed earnings and profits, even if those earnings and profits have been included in a combined unitary report.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 28,869; see also <em>Appeal of CRG Holdings, Inc. </em>(May 8, 1997) (1995-1999 Transfer Binder) Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 402-933, pp. 28,865-28,867 [rejecting double taxation argument].)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">In the absence of any controlling statute or regulation permitting the adjustment to basis that Jim Beam requests, we conclude that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the FTB on Jim Beam\u2019s second cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AdR\">Rivera, J., and Munter, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 4, 2006, S139031.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-9\"> \u201cA unitary business is generally defined as two or more business entities that are commonly owned and integrated in a way that transfers value among the affiliated entities.\u201d <em>(Citicorp North American, Inc. v.
