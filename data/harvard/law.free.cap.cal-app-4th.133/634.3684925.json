Bricker, and her husband, Ronald L. Bricker, were sued in small claims court by 11 sets of neighbors for nuisance. Following trial in the small claims matters, judgments were entered in all 11 cases in favor of plaintiffs and against petitioner and her husband. The small claims court\u2019s minutes indicate that petitioner\u2019s husband was present at the small claims trials, but petitioner was \u201cnot present.\u201d The record is silent as to whether defaults were entered against petitioner due to her failure to appear at the small claims trials, or whether, as petitioner contends, her husband asked for permission to appear, or was permitted to appear on her behalf pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 116.540, subdivision (j).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Following rendition of judgment, petitioner and her husband appealed all 11 adverse judgments. Respondent superior court thereafter issued and served a \u201cNotice of Hearing\u201d in each of the 11 appeals, notifying the parties, including petitioner, of the scheduling of a readiness conference. At the outset of the readiness conference, respondent announced that petitioner \u201chas no right to appeal\u201d since \u201c[s]he did not appear at the small claims matter.\u201d Respondent advised counsel that petitioner \u201cwould have to file a motion to vacate the judgment with the small claims judge.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The minutes from the readiness conference in each appeal state that \u201c[t]he Court finds that Defendant Marian Bricker has no right to appeal as she did not appear at the small claims hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">At a later hearing, petitioner\u2019s counsel raised the issue of the court\u2019s apparent dismissal of petitioner\u2019s appeals, and argued that the dismissal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>contrary to Code of Civil Procedure section 116.540, subdivision (j), which permits a spouse to appear at a small claims hearing on behalf of another spouse. Respondent stated: \u201cNobody told me [petitioner] was disabled or anything else. All I know is the file indicates she was not there. Consequently, she has no right to appeal.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s counsel then stated that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any Order to Show Cause stating why her appeal should not be dismissed.\u201d Near the end of the hearing, petitioner\u2019s counsel asked whether petitioner\u2019s appeals were orally dismissed, and respondent stated, \u201cI have no information whatsoever there is any reason that this person was allowed to appeal, not having been there. There was nothing presented, as I can determine in the minutes, so, yes. File your writ.\u201d The minutes from this hearing recount that petitioner\u2019s counsel addressed the court \u201cregarding party status of [petitioner]\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Court advised that there is nothing in the Court Minutes as to why [petitioner] was not present at the original hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Petitioner then filed writ petitions in this court, seeking relief from the dismissal of her small claims appeals. On our own motion, we consolidated the petitions for purposes of briefing and decision. We also issued a stay of the trials de novo in the 11 small claims appeals, and requested and obtained briefing from the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The Courts of Appeal have historically been reluctant to review mlings in small claims matters. The reason for this is obviously to promote the policy of speedy and inexpensive resolution of cases falling within the jurisdiction of small claims court. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 116.510.) But while disfavored, it has been held that review of small claims judgments may be available by extraordinary writ where there is \u201cstatewide importance of the general issues presented\u201d <em>(Green </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 616, 621 [111 Cal.Rptr. 704, 517 P.2d 1168]) and \u201cin order to secure uniformity in the operations of the small claims courts and uniform interpretation of the statutes governing them\u201d <em>(Davis v. Superior Court </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 164, 168 [162 Cal.Rptr. 167]). Writ review is appropriate under the foregoing authorities in light of the due process problem raised by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">While \u201c[t]he hearing and disposition of the small claims action shall be informal, the object being to dispense justice promptly, fairly, and inexpensively\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 116.510), due process constraints nevertheless apply to small claims matters (see <em>ERA-Trotter Girouard Assoc. v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1851, 1857 &amp; fn. 5 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 381] [\u201cwhere a defendant in a small claims appeal does not receive adequate notice of the trial date in superior court and, thus, fails to appear and suffers a default, a superior court should not be without power to fashion a remedy\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>\u201cIt is a cardinal principle of our jurisprudence that a party should not be bound or concluded by a judgment unless he has had his day in court. This means that a party must be duly cited to appear and afforded an opportunity to be heard and to offer evidence at such hearing in support of his contentions. [f] His right to a hearing does not depend upon the will, caprice or discretion of the trial judge who is to make a decision upon the issues, [f] An order or judgment without such an opportunity is lacking in all the attributes of a judicial determination. [Citations.] [][] Refusal to permit counsel for petitioner to present evidence and make a reasonable argument in support of his client\u2019s position [i]s not a mere error in procedure. It amount[s] to a deprival of a substantial statutory right . . . .\u201d <em>(Spector </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 839, 843-844 [13 Cal.Rptr. 189, 361 P.2d 909].) California Rules of Court, rule 155, which deals with the dismissal of small claims appeals, does not contemplate the procedure followed by the superior court in this matter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">In <em>Moore v. California Minerals etc. Corp. </em>(1953) 115 Cal.App.2d 834 [252 P.2d 1005], following tire parties\u2019 opening statements at trial, the trial judge essentially granted an unnoticed motion for judgment on the pleadings. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 835-836.) \u201cThe ruling came as a surprise to defense counsel, who had no opportunity to point out the sufficiency of the answer .... The parties were prepared to go to trial, and but for the precipitate and unexpected action of the court would have done so.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 836.) The court found that defendant\u2019s due process right to be heard had been violated, since \u201c[w]hen the court summarily disposed of the case, defense counsel was given no opportunity to defend his pleading .... It is true that he could have asked the court to recall its decision and listen to argument, but this opportunity, as every lawyer knows, is a poor substitute for the right to be heard before the decision is announced. ... [1] ... [1] In our research we have not discovered another case in which judgment was rendered upon a point of law raised by the court with no warning of counsel and no opportunity given to ward off the blow. Elementary principles of due process support our conclusion that if, during a trial, the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>unearths a point of law which it deems to be decisive of the cause, the party against whom the decision impends has the same right to be heard before the decision is announced that he has to produce evidence upon the issues of fact. Denial of that opportunity deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>defendant of a substantial right to which it was entitled by virtue of the guarantee of due process. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 836-837.)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Here, petitioner was not notified prior to the readiness conference that respondent was considering dismissing her appeals. At the beginning of the readiness conference, and without even mentioning to the parties at that time that it was considering the question, respondent announced its decision that petitioner had no right to appeal. Respondent\u2019s sua sponte ruling, which effectively dismissed petitioner\u2019s appeals from the 11 small claims judgments, plainly violated petitioner\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Since respondent superior court never properly noticed or held a hearing on the question of whether petitioner\u2019s appeals should be dismissed, mandamus is appropriate to compel respondent\u2019s compliance with the due process principles discussed herein. Respondent should properly notice and hear the dismissal matter anew, permitting the parties to present evidence and argument concerning whether petitioner\u2019s appeals should be permitted to proceed. Although the parties\u2019 briefs and evidentiary submissions in this court discuss the merits of the dismissal question, it would plainly be inappropriate for this court to pass on this question in first instance. The parties never had the opportunity to litigate this issue before respondent superior court, and it appears resolution of the dismissal issue may require rendition of factual findings on conflicting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">We previously advised the parties that we might issue a peremptory writ in the first instance. (See <em>Palma v. U.S. Industrial Fasteners, Inc. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 171, 177-180 [203 Cal.Rptr. 626, 681 P.2d 893].) Petitioner\u2019s right to relief is obvious, no useful purpose would be served by issuance of an alternative writ, further briefing and oral argument, and the petitions are unusually urgent in that they involve small claims actions, which are to be resolved \u201cpromptly. \u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 116.510; see <em>Ng v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 29, 35 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 856, 840 P.2d 961]; see also <em>Lewis v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1232, 1236-1237, 1240-1241 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 85, 970 P.2d 872].)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Therefore, let a peremptory writ of mandate issue commanding respondent superior court to set aside and vacate its dismissal of petitioner\u2019s small claims appeals in Humboldt County Superior Court Actions Nos. SC040716, SC040717, SC040718, SC040719, SC040720, SC040721, SC040722, SC040723, SC040724, SC040725 and SC040726, and to schedule further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion. This decision shall be final immediately as to this court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>24(b)(3).) Petitioner shall recover her costs. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 56(l).) This court\u2019s stay order shall dissolve upon respondent superior court\u2019s compliance with the peremptory writ.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b512-11\"> vBefore Jones, P.
