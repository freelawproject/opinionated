On August 30, 2001, defendant City and County of San Francisco (City) received government tort claims on behalf of plaintiffs Phay Him and Van Nun, the parents of the decedent. On November 19, 2001, representatives of the City purportedly mailed formal notices rejecting the claims to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. The notices warned that any action on the claims had to be filed within six months of the date the notices were mailed, pursuant to Government Code section 945.6. Plaintiffs contend they never received the claim rejection notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">Plaintiffs filed their negligence action on March 3, 2003, beyond the six-month period, and the City moved for summary judgment asserting, among other things, that the action was barred by the late filing. To establish mailing, the City submitted the claim rejection notices, with attached proofs of service signed by a City claims adjuster. The claims adjuster also submitted a declaration averring she had sent the claim rejection notices on November 19, 2001. Plaintiffs filed opposition papers and objections to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>declaration of the adjuster. Following oral argument, the trial court granted the motion based on the court\u2019s finding that plaintiffs had failed to file their complaint within the statutory period. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Does the City\u2019s evidence in support of the summary judgment motion establish, as a matter of law, that it mailed notice to plaintiffs denying the tort claims on November 19, 2001? Plaintiffs claim the proofs of service are deficient because they do not state the specific location where they were deposited in the United States mail. In addition, plaintiffs claim they presented sufficient evidence they never <em>received </em>the disputed proofs of service to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the notices were <em>mailed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">We review summary judgment rulings de novo to determine whether the moving party has met its burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. When the defendant is the moving party, the defendant must show either (1) that the plaintiff cannot establish one or more elements of a cause of action, or (2) that there is a complete defense. If that burden of production is met, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue of fact with respect to that cause of action or defense. <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subds. (c) &amp; (o)(2).) \u201cAll doubts as to whether there are any triable issues of fact are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ingham </em>v. <em>Luxor Cab Co. </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1049 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 587].)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">II. <em>Written Notice of Rejection of Government Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Government Code section 945.6, subdivision (a)(1) prescribes that an action against a public entity must be brought within six months of written notice of a claim denial. This written notice may be given either by personal delivery, or by mailing to the address of the claimant, or to an address designated in the claim. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 913, 915.4; <em>Katelaris </em>v. <em>County of Orange </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1211, 1214 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 556].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>public entity gives written notice of rejection in the manner specified in section 913, the statute of limitations expires six months from the day the notice of rejection is personally delivered or deposited in the mail. <em>(Dowell v. County of Contra Costa </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 896, 900 [219 Cal.Rptr. 341].) If notice of rejection is not given in compliance with section 913, the statute of limitations runs two years from accrual of the cause of action. (\u00a7 945.6; <em>Dowell, </em>at p. 900.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">A. <em>Code of Civil Procedure Section 1013a</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Under Government Code section 915.2,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> if any notice under chapter 2 governing \u201cPresentation and Consideration of Claims\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 910 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>et seq.) is given by mail, the notice must be \u201cdeposited in the United States post office [or] a mailbox ... or other similar facility . . . , in a sealed envelope, properly addressed, with postage paid. The . . . notice shall be deemed to have been presented and received at the time of the deposit. . . . Proof of mailing may be made in the manner prescribed by Section 1013a of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 915.2; see <em>Katelaris </em>v. <em>County of Orange, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at p. 1214.) Thus, the mailed notices of rejection of claim in this case would trigger application of the six-month statute of limitations if the notices comply with the requirements of Government Code section 913 and they were mailed in the manner prescribed by section 915.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">After setting out the requirements for mailing notice, Government Code section 915.2 states that \u201c[p]roof of mailing <em>may be made </em>in the manner prescribed by Section 1013a of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d (Italics added.) Code of Civil Procedure section 1013a, subdivision (1) provides that \u201c[p]roof of service by mail may be made by one of the following methods: []Q (1) An affidavit setting forth the exact title of the document served and filed in the cause, showing the name and residence or business address of the person making the service, showing that he or she is a resident of or employed in the county where the mailing occurs, that he or she is over the age of 18 years and not a party to the cause, and <em>showing the </em>date and <em>place of deposit in the mail, </em>the name and address of the person served as shown on the envelope, and also showing that the envelope was sealed and deposited in the mail with the postage thereon fully prepaid.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Plaintiffs claim the proofs of service relied upon by the City are deficient because they do not state the precise location where they were deposited in the United States mail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree for two reasons. First, Government Code section 915.2 does not mandate strict compliance with the proof of service requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1013a. Instead, it provides that proof <em>may be made </em>in compliance with this statute. <em>(Call </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County Gen. Hosp. </em>(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 911, 917 [143 Cal. Rptr. 845].) Second, even where proof of service must conform to the requisites of Code of Civil Procedure section 1013a, only substantial compliance is required. Courts have consistently concluded that listing the city and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>state where the documents were placed in the United States mail is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1013a. (E.g., <em>Forslund v. Forslund </em>(1964) 225 Cal.App.2d 476, 486 [37 Cal.Rptr. 489]; <em>Fritz </em>v. <em>Foote </em>(1958) 162 Cal.App.2d 622, 623-624 [328 P.2d 522]; accord, <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Janis </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 931, 936-937 [118 Cal.Rptr. 280]; see also <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>Glasser </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1011 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 621] [\u201cproof of service substantially complied with . . . Code of Civil Procedure section 1013a, although [the proof of service] did not expressly state on its face that the envelope was sealed and placed for collection and mailing following ordinary business practices\u201d].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, as recently as 2003, the Judicial Council of California approved a form for proofs of service by mail that indicates the \u201cplace of mailing\u201d portion of the form is satisfied by the insertion of \u201c(city and state).\u201d (2 West\u2019s Cal. Judicial Council Forms (July 2005 ed.) Proof of Service by Mail, Form FL-335.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">We conclude that the proofs of service substantially comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 1013a; they included express representations by the claims adjuster that on a specific day (November 19, 2001) she sealed each claim rejection notice in a postage-paid envelope addressed to the attorney for plaintiffs, and deposited each in the United States mail. Further, the proofs of service specified that the claims adjuster\u2019s business address was located in San Francisco and she had executed the proofs of service on that same day (November 19, 2001) in San Francisco. These representations raise a reasonable inference the claims adjuster deposited the envelopes containing the claim rejection notices in the United States mail within the boundaries of San Francisco.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">B. <em>Evidence the Notices Were Not Received</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Plaintiffs further argue that they presented sufficient evidence of nonreceipt to create a triable issue of fact that the claim rejection notices were never sent. Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence included a declaration by the secretary at the law firm representing plaintiffs that stated the secretary was \u201cresponsible for opening and directing mail received,\u201d and averred that \u201c[a]t no time did [she] receive or ever see [the claim rejection notices] dated November 19, 2001.\u201d Plaintiffs also presented circumstantial evidence of nonreceipt by attaching correspondence sent by plaintiffs\u2019 trial counsel (Harold Sullivan) to potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>referral counsel (Howard Kapp) in May 2002, informing Mr. Kapp that as of that time, Mr. Sullivan\u2019s office had not received any rejection or denial letters for plaintiff\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">As Government Code section 915.2 clarifies, our focus is on the date of mailing, not the receipt of the notice. Even so, we disagree with the City\u2019s contention that evidence of nonreceipt of the notice is irrelevant. Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 210.)  The law presumes that items mailed are received (Evid. Code, \u00a7 641) because the presumed fact \u201cis so likely to be true that the law requires it to be assumed in the absence of contrary evidence. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Craig v. Brown &amp; Root, Inc. </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 416, 421 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 818].) If, normally, an item properly mailed is received, then evidence of nonreceipt is logically probative of nonmailing and, absent contrary statutory authority, sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact and defeat summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The legislative scheme relating to the tort claims procedure is instructive. The statute of limitations period is triggered \u201cfrom the date the notice is deposited in the mail by the public entity, and not the date that it is received by the claimant or counsel.\u201d <em>(Edgington </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 39, 47 [173 Cal.Rptr. 225].) In fact, a claimant is required to comply with the six-month statute of limitations associated with government tort claims upon proof that the notice of rejection was served even if it was not actually received by the claimant. Thus, the Legislature has placed upon the claimant the risk that a properly mailed notice of claim rejection is not delivered due to an error by the postal authorities. And, the Legislature has provided a corresponding opportunity for the claimant to protect itself from this risk. Following presentation of a claim for personal injury or death (Gov. Code, \u00a7 911.2), the public entity must act within 45 days (Gov. Code, \u00a7 912.4, subd. (a)). If the entity fails to accept or reject the claim within that period, the claim is deemed to have been rejected. (\u00a7 912.4, subd. (c).) If the claim is rejected by the public entity expressly or by operation of law, notice must be sent to the claimant. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 913.) Thus, following a reasonable time after the expiration of the 45 days, a claimant should be aware that the claim has been denied and the statutory notice of that denial has not been provided. The claimant then has the opportunity to inquire about the denial and determine, thereby, the limitations period. (See 1 Van Alstyne et al., Cal. Government Tort Liability Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 4th ed. 2004) Bringing the Action, \u00a7 8.15, p. 388; cf. <em>Dowell v. County of Contra Costa, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.3d at p. 901.) The claimant should not be permitted to forgo that opportunity and, then, rely on the fact no notice was delivered to extend the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>We conclude plaintiff\u2019s evidence of nonreceipt of the claim rejection notices is legally insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact negating the six-month statute of limitations defense. In view of the City\u2019s evidence of proof of mailing, the trial court was correct to conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit was barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The judgment is affirmed.
