The first order directed appellant to return copies she had received from the juvenile court file and prohibited her from disseminating the records without a prior court order. The second order denied appellant\u2019s petition pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 827<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (section 827 petition) for disclosure of juvenile records. In affirming the order directing appellant to return documents, we conclude that although appellant is authorized to inspect juvenile court files, she is not entitled to make copies absent a prior court order. We find, however, that the juvenile court\u2019s second order improperly denied appellant access to documents needed to pursue an invasion of privacy claim and therefore reverse the denial of appellant\u2019s section 827 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Gina was bom in July 1987 and was the subject of several referrals to child protective services beginning in 1992, when she was five years old.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In March 2003, respondent filed a petition based on allegations Gina suffered serious emotional damage as a result of appellant\u2019s behavior. The case number for the proceedings was JV22599A (the first dependency case). The first dependency case was dismissed after an agreement that Gina would remain with her caretakers and appellant would cooperate so that Gina could receive medical treatment and other services requiring parental authorization. A second petition was filed in July 2003, based on allegations that appellant rescinded previous authorization regarding medical care, which prevented Gina\u2019s caretakers from securing medical care for her. The new petition was assigned a different case number. Gina was adjudged a dependent child of the juvenile court in September 2003, and the juvenile court later terminated reunification services. In <em>In re Gina S., supra, </em>Nos. A104619, A106628, we affirmed the juvenile court\u2019s order finding jurisdiction over Gina but reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>the court\u2019s order terminating reunification services to appellant because the juvenile court failed to adopt a case plan for appellant. Neither reunification services nor custody of Gina are at issue in this appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">A. <em>The Section 827 Petition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">In December 2004, appellant, acting in propria persona, served a section 827 petition. The petition requested \u201c[a]ll records generated or supplemented between February 1, 2003 and September 1, 2003 that include any of the following terms: 1. \u2018SSA,\u2019 2. \u2018Commissioner,\u2019 3. \u2018social security office,\u2019 or \u2018social security employee,\u2019 4. [variations of a first and last name], 5. \u2018medical diagnosis\u2019 and/or \u2018medical condition of Donna S[.],\u2019 or any combination of those terms . . . .\u201d The petition also requested records that contained \u201cinformation about the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of Ms. Donna S[.],\u201d information about \u201cany governmental agency inappropriately obtaining information referring to Ms. Donna S[.], or misusing information referring to Ms. Donna S[.],\u201d and \u201cany sworn declaration or affidavit that has been filed by any of [appellant\u2019s] attorneys in this case.\u201d The petition stated that appellant believed \u201cher federal Privacy Act Rights\u201d had been violated and sought the documents in order to allow her attorney to investigate what was disclosed and to evaluate the validity of possible legal claims. The petition was dated December 17, 2004, and bore the number of the first dependency case. It was stamped, \u201cReceived Marin County Superior Court 2004 Dec 28\u201d; above the stamp was the handwritten note, \u201clodged on demand.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">B. <em>Respondent\u2019s Application for Temporary Restraining Order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">According to a declaration filed in the juvenile court, Gina\u2019s counsel filed a \u201cpreliminary response\u201d to the section 827 petition on December 28, 2004. While filing the response, Gina\u2019s counsel was informed by a juvenile court clerk that another clerk had provided appellant with \u201ccopies of documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>from Gina\u2019s confidential juvenile file . . . upon her request.\u201d It was unclear whether the copied documents had come from the file in the present action or in the first dependency case. According to the declaration of Gina\u2019s counsel, counsel informed the juvenile court clerk that appellant was not permitted to have copies of documents from the juvenile court file.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Respondent filed an ex paite application for an order to show cause and temporary restraining order (TRO), requesting that appellant not \u201ccopy or disseminate any of the information from her daughter\u2019s confidential dependency files.\u201d The juvenile court entered a TRO, effective until January 11, 2005,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and ordered appellant not to copy, distribute, or disseminate any of the records. The TRO was subsequently extended until February 1, when another hearing was scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">C. <em>The February 1, 2005 Hearing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">The juvenile court considered both the request for appellant to return documents copied from the juvenile court file and appellant\u2019s section 827 petition on February 1. The court first considered the application for an order regarding the copies appellant received from the juvenile court file. After hearing argument from appellant\u2019s counsel, the juvenile court granted respondent\u2019s application and ordered appellant to return any and all documents copied from the juvenile court file and not to copy or disseminate any documents or information received from the file without obtaining prior court authorization. After the juvenile court issued its order, appellant\u2019s counsel stated appellant had \u201ca problem recalling which documents she actually received from the clerk\u2019s office.\u201d The juvenile court responded, \u201cI have a Court order in place. If I were you, I would find out where those documents are and return them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">The juvenile court next considered appellant\u2019s section 827 petition. Appellant\u2019s counsel argued<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that appellant sought to have an attorney review a \u201cvery limited class of documents\u201d in order to pursue a claim for an alleged wrongful dissemination of Social Security records to respondent. Gina\u2019s counsel argued that Gina\u2019s file documented the years of abuse Gina suffered while in her mother\u2019s care and that she did not \u201cunderstand how any information can come out of those files without it affecting Gina\u2019s privacy in some way.\u201d Respondent\u2019s counsel agreed and said \u201cit would be extremely difficult\u201d to separate the information appellant sought from private information about Gina. In response to respondent\u2019s counsel\u2019s statement that appellant previously had received relevant information through discovery, appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>lant\u2019s counsel acknowledged Donna had the information but stated that she sought court permission to share that information with an attorney in connection with a possible privacy violation lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The juvenile court reviewed in camera the Child Protective Services (CPS) files provided by respondent. After its review, the juvenile court stated, \u201cI took a look at several of the code sections, and specifically [California] Rule of Court [l]423(b) which requires that the court balance the interests of the child and other parties to the Juvenile Court proceedings, interests of the petitioner, and interests of the public, [f] \u2018The Court must permit disclosure o[r] discovery, however access to Juvenile Court records only in so far as is necessary, and only if there is a reasonable likelihood that the records in question will disclose information or evidence of substantial relevance to the pending litigation.\u2019 [][] And it goes on to say that, \u2018the burden is on the petitioner to describe in detail the reason the records are being sought and their relevancy to the proceeding for which petitioner wishes to inspect the records.\u2019 [][] And I find that has not been met.\u201d The court then denied the section 827 petition in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Appellant timely appealed from both the order that she return documents and the denial of her section 827 petition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">It is the express intent of the Legislature that \u201cjuvenile court records, in general, should be confidential.\u201d (\u00a7 827, subd. (b)(1).) This reflects a long recognized public policy of protecting the confidentiality of juvenile proceedings and records. <em>(T.N.G. v. Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 767, 778 [94 Cal.Rptr. 813, 484 P.2d 981]; <em>Keisha T., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at p. 231.) Access to confidential juvenile records is governed by section 827. Section 827, subdivision (a) lists categories of people who have the right to inspect juvenile records without court order, including the child and his or her parents, as well as certain other designated persons who have a direct interest in matters related to the child. (\u00a7 827, subd. (a)(1)(A)-(N).) Section 827, subdivision (a)(1)(O) also provides access to \u201c[a]ny other person who may be designated by court order of the judge of the juvenile court upon filing a petition.\u201d The juvenile court has exclusive authority to determine the extent to which confidential juvenile records may be released and controls \u201cthe time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>place and manner of inspection.\u201d <em>(Lorenza P. v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 607, 611 [242 Cal.Rptr. 877]; see also <em>T.N.G. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d at p. 778; <em>Keisha T., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at p. 233.) \u201cThe juvenile court has both \u2018the sensitivity and expertise\u2019 to make this determination. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Keisha T., supra, </em>at p. 232.)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Appellant argues that the juvenile court erred in ordering her to return the copies she received from a clerk and denying her section 827 petition because she has a right to access information about her own medical records in order to pursue redress for any violation of her privacy. Respondent emphasizes the vast discretion the juvenile court has over access to confidential juvenile case files. Gina has filed a brief asserting her right to privacy but supporting appellant\u2019s position and arguing that there is no good faith argument that the orders at issue were lawful in light of \u201csignificant procedural and evidentiary deficiencies.\u201d We review the juvenile court\u2019s orders for abuse of discretion. <em>(In re Elijah S. </em>(2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 1532, 1541 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 16]; <em>In re R.G. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1408, 1413 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 818]; <em>In re Tiffany G. </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 443, 453 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 8]; <em>In re Robert L. </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1065 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 654].)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">A. <em>Ordering Appellant to Return Documents Was Not Abuse of Discretion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Section 827, subdivision (a)(1)(D) provides that a case file in juvenile proceedings \u201cmay be inspected\u201d by the minor\u2019s parents. All parties (as well as the juvenile court) agree that appellant is permitted to inspect the confidential juvenile court file that relates to the dependency proceedings involving her daughter. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1423(b)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> [specified persons in section 827 may inspect juvenile court records without prior court authorization].) The juvenile court\u2019s order that appellant return copies she received and not make any further copies without the court\u2019s permission can only be justified if the right to <em>inspect </em>documents does not include the right to <em>copy </em>the same documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">We independently determine the proper interpretation of section 827 <em>(Burden </em>v. <em>Snowden </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 556, 562 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 531, 828 P.2d 672]) and conclude that the right to inspect a juvenile court file does not include the <em>automatic </em>right to copy documents in the file. (85 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 194 (2002) [right granted in section 827 to inspect file does not include authority to copy without first obtaining a court order].) The statute refers to the right to inspect, but not to copy, a case file. (\u00a7 827, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>subd. (a)(1).)  \u201cWe must look to the statute\u2019s words and give them their \u2018usual and ordinary meaning.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(White v. Ultramar, Inc. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 563, 572 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 19, 981 P.2d 944].) The word \u201cinspect,\u201d which means \u201cto view closely in critical appraisal,\u201d does not encompass making \u201can imitation, transcript, or reproduction of an original work,\u201d the definition of the word \u201ccopy.\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dict. (11th ed. 2003) pp. 647-648, col. 2 &amp; p. 256, col. 2.) As the Attorney General observed in a 2002 opinion holding that a district attorney may inspect but not copy documents in juvenile case files without first obtaining a court order, the Legislature \u201cwould know, of course, how to say \u2018inspected and copied\u2019 if it so intended.\u201d (85 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen., <em>supra, </em>at p. 198, citing Corp. Code, \u00a7 6330 [\u201cinspect and copy\u201d]; Ed. Code, \u00a7 94874 [\u201cinspection and copying\u201d]; Evid. Code, \u00a7 1158 [\u201cinspection and copying\u201d]; Earn. Code, \u00a7 9200 [\u201cinspection or copying\u201d]; Gov. Code, \u00a7 6263 [\u201cinspection or copying\u201d]; Pen. Code, \u00a7 936.7 [\u201cinspection and copying\u201d]; see also Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 800, subd. (c) [\u201cinspect and have copies\u201d]; Civ. Code, \u00a7 1365.2 [\u201cinspection and copying\u201d]; Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7 33261 [\u201cinspect and copy\u201d].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n                   We note that although section 827 \u201chas been amended virtually every year since it first appeared\u201d in 1961 <em>(People v. Superior Court, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.4th at p. 494), the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of the statute has not been modified by the Legislature. <em>(Meyer v. Board of Trustees </em>(1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 420, 432 [15 Cal.Rptr. 717] [Legislature presumed to be aware of Attorney General opinion and able to take corrective action if opinion contrary to legislative intent].) That the Legislature has modified at least three other statutes to permit copying of documents also demonstrates that it is capable of taking corrective action. (See Amends. Deering\u2019s Ann. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 3717 (2005 supp.) p. 81; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 10148 (2001 ed.) p. 130; Historical and Statutory Notes, 32D West\u2019s Ann. Gov. Code (2005 ed.) foll. \u00a7 11181, pp. 22-23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Sound public policy supports the Legislature\u2019s decision to afford some categories of people the right to inspect, but not to copy, documents in the juvenile case file. A juvenile case file is defined by statute as \u201ca petition filed in any juvenile court proceeding, reports of the probation officer, and <em>all </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number><em>other documents </em>filed in that case <em>or made available to </em>the probation officer in making his or her report, or to the judge, referee, or other hearing officer, and thereafter retained by the probation officer, judge, referee, or other hearing officer.\u201d (\u00a7 827, subd. (e), italics added.) Allowing parties the unfettered right to copy such a broad category of documents absent a court order would frustrate the juvenile court\u2019s ability to safeguard the privacy of minors in order to protect their best interests and to control access to juvenile case files. (T.N.G. v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 784; <em>In re Tiffany G., supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th at p. 450.)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Appellant\u2019s trial counsel argued that the language of rule 1423(b) supports the position that appellant was permitted to copy documents from the juvenile court file. But the plain language of the rule permits a party to \u201cinspect, obtain, or copy juvenile court records\u201d only after securing an order from the juvenile court. (Rule 1423(b).) That appellant does not have the automatic right to copy documents from Gina\u2019s case file does not mean she could not seek a court order to copy the documents, as respondent acknowledges. Section 827, subdivision (a)(3)(B) contemplates the <em>\u201crelease </em>of [a] juvenile case file or any portion thereof\u2019 (italics added) so long as interested parties are afforded due process, and courts have consistently interpreted the statute to vest the juvenile court with the authority to determine when the release of juvenile court records is appropriate. <em>(Keisha T., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at p. 232.)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The question remains whether the juvenile court abused its discretion in ordering the return of the copies appellant received from the juvenile case file. Appellant does not precisely explain how the juvenile court erred and instead focuses primarily on the denial of her section 827 petition. Respondent emphasizes that appellant does not have an automatic right to copy documents in the juvenile case file and concludes that because she had no such right, the juvenile court\u2019s order \u201cwas within the court\u2019s discretion and thus, was not an abuse of discretion.\u201d Gina argues the juvenile court did not follow proper procedures and that the juvenile court\u2019s order was not supported by any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">As to Gina\u2019s procedural arguments, we first reject her argument that respondent lacked standing to request the documents be returned. (\u00a7 280 [social services department shall represent interests of minors in dependency proceedings]; <em>In re Tiffany G., supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th at pp. 447-448, 450 [juvenile court had authority to enter nondissemination order following allegations in social worker\u2019s report].)  We also conclude that the juvenile court had the authority to order appellant to return copies of juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>case file documents, contrary to Gina\u2019s suggestion. <em>(In re Anthony H. </em>(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 495, 502 [28 Cal.Rptr.3d 575] [juvenile court has exclusive authority to determine whether juvenile records will be released].) We likewise disagree that the juvenile court was required to follow the procedures for injunctions set forth in the Code of Civil Procedure. <em>(Pack v. Kings County Human Services Agency </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 821, 827 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 594] <em>(Pack) </em>[section 827 governs confidentiality and release of juvenile records]; <em>People v. Espinoza </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1287, 1314 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 700] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Gina also overstates how much \u201cevidence\u201d was required to support the juvenile court\u2019s order. Indeed, the records at issue can provide sufficient proof of the harm that would be suffered were they disclosed. <em>(Pack, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.4th at p. 837.) It is beyond dispute that the juvenile case file here is filled with documents that detail the emotional abuse Gina suffered, as well as incidents that would be embarrassing to Gina were they to become public. It apparently also is undisputed that appellant actually received copies of documents from the clerk\u2019s office. Absent a court order, appellant might assume she was free to disseminate at will the copies she received, which \u201cwould clearly undermine the court\u2019s efforts to protect the [minor] and promote [her] best interests.\u201d <em>(In re Tiffany G., supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th at p. 452.)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">In <em>In re Tiffany G., </em>the court found that the juvenile court was well within its authority when it ordered that a mother and stepfather not circulate confidential information from juvenile records after they had mailed copies of various records to several people in two states and the stepfather suggested at a hearing he wanted to provide documents to a grand jury. <em>(In re Tiffany G., supra, 29 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 447-448, 450-451.) Although there was no evidence here as to what, if anything, appellant intended to do with the documents she possessed, we conclude that the juvenile court\u2019s order that appellant return documents and not disseminate information from the copies she received was within the court\u2019s inherent power to control the dissemination of the juvenile case files and keep the files confidential. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 450.)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">B. <em>Denial of Appellant\u2019s Section 827 Petition Was An Abuse of Discretion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">We next consider whether the juvenile court abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s section 827 petition. The court reviewed in camera CPS files and denied appellant\u2019s petition in its entirety, concluding that appellant had not met her \u201cburden\u201d under rule 1423. Appellant argues on appeal that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>the juvenile court erred in denying her petition because she sought to disseminate only information about her own medical condition and she has been denied the right to redress her grievances about an alleged privacy invasion. We agree that the juvenile court\u2019s order was too restrictive insofar as it prohibited appellant from disseminating to her attorney <em>any </em>information from the juvenile records about the alleged privacy invasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Appellant\u2019s petition requested access to a limited category of documents\u2014 namely, documents that refer to an employee of a federal agency disclosing to a county social worker information about appellant\u2019s health.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed the parties below appeared to agree, and our review of the records reviewed in camera by the juvenile court confirms, that the primary documents encompassed by appellant\u2019s motion related only to limited case notes about a March 19, 2003 incident.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To be clear, appellant was not seeking access to the juvenile case file; again, as discussed <em>ante, </em>appellant had the right to inspect the file. (\u00a7 827, subd. (a)(1)(D).) Indeed, respondent\u2019s counsel told the juvenile court that respondent previously had provided discovery from the CPS file regarding the incident at issue, and appellant\u2019s counsel acknowledged \u201c[ijt\u2019s true that we do have the information.\u201d (Italics added.) What appellant sought was permission to <em>disseminate </em>that information to an attorney to pursue a possible civil action, something she acknowledged she was not permitted to do absent a court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">\u201c[T]he prohibition against dissemination recognizes the exclusive authority of the juvenile court to determine who may have access to juvenile court records. ... It is the juvenile court, not the recipient, that has the authority to decide to whom juvenile court records may be released.\u201d <em>(Keisha T., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at p. 234.) Rule 1423(b) guides a juvenile court\u2019s decision on whether to permit access to juvenile court records. (38 Cal.App.4th at p. 235.) The rule provides, in relevant part, \u201cIn determining whether to authorize inspection or release of juvenile court records, in whole or in part, the court must balance the interests of the child and other parties to the juvenile court proceedings, the interests of the petitioner, and the interests of the public. The court must permit disclosure of, discovery of, or access to juvenile court records or proceedings only insofar as is necessary, and only if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>there is a reasonable likelihood that the records in question will disclose information or evidence of substantial relevance to the pending litigation, investigation, or prosecution.\u201d (Rule 1423(b).) Rule 1423(c) states that a section 827 petition \u201cshall describe in detail the reasons the records are being sought and their relevancy to the proceeding or purpose for which petitioner wishes to inspect or obtain the records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Respondent claims that appellant has not demonstrated good cause to disseminate information from the juvenile court records because pursuing a civil claim \u201chas not been legislatively or judicially determined as good cause in itself so as to pierce the veil of confidentiality.\u201d But rule 1423(b) specifically authorizes disclosure of information where there is \u201csubstantial relevance\u201d to an either a pending \u201clitigation, investigation, or prosecution.\u201d We likewise reject respondent\u2019s argument that confidentiality should be maintained because there are no \u201cspecific exceptions for civil plaintiffs\u201d in the statute. Although <em>In re Anthony H. </em>did not reach the merits of appellant\u2019s section 827 petition, the court recognized the importance of disclosing juvenile records to prosecute a federal civil action against a county social service department if appellant were able to show on remand that her interest in the documents outweighed any interest in confidentiality. <em>(In re Anthony H., supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at pp. 498, 506.)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Having denied appellant\u2019s petition, the juvenile court effectively barred appellant from discussing the alleged privacy invasion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Respondent now argues appellant\u2019s first amendment rights are not implicated because the juvenile court\u2019s order \u201cdoes not prevent her from [filing a federal lawsuit], it merely proscribes the dissemination of confidential court documents.\u201d But respondent does not explain how appellant could pursue a claim without being able to discuss the incident that allegedly violated her privacy with her attorney in that matter. This case is akin to <em>In re Anthony H., supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at page 505. There, the court noted that without access to the documents \u201cit would be extremely difficult to determine whether there had been any wrongdoing, and if so, to prove it.\u201d Here, absent the ability to disseminate any information about the incident to her counsel or to allege it in a complaint, it would be virtually impossible to determine if there had been any wrongdoing, and if so, to prove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>The CPS files reviewed by the juvenile court in camera<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> reveal that the incident at issue did not involve any information\u2014confidential or otherwise\u2014about Gina. Granting appellant the right to disseminate information about the incident thus would have little, if any, effect on Gina\u2019s interests. (Cf. rule 1423(b).) Respondent claims \u201c[a]ppellant has produced no case finding when the pre-filing discovery rights of a civil plaintiff outweigh the privacy rights of a juvenile\u2019s court record\u201d but does not explain how Gina\u2019s privacy rights are implicated in the first place. We agree with appellant that prohibiting appellant from discussing the incident at issue grants it \u201csuper-confidential\u201d status. We conclude the juvenile court abused its discretion insofar as it limited appellant\u2019s ability to discuss the alleged violation of her privacy rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Moreover, we find that it is possible to permit disclosure of a portion of the most relevant document without violating Gina\u2019s privacy interests. Respondent\u2019s counsel described the relevant information as being contained in \u201cprobably two or three sentences\u201d in a case note written by a social worker. Our review reveals those \u201ctwo or three sentences\u201d contain information about the date of the incident, the people involved with the disclosure of medical information, and the specific information disclosed. The sentences do not contain information about Gina, and the document could easily be redacted to remove any confidential information that does implicate her privacy interests. The juvenile court certainly had the ability to disclose a \u201cportion of the records\u201d at issue and make \u201cappropriate orders, specifying the information to be disclosed and the procedure for providing access to it\u201d in order to protect Gina\u2019s privacy interests. (Rule 1423(e); <em>In re Anthony H., supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 506 [juvenile court may limit disclosure to designated people and redact information that would conflict with minor\u2019s best interests]; <em>Keisha T., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at p. 241 [juvenile court may make \u201cappropriate orders specifying the information to be disclosed and the procedure for providing access\u201d].) We therefore remand this case and direct the juvenile court to enter a new order consistent with this opinion and rule 1423(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The juvenile court\u2019s February 1, 2005 order directing appellant to return copies of documents she received from the juvenile court\u2019s file and not to disseminate them is affirmed.
