Code, \u00a7 556, subd. (a)(1); counts 1, 3, 5, and 7)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and one count for grand theft of personal property (Pen. Code, former \u00a7 487, subd. 1; count 2). He was sentenced to prison for three years and eight months.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The primary issue in this case is whether a jury can compare an exemplar of a defendant\u2019s handwriting with handwriting on disputed documents to determine if the defendant signed the disputed documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">We hold that the jury, under Evidence Code section 1417, was entitled to compare the signatures and, based on that comparison, a jury reasonably could have concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, and without the benefit of testimony from a handwriting expert, that the questioned signatures were made by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">\n<em>FACTUAL SUMMARY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">1. <em>The Metropolitan Life Insurance Claim (Count 5).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Viewed in accordance with the usual rules on appeal <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ochoa </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199, 1206 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 23, 864 P.2d 103]), the evidence, the sufficiency of which is undisputed except as to the issue of identity, established that on August 27, 1985, a person named Eduardo Tolentino Rodriguez knowingly presented to Metropolitan Life Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>(Metropolitan) a fraudulent claim for the proceeds of a $400,000 life insurance policy in which Imelda Rodriguez (Imelda) was the insured. Rodriguez<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> presented the claim knowing Imelda was alive. (Count 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Rodriguez presented the claim through his attorney George Savin. Savin testified that \u201cEduardo Tolentino Rodriguez\u201d retained Savin in August 1985. On August 26, 1985, \u201cEduardo T. Rodriguez\u201d signed a Metropolitan claimant\u2019s statement (People\u2019s exhibit No. 28).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August 27, 1985, Savin had Rodriguez sign a notarized power of attorney (exhibit 22) so Savin could handle the Metropolitan matter. The authorization is signed with a scrawl, but the notary indicated the signature was that of \u201cEduardo T. Rodriguez\u201d (some capitalization omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On August 27, 1985, Rodriguez also signed a notarized document (exhibit 30) authorizing Metropolitan to obtain medical information pertaining to Imelda in order to process the claim. The authorization is signed with a scrawl, but the notary indicated the signature was that of \u201cEduardo T. Rodriguez\u201d (some capitalization omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Norman MacRae, a claims investigator, investigated the claim on behalf of Metropolitan. He met Rodriguez once at Savin\u2019s office. MacRae recorded in a written statement what Rodriguez told MacRae concerning how Imelda allegedly had died. Rodriguez signed the statement (exhibit No. 29); the signature is a scrawl representing \u201cEduardo T. Rodriguez.\u201d The exhibit lists his address as 17000 Tennyson Place, Granada Hills, California. MacRae witnessed Rodriguez\u2019s signature, and MacRae signed the statement. MacRae could not identify appellant at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">2. <em>The Allstate Claim (Count 7).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">On September 3, 1985, a person named Eduardo T. Rodriguez knowingly presented to Allstate Insurance (Allstate) a fraudulent claim for the proceeds of a $400,000 life insurance policy in which Imelda was the insured, even though Rodriguez knew Imelda was alive. (Count 7.) Rodriguez presented the claim through Savin. The claim (exhibit No. 23) was signed by Rodriguez on September 3, 1985, and lists his address as the above mentioned Tennyson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Place address. The signature is a scrawl representing \u201cEdwardo T. Rodriguez.\u201d The claim is also signed by Savin as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Savin personally met Rodriguez during the course of Savin\u2019s representation of him. Rodriguez gave Savin a copy of Imelda\u2019s alleged death certificate and a police report. On August 27, 1985, Savin had Rodriguez sign the previously mentioned notarized power of attorney (exhibit No. 22) so Savin could handle the Allstate matter (in addition to the Metropolitan matter).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Savin later became suspicious of Rodriguez\u2019s claims and withdrew as counsel. At trial in November 2003, Savin could not identify appellant, but testified that appellant looked familiar and his appearance was consistent with that of Rodriguez. MacRae investigated the claim on behalf of Allstate, and had appellant sign and submit exhibit No. 29, which pertained to the Allstate claim (as well as to the Metropolitan claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">3. <em>The National American Life Insurance Claim and Payment (Counts 1 and </em>2).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">On September 3, 1985, a person named Eduardo Rodriguez knowingly presented to National American Life Insurance (National) a fraudulent claim for the proceeds of a $100,000 life insurance policy in which Rodriguez was beneficiary and his wife, Imelda, was the insured, even though Rodriguez knew Imelda was alive. (Count 1.) The initial policy application was signed by Imelda on July 11, 1985, and she indicated on the application that she lived at 17000 Tennyson Place in Granada Hills.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Miller Stroup, a claims adjuster for National, processed the claim. Attorney Sheila Singer was Rodriguez\u2019s attorney. Stroup asked Singer to acknowledge that Singer was the attorney for Rodriguez. Singer had Rodriguez sign, on September 3, 1985, a document (exhibit No. 4). The signature is a scrawl above the name \u201cEduardo Rodriguez.\u201d The document authorizes Singer to handle all matters regarding Rodriguez\u2019s claim with National. Stroup received that document and also received a claimant\u2019s statement signed on September 3, 1985, by Rodriguez (exhibit No. 5). The signature is a scrawl above the name \u201cEduardo Rodriguez\u201d (some capitalization omitted), and lists his address as the above mentioned Tennyson Place address. Stroup also received a copy of an alleged Philippines death certificate (exhibit No. 6), reflecting the alleged death of Imelda. The copy reflects Rodriguez\u2019s signature, dated July 27, 1985, as that of the informant. The signature is a scrawl above the name \u201cEduardo T. Rodriguez\u201d (some capitalization omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">National honored Rodriguez\u2019s claim and made a $100,000 payment to him. (Count 2.) The check was dated September 13, 1985, and was probably sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>on that date. The check, made payable to Rodriguez, would have been sent to Singer. The check was negotiated. Singer had been instructed to deposit the check in Rodriguez\u2019s bank account when Singer received the check. Singer testified that she remembered depositing the check in a bank. Singer testified the check was not endorsed and \u201c[i]t was just ... a stamp deposit to the account of [the] payee.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Stroup did not think he had ever seen appellant before the date of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">4. <em>The Reliance Claim (Count 3).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">On September 11, 1985, a person named Eduardo Rodriguez knowingly presented to Reliance Standard Life Insurance (Reliance) a fraudulent claim for the proceeds of a $150,000 life insurance policy in which Imelda was the insured, even though Rodriguez knew Imelda was alive. (Count 3.) Singer assisted Rodriguez in processing the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Rodriguez signed, on September 4, 1985, a document (exhibit No. 12) authorizing Singer to handle the Reliance claim. Rodriguez also signed, on September 10, 1985, a Reliance claimant statement (exhibit No. 13) which lists his address as the above mentioned Tennyson Place address. As to each of exhibits Nos. 12 and 13, the signature is a scrawl above the name \u201cEduardo Rodriguez\u201d (some capitalization omitted). On October 15, 1985, Rodriguez signed a document (exhibit No. 16) authorizing Reliance to obtain medical information pertaining to Imelda. The authorization is signed \u201cEduardo T. Rodriguez.\u201d Singer later learned the claim was fraudulent. Singer did not, at trial, identify Rodriguez, but knew Rodriguez was Filipino.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Lawrence Odel investigated Rodriguez\u2019s claim to Reliance. On October 15, 1985, Odel had Rodriguez sign a written statement (exhibit No. 32) concerning how Imelda allegedly had died. The statement was signed, \u201cEduardo Rodriguez,\u201d and lists his address as the above mentioned Tennyson Place address. Odel did not testify that appellant was Rodriguez.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">5. <em>Additional Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">California Department of Insurance Investigator Kenneth Kensler was assigned to investigate the present matter in the latter part of 1985 or early <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>1986. He identified exhibit No. 31. That exhibit purports to be a copy of the California driver\u2019s license of Eduardo Tolentino Rodriguez, containing his signature and photograph, and listing his address as 17000 Tennyson Place, Granada Hills, California. The signature is a scrawl. Kensler referred to exhibit No. 31 as a \u201cSoundex\u201d from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Kensler later explained that a request for information would be made through \u201cSoundex,\u201d but the photographs on the exhibit were sent to him by DMV.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">During the direct examination of Kensler, the prosecutor indicated that Rodriguez had listed one or more residence addresses on his claim applications, and listed the above mentioned Tennyson Place address on his driver\u2019s license. The prosecutor then asked if Kensler had been able to locate Rodriguez at an address, apparently the Tennyson address, but Kensler replied he was not. At some point in 1985, Kensler went to an apartment complex at 17819 Merridy Street in Northridge, and obtained a copy of a lease (exhibit No. 33) reflecting that Rodriguez was leasing an apartment there. The lease is signed with a scrawl, representing \u201cEduardo T. Rodriguez,\u201d and lists his address as the above mentioned Tennyson Place address.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">California Department of Insurance investigator Michael Ingram testified that in November 1985, he and his partner went to an apartment complex at 17819 Merridy Street in Northridge. Once there, Ingram located Imelda, and Ingram and his partner identified themselves as police officers. Imelda fled but Ingram and his partner pursued and arrested her. Imelda provided a false name and tried to bribe Ingram and his partner to release her.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">On November 21, 2003, the parties stipulated that \u201cthe defendant, Eduardo Tolentino Rodriguez, is married to Imelda Dener Rodriguez\u201d; that she was alive at the time of trial; and appellant and his wife lived in the Philippines since late 1985. The parties also stipulated that, following her arrest, Imelda posted bail, failed to appear in court, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. All of the above discussed exhibits were admitted in evidence without objection. Appellant presented no defense evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">\n<em>CONTENTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Appellant contends there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions. He argues, inter alia, that, absent testimony from a handwriting expert, the jury could not properly compare appellant\u2019s signature on his driver\u2019s license with questioned signatures on the claims and related documents to conclude the latter signatures were made by appellant. He also argues such a comparison by the jury was impermissible because the trial court made no foundational finding as to the existence of the preliminary fact of the genuineness of the signature on the driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\n<em>Sufficient Evidence Supported Appellant\u2019s Convictions.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">1. <em>Pertinent Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The People were required at trial to rely on documentary evidence in their efforts to prove appellant committed the present offenses, because he left the country in late 1985 to live in the Philippines, and any memory of witnesses as to the culprit\u2019s appearance naturally would have diminished over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Appellant conceded during jury argument that in 1985, Imelda and another person attempted to defraud the insurance companies, but appellant denied he was the person and denied he received the $100,000 payment. Moreover, appellant\u2019s counsel urged to the jury that the scrawls on exhibits Nos. 4, 5, 6, 12, 14, 23, 29, 30, 31 (the driver\u2019s license), and 33 were somewhat similar, but the signatures on exhibits Nos. 28 and 32 were \u201ccompletely different than other signatures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">2. <em>Analysis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Appellant contends that the jury could not compare an exemplar of appellant\u2019s signature with signatures on disputed documents to determine if appellant signed the disputed documents. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">(a) <em>Pertinent Law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">Evidence Code section 1417, states, \u201cThe genuineness of handwriting, or the lack thereof, may be proved by a comparison made by the trier of fact with handwriting (a) which the court finds was admitted or treated as genuine by the party against whom the evidence is offered or (b) otherwise proved to be genuine to the satisfaction of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">Although it concerned a will contest, the case of <em>Estate of Nielson </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 796 [165 Cal.Rptr. 319] <em>(Nielson), </em>held that expert testimony was not necessary to authenticate handwriting. There the court stated, \u201cWhere the issue is the questioned authorship of a will, the trier of fact can determine the issue by comparison of the questioned writing with \u2018genuine\u2019 or admitted handwriting of the testator without the aid of the oral testimony of any witness. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1417; [citations].) Thus, no handwriting expert or testimony was necessary. The court\u2014the trier of fact\u2014had the testator\u2019s admitted handwriting before it in the proffered will. It was authorized by law to determine the authenticity of the \u2018questioned handwriting by comparison\u2019 with the conceded handwriting of the testator.\u201d <em>(Nielson, supra, </em>at p. 801.)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>For purposes of the Evidence Code, the phrase \u201c[t]rier of fact\u201d includes a jury (Evid. Code, \u00a7 235), and Evidence Code section 1417 applies to civil and criminal actions alike. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 105, 300.) Nonetheless, we have not found a published criminal case that relies on Evidence Code section 1417 to hold that a <em>jury </em>may compare an exemplar of a defendant\u2019s signature with a signature on a questioned document and then conclude that the latter signature is that of the defendant. However, criminal cases relying on former Code of Civil Procedure section 1944,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the predecessor of Evidence Code section 1417, do so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In an early case decided by this division, <em>People </em>v. <em>Weiskopf </em>(1943) 60 Cal.App.2d 214 [140 P.2d 201] <em>(Weiskopf), </em>the defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence that she forged someone\u2019s name. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 216.) We reasoned a jury could compare the defendant\u2019s signature and a signature on an affidavit of birth, and conclude the latter signature belonged to her. We stated, \u201cthe jury had before them a proven specimen of defendant\u2019s genuine handwriting, and were authorized to make their own comparison of this handwriting with that appearing on the affidavit. (Code of Civ. Proc., sec. 1944; [citations].)\u201d <em>(Weiskopf, supra, </em>at p. 218.)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In <em>People v. Driggs </em>(1910) 14 Cal.App. 507 [112 P. 577] <em>(Driggs), </em>the defendant challenged the sufficiency of evidence that she forged a lease. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 509-510.) Experts compared the lease and defendant\u2019s exemplars. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 509.) As an independent ground for rejecting the sufficiency challenge, <em>Driggs </em>concluded that the exemplars were properly submitted to the jury for comparison with the lease. <em>Driggs </em>stated, \u201cWhen the court was satisfied that the exemplars offered were genuine, it was proper to submit the same to the . . . jury for comparison. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1944.) When so submitted and in evidence, a comparison may be made by the jury with or without the aid of experts. [Citation.] The <em>weight and effect of the </em>opinion of experts, or the <em>results of comparisons, was a matter for the jury. </em>. . . After an examination of the various exhibits which are on file in this court, we feel able to say that no reasonable doubt can exist as to who wrote the signature upon the lease.\u201d <em>(Driggs, supra, </em>at p. 510, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">In <em>People v. Chapman </em>(1957) 156 Cal.App.2d 151, 158-159 [319 P.2d 8], the defendant challenged the sufficiency of evidence that he forged endorsements on three checks. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 154, 158-159.) <em>Chapman </em>concluded the jury was entitled to compare an exemplar (a check indisputably written by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>defendant) to the endorsements, stating, \u201cThe jury may properly compare handwritings to determine similarity or dissimilarity without the testimony of a handwriting expert. [Citations.] [][]... Thus defendant\u2019s felonious connection with these checks is sufficiently established, and the jury could reasonably find that defendant passed each of the three checks as genuine . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 159.)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><em>People v. Vance </em>(1956) 138 Cal.App.2d 871 [292 P.2d 552] <em>(Vance), </em>involved a third party\u2019s signature. In that case, a defendant was convicted of attempted car burglary. He was found in possession of a signed card taken from the car. The car\u2019s owner submitted an exemplar for comparison with the signature on the card, and the defendant complained on appeal that an expert had not conducted the comparison. <em>Vance </em>rejected the complaint, noting, \u201cComparison of handwriting by the jury is a method recognized and prescribed by Code of Civil Procedure, section 1944.\u201d <em>(Vance, supra, </em>at p. 874.)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">We conclude that under Evidence Code section 1417, the jury may determine that a criminal defendant signed a document by comparing the handwriting on a questioned document to an authenticated exemplar of the defendant\u2019s handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">(b) <em>Application of Law to the Facts of This Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">There is no dispute <em>someone </em>committed the crimes of which appellant was convicted. Nor is there any dispute that the culprit signed the name \u201cEduardo Rodriguez\u201d or \u201cEduardo T. Rodriguez,\u201d sometimes using a scrawl, to make the false claims at issue and receive the $100,000 payment from National.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Appellant concedes exhibit No. 31 was <em>appellant\u2019s </em>driver\u2019s license, containing his signature and photograph; that is, he concedes the driver\u2019s license was an exemplar. For example, appellant urges in his opening brief that \u201cthe only evidence that the government relied on in obtaining the conviction of appellant was asking the jury to compare the signature on appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license to the signature on the insurance claim forms.\u201d His opening brief also states that \u201c[Department of Insurance investigator] Kensler . . . procured a copy of appellant\u2019s California driver\u2019s license.\u201d Appellant later urges that it was inappropriate for the jury to \u201ccompare the signature on appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license with the signature on the insurance claims forms.\u201d His reply brief argues \u201cWhat this case comes down to is the jury comparison of the signature on appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license to the signature on the insurance claim forms.\u201d While discussing the driver\u2019s license and signature thereon, his reply brief also claims that the jury\u2019s comparison was improper because of a lack of foundation concerning the \u201cexemplar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">The People\u2019s exhibits have been transmitted to this court, and we have inspected them. Appellant\u2019s signature on his driver\u2019s license is a scrawl. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>scrawl is substantially similar to the scrawls on the other exhibits previously mentioned. Certainly the jury reasonably could have concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the scrawls were substantially the same and that appellant made all of them, and we so hold. Thus, whenever that scrawl appears on an exhibit other than the exemplar, the scrawl provides substantial evidence that appellant signed that exhibit. Accordingly, we discuss below the sufficiency of the evidence as to each count, relying in part on the scrawl as substantial evidence that appellant signed the exhibit on which the scrawl appears. Where exhibits are referred to in our discussion below, they were admitted in evidence to prove the count(s) at issue in that discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">(1) <em>The Metropolitan Claim (Count 5).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">As to count 5, the above mentioned scrawl appears on exhibits Nos. 22, 29, and 30, and this, fact alone provided sufficient evidence to convince a rational trier of fact, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant signed those exhibits pertaining to the Metropolitan claim. Moreover, the signatures on exhibits Nos. 22 and 30 were notarized. Contrary to appellant\u2019s suggestion that someone posed as him and forged those scrawls, the notary attested that the person who signed the scrawl on each of those two documents not only signed each as Eduardo T. Rodriguez, but was <em>in fact </em>Eduardo T. Rodriguez (see fns. 4 and 5, <em>ante). </em>Thus, the jury was entitled to compare the undisputedly genuine scrawl of appellant on his driver\u2019s license with the notarized scrawl attested as genuinely signed by Eduardo T. Rodriguez on those two documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Further, exhibit No. 29 reflects Rodriguez\u2019s address as 17000 Tennyson Place, Granada Hills, California, the same address listed on appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Further still, Savin testified that \u201cEduardo <em>Tolentino </em>Rodriguez\u201d (italics added) retained Savin to represent him on the Metropolitan claim, and appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license reflects that name. It is a sufficiently uncommon name that the identity of name provides sufficient evidence of identity of the person. (Cf. <em>People v. Mendoza </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 390, 400-401 [228 Cal.Rptr. 308] [and cases cited].)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">(2) <em>The Allstate Claim (Count 7).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">As to count seven, the above mentioned scrawl appears on exhibits Nos. 22, 23, and 29. Moreover, as mentioned, exhibit No. 22 was notarized, which enhances the sufficiency of the evidence. Further, exhibits Nos. 23 and 29 reflect Rodriguez\u2019s address as the Tennyson Place address, the same address listed on appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">(3) <em>The National Claim and Payment (Counts 1 and 2).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">As to count 1, the above mentioned scrawl appears on exhibits Nos. 4 and 5. Moreover, since, as we have held above, the jury reasonably could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>concluded that appellant was guilty of counts 1, 5, and 7, and since, as we hold below, the jury reasonably could have concluded appellant was the person who committed count 3, the jury also reasonably could have concluded that appellant committed count 2 and received the payment from National.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">(4) <em>The Reliance Claim (Count 3).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">As to count 3, the above mentioned scrawl appears on exhibits Nos. 12 and 13. Moreover, exhibit No. 13 reflects Rodriguez\u2019s address as the Tennyson Place address, the same address listed on appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Further, we already have concluded there was sufficient evidence that appellant committed count 5 involving the Metropolitan claim. Exhibit No. 28 was admitted in evidence to prove that count, and that exhibit contains the signature \u201cEduardo T. Rodriguez.\u201d Therefore there was sufficient evidence that appellant made that signature. The signature \u201cEduardo T. Rodriguez\u201d also appears on exhibits Nos. 16 and 32, exhibits pertaining to the Reliance claim, and a jury reasonably could have concluded, by comparing the signatures on the above three exhibits, that the signatures on them were made by the same person.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">We hold there was sufficient evidence that appellant committed the crimes of which he was convicted in counts 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, including sufficient identification evidence that he was the person who signed and submitted the fraudulent insurance claims at issue and stole the $100,000 from National. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Ochoa, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 1206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">(c) <em>None of Appellant\u2019s Arguments Compel a Contrary Conclusion.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">We conclude that there was sufficient evidence that appellant committed the offenses of which he was convicted. There was also sufficient evidence of appellant\u2019s identity. That identification evidence includes appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license bearing his signature. Comparing appellant\u2019s authenticated signature with the questioned signatures, the jury reasonably could have concluded that appellant signed the insurance claims and related documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\n<em>DISPOSITION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The judgment is modified to reflect that, as to each of counts 1, 3, 5, and 7, appellant was convicted of a violation of Insurance Code section 556, subdivision (a)(1). As so modified, the judgment is affirmed. The trial court is directed to forward to the Department of Corrections an amended abstract of judgment reflecting the above modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Klein, P. J., and Croskey, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 1, 2006, S139151. Chin, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-12\"> The information alleged, as to counts 1, 3, 5, and 7, that appellant committed violations of <em>Penal </em>Code former section 556, subdivision (a)(1). Appellant was convicted of those charges. Appellant concedes those allegations were erroneous and that, in 1985, the offenses were violations of <em>Insurance </em>Code section 556, subdivision (a)(1). Although appellant claims that Insurance Code section 556, subdivision (a)(1), was superseded by Penal Code section <em>550, </em>and that the latter section is the appropriate charging section, the appropriate section is the one that applied at the time of his 1985 offenses, that is, Insurance Code former section 556, subdivision (a)(1). We will modify the judgment accordingly. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 818, 826 [239 Cal.Rptr. 307, 740 P.2d 419].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\"> We use the name \u201cRodriguez\u201d <em>post </em>to refer to insurance claimant \u201cEduardo Tolentino Rodriguez,\u201d \u201cEduardo T.
