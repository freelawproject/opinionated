(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 288, subd. (a), 288.2, subd. (a).) In all five counts, his six-year-old stepdaughter B. was the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">On appeal, McCoy raises nine issues. In the published portion of our opinion, we will reject, after agreeing partly with his and partly with the Attorney General\u2019s analyses of the law, his challenge to the constitutionality of CALJIC No. 2.20.1 and, in a question of first impression, his argument that a readback of testimony to the jury over express defense objection out of his and his attorney\u2019s presence violated his federal and state constitutional rights to counsel and due process. In the nonpublished portion of our opinion, we will agree with his argument that there is an insufficiency of the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>to support the count six lewd and lascivious conviction but will decide all of his other arguments adversely to him. We will reverse the judgment on count six and will order the sentence on that count stricken from the judgment but will otherwise affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">In 1998, when B. was three, her mother J. started dating McCoy. In 1999, J. moved with B. into McCoy\u2019s bedroom in the three-bedroom house he shared with two other people. At first, B. slept in a bed in McCoy\u2019s and J.\u2019s bedroom, but after McCoy built her a room adjoining his and J.\u2019s bedroom she slept there. In September 2001, McCoy and J. got married. Testifying in his own defense, McCoy denied the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">From the testimony of B., a detective who interviewed her, and a pediatric nurse practitioner who examined her, \u201cabout five\u201d discrete incidents of criminal conduct by McCoy against B. emerged. The following sentences summarize the facts in those incidents without regard to the dates of occurrence, which are irrelevant to the issues on appeal. McCoy called her into his and J.\u2019s bedroom, where she saw him sitting naked on the floor watching a movie depicting a naked man and two naked women, one of whom wore a strap-on penis, having sex. She saw McCoy\u2019s penis was big and long and asked him, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d; he showed her he was touching his penis and told her to put her mouth there and to touch him there, and she sucked his penis and touched his penis with a cupped hand and a stroking motion. He masturbated as he lay in bed and she watched. He rubbed her vagina with his penis and had her touch her vagina and rub her vagina on his penis. Sometimes, but not always, something came out of his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">On those facts, a jury found McCoy guilty of five discrete incidents of criminal conduct against B. comprising one count of exhibiting harmful matter\u2014an adult video\u2014to a minor and four counts of committing lewd and lascivious acts\u2014placing her mouth on his penis, touching her vagina with his penis, having her touch his penis, and having her watch him masturbate\u2014on a child under the age of 14 years. The court imposed a six-year term for exhibiting the harmful matter and concurrent terms for committing the lewd and lascivious acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">1., 2.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">3. <em>CALJIC No. 2.20.1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">McCoy argues that by improperly bolstering B.\u2019s credibility CALJIC No. 2.20.1 violated his federal and state constitutional rights to confrontation, due process, jury trial, and presentation of a defense. The Attorney General argues that by not objecting below McCoy forfeited his right to appellate review and that the instruction is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Preliminarily, we turn to the Attorney General\u2019s forfeiture argument. Applying the established rule that allows appellate review, even in the absence of an objection, of any instruction affecting the substantial rights of the accused, we reject his argument. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1259; <em>People v. Brown </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 518, 539, fn. 7 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 145, 73 P.3d 1137].)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Fifteen years ago, the California Supreme Court characterized the Legislature\u2019s enactment of Penal Code section 1127f,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which mandates the instruction that CALJIC No. 2.20.1<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> now incorporates, as adopting the modern view of criminal jurisprudence that rejects traditional notions of child witnesses as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>susceptible to leading questions, incapable of recalling prior events accurately, and neither rehable nor truthful. <em>(People v. Jones </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 294, 315 [270 Cal.Rptr. 611, 792 P.2d 643].) Three subsequent Court of Appeal cases have rejected constitutional challenges to CALJIC No. 2.20.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Two of those cases arise from the Fourth Appellate District, Division Two. In the first of those cases, <em>People </em>v. <em>Harlan </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 439 [271 Cal.Rptr. 653] <em>(Harlan), </em>the court held that the instruction neither excessively inflates a child\u2019s testimony nor impermissibly usurps the jury\u2019s role as arbiter of witness credibility nor violates the accused\u2019s right to confront a child witness nor \u201crequire[s] the jury to draw any particular inferences from a child\u2019s cognitive ability, age and performance as a witness. Rather, it instructs the jury to consider such factors in evaluating a child\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 455-457.) In the second of those cases, <em>People v. Jones </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1566 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 9] <em>(Jones), </em>the court held that the instruction \u201cpresupposes that the jury must make a determination of credibility, but only after considering all the factors related to a child\u2019s testimony, including his [or her] demeanor, i.e., how he or she testifies on the stand,\u201d all without \u201c Tor\u00e9elos [ing] independent jury consideration of the credibility of a child witness.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1572, 1574.) A case from the Sixth Appellate District held that CALJIC No. 2.20.1 neither \u201c \u2018lessen[s] the government\u2019s burden of proof\u2019 \u201d nor \u201c \u2018instructs the jury to unduly inflate the testimony of a child witness\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Gilbert </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1372, 1393 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 660] <em>(Gilbert): </em>\u201cThe instruction tells the jury not to make its credibility determinations solely on the basis of the child\u2019s \u2018age and level of cognitive development,\u2019 but at the same time invites the jury to take these and all other factors surrounding the child\u2019s testimony into account. The instruction provides sound and rational guidance to the jury in assessing the credibility of a class of witnesses as to whom \u2018 \u201ctraditional assumptions\u201d \u2019 may previously have biased the factfinding process. Obviously a criminal defendant is entitled to fairness, but just as obviously he or she cannot complain of an instruction the necessary effect of which is to increase the likelihood of a fair result.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">McCoy argues that <em>\u201cHarlan, Jones, </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>were wrongly decided.\u201d He emphasizes verbiage in <em>Harlan </em>that <em>Jones </em>quoted with approval about how the word \u201cperform\u201d in CALJIC No. 2.20.1 \u201cimplies nonverbal action\u201d and about how the instruction \u201cdoes not relate to the truth or falsity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>content of the child\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1572-1573, citing <em>People v. Harlan, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.3d at p. 455.)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">First, McCoy paints with too broad a brush. <em>Gilbert </em>simply ignored the <em>Harlan/Jones </em>verbiage and cut to the chase: \u201cOur own consideration of Penal Code section 1127f and CALJIC No. 2.20.1 satisfies us that <em>Harlan </em>reached <em>the right result.\u201d (People v. Gilbert, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1393, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Second, the <em>Harlan/Jones </em>verbiage cannot withstand thoughtful analysis. By stating that a child \u201cmay perform differently than an adult\u201d \u201cbecause of age and level of <em>cognitive </em>development\u201d and defining \u201c \u2018cognitive\u2019 \u201d as \u201cthe child\u2019s ability to perceive, to understand, to remember, and to <em>communicate,\u201d </em>the instruction straightforwardly tells the jury that a child may perform differently than an adult <em>\u201cbecause of </em>\u2019 the <em>\u201clevel of </em>\u2019 his or her <em>\u201cability to .. . communicate.\u201d </em>(CALJIC <em>No. 2.20.1, </em>italics added.) The instruction expressly allows a reasonable likelihood that the jury did <em>not </em>construe the word \u201cperform\u201d to apply only to \u201cnonverbal action.\u201d (See <em>Estelle v. McGuire </em>(1991) 502 U.S. 62, 72-73 &amp; fn. 3 [116 L.Ed.2d 385, 112 S.Ct. 475], [\u201creasonable likelihood\u201d standard of review]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clair </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 663 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 828 P.2d 705] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">At oral argument, McCoy intimated that the infirmity he assigns to CALJIC No. 2.20.1 infects the new Judicial Council child witness instruction as well. (Judicial Council of Cal. Crim. Jury Instns. (2006), CALCRIM No. 330 [Testimony of Child 10 Years of Age or Younger].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) He is wrong. The <em>Harlan/Jones </em>verbiage originates entirely from case law, finds no support in CALJIC No. 2.20.1 or CALCRIM No. 330, fails to diminish the persuasiveness of the holdings in <em>Harlan </em>and <em>Jones, </em>and has no impact at all on the holding in <em>Gilbert. </em>In express reliance on the holdings in <em>Harlan, Jones, </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>alike, we squarely reject McCoy\u2019s constitutional challenges to CALJIC No. 2.20.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>4., 5.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">6. <em>The readback to the Jury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">McCoy argues that a readback of testimony to the jury over express defense objection out of his and his attorney\u2019s presence violated his federal and state constitutional rights to counsel and due process. The Attorney General argues that error, if any, was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">During deliberations, the jury sent the court a note asking for a readback of B.\u2019s testimony about watching videos with McCoy and about viewing photographs on the computer. The court granted the request, ordered the readback in the jury room, and admonished the jurors not to ask questions, not to discuss the case while the court reporters were in the jury room, and\u2014if the jurors felt something was missing\u2014to request an additional readback from the court reporters on the topics in the jury\u2019s note but otherwise to request an additional readback only from the court. McCoy objected and requested \u201cthat the reread be in open court so that we could see and hear what is being read to the jury and a record could be made of that\u201d and so that he could \u201ceither object to or ask for additions or things like that.\u201d The court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">As the United States Constitution guarantees the accused the right \u201cto have the Assistance of Counsel for his [or her] defence\u201d (U.S. Const., 6th Amend.), so the California Constitution grants to the accused the rights \u201cto have the assistance of counsel\u201d and \u201cto be personally present with counsel\u201d and requires that those rights \u201cshall be construed by the courts of this state in a manner consistent with the Constitution of the United States\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 24).  Likewise, as the United States Constitution proclaims that no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\u201d (U.S. Const., 14th Amend.), so the California Constitution declares that no person may \u201cbe deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Construing the contours generally of the constitutional rights at issue here, the United States Supreme Court has articulated the accused\u2019s right to the presence of counsel \u201cat every stage of a criminal proceeding where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>substantial rights of a criminal accused may be affected\u201d <em>(Mempa v. Rhay </em>(1967) 389 U.S. 128, 134 [19 L.Ed.2d 336, 88 S.Ct. 254]), the accused\u2019s right \u201cto be present at all [critical] stages of the [criminal prosecution] where his [or her] absence might frustrate the fairness of the proceedings\u201d <em>(Faretta v. California </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 806, 819, fn. 15 [45 L.Ed.2d 562, 95 S.Ct. 2525], citing <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts </em>(1934) 291 U.S. 97 [78 L.Ed. 674, 54 S.Ct. 330], overruled on other grounds by <em>Duncan v. Louisiana </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 145, 154-155 [20 L.Ed.2d 491, 88 S.Ct. 1444], and <em>Malloy v. Hogan </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 1, 2, fn. 1, &amp; 11 [12 L.Ed.2d 653, 84 S.Ct. 1489]), and the accused\u2019s right \u201c \u2018to be present in his own person whenever his presence has a relation, reasonably substantial, to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charge\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kentucky </em>v. <em>Stincer </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 730, 745 [96 L.Ed.2d 631, 107 S.Ct. 2658]). The high court has never held that a readback is a critical stage of trial. (See <em>La Crosse v. Keman </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 244 F.3d 702, 707-708.)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">In the absence of United States Supreme Court authority, McCoy relies on Ninth Circuit cases. (See, e.g., <em>Fisher v. Roe </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 263 F.3d 906, 913-917 (Fisher) [grant of relief after a readback in absence of and without knowledge of either accused or accused\u2019s attorney], abrogated on another ground by <em>Mancuso v. Olivarez </em>(9th Cir. 2002) 292 F.3d 939, 944, fn. 1; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(9th Cir. 1995) 63 F.3d 807, 814-815 [same], overruled on another ground, by <em>Tolbert v. Page </em>(9th Cir. 1999) 182 F.3d 677, 685.) Even on federal questions, however, Ninth Circuit cases do not bind the state courts. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Crittenden </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 120, fn. 3 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 474, 885 P.2d 887].)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Construing the contours of the constitutional rights at issue here specifically with reference to readbacks, the California Supreme Court has rebuffed several challenges akin to McCoy\u2019s. In <em>People v. Cox </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 916 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 272, 70 P.3d 277], the court noted in passing that both the accused and his attorneys waived their presence at a readback but denied relief on the ground that \u201cthe rereading of testimony is not a critical stage of the proceedings.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 963.) The court distinguished <em>Fisher </em>on the ground that neither the accused nor his attorney even knew about the readback. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In <em>People v. Horton </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1068 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 516, 906 P.2d 478], with no showing that the accused\u2019s personal presence could have assisted the defense in any way, the court held that his attorney\u2019s stipulation to a readback without his or his attorney\u2019s presence was not ineffective assistance. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1120-1121, 1127; cf. <em>People v. Ayala </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 225, 287-289 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 682, 1 P.3d 3].) \u201cThe reading back of testimony ordinarily is not an event that bears a substantial relation to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>defendant\u2019s opportunity to defend,\u201d the court observed. <em>(People v. Horton, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th. at p. 1121.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Similarly, the court held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pride </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 195 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 833 P.2d 643] that despite the absence of a personal waiver by the accused his attorney\u2019s waiver of the presence of both attorney and client at a readback did not violate the accused\u2019s federal or state constitutional rights to counsel and due process even though, as the court acknowledged, \u201cno one was present (the court, counsel, or defendant) to monitor or report the readback.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 251.) Congruently, the court held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Bloyd </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 333 [233 Cal.Rptr. 368, 729 P.2d 802] <em>(Bloyd) </em>that the accused\u2019s attorney\u2019s stipulation to the absence of attorney and client alike from a readback did not abridge the accused\u2019s federal constitutional right to counsel or state constitutional right to be present at trial even in the absence of his express consent. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 358-361.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Likewise, where the accused\u2019s attorney \u201cpurported to waive\u201d the accused\u2019s presence, \u201cvarious portions of testimony were reread to the jury,\u201d and the appellate briefing made no contention \u201cthat any other exchanges between the judge and jury, or counsel and jury, took place,\u201d the court in <em>People v. Hovey </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 543, 585 [244 Cal.Rptr. 121, 749 P.2d 776] declined to grant relief since \u201crereading of testimony ordinarily would not be an event which bears a substantial relation to the defendant\u2019s opportunity to defend, and nothing in the present record indicates that defendant\u2019s personal presence would have assisted the defense in any way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Inferring a general rule from United States Supreme Court and California Supreme Court cases, we hold by parity of reasoning, on a record not only showing that the court carefully admonished the jury before the readback but also failing to show, let alone intimate, that McCoy\u2019s or his attorney\u2019s presence during the readback could have assisted the defense in any way, that the court committed no constitutional error in allowing the readback over express defense objection.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>7.-9.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The judgment is reversed on the count six lewd and lascivious conviction. The sentence is ordered stricken from the judgment on that count. The matter is remanded with directions to the superior court to issue, and to send to every appropriate person a certified copy of, an abstract of judgment amended accordingly. McCoy has no right to be present at those proceedings. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 407-408 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610].)
