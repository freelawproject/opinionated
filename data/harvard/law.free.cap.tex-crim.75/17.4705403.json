Besides \u201ctherefore\u201d could and should be regarded as surplusage. Herrington v. State, 73 Texas Crim. Rep., 359, 166 S. W. Rep., 721, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-15\">Article 7355, Revised Civil Statutes, enacts, that there shall be levied on and collected from every person pursuing the occupations named in the following subdivisions of this article an annual occupation tax which shall be paid in advance. Subdivision 23 says: \u201cFrom every pawnbroker an annual tax of $150.\u201d Article 7357 expressly gives the Commissioners Courts of the several counties power to levy for county purposes one-half of the occupation taxes levied by the State. Article 130, Penal Code, makes it an offense for any person to pursue or follow any occupation taxed by law without first obtaining \u00e1 license therefor, the penalty prescribed being not less than the amount of taxes, nor more than double that sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-17\">The pleadings follow the statute and are in strict conformity to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>forms laid down by both Judge White and Judge Wilson in their Ann. Code Crim. Proc. So that appellant\u2019s motion to quash the pleadings because the same did not contain an allegation that the Commissioners Court of said county had duly entered an order fixing the county tax at one-half that of the State was properly overruled. The pleading did not have to allege that the order was duly entered. Nor was the pleading bad because it is claimed it only alleged conclusions. It alleged the facts. Nor did the pleading have to allege that appellant lent money, received deposits as security for the payment of loans and interest on personal property; nor the rate of interest he charged, what property he took as security, and to whom he made such -respective loans. None of this had to he alleged in the pleading. The cases cited by appellant of Crews v. State, 10 Texas Crim. App., 292, and Woolsey v. State, 14 Texas Crim. App., 57, are not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The term of the County Court at which this conviction was had, adjourned February 28, 1914. The statement of \u25a0 facts was not filed until sixty-three days later, and the bills of exception, sixty-nine days after adjournment. The State\u2019s motion to strike out and not consider them must, therefore, be sustained. Durham v. State, 69 Texas Crim. Rep., 71, 155 S. W. Rep., 222; DeFriend v. State, 69 Texas Crim. Rep., 329, 153 S. W. Rep., 881; Stephens v. State, 158 S. W. Rep., 531-2; Wilson v. State, 71 Texas Crim. Rep., 547, 160 S. W. Rep., 454; Hampton v. State, 72 Texas Crim. Rep., 189, 161 S. W. Rep., 966; Newsome v. State, 72 Texas Crim. Rep., 453, 162 S. W. Rep., 891; and a great many other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">No other question is raised which can be considered in the absence of bills of exception, or statement of facts. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b43-8\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">October 14, 1914.</p>\n<author id=\"b43-10\">PRENDERGAST, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AF9\">\u2014Appellant urges that this prosecution can not be maintained on article 130, Penal Code, and articles 7355 and 7357, Rev. Civil Stats., but if maintained at all, it must be under article 641, Penal Code. In this he is clearly wrong. Article 641, Pernal Code, is: \u201cIf any pawnbroker, or person doing any business as such, shall receive any article in pledge, or sell the same without complying with the laws regulating pawnbrokers in this State, he shall he punished by fine not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than one hundred dollars.\u201d This article was based on title 103, articles 6155 et seq. of our Revised Statutes. The Revised Statutes specifically enact what pawnbrokers shall do when they receive an article in pledge and what they shall do when they sell it and this article, 641, makes it an offense if the pawnbroker violates that law in either receiving or selling the pledged article and has no application whatever to the question of the payment of an occupation tax. That is exclusively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>regulated by the articles of the Code and Revised Civil Statutes, as shown in the original opinion.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b44-5\">[Rehearing denied October 14, 1914.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b44-3\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
