So the only question presented for review is the sufficiency of the testimony to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\">The testimony shows that J. W. Howell was manager of the O bar 0 ranch in Kent County; that a cow belonging to this company was found dead in the pasture where she had been killed by being shot. The cow was skinned and the two hind quarters taken, the remainder of the cow being left where killed. A number of witnesses testify to trailing a horse from this cow to appellant\u2019s house; the track of the horse was measured on the ground where the cow was killed, and this measurement exactly fitted the track of the left fore foot of appellant\u2019s horse. The track of a man was also measured where the cow was killed, and this measurement fitted the track made by appellant at the time of his arrest. Fresh beef was found in appellant\u2019s house, behind a wagon sheet, which witnesses swear were the hind quarters of a beef. Sheriff McCoombs testified that he measured the horse track and the man\u2019s track at the place where the cow was found; that in trailing the track to appellant\u2019s house he measured it twice more, and they were the same; that when he got to the house he says, \u201cI took the measure and raised the foot of Basberry\u2019s horse, and put the measure lengthwise to it, crosswise and across the cork. I' first measured the right fore foot of that horse, and found that the measurement lengthwise and crosswise was exactly right, but in measuring across the corks they were a little too narrow. Then I took up his left fore foot and measured it, and it was exactly correct with the measure. I do not know whether I measured the right foot or the left foot at the cow. The man\u2019s track fitted appellant\u2019s exactly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Appellant offered no explanation of his possession of this beef at the time, but on this trial some witnesses testify that appellant had been given one hind quarter of a beef, some ten days prior to the time the beef was found in his house by his brother-in-law. However, the witnesses for the State swear there was more than one hind quarter of a beef found at appellant\u2019s house, and that the beef found was fresh\u2014 not more than three or four days old at the outside. Hr. Bostick says as to the quantity of beef he found in Lee Basberry\u2019s house, that it looked to be two quarters of beef cut up in the boxes. \u201cI think there was more than one quarter.\u201d Appellant undertook to account for but one quarter ten days old, when all the witnesses say the beef found in appellant\u2019s house was only three or four days old. Hnder such circumstances we will not disturb the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AFy\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b142-6\">DAVIDS OH, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AQW\">(dissenting).\u2014I think the evidence too inconclusive and uncertain to meet the requisite rule of circumstantial evidence. The horse tracks did not.fit; at least the witnesses say one track did and the other did not. Two hind quarters were taken\u2014only one found at appellant\u2019s house, and this he proved by uncontradicted evidence was given him by his brother-in-law. The facts to render the citizen infamous ought to be more cogent than this record discloses.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
