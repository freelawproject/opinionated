The evidence would show that trouble existed because of differences growing out of the relationship of landlord and tenant, appellant being a tenant of deceased. The State\u2019s evidence would support a verdict of murder upon express malice, therefore rendering the case non-bailable. But the defendant\u2019s evidence raises the issues of self-defense and imperfect self-defense with such cogency as we think to require the court to submit those issues to the juri7, and a court can not say that a jury would not be justified in finding for the defendant on one or the other of those defenses, and under such circumstances we think the court erred - in refusing to grant appellant bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-15\">The judgment is reversed and bond fixed in tire sum of $7500.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-16\">\n<em>Bail granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
