We have carefully read and studied the evidence. It is unnecessary to recite it. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>court gave a correct charge. He also submitted everything that the evidence raised in appellant\u2019s favor. The jury decided every issue against him. In our opinion the evidence is sufficient to sustain the verdict and we would not be authorized to reverse the case on that account.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b32-5\">[Rehearing denied October 14, 1914.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b32-3\">One other question is suggested and that is that outside influences from a mob affected the jury. The record shows that the court heard evidence on that issue and decided it against appellant. We are in no way furnished with the evidence. We must presume that the court correctly decided the question. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
