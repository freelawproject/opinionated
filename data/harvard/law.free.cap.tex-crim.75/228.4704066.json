Under such circumstances, as the indictment charges the offense of which he was convicted, there is nothing presented for review. There are questions presented in the motion for new trial, which would indicate that appellant\u2019s defense was that he had purchased the pistol and was carrying it home, which issue the court did not present to the jury. But without the evidence heard on the trial, we can not say that the court erred in not doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-19\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-20\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
