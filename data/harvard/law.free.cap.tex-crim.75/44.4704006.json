Both were tried at the same time. In the opinion in the Sloan case, Judge Harper has stated the facts in both cases. The questions raised are the same in both. There is but one question we will further discuss in this in addition to its, discussion in the Sloan case, and that is, whether or not the residence wherein this gaming and gambling was done was \u201ca private residence occupied by a family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The statutes are: \u201cIf any person shall play at any game of cards . . . at any place, except in a private residence occupied by a family .. . he shall be fined,\u201d etc. P. C., 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">\u201cIf any person . . . shall go into or remain in any place where any of the games- prohibited by tbis Act are, within his knowledge, being played ... he shall be punished by fine,\u201d etc. P. C., 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">\u201cA residence may be a private residence, although it be not occupied by a family.\u201d Williams v. State, 48 Texas Crim. Rep., 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">In discussing whether two grown sons and a brother-in-law were members of a man\u2019s family under the estray statute in Goode v. State, 16 Texas Crim. App., 411, this court said: \u201cMr. Webster defines the word 'family\u2019 to mean 'the collective body of persons who live in one house, or under one head or manager or household.\u2019 Mr. Bouvier defines it to be 'all the individuals who live under the authority of another, including the servants of the family.\u2019\u201d But the court held, in effect, that neither of said persons, were members of his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-15\">Under our gaming statute this court held, in Patterson v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 393, that a bachelor living in a residence with some hired hands did not make the habitation \u201ca private residence occupied by a family.\u201d And in Robbins v. State, 57 Texas Crim. Rep., 8, held to the same effect. In McCollum v. State, 49 Texas Crim. Rep., 383, it was shown that a father lived for some time in one of his residences with two of his sons, one 17, the other 15 years old, together with Other members of his family. That some time before a game of cards was played in said residence he had gone and moved the rest of his family other than his said two sons to another of his residences, the said two sons remaining in said residence. The court held the habitation where the two sons remained was a residence, but not occupied by a family.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-16\">In Davis v. State, 68 Texas Crim. Rep., 259, it was shown Pitch and wife lived in their residence, and Davis, an unmarried man, had been staying with them. Pitch and wife went on a trip and were gone thirteen or fourteen days. Davis continued to stay at their residence while they were away, and permitted gambling therein several times during their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>absence. He was convicted for permitting property under his control to be used as a place for people to resort and gamble with cards, etc. He defended on the grounds that the place was \u201ca private residence occupied by a family,\u201d and the indictment did not negative this. This court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u201cFor the time being, it was not a private residence occupied by a famil)r, but appellant, an unmarried man, was staying there by permission at least. It would be immaterial whether he was in possession by permission or had taken possession during Mr. Fitch\u2019s absence, believing that it would be agreeable with the owner. If one should in any manner, while the family was absent, take possession of a house and permit gambling to be engaged in by all those who came to the house while he was in control of the house, and when it was shown that on five occasions during this time he permitted gambling to be carried on in the house, it would be an offense against the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">It is clear our statutes make it an offense to play a game of cards at any place, or go into or remain at any place where such game is knowingly played, unless such game is played at a private residence and that that residence at the time the game is played is occupied by a family. It is not the private residence that protects the gaming from being unlawful, but it is the fact that that residence is at the time occupied by a family,-\u2014not that some family makes it their residence, but for the time is away.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The uncontradicted evidence shows that the wife of Henry Cantrell, in whose residence the gaming occurred, had gone to her parents and been there about two weeks, and that Cantrell himself was also at her parents, having gone there the day before. \u00a1Neither of them, nor any other constituent of the family, were occupying the residence at the time of the gaming. These young men who were gaming there got permission from Cantrell to play dominoes,\u2014not to gamble with cards,\u2014 while he and his family were not occupying their residence. The length of time they were not occupying it is not decisive. They did not have to be away from and out of, and not occupying their residence, for a year, nor a month,\u2014just so they were distinctly not occupying it at the time, is all that was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Our statute makes it an offense for any person to keep a bawdy house in any house owned, occupied or controlled by him. This court, in Flynn v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 230, and Willis v. State, 34 Texas Crim. Rep., 148, under said statute, in effect, held that although one person owns the house, yet if another has possession, charge or control of it for the time being, the latter is the keeper, etc. This court, through Judge Hurt, in Stokeley v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 638, expressly held that where a man, in the absence of his wife, permitted one woman for less than half of one night to occupy his residence and have sexual intercourse with men, made the residence a bawdy house, and he was guilty of keeping it as such house.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">As stated above, these young men got possession of Cantrell\u2019s residence, while unoccupied by him and his family, under the pretext to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>play the innocent and lawful game of dominoes; but as soon as they got into it they at once converted it into a gambling house. This residence was not \u201coccupied by a family\u201d in contemplation of our statute under the facts and circumstances established in this case, so as to exempt appellant from conviction; therefore, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\n<em>Affirmed,.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
