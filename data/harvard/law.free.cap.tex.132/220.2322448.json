Davis, filed this suit against Giant Manufacturing Company, plaintiff in error, to collect a commission alleged to be owing him for the sale of forty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>floodlight projectors to the San Antonio Baseball Club. Trial with the aid of a jury resulted in a judgment for Davis for a part of the amount sued for and against the company on its cross actions. The company appealed and the Court of Civil Appeals affirmed the judgment. 91 S. W. (2d) 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\">Davis declared upon a written district sales manager contract between him and the company seeking recovery of $1200.00 claimed as the balance of a commission due him under the terms of his contract for making the sale. The aggregate catalog list price of the projectors was $8000.00 and the net price alleged by Davis to have been paid by the customer was $5200.00. The provision for compensation to the seller, in the language of the contract, is <em>\u201ca </em>commission representing the difference between forty per cent (40%) off catolog list prices and the net price paid by customer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Davis filed his suit upon the theory that the word \u201coff\u201d used in the contract means \u201cof,\u201d and that forty per cent \u201coff list price\u201d means forty per cent <em>of </em>the list price. More concretely stated Davis\u2019 claim was that he was entitled to a compensation representing the difference between forty per cent <em>of </em>$8000.00, and $5200.00; or as expressed after being mathematically calculated according to his theory, the difference between $3200.00 and $5200.00, which equals $2000.00. He admitted having been paid $800.00 and claimed a balance due of $1200.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">When the contract was offered in evidence the court sustained the company\u2019s contention that there was a variance between the contract alleged and that offered. Plaintiff amended his petition by changing the word \u201cof\u201d to \u201coff,\u201d but continued to contend that \u201cforty per cent off list price\u201d meant forty per cent <em>of </em>list price, and contended also, as did the company, that the contract was clear and unambiguous. Upon conclusion of the evidence the court submitted to the jury the question of whether under the usage or custom of the \u201cbusiness of selling on commission\u201d the expression \u201cforty per cent off the catalog prices,\u201d means forty per cent of such price. The jury answered in the affirmative. The writ was granted upon assignments complaining substantially that it was error to submit the question to a jury, for the reason that the compensation provision of the contract is clear and an affirmative finding would do violence to its plain and unambiguous language. The assignments must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">It is. evident that the expressions \u201cper cent off\u201d and \u201cper cent of\u201d have different meanings. \u201cOff\u201d might mean \u201coff of,\u201d illiterately expressed (Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>2nd. ed. p. 1689), but could not be made to mean \u201cof\u201d without doing violence to the language. The substitution of the word \u201cof\u201d for \u201coff\u201d changes its clear meaning. If a merchant should advertise for sale an article listed at the price of $1.00, at ten per cent off list price, a customer would hardly have the temerity to contend that the price to be paid by him for the article would be 10c. He would understand that the price to be paid by him as customer would be 90c, the ten per cent having been taken off. Carrying the illustration further, if the merchant\u2019s clerk was earning a compensation representing the difference between ten per cent \u201coff list price,\u201d and the price paid by the customer, his commission on the sale, under plaintiff\u2019s contention, would be 80c. The merchant would be paying a commission equal to eight-ninths of the sale price of the article in order to get it sold at a cut price. Nothing further need be said in determining the amount of compensation provided as commission in the contract sued upon except that it is a compensation representing the difference between the price calculated at \u201cforty per cent off\u201d a list price of $8000.00, and the customer\u2019s price of $5200.00. When the difference between the two prices is thus calculated, it amounts to $400.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">It appears that notwithstanding the fact that Davis grounded his cause of action upon the written contract declared upon, his own testimony discloses that the measure of compensation provided by the contract was not the measure which he claims was subsequently agreed upon for the sale in question. When asked how the commission was figured his reply was \u201cFifty and ten off the sales price.\u201d Asked by his counsel to explain, he said: \u201cFirst, fifty per cent off sales price, and ten per cent off the remaining sum, added together, making fifty and ten of (off) catalog price,\u201d adding that this \u201cwas to have been under the terms of our contract my commission in any of my sales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">It is stated in the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals that after \u201cit was decided that \u2018off\u2019 and \u2018of,\u2019 in making the sale, meant the same, the court construed and applied the contract to the facts shown by the evidence.\u201d It is further stated that \u201cwe do not think the evidence shows that the commission on the sale was agreed upon by special oral argument (agreement), as contended by the company. We cannot concur in the conclusion stated in view of the following summary of the pertinent facts and proceedings bearing upon the matter: Davis himself, after making the explanation of the basis of recovery relied upon by him, quoted above, testified in making concrete application that fifty per cent of catalog price of $8000.00 would be $4000.00 and that ten per cent off the remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>figure would be $400.00; that the two sums added would give a total commission under his contract of $4400.00. When his counsel pointed out to him that this method of computation was not according to the terms of the contract sued upon, which provides forty per cent off, he replied: \u201cMy contract with President Harding, then.\u201d He further testified that he was forced to discount this $8000.00 transaction; that he telephoned the president at Council Bluffs, Iowa, while negotiating the deal and was told by Harding to discount \u201cthe catalog price fifty and ten, deduct from that thirty-five per cent off the catalog price, and the difference $1600.00, shall be your commission. Take it or leave it.\u201d Counsel for the company objected to this testimony on the ground of variance between the contract provision for compensation and that relied upon and testified to by Davis, stating that the latter measure of compensation was not supported by any pleading. The trial court admitted the testimony over the objection urged. Shortly before the trial was concluded Davis\u2019 counsel requested the court to allow him to file a trial amendment so as to make the allegations and the proof with respect to the $1600.00 commission correspond. Upon inquiry from the court as to what he desired stated in the amendment, he said: \u201cWe want to put in it allegations which will be covered by the evidence of this morning that the parties by telephone conversation agreed that the commission in the San Antonio Baseball Club case would be $1600.00. In other words, a modification of the contract itself.\u201d After leave to amend had been granted over objection interposed by the company it procured leave to file a reply thereto. Upon reading the reply the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-3\">\u201cGentlemen, although I allowed that trial amendment and the reply to it, I see now that the allowance of both has resulted in such confusion in the issues of this case that I don\u2019t believe any court in the world could submit the issues to the jury and the jury render a verdict thereon, and, therefore, I will hear from you as to whether the Court ought not now to withdraw his leave to file.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">After argument of counsel the court struck out both the trial amendment and the reply and submitted to the jury the sole issue of whether forty per cent \u201coff\u201d and forty per cent \u201cof\u201d as used in the contract meant the same. The jury answered affirmatively and judgment was rendered in favor of Davis. It is obvious from the record stated above that the court erred both in submitting to the jury the issue referred to and in awarding judgment in Davis\u2019 favor upon testimony at variance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>with the measure of commission declared upon. As stated by Chief Justice Stayton in Morris v. Kasling, 79 Texas 141, 15 S. W. 226, 11 L. R. A. 398, \u201cone suing upon a contract must recover upon the contract alleged, or not at all.\u201d Counsel for plaintiff appears to have recognized this elementary principle in procuring leave to file the trial amendment which was subsequently struck out' over his protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The Court of Civil Appeals also held that the trial court did not err in dismissing without prejudice the company\u2019s cross actions. The holding was predicated upon alleged defective pleadings. In view of the necessity of reversing and remanding the case for the errors pointed out, and the further fact that the pleadings upon another trial will doubtless be amended, it is unnecessary to discuss the assignments relating to the dismissal of the cross actions or any of the remaining assignments. Whether the company will desire to set up a cross action to the cause of action as repleaded, or what the allegations will be upon another trial, cannot be definitely known at this time. It is therefore not practicable to pass upon the other assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The motion of Davis to dismiss the application for writ of error is denied. The defects in the application pointed out in the motion are that if \u201cone looks to the place directed by the application as supporting the presentation in this Court of any particular assignment of error, he finds that the \u2018assignment of error\u2019 thus referred to in the record\u201d is not the one recited in the application. In other words the record references given in connection with the assignment are incorrect. There are assignments in the application however of which this Court has jurisdiction other than those upon which the writ was granted. Since jurisdiction had already been .taken when the motion to dismiss was filed it was thereby extended to all questions of law presented. Moore v. Davis (Com. App.), 27 S. W. (2d) 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Plaintiff in error alleges in its application that all \u201cthe errors * * * assigned * * * were duly assigned and presented in appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing * * * in the Court of Civil Appeals, which was * * * overruled * * It is not alleged in the motion to dismiss that none of the assignments presenting questions of law embody matters complained of in the complaints set up in the motion for rehearing in the Court of Civil Appeals, but the incorrectness of references to the record is alleged and relied upon mainly. In view of the fact that it is not alleged and pointed out that none of the assignments in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>application are predicated upon grounds urged as a basis of complaint in the motion for rehearing in the Court of Civil Appeals, the incorrectness of the references becomes at this time immaterial. The application is highly defective, but in the motion to dismiss no jurisdictional defect is pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\">The judgments of the trial court and Court of Civil Appeals are reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Opinion adopted by the Supreme Court November 30, 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">- Rehearing overruled January 11, 1939.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
