Elwert, Jr., Lillie Elwert, George Elwert and Eliza Elwert, and the residue of her estate to her four children, one-fourth each to Bertha E. Weniger, Sarah A. Maisch and Max B.

Elwert, in equal third parts or shares, share and share alike, absolutely and forever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\">On February 6, 1894, Theodore H. Elwert gave his mother a promissory note under seal for $775. Under date of February 18, 1897, there was a credit indorsed on the note of $125.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-6\">The auditing judge, Dallett, P. J., found as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-7\">The question for determination is whether the balance due upon this note, together with interest thereon, is to be charged against the distributive share of Theodore H. Elwert.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-8\">The note is dated February 6, 1894, the credit on account is dated February 18, 1897. The testatrix\u2019s will was executed on July 17, 1907. She died on February 17, 1909.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-9\">The balance of principal for distribution after payment of the testatrix\u2019s pecuniary legacies and composed of both personal and real estate is $7,176.20.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-10\">The balance due upon this note at the date of testatrix\u2019s death, figuring interest from the date on which the payment was made on account was approximately $1,118.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-11\">If this were added to the balance of principal shown by the account, $7,176.20, the total would be $8,294.20\u2014 one-fourth of which would be $2,073.55. The interest derived from this fund after the payment of the costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>of administration, taking into consideration the fact that the $1,118 would only earn income after it had been paid, would amount to less than $100 per annum, of which under Baily\u2019s Est., 153 Pa. 402, and Neel\u2019s Est. No. 1, 207 Pa. 443, $39.00 per annum would be applied as interest on the indebtedness of $650, and perhaps $60.00 a year on account of the indebtedness of $1,118, so that it would be many years before Theodore H. Elwert would receive any benefit under the will, unless the trustee desired to pay him the principal as to which he has the right to exercise his discretion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-6\">A legacy by a testator to his debtor does not operate as a release or extinguishment of his debt unless it clearly appears that it was the intention of the testator that it' should operate: Sharp v. Wightman, 205 Pa. 285.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-7\">This is undoubtedly the rule, and unless an intention is to be found from this testatrix\u2019s will, or after the introduction of extrinsic evidence, the debt must be charged against the interest of Theodore H. Elwert, and therefore being a gift over of the principal at the death of Theodore H. Elwert under the authorities hereinbefore cited charged against income.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-8\">The testatrix\u2019s words are that \u201cIn no manner nor under any circumstances is either the principal or income so held in trust as aforesaid, to be liable for the present,\u2019 past, or future debts, defaults, contracts, engagements or obligations of my said son, Theodore H. Elwert, during the continuance of the trust hereby and herein created.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-9\">On the back of the check where the credit for $125 appears under date of February 18, 1897, there also appears the memorandum \u201cSame credit as note of T. Elwert for $1,154, dated 11/9/96 (see note).\u201d There was another note, and if so, was it paid or destroyed?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-10\">And ten years elapsed between the date of this credit and the date of testatrix\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-11\">Taking into consideration the testatrix\u2019s words, the probable existence of a later and forgotten indebtedness, the number of years that elapsed between the date of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>credit and the date of testatrix\u2019s will and the actual situation which would result, were the debt held to be due, by the son, the auditing judge must conclude that the testatrix when she wrote her will did not have in mind the payment of any indebtedness by her son, Theodore H. Elwert, and that if such indebtedness did exist, she intended when she directed that the share held in trust for that son should be both as to principal and income free from liability for \u201cpresent, past or future debts\u201d to include the debt owing by him to her. It is reasonable to believe, in view of her reference to debts that had she had any other intention in mind, she would have referred in some way to this particular indebtedness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-3\">On exceptions Anderson, J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-4\">This is a close case. The ordinary rule as stated in Sharp v. Wightman, 205 Pa. 285, is that a legacy by a testator to his debtor does not operate as a release .or extinguishment of the debt, unless it clearly appears that it was the intention of the testator that it should so operate. And in that case, which was a spendthrift trust, it was held that the provision against liability for the legatee\u2019s present or future debts, contracts or engagements, had the effect of raising a doubt, which might be resolved by extrinsic evidence as to the intention of the testator in reference thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-5\">In Neel\u2019s Estate, 207 Pa. 443, where the testator created a trust to pay one-fifth of two-thirds of the income of his estate to his son during the life of testator\u2019s widow, and the whole after her death, and after the death of the son the principal out of which the one-fifth income arose to the son\u2019s issue, then living, and where the testator after the making of the will paid his son various sums of money amounting in the aggregate to $4,100, and took his notes therefor, it was held that the clause in the will absolving the son\u2019s share from his debts or liabilities did not apply to the obligation taken for money paid the same subsequent to the making of the will, but that repayment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>such moneys should be made out of the income of the cestui que trust, and not out of the principal of the fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-4\">In the present case we have no testimony as to the intention of the testatrix. We are therefore confined to the four corners of the will. But, as said in Hermann\u2019s Estate, 220 Pa. 52, \u201cWhen we come to consider it (the will) and interpret its meaning, we must do so in the light of all the circumstances by which it was surrounded when he made it, and by which he was probably influenced: Stambaugh\u2019s Estate, 135 Pa. 585. 'It has been long and well settled, and indeed it is a principle so cognizant to reason that the only wonder is it should ever have been questioned; that all the surrounding circumstances of the testator\u2014his family, the amount and character of his property\u2014may and ought to be taken into consideration in giving a construction to the provisions of his will: Postelthwaite\u2019s Appeal, 68 Pa. 477.\u2019\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-5\">The present case differs from Neel\u2019s Estate in this, that no money was paid after the date of the will; it had been given long prior thereto; and the payment, therefore, cannot be construed as an advance on account of the legacy. It is true that in the English case cited by exceptant, Wilmot v. Woodhouse, 4 Bro. C. C. 227, the debt was long overdue as here, and that the chancellor held that the mere fact that the testator recited that he had already given certain moneys to the legatee as a reason why he did not give her, his daughter-in-law, as much as he gave to his children did not manifest an intention to release, the debt; that it could not be presumed that he meant to release it for he kept the note.uncanceled in his possession, and that if he forgot it, there was an utter absence of intention with respect to it. With all due deference to the learned chancellor, the writer cannot follow his reasoning; at all events the ease is not a binding authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">Here was a debt created long before the making of the will, a debt of a partnership, of which the cestui que trust was a member, and therefore debt of his copartner as well as himself, and but for the fact that the note was under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>seal, would be outlawed by the statute of limitations. It may be and probably was on account of his debts incurred as a partner that the testatrix placed her son\u2019s share in trust, as well as on account of debts in his transaction, instead of giving it to him outright as in the case of her other children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-3\">As pointed out by the auditing judge, the balance shown by the account is about $7,000, and there is nothing to show that the circumstances of the testatrix had changed since the making of her will. The note of Theodore H. Elwert, with interest, amounts to over $1,000. If this were added to the balance for distribution, the share to be held in trust for Theodore would be about $2,000, and if we were to apply the rule adopted in Neel\u2019s Estate, he would not receive any income from his legacy for many years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-4\">Ik can hardly be supposed that the testatrix intended her son to remain without income for this length of time when she so emphatically provided that \u201cin no manner or under any circumstance is either the principal or income so held in trust as aforesaid to be liable for the present, past or future debts, contracts, engagements or 'obligations of my said son, Theodore H. Elwert, during the continuation of the trust hereby and herein created.\u201d But for the rule cited in Sharp v. Wightman, there could have been no doubt of the meaning of this will, and it seems to us that sufficient appears in the will and in the circumstances of testatrix to show her intention that the rule cited in Sharp v. Wightman should not apply. The exceptions. are dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in dismissing exceptions to adjudication.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-6\"><em>Jacob </em>Weinstein, with him <em>George Be B.

The opinions filed by the learned auditing judge and court in banc fairly meet and dispose of every material question involved. Due recognition is given to what Chief Justice Gibson in Zeigler v. Eckert, 6 Pa. 13, calls \u201cthe legal presumption of an intention not to discharge a debt which arises from a naked legacy to the debtor.\u201d It is upon this presumption the appellant must rely. But it is clearly pointed out in Sharp v. Wightman, 205 Pa. 285, that where a testator makes a gift of the net income of a fund or property, and especially where it is provided, as in this case, that \u201cin no manner or any circumstances is the .... income so held in trust to be liable for the present, past or future debts\u201d of the legatee, the presumption just referred to, if not entirely destroyed, is so far weakened that recourse may be had to extrinsic evidence to enable the court to determine the real intent of the testator in the premises. The record shows that an opportunity to furnish such proof was given to the present appellant but none was offered. The learned auditing judge therefore, in the absence of other evidence, rightfully took cognizance of the facts disclosed by the adjudication. From these it appeared that the estate of the testatrix was small; that by reason of financial reverses or otherwise one of her sons needed the protection of a spendthrift trust for any bequest she might make in his favor, and that her will clearly disclosed an intention on her part to make some provision by way of income to aid him.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">From these facts the conclusion was accordingly deduced that in the present case the beneficent intention of the testatrix would be practically nullified were the legatee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>to have charged even against his income the amount, debt and interest, of a note he had given to his mother long before her will was made. It is also pointed out that by reason of the fact just stated the present case is clearly distinguishable from Neel\u2019s Estate, 207 Pa. 443. All of these questions, and they are the vital and controlling ones in this case, are clearly and more elaborately discussed in the opinion of the learned court in banc. We are of opinion that the conclusion there reached was correct, and we accordingly affirm the decree that was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
