It is not entitled in any Court, was irregularly filed in the Police Court, and cannot be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The defendant in his affidavit says <em>\u201c </em>he was arrested in Honolulu at about seven o\u2019clock p. m. on the 6th December, 1888, on th\u00e9 charge of having opium unlawfully in his possession, together with Aug Gau. That he has not been in this country very long, and does not speak or understand the native or English language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The affidavit, after stating a conversation between the defendant and Aug Gau, wherein it was arranged that the defendant should plead guilty in order that Aug Gau might have a chance of being discharged, states: \u201cThat just before the above conversation with said Aug Gau deponent was asked by one of the policemen who arrested him, whose name is unknown to deponent, but whom deponent can identify, to pay him ten dollars, and that deponent would be discharged. That deponent took from his pocket ten dollars in U. S. gold coin, and the said policeman took it rather forcibly from deponent, who was rather reluctant to part with his money; but as the said policeman said that he (deponent) would get off, deponent did not further object to the taking of the money. That the case came on for hearing the seventh instant, and deponent replying upon and believing the statements of said policeman to deponent, that deponent would be discharged from said charge, or that at most he would only receive a money fine with three or four days at most imprisonment,'did not employ counsel for his defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In no part of the affidavit does the defendant affirm his innocence of the charge ; neither does he allege that the policeman' induced him to plead guilty, but, on the contrary, he was to be discharged entirely on payment of the alleged bribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The Court cannot refrain from expressing its surprise that a practitioner of the Court should .prepare and allow his client to swear to an affidavit, in one part of which the deponent states that he \"does not speak or understand the English or native <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>language; and in another part details an offer made by a policeman (a native) on payment of ten dollars to discharge him, or procure his discharge.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AM6\"><em>J.
