The house was worth but little over $100. The insurance company knew that such a house commanded poor tenants. There is no dispute, the tenant paid the rent to JSTovemher 1st; that the tenant was in jail for a failure to pay a fine for assault and battery ; that his wife remained in the house until two weeks or less before the fire. She took the child to her parents intending to return to the house. She says she left Tracey\u2019s effects in the house when she went away, but left the key with him, or his legal custodian, the Sheriff. Tracey left his effects in the house. It is true they were very poor people, and their goods were of but little value, but such as they were he kept them in this house, and the proof shows the house was occupied. Two juries pass on this question o'f fact, and it is matter purely for tlie jury, and the court can not say that the jury was not warranted in so finding.</p> <opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b590-5\" pgmap=\"590\">Lacey, J.</author> <p id=\"AD6D\" pgmap=\"590\">This was a suit commenced by appellee against appellant before a Justice of the Peace, and from there appealed to the Circuit Court, and finally, after one verdict had been set aside and a second one resulting in appellee\u2019s favor and damages assessed at $108.88, the court overruled a motion for a new trial and rendered judgment in favor of appellee, and from this judgment this appeal is taken.</p> <p id=\"b590-6\" pgmap=\"590(192) 591(174)\">The main defense was made under the following clause in the insurance policy, to wit: \u201c If without the written consent of the company indorsed on the policy such dwelling house shall cease to be occupied as a dwelling, then so long as said dwelling house shall be so unoccupied, this policy shall be void and of no force or effect.\u201d The house insured was a dwelling house, and insured by appellee as the guardian of Frank Hasney, a boy eleven years old, who was the owner of the house and lot in question. The house was totally destroyed by fire about 10 o\u2019clock at night, October 15, 1884, and was worth over $100. The evidence is that the dwelling house so insured had been occupied by a tenant, one H. M. Tracey and wife, until two weeks before the last day of July immediately preceding the time it was consumed by fire. On the last day of July H. M. Tracey became involved in some trouble and was fined one dollar, and sent to the county jail, and remained there until October 24th following the fire. Mrs. Traccy, the wife of H. M. Tracey, continued to occupy the dwelling until about two weeks previous to the fire, when she left the house and went to Mattoon, Illinois, and hired out as a servant to do general housework. Upon leaving she sold all the furniture and household goods, except one old cupboard she made herself, locked the door, and gave the door-key to one Uickols, to hand to the Sheriff for her husband. PTo other occupant was in the house till the time of the fire. It may be she intended to return to the house at some indefinite time. It is quite clear that this house was not occupied as a dwelling. But appellee contends the evidence brings the case within the rule announced in the case of Phoenix Ins. Co. v. Tucker, 92 Ill. 64. We do not think it falls within the rule announced in that case, but rather within the rule announced in the case of the American Ins. Co. v. Padfield, 78 Ill. 167.</p> <p id=\"b591-5\" pgmap=\"591\">\u201c The clause in the policy should not be construed to mean a constructive, but an actual occupation.\u201d We therefore think the verdict was manifestly against the weight of the evidence. So holding it is not necessary to notice any of the other objections raised. Because the verdict is greatly contrary to the weight of the evidence, the judgment is reversed.</p> <p id=\"b591-6\" pgmap=\"591\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
