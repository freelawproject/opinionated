By the third instruction the jury are told to find the defendant guilty if they found from the evidence that by.the dam or slaslnboards the waters of the lake were raised and elevated above their natural and usual height during the summer months of the year. By the fifth instruction the jury are told, by the court, that they should find the defendant guilty, if from the evidence they found that by his act he had maintained the waters of said lake above their natural and usual height during any summer month during the last four years. This does not naturally or necessarily refer to a raising during the summer months of the lake above its natural and usual height. Such is not the ordinary significance to be derived from language so arranged. But obviously it lays down a different rale as to the rights of the defendant from that laid down in the defendant\u2019s instructions, and hence in conflict with it. The fifth instruction so reads as to manifestly limit the height to which the defendant must confine the water to the minimum height in summer, which, as shown by the evidence, is at a low stage of water. At such stage the water did not flow out of the lake through its outlet, and off by the natural stream or water-course leading from it to Fox Biver. And yet, the defendant, under the law and the defendant\u2019s instructions, had the right to leave the lake up and keep it up to the very point where the lake waters would flow out through its natural outlet, and away over his soil.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aai\" pgmap=\"474\">We claim that the instructions complained of took from the defendant below the exercise of a natural right that belonged to him as a riparian owner; namely, of keeping his hanks and consequently the lake at the height which nature fixed, and that the instructions in effect stated that if the water exceeded the level during any of the summer months, when the water was low in the lake, the defendant was liable for any damage resulting therefrom, even though the level at which he kept the lake in these months was not as high as the natural level of the lake when it flowed through its natural outlet and ran away in a well defined channel through the water-course called Crystal Lake outlet.

Dawson, 1 Gil. 544.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0vP\" pgmap=\"474(20) 475(86)\">The jury could not correctly decide which set of instructions was correct and which erroneous. That they were in flat conflict with each other was obvious, and it was error to so instruct the jury, for which, if for no other reason, we respectfully insist the judgment must be reversed. Ill.

The plaintiff has no claim upon any one to lower the water in Crystal Lake by artificial means, to thereby create ,a receptacle for the waters proceeding from his wet marshy lands through artificial ditches.

The lands of appellee claimed to have been injured comprise about fortv-iive acres of a farm of about two hundred acres lying and bordering on the north shore of said lake. This lake is about one and three quarter miles east and west and about three fourths of a mile north and south. A portion of this farm has a lake shore front on the north of about three quarters of a mile. This forty-five acres claimed to have been injured is separated from the lake by a ridge of loose sand, gravel and pebble stones, some three feet in height. The outlet of the lake is situated at its.southeast corner. The appellee had a ditch on liis lands from the lake, connecting with his forty-five acres. The appellant was the owner of all the lands bordering upon and around the lake, except that owned by the appellee and a small piece of land owned by James Crow, near the northeast corner of said lake. The declaration contains two counts. The first count avers that the appellant \u201c wrongfully stopped up, dammed up, obstructed, raised and elevated said waters of said Crystal Lake, and then and there and thereof, and by reason thereof, from thence, during all the time aforesaid, unjustly and wrongfully made and caused to be made and kept and continued, and still doth make, keep, cause and continue, large quantities of the said waters of said Crystal Lake to run and flow to, into, upon and over the said messuage, lands and premises of the said plaintiff, and thereof unlawfully, unjustly and wrongfully, by means thereof, greatly injured the plaintiff,\u201d etc. The second count avers that the appellant \u201c doth cause, procure and continue largo quantities of water to run upon, into and over, and to flow upon and into the lands of the plaintiff.\u201d It is first insisted by the learned counsel for the appellan t \u201c that the proofs made do not agree with the case alleged, and do not support it.\u201d If this position is true, then no recovery could be sustained in this action. Under the well established rule of pleading, the plaintiff must in his declaration clearly state the nature of the defendant\u2019s liability, and that liability must be proved as laid. We have carefully examined the record in this case, and while we find a sharp conflict in the evidence, we are not prepared to say that the proof does not sustain the declaration. We do not deem it necessary to refer to the testimony in detail. The evidence for the appellee tended strongly to prove that the placing of the flash hoards by the appellant, in 1877, at the natural outlet of said lake, had caused the waters in said lake to rise some two feet higher than it was prior thereto; that the lands claimed to have been overflowed had, prior to the placing of the flash boards, been dry and could be cultivated, and that since they were placed at the outlet the waters of said lake had flowed to, over and upon the said land of appellee, causing said land to be overflowed and rendered worthless for crops. There was also evidence for the appellee tending to prove that the placing of the flash boards by the appellant at the outlet of said lake had caused the waters in said lake to rise some two feet higher, and thereby had impeded, dammed and 'stopped the flow of the water from appellee\u2019s ditch into said lake, and had caused the same to flow back to, on and over the appellee\u2019s lands, thereby causing said lands to be overflowed. The evidence for the appellant tended to prove that the placing of the flash boards did not cause the waters in said lake to rise higher; that the escape of the waters from said lake had not been impeded, and that no water from said lake had flowed to, over and upon the lands of appellee, and that the escape of the water through the ditch of the appellee into the lake was not dammed, stopped or impeded by the placing of the flash boards. In this conflict of evidence the Supreme Court has uniformly held, \u201c that the verdict will not be disturbed on the ground the verdict is against the evidence, where there is enough to support the finding.\u201d In such a case the court will not attempt to nicely weigh the evidence on each side, and will only grant a new trial when the verdict is manifestly against the evidence. White v. Clayes, 32 Ill. 325; Tolman v. Race, 36 Ill. 472; Umlauf v. Bassett, 38 Ill. 96; Harbison v. Shook, 41 Ill. 141; Stickle v. Otto, 86 Ill. 161; Addems v. Suver, 89 Ill. 482; Howett v. Estelle, 92 Ill. 218. There was no question as to the placing of the flash boards by the appellant at the outlet of said lake, but whether the waters of said lake were raised thereby and caused to flow from and over the lands of appellee from said lake, or whether the water from the ditch of the appellee was impeded, dammed and stopped, and caused to flow back to, on and over appellee\u2019s, lands in consequence of the placing of said flash boards, were all questions of fact. It was the province of the jury to find the facts and to determine the weight and credit to be given to the testimony. Bishop v. Busse, 69 Ill. 403. The objection to the 3d and 5th instructions given for appellee is not well taken. All of the controverted questions arising in the case were by these instructions clearly submitted to the jury. The fixing of the time at the summer months as to the height of the waters in said lake, prior to the placing of the flash boards, was correct. The question-for the jury to determine was so stated, supra. We find no error in the law as given. Substantial justice has been done.</p> <p id=\"b478-4\" pgmap=\"478\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
