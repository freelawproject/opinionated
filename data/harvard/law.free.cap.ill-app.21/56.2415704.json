A plaintiff can not recover more than he claims, and if he takes judgment for more it is error. Brown v. Phillips, 6 Ill. App. 250 ; T., P. &amp; W. R. R. Co. v. Pence, 71 Ill. 274 ; Bidgely v.

Snider, Breese, 336.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-5\" pgmap=\"53\">In the note or agreement sued on there is a provision for the allowance of $10 attorney\u2019s fee. It was error to include this sum in the verdict and judgment. Byers v. Nat. Bank, 85 Ill. 423 ; Dowty v. Holtz, 85 Ill. 525; Easter v. Boyd, 79 Ill. 355 ; Clark v. Morgan, 13 Ill.

If it did good work, or was absolutely accepted, the defendant was liable. On both these points the evidence was conflicting, and the instructions were not strictly consistent; but on the whole we think the jury could not have been misled, and perceive no sufficient reason for disturbing their finding for plaintiff.</p> <p id=\"b53-9\" pgmap=\"53\">, The amount, however, improperly included ten dollars for an attorney fee (for which the note provided if not paid when due and suit should be brought thereon) which appellee here remitted by leave of this court. The judgment will be affirmed for $165.48.</p> <p id=\"b53-10\" pgmap=\"53\">Judgment affirmed,.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
