In an action to recover damages resulting from injuries to a colt, while lawfully in the pasture of a third person, caused by the defendant\u2019s dog, which he had unlawfully taken within the pasture, it is held: That the defendant is liable for any injury done by the dog; that no averment that he had previous notice of a vicious disposition in the dog was necessary, and that the declaration, being in an action on the case, was substantially good.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b201-7\" pgmap=\"201\">2.

Van Leuven v. Lyke, 1 N. Y. 515.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-13\" pgmap=\"201(13) 202(79)\">The gist of the action of trespass to realty is the injury to the possession, and to maintain it the plaintiff must have an interest, however temporary, in the soil itself or its profits, and if the premises be occupied, plaintiff must also have, as against one other than a tenant in common, actual and exclusive possession of the premises. Smith v. Wunderlich, 70 Ill. 426 ; St. L., V. &amp; T. H. R. R. Co. v. Town of Summit, 3 Ill. App. 255 ; Dean v.

(16 Am. Ed.), bottom page 123 and note (u 3).</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-6\" pgmap=\"202\">If the owner act illegally, as by trespassing with his dog', he will be liable, although the dog did the injury complained of against his will. 1 Chitty on P., bottom page, 123, note (x); Beckwith v. Shoredyke, Burr, 2092 ; 9 Ballou\u2019s Abr., 486 ; Deane v. Clayton, 7 Taunt. 516.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-7\" pgmap=\"202\">If the master accompany the dog, himself a trespasser, the damage done by the dog is deemed consequential upon the wrongful action of the master, and renders the master liable to the same extent that it would had he done the damage with his own hand. 1 Addison on Torts, Sec. 381.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-8\" pgmap=\"202\">And it is no defense to say the title of the locus vn quo, in which the alleged tortious acts took place, is in one other than the plaintiff, unless the defendant shall justify by showing authority from such other person to enter the premises, Finch v. Alston, 23 Am'.-Dee. 299.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-9\" pgmap=\"202\">When a dog, not known to be vicious, enters alone upon land and does mischief, his owner is not liable ; but if the dog accompany his owner, while the latter is trespassing, and does mischief, though against the will of the owner, the trespasser will be liable for the damage done by his dog. Wolf v. Chalker, 31 Conn. 128 ; 49 Am. Dec. 256.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-10\" pgmap=\"202\">And many of the cases go further. Where a dog entered the land of another and killed a cow, though the owner had no previous knowledge of the malicious character of the dog, he was held to be liable for the damages. Chunot v.

Rep. 667.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-4\" pgmap=\"203\">Where defendant\u2019s animals are unlawfully and as trespassers in the close of another, their owner is liable for all damages or injuries they commit, whether he had previous notice of their tendency to commit the harm or injury complained of or not. Hor need it be alleged or proved that the owner or keeper of such animals had any previous notice of their vicious disposition, or that they had previously shown such disposition. Angus v.

Beckwith v. Shoredyke, 4 Burr, 2092; 49 Am. Dec. 257.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-6\" pgmap=\"203\">He who has the care, custody or control of trespassing animals is liable for all the damage they may occasion.

Goodman v. Gay, 15 Pa. St. 188; Dicker v. Goodman, 44 Me. 322; 1 Addison on Torts Sec. 381; 1 Chitty\u2019s Pl., side paging, 82.</p> <p id=\"b204-8\" pgmap=\"204\">We think the demurrer was properly overruled. The declaration was substantially good, not in trespass to personal property, or to real estate, but in an action on the case, which was the proper form of action; hence the authorities cited by appellants upon the question of trespass to real estate have no application. Some of the questions asked the witnesses upon the assessment of damages are not entirely free from error, but we do not think they worked any injury to appellants, and we do not therefore notice them in detail.</p> <p id=\"b204-9\" pgmap=\"204\">Upon the question of the value of the colt, we think the evidence was sufficient to justify the finding of the jury, and the judgment of the Circuit Court will therefore be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b204-10\" pgmap=\"204\">Affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
