M\u2019Clure, 36 Ill. 77.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-8\" pgmap=\"197\">Each of these cases was decided upon peculiar facts which do not seem similar to the facts of the present case, and they fall far short of showing, by decision or principle, that a court can refuse a trial because the defendant and his attorney file their affidavits that the subject-matter of the suit has been paid or settled.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-9\" pgmap=\"197\">Messrs.

In this case a written order of the plaintiff was filed dismissing the suit, which the court carried into effect by dismissing it.</p> <p id=\"b197-13\" pgmap=\"197\">There was no proof to impeach the validity and good faith of the order of dismissal. The court would not try such a \u25a0 question, if contended, by affidavits, nor by such a mode of inquiry determine the validity of the settlement; but the instrument not being impeached would properly carry it out and dismiss the suit, which was in this case done, and, as we think, properly.</p> <p id=\"b197-15\" pgmap=\"197\">Affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
