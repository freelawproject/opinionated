In an action against a railroad company to recover damages for the killing of four horses, in which the question involved is, whether the injury was caused by the defective condition of a-gate at a farm crossing, this court, upon a review of the evidence, sustains a verdict for the plaintiff.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b238-15\" pgmap=\"238\">2. The fact that the trial court permitted the plaintiff and another witness to be recalled, after the defendant had rested, to testify as to the coiti dition of the gate, on the Saturday before the trial, is not a sufficient ground for a reversal, the evidence not being especially harmful and the time of its introduction being within the discretion of the court.</headnotes><decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b238-16\" pgmap=\"238\">[Opinion filed August 26, 1886.]</decisiondate><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-17\" pgmap=\"238\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Vermilion County; the Hon.

This was an action on the case for damages which the appellee claims to have sustained by the killing of fcmr horses. During the night preceding the 8th of August, 1884, the four horses in question belonging to the appellee, owing to some defect in the fence surrounding the premises in which they were pasturing, got out into the public road, went east about a quarter of a mile along said public road and beyond the place where the railroad crossed the same, where they, by some means, got.into the inclosed-premises of George Evans lying east of the railroad track, and immediately west of said highway; which\" was, and had been, used that summer for the purpose of raising grain, hay,- etc., but in which no stock was then kept. After getting into this inclosure the horses seem to have passed in a southwest direction until they found their way to a farm crossing wholly within the inclosed premises of said Evans, and passing through the gate on the east side of said crossing, they succeeded in getting upon the railroad company\u2019s right of way where they were killed by a train going north, about one o\u2019clock in the morning.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-5\" pgmap=\"239\">The declaration counts upon the statutory liability of the appellant for failing to properly fence its tracks, and also upon the common law liability on account of negligence in the manner of running its trains.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-6\" pgmap=\"239\">Plea of general issue; trial by jury, verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, for 8600, from which defendant appeals.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b239-7\" pgmap=\"239\">Mr. William Armstrong, for appellant.</attorneys><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-8\" pgmap=\"239\">It was absolutely essential, in order to entitle the plaintiff to a verdict, that he should prove a state.of facts which would render the. defendant liable under the statute for failing to erect or maintain a suitable fence and gate-at the farm crossing, in question and that the failure so to do was the proximate cause of the horses getting upon the track; or that the defendant\u2019s agents were guilty of negligence in the manner of running of the train after they had discovered the horses upon the track. \u25a0 \u25a0</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-9\" pgmap=\"239\">Where there is evidence of contributory negligence it is error to instruct the jury that if they found the fence was defective the company was liable.

Seirer, 60 Ill. 295.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-10\" pgmap=\"239(11) 240(47)\">The law of this State does not require railroad companies to fence their track against breachy horses. All that is required is that they shall fence against stock that ordinarily come in contact with their fences. The word breachy hardly admits of comparison and a breachy animal is not one against which railroads are required to fence.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-4\" pgmap=\"240\">Mr. G.
