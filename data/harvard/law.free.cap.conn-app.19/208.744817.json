After a trial, the court rendered judgment for the plaintiff in part. The court enjoined the defendant from depositing any further fill within twenty-five feet of the wetlands, but refused to order the defendant to abate the violation. The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in denying him complete injunctive relief. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">After a trial and an inspection of the defendant\u2019s property, the trial court found the following facts. The defendant has owned a parcel of property in Milford since 1955. His residence is located on a portion of that property, which is contiguous to the portion on which the landfill is located. The portion of the property supporting the defendant\u2019s residence is level; it then drops off for approximately twenty-five feet to create a forty-five degree slope. At the bottom of the slope the land is level. The watercourse, a brook, is located on this lower level. For several years, the defendant has deposited, with the town\u2019s knowledge, fill and debris, including broken asphalt, concrete, used tires and other substances not readily identifiable, on the slope. Over the past decade, the plaintiff has been in contact with the defendant and has advised him that the Milford zoning regulations require a permit to fill land within twenty-five feet of a designated wetlands area.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In June, 1986, a city official conducted an inspection of the defendant\u2019s property. The inspection revealed that the defendant was depositing fill within twenty-five feet of a designated wetlands area in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the town\u2019s zoning regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant admitted that he filled the area in question and did not obtain a permit. On June 18, 1986, the plaintiff notified the defendant that the landfill was a violation of the town zoning laws and ordered him to contact the city planner within three business days. The defendant failed to correct the violations and the plaintiff brought the present action for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s request for a permanent injunction to enjoin the defendant from continuing to deposit debris within twenty feet of the wetlands area. With respect to the plaintiff's request that the defendant be required to abate the violation, however, the trial court found that the plaintiff had presented no evidence to prove the date when the defendant began filling the area, nor did he establish where, or to what point on the land, the defendant had filled. The trial court reasoned that, absent such evidence, any order related to abating the violation would be unenforceable because it could neither determine the effective dates of the statutes and ordinances upon which the plaintiff relied nor determine the point at which removal of the fill would begin and end.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Although the plaintiff recognizes that the trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny an injunction to enforce zoning regulations is discretionary and will not be revised absent a clear abuse of discretion; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Murzyn, </em>1 Conn. App. 176, 183, 469 A.2d 1227, cert. denied, 192 Conn. 802, 471 A.2d 244 (1984); he argues that this case presents a situation in which \u201c \u2018the only reasonable conclusion is that the plaintiff is, in equity, entitled to an injunction.\u2019 <em>Dimmock </em>v. <em>New London, </em>157 Conn. 9, 19, 245 A.2d 569 (1968); <em>Hammerberg </em>v. <em>Leinert, </em>[132 Conn. 596, 604, 46 A.2d 460 (1946)].\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Murzyn, </em>supra. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">A decision to grant or deny an injunction must be compatible with the equities in the case which include \u201cthe gravity and wilfulness of the violation, as well as the potential harm to the defendants.\u201d Id. Our review is limited to whether the trial court abused its discretion. See <em>Emhart Industries Inc. </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Local Union 376 UAW, </em>190 Conn. 371, 406, 461 A.2d 422 (1983). The trial court\u2019s memorandum clearly indicated that it undertook a process of weighing the equities in this case. We have examined the record and the plaintiff\u2019s claims and conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision not to order the defendant to abate the violation was within its discretionary authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The record reveals that over the past decade the parties have been in contact with one another and the plaintiff was aware of the defendant\u2019s activities on his property. According to the defendant, persons other than the defendant were permitted to fill the area. There was no evidence presented by the plaintiff as to when the defendant began depositing debris on the slope or at what point on the property the fill attributable to the defendant began and ended. The plaintiff\u2019s expert testified that the debris was placed within twenty-five feet of a wetlands area, but could not state how long the fill had been there.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>On the basis of this record, it was not unreasonable for the court to deny the plaintiff\u2019s request for abatement of the violation when it could not determine the length and extent of the violation. In addition, under these circumstances, the trial court could reasonably have found that it would be unfair and unduly burdensome to require the defendant to move the fill. The trial court, having conducted an inspection of the premises, was in the best position to assess the extent of the violation and the effect of an abatement order on the defendant. Finally, there was no evidence presented at the hearing that the defendant\u2019s conduct was wilful. In fact, the record discloses that upon receiving the cease and desist order the defendant promptly refrained from further activity on the slope.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">On this record, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s assessment of the equities in this case was clearly erroneous. \u201cAt the trial, it was the plaintiff\u2019s burden to prove its entitlement to equitable relief. On appeal, it was the plaintiff\u2019s burden to establish so manifest an infringement of its statutory or constitutional rights as to demonstrate an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in its denial of the plaintiff\u2019s request for a permanent injunction.\u201d <em>Gorra Realty </em>v. <em>Jetmore, </em>200 Conn. 151, 165, 510 A.2d 440 (1986). The plaintiff has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-12\"> The plaintiff instituted this action for injunctive relief pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-12. This section provides local zoning enforcement officers with a means to enforce local zoning laws. The statute specifically grants the zoning enforcement officer the power to sue for injunctive relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>as well as to impose monetary fines and to enforce its rules by instituting a suit to enjoin a party from violations of zoning laws. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Campanelli, </em>9 Conn.
