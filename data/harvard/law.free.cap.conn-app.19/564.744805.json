The sole issue presented in this appeal is whether, as a jurisdictional prerequisite to a summary process action initiated pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 21-80 (b) (3) (B),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiff must allege in his complaint a \u201cpreliminary and distinct thirty day written notice period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>The facts are not in dispute. On December 3, 1987, the plaintiff lessor and the defendant lessee entered into a written lease for the rental of a mobile home lot. Under the terms of the lease, the defendant agreed to pay an annual rent of $2280, payable in twelve monthly installments of $190, each to be paid on the first of each month beginning in January, 1988. The defendant took possession and subsequently failed to pay the rent due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>for the months of February, March, April and May of 1988. By way of a notice to quit possession dated May 12, 1988, and served upon the defendant on May 14, 1988, the plaintiff notified the defendant to vacate the lot on or before June 16,1988. The notice to quit stated the total arrearage due. The notice to quit served upon the defendant was referred to in the complaint and appended as an exhibit. The defendant did not tender the arrearage prior to June 16,1988,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and remains in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">On August 10, 1988, the trial court held a hearing and determined sua sponte that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs claim because the plaintiff failed to comply with General Statutes \u00a7 21-80 (b) (3) (B). The trial court interpreted that statute to require the plaintiff, as a prerequisite to the institution of a summary process action, to give the defendant an additional thirty days notice as required under General Statutes \u00a7 47a-15.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the only notice requirements applicable to a summary process action initiated under \u00a7 21-80 for nonpayment of rent are clearly set forth in \u00a7 21-80 (b) (3) (B) and that no separate, preliminary notice period is required, we find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>\u201cAs a condition precedent to a summary process action, proper notice to quit is a jurisdictional necessity.\u201d <em>Lampasona </em>v. Jacobs, 209 Conn. 724, 729, 553 A.2d 175 (1989). Section 21-80 (b) (3) applies to summary process actions involving mobile home parks. Id. Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 47a-23, the general summary process statute, when a tenant, as in this case, breaches her lease by failing to pay rent, and the landlord seeks to terminate the tenancy, the landlord must follow the procedures enunciated in \u00a7 21-80 (b) (3) (B). Under that section, to effectuate the termination the landlord must give the resident thirty days written notice and that notice must state the total arrearage due. If the tenant tenders the total arrearage due within the thirty day notice period provided in this section, the landlord \u201cshall not maintain or proceed with the summary process action.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 21-80 (b) (3) (B). The purpose for reciting the total arrearage due in the notice is to afford the tenant a final opportunity to save the tenancy by tendering the total arrearage within the thirty day grace period. If tender is made within the grace period, the statute bars further action by the landlord. Thus, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>the plain language of \u00a7 21.-80 (b) (3) (B), the prerequisites to the maintenance of a summary process action for nonpayment of rent are a written thirty day notification to the tenant and a statement of the total arrearage due. Section 21-80 (b) (3) (B) does not, as the trial court found, require a separate, preliminary notice period pursuant to \u00a7 47a-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Section 47a-15 applies to residential apartments generally; <em>Hoban </em>v. <em>Masters, </em>36 Conn. Sup. 611, 613, 421 A.2d 1318 (1980); and provides that under certain circumstances, in which a tenant fails to comply with his or her rental obligations under \u00a7 47a-ll, the landlord is required to deliver to the tenant a written notice \u201cspecifying the acts or omissions constituting the breach\u201d and to give the tenant thirty days to abate the violation or risk the termination of the tenancy. This notice provision has been interpreted to be separate from and preliminary to the maintenance of a summary process action pursuant to \u00a7 47a-23. See <em>Marrinan </em>v. <em>Hamer, </em>5 Conn. App. 101, 104, 497 A.2d 67 (1985); <em>Kapa Associates </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 274, 278, 408 A.2d 22 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The trial court\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 47a-15 in a case involving a summary process action to regain possession of a mobile home lot, and one involving nonpayment of rent, was misplaced. First, \u00a7 47a-15 is inapplicable to proceedings initiated under \u00a7 21-80. Section \u00a7 21-80 (b) (4) provides that unless otherwise specified, \u201cproceedings under this chapter shall be prescribed under Chapter 832,\u201d the general summary process chapter. General Statutes \u00a7 47a-15 is located in chapter 830 of the General Statutes and, therefore, does not apply to proceedings involving mobile home parks. Furthermore, even if we were to assume that \u00a7 47a-15 was applicable, the plain language of this section exempts a landlord from compliance with its notice provisions in cases where the breach of the rental agreement is based on a tenant\u2019s nonpayment of rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Second, \u00a7 21-80 includes a notice provision similar to that prescribed by \u00a7 47a-15 and, like \u00a7 47a-15, does not apply where the termination of lease is based on the tenant\u2019s failure to pay rent. That proposition is supported by the plain language of \u00a7 21-80 (b) (2), which states that a landlord \u201cmay not maintain a summary process action under subparagraph (B), (C) or (D) of subdivision (1) of this subsection prior to delivering a written notice to the resident specifying the acts or omissions constituting the action or inaction complained of and allowing the resident twenty-one days to remedy such complaint.\u201d That section, like \u00a7 47a-15, provides a separate and preliminary notice requirement to allow a tenant in a mobile home park to abate the claimed violation. The twenty-one day notice period is required, however, only when the tenant\u2019s noncompliance with his lease obligations is based on one of the subdivisions enumerated in \u00a7 21-80 (b) (2), including subparagraphs (B), (C) or (D). The reason of nonpayment of rent, listed as subparagraph (A), is specifically excluded from the preliminary notice requirements of \u00a7 21-80 (b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">We conclude that under \u00a7 21-80, when a landlord seeks to terminate a tenancy for nonpayment of rent, only the notice requirements set forth in \u00a7 21-80 (b) (3) (B) are applicable. Although we recognize that the provisions of \u00a7 21-80 (b) (3) (B) were designed to afford greater protection to mobile manufactured home owners who rent lots than other tenants, the law does not require a preliminary and distinct thirty day written notice pursuant to \u00a721-80 (b)(3) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21-80 provides in pertinent part: \u201cgrounds for summary PROCESS OR TERMINATION OF RENTAL AGREEMENT.

Except in the ease in which the landlord elects to proceed under sections 47a-23 to 47a-23b, inclusive, to evict based on nonpayment of rent or based on conduct by the tenant which constitutes a serious nuisance, if there is a material noncompliance with section 47a-ll which materially affects the health and safety of the other tenants or materially affects the physical condition of the premises, or if there is a material noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or a material noncompliance with the rules and regulations adopted in accordance with section 47a-9, the landlord may deliver a written notice to the tenant specifying the acts or omissions constituting the breach and that the rental agreement shall terminate upon a date not less than thirty days after receipt of the notice.
