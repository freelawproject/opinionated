The writ contained a May 1,1984 return date and was properly signed by plaintiff\u2019s counsel as a commissioner of the Superior Court. The accompanying complaint, however, was unsigned. On May 7,1984, the plaintiff filed a properly signed amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The defendant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not discover the absence of a signature on the original complaint until it was pointed out by the court at a pretrial conference nearly four years after the commencement of the action. As a result, on March 24,1988, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the action claiming that the omission of the signature on the original complaint deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 145 and General Statutes \u00a7 52-45a. The court granted the motion to dismiss on April 12,1988, and from that judgment the plaintiff appeals to this court. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Both parties rely on General Statutes \u00a7 52-45a<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to support their arguments. The plaintiff claims that the statute requires a signature on the writ and does not extend the signing requirement to the complaint that must accompany it. The defendant contends that the statute mandates that both the writ and the complaint be signed by a commissioner of the Superior Court. The defendant is incorrect. The plain language of the statute provides only that a signed writ be accompanied by a copy of the complaint. That section contains no language directing counsel to sign the complaint as well. Where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, courts cannot \u201csupply what the legislature chose to omit.\u201d <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Tufveson, </em>6 Conn. App. 301, 304, 505 A.2d 18, cert. denied, 199 Conn. 806, 508 A.2d 31 (1986). Therefore, we cannot impose on the plaintiff the additional requirement of signing the complaint. We conclude that compliance with the statute was all that was required to give the court subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Interpretation of the statute, however, does not conclude the matter, as the defendant raises an alternative ground for sustaining the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the suit. The defendant argues that because a complaint is a pleading, as defined by Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7112 and 131, it must \u201cbe signed by at least one attorney of record in his individual name.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 119. The defendant claims that the plaintiffs noncompliance with \u00a7 119 deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction and mandated dismissal of the action. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 119 does not warrant dismissal of the action. Both the General Statutes and the rules of practice allow the plaintiff, as a matter of right, to amend <em>\u201cany </em>defect, mistake or informality\u201d in the pleadings within thirty days of the return date. (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-128; Practice Book \u00a7 175. In the present case, therefore, the plaintiff\u2019s timely filing of a properly signed amended complaint cured the defect of the missing signature in the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The defendant finally contends that the failure of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to sign the complaint violated Practice Book \u00a7 399, which prohibits the court clerk from filing any paper that has not been signed by counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This argument is unavailing because the obligation created by Practice Book \u00a7 399 is imposed on the clerk and not on the plaintiff. \u201c \u2018For the reason that individuals or the public should not be made to suffer for the dereliction of public officers, provisions regulating the duties of public officers . . . are generally directory.\u2019 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands) \u00a7 57.19.\u201d <em>Tramontano </em>v. <em>Dileto, </em>192 Conn. 426, 432, 472 A.2d 768 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>169 Conn. 223, 238, 363 A.2d 143, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1025, 96 S. Ct. 469, 46 L. Ed. 2d 399 (1975) (obligations imposed on judge were directory); <em>State ex rel. Arcudi </em>v. <em>Iassogna, </em>165 Conn. 203, 205-206, 332 A.2d 90 (1973) (obligation imposed on governor was directory); <em>Donohue </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 550, 554, 235 A.2d 643 (1967) (obligation imposed on zoning authority was directory). Furthermore, \u00a7 399 contains no sanction for noncompliance. We conclude that \u00a7 399 is directory, and therefore the clerk\u2019s acceptance of the unsigned complaint should not disadvantage the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>tiff. In addition, the plaintiffs timely amendment corrected the pleading defect, nunc pro tunc, thereby curing the clerk\u2019s oversight retroactively to the time of filing the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">We recognize that in <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 389, 392-93, 449 A.2d 189 (1982), the Appellate Session of the Superior Court upheld the dismissal of a summary process action because the complaint had not been signed. This case, however, can be distinguished from <em>Collins </em>because there the plaintiff failed to amend its complaint within the thirty days allowed for amendment as of right. Id., 392. Therefore, the decision whether to permit the amendment and thus cure the defect was within the discretion of the trial court. See Practice Book \u00a7 176. Here, by contrast, the plaintiff acted promptly to correct, as a matter of right, the omission of the signature, leaving nothing for the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Finally, we point out that \u201c[i]t is the policy of the law to bring about a trial on the merits of a dispute whenever possible and to secure for the litigant his day in court.\u201d <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Calise, </em>174 Conn. 567, 574, 392 A.2d 440 (1978). To that end, the rules of practice are to \u201cbe interpreted liberally in any case where it shall be manifest that a strict adherence to them will work surprise or injustice.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7\u00a76 and 4187. In light of this settled policy and for the reasons previously stated, we find that the motion to dismiss was improperly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">There is error, the judgment of dismissal is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-9\"> This action named Maximo Perez and the city of Bridgeport as defendants. Only Perez is a party to this'appeal. Therefore, we refer only to Perez when we speak of the defendant in the singular.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\"> Section 52-45a provides in pertinent part: \u201cCivil actions shall be commenced by legal process consisting of a writ of summons . . . describing the parties, the court to which it is returnable, the return day and the date and place for the filing of an appearance.
