The arrest arose out of a transaction between the defendant and Atlantech, Inc., in which Atlantech installed certain equipment and performed certain services on a boat owned by the defendant, and the defendant thereafter stopped payment on a check he had delivered to Atlantech in partial payment for the equipment and labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The defendant moved to dismiss the information pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 815 (9), which provides for a pretrial dismissal based on any grounds other than those specified in Practice Book \u00a7 815 (1) through (5). The trial court, however, granted the motion pursuant to \u00a7 54-56. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The trial court specifically ruled that it had no authority to dismiss the information under Practice Book \u00a7 815 (9) because Practice Book \u00a7 816 prohibits a defendant who was arrested pursuant to a warrant from moving to dismiss under that subsection. See footnote 2, supra. Nonetheless, the court ruled that it did have authority to act on the defendant\u2019s motion under \u00a7 54-56, and therefore treated the motion as having been made under that statute. The court further noted that a warrant had been issued, and stated that it had examined the contents of the warrant affidavit and was satisfied that it established probable cause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court then stated its reasons for dismissing the information over the state\u2019s objection. Those reasons are summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">First, the court noted that both the state and the defendant had earlier indicated that there were out-of-state witnesses who would have to be produced or whose depositions would have to be taken.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>court stated the basis of the state\u2019s claim that, when the defendant stopped payment on the check, he had \u25a0the intent to obtain possession of the boat and leave Connecticut with it, and thus avoid payment of any obligation incurred as a result of Atlantech\u2019s labor and installation of equipment. In this connection, the court questioned whether the state \u201ccould persuade a jury beyond a reasonable doubt of [the defendant\u2019s] criminal intent,\u201d because the defendant subsequently issued Atlantech a $6000 check that Atlantech did not cash. Third, the court stated that Atlantech did not seek civil redress, but boarded the boat to remove the equipment it had installed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Fourth, the court stated its belief that the dispute between the defendant and Atlantech was \u201cbest resolved in a civil situation,\u201d and that Atlantech\u2019s interests could be protected by the defendant\u2019s agreement to put a sum of money in escrow and to submit to civil process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court concluded: \u201cI feel that the cost to the citizens of the state [of] a protracted trial in which it was not obvious that the state would be able to maintain the high standard of proof required in a criminal case to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, warrants that the Court grant the motion to dismiss under [the] circumstances . . . under [General Statutes \u00a7] 54-56 not under the rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The state claims that the court erred because (1) \u00a7 54-56 did not apply to this case, (2) if \u00a7 54-56 did apply, the court abused its discretion in dismissing the information, and (3) to the extent that \u00a7 54-56 conflicts with Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 815 and 816, the statute violates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>the constitutional principle of separation of powers. We find error on the state\u2019s first claim, and therefore need not reach its other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The state\u2019s claim that \u00a7 54-56 did not apply to this case is dispositive. The state argues that the court relied on the \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d prong of \u00a7 54-56; see footnote 1, supra; and that that reliance was erroneous because the defendant was arrested pursuant to a warrant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bellamy, </em>4 Conn. App. 520, 527, 495 A.2d 724 (1985). The defendant responds that the court relied on the \u201cinsufficient cause\u201d prong of the statute, and that the court properly exercised its power under <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>200 Conn. 453, 512 A.2d 183 (1986). We agree with the defendant that the trial court relied on the insufficient cause prong of \u00a7 54-56. We also agree with the state, however, that \u00a7 54-56 does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-56 and Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 815 and 816 appear to conflict with each other. Section 54-56 permits the court to dismiss an information \u201cat any time, upon motion by the defendant . . . if . . . there is not sufficient evidence or cause to justify a bringing or continuing of such information . . .\u2019\u2019Practice Book \u00a7 815 (5) mirrors \u00a7 54-56 by providing for a motion to dismiss an information for \u201c(5) [insufficiency of evidence or cause to justify the bringing or continuing of such information . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 816, however, provides that \u201c[n]o defendant . . . who has been arrested pursuant to a warrant may make a motion under [paragraph] (5) . . . of Sec. 815.\u201d Thus, facially at least, the two provisions \u2014 legislative and judicial \u2014 present a constitutional issue of the separation of powers. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>187 Conn. 292, 296-98, 445 A.2d 901 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">We are obligated, however, where reasonably possible, to read statutes so as to avoid calling their con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>stitutionality into question. <em>Kredi </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>1 Conn. App. 511, 515, 473 A.2d 333, cert. denied, 193 Conn. 803, 474 A.2d 1260 (1984). Applying this canon of construction to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56, we conclude that it does not apply to this case because the defendant was arrested pursuant to a warrant and no trial has yet been held.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We begin with an analysis of the background against which \u00a7 54-56 must be read. It has long been the law in Connecticut that the state's attorney derives his authority from the common law, that it is his duty to determine whether reasonable grounds exist to proceed with a criminal charge, and that \u201c[i]n the discharge of the functions of his high public office he has broad discretion in determining what crime or crimes to charge in any particular situation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 473-74, 450 A.2d 828 (1982); see also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Main, </em>31 Conn. 572, 576 (1863). \u201cSo long as he acts within the jurisdiction of his office it is not appropriate for a court to set policy for the performance of his prosecutorial function.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>supra, 474. The criminal justice system vests him with broad discretion to determine whether to press a prosecution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra, 460. \u201cIn the absence of statutory authority, the court has no power of its own motion to dismiss a criminal prosecution unless there is a fundamental legal defect in the information or indictment (such as want of jurisdiction or form of the information), or a constitutional defect such as denial of the right to a speedy trial . . . . \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>172 Conn. 608, 610-11, 376 A.2d 74 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-56 constitutes a grant of such \u201cstatutory authority.\u201d That does not mean, however, that it necessarily applies to this case. What may appear to be clear legislative language should not be read to preclude a legislative intent that is disclosed by the history or purpose of a statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bellamy, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>523. The purpose of the statute is \u201c \u2018to prevent uncheeked power by a prosecuting attorney.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>13 Conn. Sup. 112 (1944); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Bellamy, </em>4 Conn. App. 520, 527, 495 A.2d 724 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reinosa, </em>29 Conn. Sup. 117, 118, 274 A.2d 524 (1970).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Consistently with that purpose, we have held that the evidentiary insufficiency prong of \u00a7 54-56 \u201cdoes not apply where a judge has found probable cause and authorized the issuance of an arrest warrant. In such a case, the judicial authority\u2019s considered judgment has been interposed between the power of the prosecuting attorney and the rights of a defendant. The prosecutorial power is not unchecked; it has already been subject to the prior check of the judicial authority\u2019s \u2018independent determination that probable cause exists as to each element of every crime charged.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Heinz, </em>[193 Conn. 612, 617, 480 A.2d 452 (1984)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bellamy, </em>supra, 527. In <em>Bellamy, </em>we read <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>193 Conn. 602, 605, 478 A.2d 994 (1984), to hold that, in the absence of an invocation of Practice Book \u00a7 816, the court may rely \u201con General Statutes \u00a7 54-56 to dismiss an information which is preceded by an arrest warrant . . . if it is conclusively established that the court has before it all the evidence which the state will be able to produce at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The insufficient cause prong of \u00a7 54-56 stands on a somewhat different footing, however, from the insufficient evidence prong. Whereas the insufficient evidence prong invites an inquiry into whether the evidence, viewed most favorably to the state, would support a guilty verdict; <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>supra, 611-12; the insufficient cause prong invokes \u201cthe notion of fairness\u201d that must \u201c[permeate] the considerations to be given to the trial court\u2019s decision .... Thus, a balancing process must occur which weighs the interests of the state and society . . . against the interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>of the defendant. . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra, 458. The court\u2019s discretion in this regard \u201cmust be informed and guided by considerations of fundamental fairness that are ingrained in the concept of due process of law.\u201d Id., 459. In exercising its discretion, the court must explicitly weigh the competing factors on both sides; id., 459; and must exercise its statutory power with great caution and only when the circumstances are compelling. Id., 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">An examination of the history of \u00a7 54-56, and the cases in which it has been employed to sanction dismissals for cause, also sheds light on its scope. It was first interpreted in a reported decision by Judge (later Chief Justice) Wynne, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>supra. Judge Wynne stated that he had \u201cpersonal recollection of the reasons urged when the law was enacted in 1921. . . . What the statute was designed for, the very purpose for which it is now invoked, is a matter of legislative and judicial history.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u201cIn the spring of 1921 a case was tried involving a prominent lawyer before the Superior Court for Hartford County. The jury disagreed. The judge who presided, as well as counsel for the defense, saw the necessity for a law such as was passed. It was approved June 2, 1921. On June 17, 1921, a <em>nolle pros </em>was entered. The coincidence requires no comment.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">In <em>Carroll </em>itself, Judge Wynne dismissed the information against the defendant after two juries had refused to convict him, where the court was confident that the defendant would be acquitted on a third trial. Id., 112-13. Thus, in <em>Carroll, </em>the court read the statute as aimed at permitting a court to dismiss an information after a trial ending in a mistrial, and applied the statute in such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra, the court upheld the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the information after the defendant\u2019s conviction had been reversed on appeal and a new trial had been ordered. We note also that in <em>Corchado </em>the defendant had not been arrested pursuant to a warrant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>188 Conn. 653, 656, 453 A.2d 427 (1982); see also Connecticut Supreme Court Records &amp; Briefs, Part II, October Term, 1982. Indeed, the principal out-of-state authority on which the <em>Corchado </em>court relied was <em>State </em>v. <em>Abbati, </em>99 N. J. 418, 434, 493 A.2d 513 (1985), a reprosecution case. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>207 Conn. 374, 397, 542 A.2d 306 (1988), the court relied on \u00a7 54-56 to permit the trial court to exercise its discretion to dismiss a death penalty proceeding after the jury had become deadlocked on the penalty phase.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> O\u00far research fails to disclose any reported case where the insufficient cause prong of \u00a7 54-56 has been found to support a dismissal of an information before at least one trial has been held.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Mindful of our obligation to interpret \u00a7 54-56 so as to avoid a constitutional collision with Practice Book \u00a7 816, of the judicial and legislative origins of the statute, and of the rare but consistent instances of the statute\u2019s judicial application, we conclude that where, as here, no trial has yet been held and where Practice Book \u00a7 816 is invoked, the insufficient cause prong of the statute is an inappropriate basis for dismissal of an information preceded by an arrest warrant. There are, moreover, practical policy considerations that support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Dismissal under \u00a7 54-56 for insufficient cause to justify the prosecution requires the court explicitly to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>weigh all the competing factors and considerations of fundamental fairness to both sides \u2014 the defendant, the state and society, and presumably the victim. This must be done with great caution, and a dismissal ordered only when the circumstances are compelling. <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>200 Conn. 453, 458-60, 512 A.2d 183 (1986). This difficult and delicate process necessarily involves a careful consideration by the court of such factors as the strength of the state\u2019s case, the likelihood of conviction, the severity of the crime, its effect on the victim, the strength of the defendant\u2019s defense, the defendant\u2019s personal situation, and all the other myriad factors that underlie a judgment regarding fundamental fairness. Although we are not prepared to say that an informed judgment about such factors can never be reached short of trial, certainly such a judgment can be better formed after the court has had the opportunity to view at least one trial of the charges contained in the information sought to be dismissed for insufficient cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Thus, the trial court in this case erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. This conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider the state\u2019s claim that the trial court abused its discretion under General Statutes \u00a7 54-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside, and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-56 provides: \u201cAll courts having jurisdiction of criminal cases shall at all times have jurisdiction and control over informations and criminal cases pending therein and may, <em>at any time, </em>upon motion by the defendant, dismiss any information and order such defendant discharged if, in the opinion of the court, there is not sufficient evidence or cause to justify the bringing or continuing of such information or the placing of the person accused therein on trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-10\"> Practice Book \u00a7 815 (5) provides: \u201cThe following defenses or objections, if capable of determination without a trial of the general issue, shall, if made prior to trial, be raised by a motion to dismiss the indictment or information ...
