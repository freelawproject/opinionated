The dispositive issue is whether the habeas court erred in concluding that the petitioner, who was charged with being a persistent dangerous felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>offender for a crime committed after July 1,1981, was not exposed to a sentence of life imprisonment and, therefore, not entitled to a hearing in probable cause. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The petitioner was charged in the first part of an information with committing robbery in the first degree on or about September 30, 1983, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-134. In the second part of the information, he was charged with being a persistent dangerous felony offender in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-40 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petitioner was convicted after a jury trial on both counts of the information and, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-40 (f)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>and 53a-35a,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was sentenced to a term of twenty-five years in prison. He claims that he was entitled to a probable cause hearing pursuant to article first, section 8, of the Connecticut constitution as amended by article seventeenth of the amendments<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">A person who is charged with a crime that is \u201cpunishable by death or life imprisonment\u201d and \u201cwho has not been indicted prior to May 26, 1983,\u201d is entitled to a \u201cpreliminary hearing [to determine whether] there is probable cause to believe that the offense has been committed and that the accused person has committed it.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a (a); Conn. Const., amend. XVII. Under this section, <em>only </em>a person who is exposed to a sentence of life imprisonment or death is entitled to a probable cause hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The petitioner argues that a prerequisite for sentencing a persistent felony offender, pursuant to \u00a7 53a-40 (f), is that the court find that \u201cextended incarceration and lifetime supervision will best serve the public interest.\u201d He argues that this phrase subjects him to life \u201cimprisonment,\u201d and as a consequence, he was entitled to a probable cause hearing. The petitioner\u2019s argument incorrectly equates \u201csupervision\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> with \u201cimprisonment,\u201d and misconstrues the clear intent of \u00a7 53a-40 (f). We read the phrase \u201cextended incarceration and lifetime supervision\u201d as an expression of the legislature\u2019s policy in enacting this statute, and therefore, not as mandating any particular sentence. Rather than imposing any particular sentence, \u00a7 53a-40 (f) merely authorizes a sentence for a class A felony and then directs the trial court to consult the applicable sentencing statute, depending on the date the offense occurred. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-35a and 53a-35. Under the applicable statute in this case, the maximum prison sentence to which the petitioner was exposed was twenty-five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40 (f), a person who is convicted of being a persistent dangerous felony offender, either before or after July 1, 1981, may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment authorized by the applicable statutes for a class A felony. Prior to July 1, 1981, indeterminate sentencing was mandated for all felonies, and the maximum term for a class A felony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>including murder, was life imprisonment. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35 (a) and (b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For crimes committed on or after July 1,1981, however, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a mandates definite sentencing and sets forth the current sentencing scheme. Section 53a-35a distinguishes between two types of class A felonies and provides in pertinent part: \u201c(2) for the class A felony of murder, a term not less than twenty-five years nor more than life; <em>(3)for a class A felony other than murder, </em>a term not less than ten years nor more than twenty-five years . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Because the petitioner was convicted after July 1, 1981, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a is applicable to his case. Since he was convicted of a \u201cclass A felony other than murder,\u201d the maximum prison sentence that the court could have imposed under that section was twenty-five years. Under these circumstances, the petitioner could not have received a sentence of life imprisonment or death and, therefore, no probable cause hearing was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-40 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cPERSISTENT OFFENDERS: DEFINITIONS, DEFENSE; AUTHORIZED SENTENCES.
