We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The following facts are relevant to the disposition of this appeal. The plaintiff commenced this action by way of a two count complaint returnable November 20, 1984. The first count sought foreclosure of a mechanic\u2019s lien placed upon real estate owned by the defendant, arising from labor and materials furnished by the plaintiff for the well water system on the property. The second count, based upon unjust enrichment, sought damages in the amount of the reasonable value of the work performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">On July 20, 1986, the trial court, <em>Jacobson, J., </em>dismissed the action for failure to prosecute with due diligence pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 251. The plaintiff filed a motion to open the judgment of dismissal and a supporting affidavit on October 9,1986. The affidavit indicated that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney was attempting to obtain military service affidavits for the two codefendants, Patricia and Thomas Boyham. The trial court granted the motion on November 3, 1986, and ordered the plaintiff to close the pleadings as to Roberts within thirty days and as to the Boyhams within ninety days, in order to allow sufficient time to obtain the mili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>tary affidavits. The plaintiff closed the pleadings as to Roberts by filing a reply denying his special defenses on November 20, 1986. The plaintiff withdrew the claims against the Boyhams because of its inability to obtain the military service affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The action was thereafter tried before the court, <em>Hon. Milton J. Belinkie, </em>state trial referee, who rendered judgment in favor of the defendant on the first count and in favor of the plaintiff on the second count. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The defendant\u2019s sole claim on appeal is that the trial court erred in granting the plaintiff\u2019s motion to open the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u201c \u2018Courts have an inherent power to open, correct and modify judgments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Steve Viglione Sheet Metal Co. </em>v. <em>Sakonchick, </em>190 Conn. 707, 710, 462 A.2d 1037 (1983). A civil judgment may be opened if a motion to open or set aside is filed within four months of the issuance of judgment. Practice Book \u00a7 326; General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a. Such a motion is addressed to the trial court\u2019s discretion, and its action will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is shown that the court acted unreasonably and in clear abuse of its discretion. <em>Acheson </em>v. <em>White, </em>195 Conn. 211, 215-16, 487 A.2d 197 (1985). \u201cIn determining whether the trial court abused its discretion, [the reviewing] court must make every reasonable presumption in favor of its action.\u201d Id., 215; <em>Steve Viglione Sheet Metal Co. </em>v. <em>Sakonchick, </em>supra, 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">The trial court concluded that there was evidence of reasonable cause to set aside the dismissal based upon the plaintiff\u2019s efforts to obtain military affidavits for the Boyhams. Moreover, the record indicates that the motion to open was filed within four months of the judgment of dismissal. Our review indicates that the trial court\u2019s decision is fully supported by the record and was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>The defendant\u2019s claim that the affidavit supporting the plaintiff\u2019s motion to open failed to comply with the requirements set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 377 misses the mark. A review of our Practice Book and case law indicates that the proper way to open a \u00a7 251 judgment of dismissal is to file a motion to open the judgment pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 326. See, e.g., <em>Van Mecklenburg </em>v. <em>Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 517, 518, 494 A.2d 549 (1985); <em>Acheson </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra; <em>Steve Viglione Sheet Metal Co. </em>v. <em>Sakonchick, </em>supra; 1W. Moller &amp; W. Horton, Connecticut Practice Book Annotated (3d Ed.), commentary to \u00a7 251 (p. 441). Practice Book \u00a7 377 is the vehicle by which to open a judgment rendered upon a default or a nonsuit, and not a judgment of dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-13\"> The plaintiff commenced this action against the named defendant, who owned the property where the plaintiff performed work, and against Thomas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>and Patricia Boyham, the tenants of the named defendant who resided on his property. The action was later withdrawn as to the Boyhams. The term \u201cdefendant\u201d as used in this opinion refers only <em>to </em>Roberts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 251 provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf a party shall fail to prosecute an action with reasonable diligence, the court may, after hearing, on motion by any party to the action pursuant to Sec. 196, or on its own motion, render a judgment dismissing the action with costs. At least two weeks\u2019 notice shall be required except in cases appearing on an assignment list for final adjudication. Judgment files shall not be drawn except where an appeal is taken or where any party so requests.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
