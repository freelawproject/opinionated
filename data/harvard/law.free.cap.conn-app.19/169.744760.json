The questions are: (1) \u201cIs the city of New Haven obligated under the Connecticut General Statutes [\u00a7 38-327] and Regulations to provide uninsured motorist benefits to operators of patrol cars it owns which are used by the city of New Haven\u2019s department of police services, with respect to which it is self-insured?\u201d and (2) \u201cDoes the city of New Haven\u2019s status as employer of the plaintiff, John Ross, and the fact that the city of New Haven has paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits to him, or on his behalf, bar the plaintiff, pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 31-284, from receiving uninsured motorist benefits?\u201d We decline to answer question one, and we answer question two in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">A stipulation filed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4148 shows that the plaintiff, a New Haven police officer, was on duty driving a New Haven police department patrol car when he was injured in an accident with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>uninsured motorist. He received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the city of New Haven and in this action seeks to recover uninsured motorist benefits from the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">For the sake of clarity, we will discuss the questions in the reverse order in which they are presented. Thus, we first consider whether the plaintiff\u2019s receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the city bars him from receiving uninsured motorist benefits from the city. The pertinent part of our workers\u2019 compensation law provides: \u201cAll rights and claims between employer and employees . . . arising out of personal injury . . . sustained in the course of employment . . . are abolished other than rights and claims given by this chapter .. . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-284. This statute has been repeatedly and uniformly construed by the courts of this state to exclude further recovery from the employer by an employee who has received workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>209 Conn. 59, 64, 546 A.2d 846 (1988); <em>Panaro </em>v. <em>Electrolux Corporation, </em>208 Conn. 589, 599, 545 A.2d 1086 (1988); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>State, </em>189 Conn. 550, 558, 457 A.2d 304 (1983). Accordingly, we conclude that the answer to the second question is yes; the plaintiff is barred from receiving uninsured motorist benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The remaining question concerns whether the city of New Haven is required by law to provide uninsured motorist benefits to the operators of its police patrol cars. Practice Book \u00a7 4147 grants authority for reservation of questions to this court and provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe court will not entertain a reservation for its advice upon questions of law arising in any action unless the question or questions presented are such as are, in the opinion of the court, reasonably certain to enter into the decision of the case . . . .\u2019\u2019In view of our determination that the plaintiff\u2019s receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits bars his receipt of uninsured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>motorist benefits, the reserved question is not, in our opinion, \u201creasonably certain to enter into the decision of the case.\u201d Accordingly, we decline to answer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We decline to answer question one (re: definition of police patrol cars). We answer question two (re: workers\u2019 compensation benefits) yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">No costs will be taxed to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
