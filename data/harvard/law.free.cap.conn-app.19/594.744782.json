Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress evidence of all observations by the police involving the defendant\u2019s performance of field sobriety tests. After a hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred (1) in failing to suppress the evidence derived from the roadside sobriety tests, (2) in admitting the opinion testimony of certain police officers regarding the defendant\u2019s intoxication, and (3) in instructing the jury on the principle of reasonable doubt. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. In the early morning of October 23, 1987, Officer Richard Applebaum of the Trumbull police department was assigned to special duty at the Trumbull Marriott Hotel. Responding to a complaint from the hotel management concerning the defendant, Applebaum found the defendant asleep in a chair in the front lobby. Upon awakening him, Applebaum noticed a strong odor of alcohol on his breath. The defendant at first became irate, loud and boisterous, and Applebaum had to calm him by explaining that he was not arresting him but was merely asking him to leave the hotel lobby. After Applebaum offered to arrange a safe ride home for him, the defendant responded that his car was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>parked in a lot next to the Marriott and that he would wait in his car for a friend at the bar who would drive him home. At trial, Applebaum testified that he then observed the defendant walk, with an uncertain gait, to his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Applebaum then radioed police headquarters with a description of the defendant\u2019s vehicle and asked that a police car be sent into the area. When he returned, the defendant\u2019s vehicle was no longer in the parking lot. Applebaum called headquarters again to report this fact, and was informed that another Trumbull police officer had already stopped the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Thereafter, Applebaum joined Trumbull police officer Thomas Savarese at the side of the road near the entrance to the Merritt Parkway, where Savarese was completing field sobriety tests on the defendant. Savarese testified at both the hearing on the motion to suppress and at the trial that he stopped the defendant and told him that his vehicle had been stopped for failure to have headlights on. When the defendant responded to Savarese, the officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol on the defendant\u2019s breath. Savarese further testified that, after he had administered the sobriety tests, he arrested the defendant for driving while under the influence and took him to headquarters where the defendant acted belligerently and spoke with slurred speech. Police officer Richard Bernaud testified that, during the booking procedure, the defendant was combative, his speech was slurred and he was hesitant in his movements. Bernaud also testified that he smelled the odor of alcohol on the defendant\u2019s breath.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The defendant testified that he had consumed several drinks at the hotel bar but was not intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The essence of the defendant\u2019s first claim is that the trial court erred in determining that probable cause to arrest is not a condition precedent to the administering of a field sobriety test. The defendant argues that because the trial court found that probable cause for the defendant\u2019s arrest did not arise until after the field sobriety tests, the court erred in admitting the observations by the police concerning those tests.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument and held that the police had legally detained the defendant on a reasonable suspicion and that the roadside sobriety tests were a minimal intrusion on his constitutional rights. The trial court further held that the police \u201cseized\u201d nothing from the defendant and, accordingly, that the police testimony regarding the observations of the roadside tests was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The police may detain an individual for a brief period of time without probable cause to make an arrest, if they have a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the person is involved in criminal activity. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>189 Conn. 611, 617, 458 A.2d 369 (1983). The purpose of such a detention is to maintain the status quo while investigating the circumstances that give rise to the suspicion of criminal wrongdoing. See Adams v. <em>Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 146, 92 S. Ct. 1921, 32 L. Ed. 2d 612 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 618. Once a lawful stop is made, a police officer\u2019s suspicions may become further aroused and \u201cthe stop may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>be prolonged and the scope enlarged as required by the circumstances, provided the scope of the investigation remains within the limits created by the facts upon which the stop is predicated and the suspicion which they arouse. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 21-22, 29 . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>181 Conn. 299, 305, 435 A.2d 334 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut guaranty the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures. Connecticut cases have presumed that roadside sobriety tests are incident to the initial stop and that chemical blood and breath tests are incident to the arrest. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hancich, </em>200 Conn. 615, 618-19, 513 A.2d 638 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rutledge, </em>17 Conn. App. 250, 252, 552 A.2d 435 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>16 Conn. App. 156, 158, 547 A.2d 69 (1988).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The fourth and fourteenth amendments apply, however, \u201cbecause stopping an automobile and detaining its occupants constitute a \u2018seizure\u2019 within the meaning of those Amendments, even though the purpose of the stop is limited and the resulting detention quite brief. The essential purpose of the proscriptions in the Fourth Amendment is to impose a standard of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 upon the exercise of discretion by government officials, including law enforcement agents in order \u2018 \u201cto safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions. . . .\u201d \u2019 <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Barlow\u2019s, Inc., </em>436 U.S. 307, 312 [98 S. Ct. 1816, 56 L. Ed. 2d 305] (1978), quoting <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 528 [87 S. Ct. 1727, 18 L. Ed. 2d 930] (1967). Thus, the permissibility of a particular law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>enforcement practice is judged by balancing its intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u201d <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 653-54, 99 S. Ct. 1391, 59 L. Ed. 2d 660 (1979). The intrusion must be confined to what is \u201cminimally necessary\u201d under the circumstances. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In the present case, there is no question that the initial stop, made because the defendant was driving without headlights in the dark of night, was permissible. See <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>supra, 663. After making the stop near an entrance to the Merritt Parkway in Trumbull, Savarese detected a strong odor of alcohol on the defendant\u2019s breath, and, suspicions aroused, he conducted field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The state has a vital interest in keeping intoxicated drivers off the roads and highways. That interest is evinced by our legislature\u2019s passage of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) (2), which makes it per se illegal for a person to drive \u201cwhile the ratio of alcohol in the blood of [the driver] is ten-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight.\u201d Balanced against that strong state interest is the intrusiveness of roadside sobriety testing, by which the police measure the physical performance of a suspected intoxicated driver before allowing that person to continue driving. The defendant relies heavily on <em>People </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>677 P.2d 310 (Colo. 1984), in which a Colorado court required that probable cause to arrest exist before the police administer field sobriety tests. The defendant strongly urges that we adopt the <em>Carlson </em>rule in Connecticut. Other jurisdictions, however, have held that the degree of intrusion by the governmental authority into a person\u2019s affairs in administering such tests is minimal and therefore is outweighed by the strong governmental interest. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>718 P.2d 171 (Ariz. 1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Golden, </em>171 Ga. App. 27, 318 S.E.2d 693 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>(1984) . We agree with the latter holdings. To hold otherwise and to accept the defendant\u2019s position that we require the police to have the equivalent of probable cause to arrest before giving the field sobriety tests would seriously impair the state\u2019s efforts to meet the enormous danger posed by the presence of intoxicated drivers on the highways. In rejecting the <em>Carlson </em>standard, we find the holding of <em>State </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, to be the most compelling and persuasive. In that case, the Arizona Supreme Court held that \u201croadside sobriety tests that do not involve long delay or unreasonable intrusion, although searches under the fourth amendment, may be justified by an officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion (based on specific, articulable facts) that the driver is intoxicated.\u201d Against this standard, we conclude that the trial court correctly admitted evidence regarding the roadside sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The defendant also argues that article first, \u00a7 9, of the Connecticut constitution bars the admission of roadside sobriety tests. This section of our constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be arrested, detained or punished except in cases clearly warranted by law.\u201d The gravamen of the defendant\u2019s claim is that sobriety tests cannot be conducted when the detention is not \u201cclearly warranted\u201d and that the meaning of \u201cclearly warranted\u201d is the equivalent of probable cause. We find the defendant\u2019s claim to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Although we note that our Supreme Court has held that the provision of article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution provides more substantive protection to citizens than does the fourth amendment to the federal constitution in the determination of probable cause; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 233, 496 A.2d 498 (1985) ; the defendant\u2019s reliance on that case is inapposite. Nowhere in that decision did the Supreme Court suggest that the <em>Terry </em>stop situation warranted the higher standard of probable cause. We have not found, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>nor has the defendant presented any support for his claim that \u201c[t]he state constitution mandates a standard of probable cause for even the detention of an individual which exceeds that of the Federal Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">As we have previously noted, our Connecticut case law presumes that roadside sobriety testing is incident to the initial stop, based on the officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion, rather than on the subsequent arrest. Nothing cited by the defendant has persuaded us to conclude the contrary. Thus, the question is whether the administration of a field sobriety test to a suspect on the basis of a reasonable, articulable suspicion in the absence of probable cause is \u201cclearly warranted\u201d within the meaning of the Connecticut constitution. On the basis of our reasoning with respect to the first claim of error, we answer that question in the affirmative. The trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The defendant next contends that the trial court erred in admitting certain police opinion testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s intoxication. The facts relevant to this claim are as follows: At trial, Applebaum testified that, from his observations of the defendant at the hotel, he believed that the defendant \u201cwas impaired at the very least and should not be allowed to operate [a vehicle].\u201d Savarese later testified that he had observed the defendant driving his automobile without the headlights on and had pulled him over to the side of the road. Savarese testified that he had to bang on the defendant\u2019s car window for about \u201ctwenty seconds\u201d before the defendant rolled the window down, at which point the officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol. Believing he was confronting a possibly intoxicated driver, Savarese administered field sobriety tests to the defendant. Savarese also testified that, on the basis of his observations and the roadside sobriety tests, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>believed that the defendant \u201cwas intoxicated and that he was unfit to drive a car safely.\u201d The defendant now claims that the trial court erred in admitting the opinion testimony of Applebaum and Savarese because it concerned their opinions on the ultimate issue to be decided by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">In addressing this claim of error, we first note that the trial court ruled that all the opinions before it were lay opinions on the issue of intoxication. The court\u2019s ruling was that \u201cunder the law in the State of Connecticut, any person, even a lay person, may describe an individual that he has observed and state whether or not he believes that such individual was under the influence of alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Accordingly, the trial court admitted the testimony of both Applebaum and Savarese as \u201clay opinion\u201d on the issue of intoxication. The defendant claims that the trial court mistakenly characterized the opinion testimony before it and, the mischaracterization notwithstanding, erroneously allowed opinion evidence on an ultimate issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">We agree with the defendant, in part, in that the trial court improperly characterized Savarese\u2019s opinion as that of a lay person. At trial, the state framed its offer of Savarese\u2019s opinion as that of an expert, but the trial court rejected that offer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior to asking Savarese for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>his opinion on the defendant\u2019s state of intoxication and ability to drive, the assistant state\u2019s attorney had established Savarese\u2019s particular training and experience in detecting intoxicated drivers as a patrol division officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">\u201cGenerally, expert testimony is admissible if (1) the witness has a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue, (2) that skill or knowledge is not common to the average person, and (3) the testimony would be helpful to the court or jury in considering the issues.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>199 Conn. 473, 476, 507 A.2d 1387 (1986). Savarese\u2019s training included \u201cD.W.I.\u201d training, which included, as he testified, \u201chow to identify possible drunk drivers, [and] how to perform certain tests to determine if the subject [who] was pulled over for drunk driving [is] actually drunk.\u201d It is clear from the record that his opinion, which included his interpretations of the results of the roadside sobriety tests, was based on this training. As such, his opinion qualified as that of an expert and should have been accorded that status. The defendant, however, contends that an expert witness is precluded from giving an opinion as to the ultimate issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">\u201cAn expert witness is not ordinarily permitted to express an opinion on an ultimate issue of fact which is to be decided by the trier of fact. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, </em>207 Conn. 35, 41, 540 A.2d 42 (1988); <em>Kowalewski </em>v. <em>Mutual Loan Co., </em>159 Conn. 76, 80, 266 A.2d 379 (1970). \u2018 \u201cExperts can sometimes give an opinion on an ultimate issue where the trier, in order to make intelligent findings, needs expert assistance on the precise question on which it must pass.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, </em>supra, quoting C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Handbook of Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 7.17.3, p. 186.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mendez, </em>15 Conn. App. 531, 535, 545 A.2d 587, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 810, 548 A.2d 441 (1988). Savarese\u2019s testimony, which included a description and interpretation of and conclusions regarding the roadside sobri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>ety tests, was necessary for the jury intelligently to make a finding as to whether the defendant violated General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) by \u201c[operating] a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both.\u201d The opinion portion of Savarese\u2019s testimony differed from any other opinion testimony regarding the sobriety of an individual because it was based in great part on knowledge and skill beyond the ken of the average juror. We conclude that Savarese\u2019s testimony fit the test for admission of expert testimony on the ultimate issue as set out in <em>Vilalastra, </em>and was therefore admissible.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The trial court\u2019s admission of Savarese\u2019s opinion testimony was correct, but the grounds for its admission were erroneous. \u201cThis court is not required to reverse a ruling of the trial court which reached a correct result, albeit for a wrong reason. <em>Favorite </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>176 Conn. 310, 317, 407 A.2d 974 (1978).\u201d <em>Herrmann v. Summer Plaza Corporation, </em>201 Conn. 263, 274, 513 A.2d 1211 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">With respect to the testimony of Applebaum, we find that the trial court did not err in admitting this evidence. The relevant part of Applebaum\u2019s testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s state of intoxication is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">Mr. Palumbo: \u201cWhen you observed him walking out, could you describe for us please how he walked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">\u201cA. He walked rapidly but he was unsure of his gait.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">\u201cQ. Do you base your opinion as to how he was walking \u2014 your opinion is based upon your training and experiences as a police officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">\u201cQ. And, prior experience with arresting people for operating under the influence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">\u201cA. Yes. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">\u201cQ. Okay. Again, based upon your experience, did you formulate an opinion as to whether he was fit to drive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">\u201cQ. What was that opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-10\">\u201c[Defense counsel:] Objection as to that opinion. That calls for an opinion on the ultimate issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-12\">\u201cQ. Did you formulate an opinion, officer, as to his fitness to operate an automobile?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-13\">\u201cA. Yes. It was my opinion he was impaired at the very least and should not be allowed to operate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">Unlike Savarese\u2019s testimony, Applebaum\u2019s opinion was not based on any expertise or specialized skill. Any person who had observed the defendant in the Marriott hotel lobby would have been able to formulate an opinion as to the defendant\u2019s sobriety or fitness to operate an automobile. Accordingly, the trial court was correct to characterize Applebaum\u2019s conclusion as a lay opinion that could be measured and weighed against any other evidence that might suggest, for example, the defendant\u2019s sobriety. The defendant argues, however, that the trial court erred in allowing lay opinion on the ultimate issue of operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">Applebaum\u2019s opinion was based on events that occurred prior to the defendant\u2019s ever entering his automobile. This opinion concerned the defendant\u2019s condition in the hotel lobby, a condition from which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Applebaum concluded that the defendant was unfit to drive. This opinion, however, did not go to the ultimate issue of fact that was to be decided by the trier of fact, namely, whether, as prohibited by General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a, the defendant was <em>operating a motor vehicle </em>while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Applebaum\u2019s testimony was decidedly distinguishable from that of Savarese, who not only observed the defendant operate the vehicle suspiciously, but also concluded from the application of his expert training that the defendant, in fact, operated that vehicle while intoxicated. Applebaum\u2019s answers to the questions put to him did not require him to apply a legal principle or standard to certain facts or to state a legal conclusion therefrom with respect to the crime charged. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>124 Conn. 664, 668, 2 A.2d 374 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">\u201c \u2018The general rule is that witnesses must state facts and not their individual opinions, but there are exceptions to this rule as well established as the rule itself.\u2019 <em>Sydleman </em>v. <em>Beckwith, </em>43 Conn. 9, 11 [1875].\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Newell, </em>160 Conn. 269, 277, 278 A.2d 776 (1971); see also C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 7.15. \u201cBecause \u2018[t]he condition of intoxication and its common accompaniments are a matter of general knowledge\u2019; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>[supra], 667; <em>Way </em>v. <em>Pavent, </em>179 Conn. 377, 380, 426 A.2d 780 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>122 Conn. 439, 442, 189 A. 606 (1937); <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>10 Conn. App. 71, 74, 521 A.2d 597 (1987); our Supreme Court has held that laymen may testify as to their opinion of whether a person is intoxicated. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra; see also J. Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn Rev. 1986) \u00a7 1974; C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, [supra] \u00a7 7.15 (c).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenna, </em>11 Conn. App. 122, 136-37 n.9, 525 A.2d 1374, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 806, 531 A.2d 939 (1987). We conclude that the trial court did not err in allowing Apple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>baum to testify, as a lay person, as to his opinion of the sobriety of the defendant, a subject that was clearly relevant to the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that a reasonable doubt is \u201ca real or honest doubt [for which] a valid reason can be given\u201d and one which \u201cin serious affairs which concern you in your everyday life you would pay attention to and consider.\u201d The defendant claims that these definitions unconstitutionally lowered the state\u2019s burden of proof and thus constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">In a criminal case, the trial court must instruct the jury on the constitutional requirement that the state prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>DelVecchio, </em>191 Conn. 412, 420, 464 A.2d 813 (1983). \u201c \u2018[Cjourts . . . [should] not use language in instructions which can be understood as diluting or in any way impairing the constitutional requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pine, </em>609 F.2d 106, 108 (3d Cir. 1979).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>183 Conn. 17, 28, 438 A.2d 1165 (1981). It is well established that the test to be applied on appellate review to a claim of instructional error is whether the charge as a whole presented the case to the jury so that no injustice has been done. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lytell, </em>206 Conn. 657, 664, 539 A.2d 133 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moss, </em>189 Conn. 364, 370, 456 A.2d 274 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 170, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">After instructing the jury on the presumption of innocence and stating that the state bore the burden of proving each and every element of the crime charged, the trial court gave a detailed charge regarding reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>After reading and considering the charge as a whole, we conclude that it is not reasonably possible that the jurors were misled as to the burden that the state had to sustain. On appeal, we will not subject the language of the court\u2019s charge to critical dissection or examine it in artificial isolation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DelVecchio, </em>supra, 421. Reviewing the instruction in its entirety, we find that the trial court fairly apprised the jury of the reasonable doubt standard so that no injustice was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-8\"> Although the police attempted to administer an intoximeter test, they failed to follow the proper procedures, resulting in the exclusion of the test results from the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\"> At trial, the state premised the admissibility of the sobriety test results on (1) probable cause, (2) the consent of the defendant, and (3) the contention that the test results were \u201cnontestimonial evidence.\u201d The trial court did not address the grounds of consent or \u201cnontestimonial evidence\u201d and the state has not pursued the ground of \u201cconsent\u201d on this appeal. Accordingly, we will consider the state\u2019s claim with respect to consent abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b618-6\"> Although the defendant challenges the admission of the roadside sobriety tests under article first, \u00a7 7, of the state constitution, he advances no argument for the separate treatment of the issue on appeal. We therefore consider only the federal and state constitutional claims actually briefed by him. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>208 Conn. 52, 67 n.9, 544 A.2d 611 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>17 Conn. App. 502, 505 n.1, 554 A.2d 746, cert. granted, 211 Conn. 807, 559 A.2d 1141 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b622-8\"> During this part of the trial the following questions were put to Savarese by the assistant state\u2019s attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">\u201cQ. Based upon your training and experience, did you form an opinion as to Mr. Lamme\u2019s ability to safely operate an automobile?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">\u201cQ.

Based upon your training and experience and your observations, officer, and the tests which were performed upon Mr. Lamme, did you come to a conclusion as to whether or not you believed Mr. Lamme was under the influence of intoxicating liquor?\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b624-10\"> The defendant also suggests that expert opinion on the ultimate issue to be decided by the jury is inadmissible under General Statutes \u00a7 54-86. This claim was not raised at trial and, therefore, we will not review it. Practice Book \u00a7 4185.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\"> The trial court\u2019s instructions regarding reasonable doubt were as follows: \u201cA reasonable doubt, therefore, is a doubt for which a valid reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>can be given. It is a doubt which is something more than a guess or a surmise. It is not a conjecture, nor is it a fanciful or capricious doubt. A reasonable doubt is not a doubt which is raised by someone simply for the sake of raising a doubt, nor is it a doubt suggested by the ingenuity of counsel or of a juror which is not warranted by the evidence or lack of evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">\u201cIn other words, a reasonable doubt is a real or honest doubt. It is a doubt which has its foundation in the evidence or the lack of evidence produced in the courtroom. It is such a doubt as in the serious affairs which concern you in your everyday life you would pay attention to and consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">\u201cProof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that precludes every reasonable hypothesis except that which tends to support and is consistent with the defendant\u2019s guilt and is inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. However, absolute certainty in the affairs of life is almost unattainable and for that reason absolute certainty on the part of the jury before it returns a verdict of guilty is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">\u201cWhat the law does require is that after reviewing all of the evidence which includes the exhibits, if there is something in the evidence or lack of evidence which leaves in the minds of the jurors as reasonable persons, a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt as to any particular charge, then the defendant must be given the benefit of that doubt ....</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">\u201cIt necessarily follows that if the facts point equally in two separate directions, one way towards innocence and the other way towards guilt, then it must be given that direction which is towards innocence because to satisfy the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, it is incumbent upon the State to negate every supposition which is reasonable or probable.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">\u201cIf therefore you can, with reason, reconcile all the facts proved with any reasonable theory consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence, then you cannot find him guilty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
