Their motions seek our review of the decisions of the presiding judge of the habeas court denying their appellate counsels\u2019 motions to withdraw. In passing on these motions, we are faced with the issue of whether the procedures set out in <em>Anders </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S. Ct. 1396, 18 L. Ed. 2d 493 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>(1967), and Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 952 through 956, apply in the context of appeals from habeas corpus judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The petitioner Franko is serving a twenty year sentence for sexual assault, and the petitioner Thompson is serving a thirty year sentence for robbery, burglary and as a persistent felony offender. Both Franko and Thompson filed writs of habeas corpus alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">In Franko\u2019s case, the writ of habeas corpus was denied by the trial court, <em>Barry, J. </em>Thereafter, Franko, by his public defender, filed a petition for certification to appeal the denial to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 30, 1988, Judge Barry granted the petition for certification to appeal, along with an appointment of counsel and a waiver of fees. The public defender representing Franko filed a timely appeal on his behalf, but thereafter moved in this court to withdraw as appellate counsel on the basis of an <em>Anders </em>brief. In keeping with our procedure when such motions are filed in criminal cases under Practice Book \u00a7 4035,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we referred the motion and <em>Anders </em>brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>to Judge Mack, the presiding judge of the habeas court, On October 25, 1988, Judge Mack denied the motion to withdraw. On November 18, 1988, the public defender moved for an articulation of Judge Mack\u2019s ruling. Finally, on February 14,1989, the public defender filed, in this court, under Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 4053 and 4054,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an untimely motion for review of Judge Mack\u2019s articulation. It is that untimely motion for review that we now address.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>In Thompson\u2019s case, the writ of habeas corpus was denied by the court, <em>Kline, J., </em>on August 21, 1985. Thompson\u2019s untimely petition for certification to appeal was granted by Judge Kline on October 3,1985.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After filing an appeal on the petitioner\u2019s behalf, the public defender subsequently moved to withdraw on the basis of an <em>Anders </em>brief. Just as in the <em>Franko </em>case, Judge Mack denied the public defender\u2019s motion to withdraw, and an untimely motion for review of that denial was filed in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">As previously noted, both motions for review were untimely because neither was filed within ten days of the decision on the motion to withdraw, as required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Practice Book \u00a7 4053. Ordinarily, we would dismiss both motions for their untimeliness and would refuse to consider the merits of either. Because we consider the issue likely to recur, however, we choose in this rare instance to depart from our usual policy and grant review for reasons of judicial economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Each motion essentially seeks our review of the presiding judge\u2019s denial of appellate counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. Before we address the merits of these motions, we must decide whether the procedure set out in <em>Anders </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, and codified in Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 952 through 956; see footnote 2, supra; applies in the context of appeals from habeas corpus judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Although <em>Anders </em>was a habeas corpus action, the opinion in that case focuses only upon \u201cthe extent of the duty of court-appointed appellate counsel to prosecute a <em>first </em>appeal from a criminal conviction, after that attorney has conscientiously determined that there is no merit to the indigent\u2019s appeal.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Anders </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 739. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 952 through 956 implement the <em>Anders </em>principle. The <em>Anders </em>decision is based upon constitutional requirements guaranteed by the sixth amendment in criminal cases. There is, however, no equivalent constitutional right to counsel in habeas corpus cases. <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 107 S. Ct. 1990, 95 L. Ed. 2d 539 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Although the <em>Anders </em>procedure is not, therefore, constitutionally required in habeas corpus appeals, we look beyond this constitutional limitation to the existence of General Statutes \u00a7 51-296, which creates a statutory right to counsel in certain habeas corpus actions. That section mandates that counsel be appointed for an indigent defendant \u201c[i]n any criminal action, <em>in any habeas corpus proceeding arising from a criminal matter, </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>any extradition proceeding, or in any delinquency matter .. . (Emphasis added.) We conclude, moreover, that General Statutes \u00a7 51-296 applies as well to appeals from such habeas corpus proceedings, because no such appeal may be taken unless an appropriate judicial authority has certified pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (b) \u201cthat a question is involved in the decision which ought to be reviewed by the court having jurisdiction . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Because the legislature has created a right to counsel in habeas corpus cases under \u00a7 51-296, and in appeals therefrom, we conclude that the right to appeal in habeas corpus actions should be extended the same protections as those set out in the <em>Anders </em>decision. We, therefore, follow the procedure set out in Practice Book \u00a7 4035 and \u00a7\u00a7 952 through 956; see footnote 2, supra; by referring motions to withdraw based on <em>Anders </em>briefs to the presiding judge of the trial court in those habeas corpus matters specified in General Statutes \u00a7 51-296.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Although we have the authority, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 4035 and 4053, to review the habeas court\u2019s decision, we consider that the habeas court is in the best position to make the <em>Anders </em>determination in the first instance. If, upon the filing of the <em>Anders </em>brief and upon his own independent review of the transcript, record and any brief filed by the defendant, the presiding judge determines that an appealable issue dqes exist, he shall follow the mandate of Practice Book \u00a7 955 by either allowing counsel to withdraw and appointing new counsel to represent the defendant, or by ordering counsel of record to proceed. If the presiding judge determines that no appealable issue properly exists in the case, then the matter should be referred to the judge who granted the petition for certification to appeal, for a determination of whether certification was improvidently granted in the first instance. If that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>judge determines that certification to appeal was improvidently granted, he should vacate his previous certification and notify the clerk of this court. Upon such notification, the appeal will be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. If that judge nonetheless determines that certification was proper, then he shall follow the mandate of Practice Book \u00a7 955 by either allowing counsel to withdraw and appointing new counsel to represent the defendant, or by ordering counsel of record to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">We are aware that the certification requirement of General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (b); see footnote 1, supra; frequently places the judge who tried the habeas corpus case in the uncomfortable position of reviewing his own decision to determine whether an appealable issue exists. While we can understand a judge\u2019s reluctance to deny a petitioner\u2019s request to appeal under those circumstances, we note that such a denial of a petition for certification of appeal does not leave the petitioner without further recourse. If the petition for certification to appeal is denied, the petitioner may bring a writ of error in the Supreme Court under General Statutes \u00a7 52-273 and Practice Book \u00a7 4143, provided that \u201cthe issues sought to be raised do not present any federal question cognizable by the federal district court . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the petitioner cannot pass the federal ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>tion hurdle in order to bring a writ of error, he may then seek relief via the federal habeas corpus route under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Furthermore, the legislature has deemed it appropriate in other contexts for a judge to review his own decision for the limited purpose of determining whether an appealable issue exists. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 54-95 provides that \u201c[n]o appeal may be taken from a judgment denying a petition for a new trial unless, within ten days after the judgment is rendered, the judge who heard the case or a judge of the supreme court or the appellate court, as the case may be, certifies that a question is involved in the decision which ought to be reviewed by the supreme court or by the appellate court. ...\u201d Additionally, General Statutes \u00a7 54-96, which requires the permission of the presiding judge in order for the state to appeal in a criminal case, has ordinarily been considered to apply where the judge who presided at the trial also made the determination of whether to permit an appeal. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>178 Conn. 450, 452, 423 A.2d 118 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1015, 100 S. Ct. 667, 62 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrissey, </em>18 Conn. App. 658, 659, 560 A.2d 471 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Finally, we turn to the issue of res judicata as raised in these cases by Judge Mack. His denials of the motions to withdraw were apparently based on his view that the previous decision granting certification to appeal in each case had res judicata effect on a subsequent motion to withdraw. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">In a habeas corpus case, the adjudication on the merits is the judgment on the habeas petition, and not the subsequent order granting certification to appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Furthermore, because it is clear under <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>199 Conn. 453, 459, 508 A.2d 11 (1986), that a judge is not bound by the decision of another judge made at an earlier stage in the proceedings, Judge Mack was not bound by the earlier decisions of Judges Barry and Kline granting certification to appeal, when he considered the two motions to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">In both cases, the orders denying the motions to withdraw are set aside, and the motions to withdraw are referred to the presiding judge of the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (b) provides: \u201cNo appeal from the judgment rendered in a habeas corpus proceeding brought in order to obtain his release by or in behalf of one who has been convicted of crime may be taken unless the appellant, within ten days after the case is decided, petitions the judge before whom the case was tried or a judge of the supreme court or appellate court to certify that a question is involved in the decision which ought to be reviewed by the court having jurisdiction and the judge so certifies.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4035 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe supreme court, on its own motion, may refer an application to withdraw appearance filed pursuant to Sec. 952 to the trial court for purposes of rendering a decision thereon. The decision of the trial court may be reviewed by the supreme court pursuant to Sec. 4053. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 952 through 956 provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">\u201cSec. 952.--REQUEST BY INITIAL COUNSEL TO WITHDRAW</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-11\">\u201cWhen the defendant is represented at trial by the public defender or when he has counsel appointed for him to prosecute his appeal under the provisions of Sec. 950 and such public defender or counsel, after a conscien<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>tious examination of the case, finds that such an appeal would be wholly frivolous, he shall advise the presiding judge and request permission to withdraw from the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">\u201cSec. 953.--SUBMISSION OF BRIEF</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">\u201cAt the time such request is made, counsel shall submit to the presiding judge a brief which refers to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.
