The defendant had denied the plaintiffs application to construct a single family home, driveway and septic system in a wetland. The plaintiff claims that the court erred in concluding (1) that he was not entitled to a permit as a matter of right pursuant to two particular provisions of the town\u2019s inland wetlands regulations, (2) that the defendant\u2019s decision did not amount to an unconstitutional taking of his property without compensation, and (3) that the defendant\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have fully considered the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>tiff\u2019s claims, the defendant\u2019s responses thereto, the entire record of this case and the trial court\u2019s thoughtful memorandum of decision. On the basis of that review, we conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s claims of error are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-9\"> At oral argument in this court, the plaintiff raised for the first time in the entire history of this case a claim that certain reports were improperly received by the defendant after the administrative hearing. We take no cognizance of this claim because it was not raised in the trial court or in his brief in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
