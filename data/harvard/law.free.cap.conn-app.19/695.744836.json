He claims that the trial court erred (1) in removing him from the courtroom during his trial, and (2) in its instructions to the jury. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-15\">The jury could reasonably have found that on June 23,1985, at approximately 11:30 p.m., the defendant, carrying a sawed-off shotgun, entered a cafe in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Hartford with an unarmed man and announced, \u201cThis is a robbery.\u201d The defendant pointed the gun at Gloria Echevarria, who was sitting behind the bar, and told her to open the cash register. She complied and the unarmed man removed approximately $325 from the cash register. At that point the defendant grabbed the bartender who was emerging from the rear of the cafe and pointed the gun at his neck. He then pushed the bartender against the bar and took approximately $180 from his pockets and wallet. Both robbers then fled and the bartender called the police who later arrested the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The defendant first claims that the trial court erred in removing him from the courtroom during argument on the state\u2019s objection to a question posed to him on direct examination by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The defendant had taken the witness stand on his own behalf when defense counsel inquired, \u201cAnd, to your knowledge, what is the community right where the Friendship Cafe is, if you know?\u201d The state objected to the question on relevancy grounds and the court excused the jury. Before defense counsel could respond to the objection, the state\u2019s attorney sought removal of the defendant, in order to prevent him from tailoring his testimony to the argument. Over defense counsel's objection and exception, the court agreed, ordering the defendant to leave the courtroom, justifying the expulsion on the ground that no testimony was to be taken during his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court violated his right to be present at his trial pursuant to the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. He also argues that the court violated Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 967 and 968.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>By contrast, the state argues that neither the state constitution nor the federal constitution mandates that the defendant be present, where, as here, a legal question concerning the admissibility of testimony was discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">It is well established that a case will not be decided on constitutional grounds if there is some other ground on which it can be decided. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>200 Conn. 310, 322, 511 A.2d 1000 (1986). While both our Supreme Court and this court have addressed the defendant\u2019s right to be present at his trial under the federal constitution no case has been found that addresses this right in relation to our rules of practice. Because those rules furnish an adequate basis for determining the issue before us, we will address it accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Three rules of practice are pertinent to the defendant\u2019s claim. Practice Book \u00a7 967 provides that a \u201cdefendant has the right to be present at the arraignment, at the time of the plea, at evidentiary hearings, <em>at the trial, </em>and at the sentencing hearing . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) Practice Book \u00a7 968 reinforces the defendant\u2019s right to be present by stating that he <em>\u201cmust be present at the trial\u201d </em>(emphasis added) unless the trial court finds that he is represented by counsel and that he has waived his right to be present. Finally, Practice Book \u00a7 970 (3) provides that the <em>\u201cdefendant need not be present </em>. . . [a]t any argument on a question of law or at any conference . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Although we are determining this issue on rules of practice grounds, an examination of cases discussing the constitutional right to presence at trial is helpful. Our Supreme Court has held that \u201c[a] criminal defendant has a constitutional right to be present at all critical stages of his trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Simino, </em>200 Conn. 113, 125, 509 A.2d 1039 (1986); <em>Rushen </em>v. <em>Spain, </em>464 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>114, 104 S. Ct. 453, 78 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1983); <em>see Illinois </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 338, 90 S. Ct. 1057, 25 L. Ed. 2d 353 (1970). When a situation arises in which the defendant is not present during some portion of his trial, the reviewing court must determine whether he was absent during a critical stage and whether he effectively waived his right to be present by his unexcused absence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Simino, </em>supra, 126. The latter question need not be addressed here because both parties agree that the defendant did not waive his right.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Simino, </em>supra, 128, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Olds, </em>171 Conn. 395, 405-406, 370 A.2d 969 (1976), the state asserts that a defendant has no absolute right to be present during discussions of law. Our reading of those cases, however, indicates that such a right would arise if it is determined that his presence bears a reasonably substantial relation to his opportunity to defend. <em>State </em>v. <em>Olds, </em>supra, 406; see <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 106, 54 S. Ct. 330, 78 L. Ed. 674 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">In upholding the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s request to be present, the court, in <em>Olds, </em>examined the record and held that the discussion of law at issue involved pretrial motions, such as motions for production, to quash, to reduce bond and for a jury of twelve and that \u201cthere would have been no \u2018advantage\u2019 to having the defendant present . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Olds, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The right to be present during a discussion of law after the trial has commenced, however, arose in <em>State </em>v. <em>Simino, </em>supra. In <em>Simino, </em>the court held that the defendant\u2019s presence was constitutionally mandated when the court was charging the jury because during that time the \u201c \u2018court is required to state the fundamental legal principles applicable to criminal cases generally, as well as the material legal principles applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>to a particular case and the application of the law to the facts. . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., 128, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Ciaccio, </em>47 N.Y.2d 431, 436, 391 N.E.2d 1347, 418 N.Y.S.2d 371 (1979). Despite the holding that the defendant had a right to be present during the jury charge, the <em>Simino </em>court concluded that the defendant had waived that right by failing to attend court that day, through no fault of the state. <em>State </em>v. Simino, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In the present case, during the enforced absence of the defendant, the trial court sustained the state\u2019s objection to defense counsel\u2019s question to the defendant. It stated that it had previously prohibited him from inquiring into the existence of high crime and drug trafficking in and around the cafe through earlier witnesses he had subpoenaed because such evidence was irrelevant to the case. The court added that defense counsel had failed to interview those witnesses prior to their taking the stand despite the fact that they had been waiting at the courthouse to testify for approximately two days. Consequently, he did not know how those witnesses would respond to his questions and the court would not now permit him to elicit the desired but still irrelevant answers from the defendant. Defense counsel did not respond to those remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s enforced absence bore a reasonably substantial relation to his opportunity to defend himself because he was precluded from hearing the court\u2019s remarks reflecting upon his counsel\u2019s preparation of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Because we interpret Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 967 and 968 as implementing the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be present at trial under the circumstances of the present case, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s order evicting him from the courtroom violated his right to be present at the trial pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 967. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Although the language in Practice Book \u00a7 970 (3) appears to grant the trial court discretion in removing the defendant during questions of law, the facts here clearly demonstrate that a court acts at its peril when it elects to do so during the trial, as opposed to during arguments of pretrial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The defendant urges us to adopt a per se rule of error in any case in which a defendant is ordered to leave the courtroom during the trial, except for reasons of misconduct as provided in Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 891 and 892. Because we strongly favor the defendant\u2019s presence at all times during the trial, the establishment of a per se rule is appealing. On the other hand, because we can envision a situation involving a purely technical violation, we conclude that the better course is a case-by-case analysis, determining harm in the light of the circumstances of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Here, the colloquy that occurred in the defendant\u2019s absence involved the state\u2019s objection to a proposed question which the court sustained on relevancy grounds. The defendant does not challenge that ruling on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, the defendant claims that his absence was harmful because he was precluded from learning of and investigating the court\u2019s remarks concerning his counsel\u2019s preparation of his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">An inquiry into this type of claim is more suited to a habeas corpus proceeding and would therefore be inappropriate in this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>206 Conn. 685, 706-707, 539 A.2d 561 (1988). Hence, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>The defendant\u2019s remaining claims challenge the court\u2019s charge to the jury. He argues (1) that there was insufficient evidence to warrant the court\u2019s instruction on subsection (2) of the definition of robbery found in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133, (2), in the alternative, that the court failed to instruct the jury that they all had to agree on which subsection of \u00a7 53a-133 the defendant violated, (3) that there was insufficient evidence to warrant the court\u2019s instruction on two statutory alternatives found in the definition of larceny as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-118, and (4) that the portion of the court\u2019s instruction concerning the taking of money from the cash register was confusing and erroneous. The defendant concedes that none of these claims of error was raised at trial and asks this court to review them under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In defining the crime of robbery, the court read General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133, which provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person commits robbery when ... he uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person for the purpose of: (1) Preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property or to the retention thereof immediately after the taking; or (2) compelling the owner of such property or another person to deliver up the property or to engage in other conduct which aids in the commission of the larceny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The court then referred to the evidence detailing the taking of money from the cash register to demonstrate how either subsection may apply. Shortly thereafter, it mentioned the robbery of the bartender in order to remind the jury that the case involved two separate robbery charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">At the outset, we note that the defendant\u2019s first two challenges to the court\u2019s charge are directed solely to the robbery of the bartender. Turning to his first claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>he argues that the court erred in instructing the jury on the second subsection of \u00a7 53a-133 because there was no evidence that the bartender was compelled \u201cto deliver up\u201d his wallet and the cash. Therefore, he claims that the judgment of conviction on that count must be set aside and a new trial must be ordered. Because a defendant has a constitutional right to be acquitted unless proven guilty of each element of a charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt, we will review this claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>202 Conn. 349, 363, 521 A.2d 150 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Messier, </em>16 Conn. App. 455, 469, 549 A.2d 270 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>8 Conn. App. 620, 625, 514 A.2d 345 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">\u201c \u2018[Wjhere a person may have been convicted under more than one statutory alternative, the judgment cannot be supported unless the evidence was sufficient to establish guilt under each statutory provision which the trier may have relied upon.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>190 Conn. 639, 650-51, 462 A.2d 1021 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Both parties agree that the evidence depicted the defendant placing a shotgun to the bartender\u2019s neck, turning him around and ordering him to place his hands on the bar while the other individual went through the bartender\u2019s pants pockets retrieving his wallet and cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The state argues that the defendant takes an excessively restrictive view of the interpretation of subsection (2). It contends that the proof necessary to support such an instruction need only demonstrate that the victim was compelled to yield control of the property. Thus, in this case the force used placed the bartender in a position where he would be compelled to make himself accessible to a taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">To support its argument, the state relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra. There we said that \u201c[a] common sense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>analysis [of \u00a7 53a-133] illustrates that the two subsections overlap. . . . \u2018[Preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property\u2019 is at least a first cousin of\u2018compelling the owner of such property . . . to deliver up the property.\u2019 \u201d Id., 625. In <em>Webb, </em>we disagreed with the defendant\u2019s argument that the court erred by instructing the jury on both subsections rather than only on subsection (2) because he was charged only with \u201c \u2018[forcing the victim] to sign over to him her paycheck.\u2019 \u201d Id. Rather, \u201cwhile we concede that [such] language ... is covered by subsection (2), that does not logically lead to a conclusion that subsection (1) is excluded.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">By contrast, the defendant urges us to follow <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra. There, the trial court also instructed the jury on both subsections. On appeal, the state conceded that the evidence supported an instruction only as to subsection (1). In finding reversible error, our Supreme Court stated, \u201c \u2018[t]he court has a duty to submit to the jury no issue upon which the evidence would not reasonably support a finding.\u2019 \u201d Id., 364, quoting <em>Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>186 Conn. 632, 641, 443 A.2d 471 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">In light of our interpretation of \u00a7 53a-133 in <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, we are unpersuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument and his reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra. There, the victim felt a \u201ctug\u201d on her shoulder where the strap of her pocketbook rested and immediately lost consciousness. She testified that she \u201cdid not see the person who had taken her pocketbook, but believed he had approached her from behind.\u201d Id., 352. As the state conceded, this scenario leaves no room for any interpretation other than that the defendant\u2019s actions prevented or overcame the victim\u2019s resistance to his seizure of her pocketbook and thus supported an instruction only as to subsection (1). The evidence in the present case, however, does not permit such a clear-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>cut analysis and we are satisfied that the trial court did not err by instructing the jury on both subsections.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">We now turn to the defendant\u2019s alternate argument that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that each member had to agree on which subsection of \u00a7 53a-133 the defendant violated with respect to the robbery of the bartender. As a result, the defendant claims that his sixth amendment right to a unanimous jury verdict was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Although the defendant failed to take an exception to the absence of such an instruction, his claim is entitled to a limited review to determine whether his sixth amendment right was compromised. <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>211 Conn. 18, 33, 557 A.2d 917 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">When a trial court charges the jury on statutory alternatives that are supported by the evidence and are conceptually distinct, it must also instruct the jury that each member must agree on which alternative the defendant committed if it renders a conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">We have previously determined that the evidence in this case supported a charge on both subsections of \u00a7 53a-133. Moreover, we also stated that we interpret those subsections as \u201cfirst cousins\u201d and \u201calmost indistinguishable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 625, 626. Because \u201c \u2018[t]he jury should not be obliged to decide between two statutorily prohibited ways of committing the crime if the two ways are practically indistinguishable\u2019 \u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>209 Conn. 322, 334, 551 A.2d 1206 (1988), quoting <em>Manson </em>v. <em>State, </em>101 Wis. 2d 413, 430, 304 N.W.2d 729 (1981); we conclude that subsections (1) and (2) are not conceptually distinct and therefore a unanimity charge was not required. Thus, there was no danger of a constitutional violation and the defendant\u2019s claim is not entitled to further review. Id.; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>14 Conn. App. 10, 39, 539 A.2d 1005, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 891, 109 S. Ct. 226, 102 L. Ed. 2d 217 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">In his next claim, the defendant argues that the trial court erred by reading the entire definition of larceny from General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The trial court instructed the jury that larceny encompasses, inter alia, a wrongful taking, obtaining or withholding of the property of the owner. The defendant contends that this instruction placed statutory alternatives before the jury which were not supported by the evidence because there was no proof in the record of an \u201cobtaining\u201d or \u201cwithholding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">We will not address this claim of error because the defendant failed to preserve it for appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>206 Conn. 621, 627, 539 A.2d 114 (1989). Moreover, our reading of the charge discloses that the court specifically apprised the jury that the state was alleging a \u201cwrongful taking.\u201d Hence, there was no danger that their verdict was based on an improper element of larceny. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">The defendant argues, in this final claim, that the trial court\u2019s instruction concerning the taking of money from the cash register was confusing and erroneous. The state concedes and we agree that this issue is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Zayas, </em>195 Conn. 611, 616, 490 A.2d 68 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">The thrust of the defendant\u2019s argument is that the court was inconsistent in identifying the owner of the money taken from the cash register. As a result, the jury may not have understood the elements of the crime of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">\u201cIt is elementary jurisprudence that a jury charge is to be considered in its entirety and no part of it is to be critically dissected in order to find a technical inac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>curacy in one portion, read in artificial isolation from the overall charge.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>17 Conn. App. 391, 394, 552 A.2d 837 (1989). We are satisfied that the jury was aware, on the basis of the evidence, that Echevarria was an employee of the cafe and was sitting behind the bar, when the defendant forced her to open the cash register, and that Morganson, who was not present, was the owner of the cafe. The court\u2019s reference to \u201c[the robbery] against the Friendship Cafe\u201d does not distort these facts or leave any element of the crime misunderstood. Having reviewed the charge from the standpoint of its effect on the jury in assisting it in reaching a proper verdict; <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>17 Conn. App. 273, 279, 552 A.2d 438 (1989); we are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">In this opinion Daly, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\"> Moreover, we note that the defendant was present at trial during an earlier argument concerning the state\u2019s objection to similar questions and, as a result, he was aware of the basis of the court\u2019s ruling that the testimony elicited was irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b721-9\"> A habeas corpus action alleging ineffectiveness of counsel is pending at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b727-7\">Borden, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9Kb\">concurring. I agree with the result and with much of the reasoning of the majority. I write separately, however, because I take a somewhat different view of the basis of the conclusion that the trial court erred in excluding the defendant from the trial. In my view, Practice Book \u00a7 967 is sufficient to decide this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">It is Practice Book \u00a7 967 which governs the defendant\u2019s <em>right </em>to be present at his trial. That section, which is entitled \u201cRight of Presence,\u201d provides that \u201c[t]he defendant has the right to be present at the arraignment, at the time of the plea, at evidentiary hearings, <em>at the trial, </em>and at the sentencing hearing, except as provided in Sec. 966 . . . . <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">By contrast, Practice Book \u00a7 968, entitled \u201cContinued Presence Not Required,\u201d refers to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>instances where the defendant \u201cmust be present,\u201d namely, \u201cat the trial and at the sentencing hearing . . . . \u201d Thus, \u00a7 968 refers to those situations where the defendant may not absent himself unless he is excused by the court. Put another way, this section refers to those situations where the defendant has no right to be absent. This reading is buttressed by \u00a7 969, which provides, in general, that if the defendant is not present \u201cat the trial or a part thereof or the sentencing hearing and his absence has not been excused,\u201d the court may issue a capias to compel his presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">I agree with the majority that, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court violated Practice Book \u00a7 967 by excluding the defendant from the courtroom during the trial. Although his right to be present at trial may not be absolute, the state\u2019s argument at trial, namely, that he might tailor his testimony to legal arguments made in his presence; see footnote 2, infra; was an insufficient ground on which to remove him from the witness stand and to exclude him from the courtroom while those arguments were made. There simply is no basis, either in the language of Practice Book \u00a7 967, in its purpose or in the constitutional background against which it must be read, for such an exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">1 agree with the majority that the transcript of what occurred in the defendant\u2019s absence indicates that the defendant was not harmed by the court\u2019s error in excluding him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fact that his attorney had earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>been unsuccessful in attempting to present irrelevant evidence about the high incidence of crime in the area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>of the cafe, through witnesses whom he may not have interviewed beforehand, must have been known to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the defendant, because that had happened in his presence in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>I agree with the majority that a violation of Practice Book \u00a7 967 should not call for a rule of reversal per se, without an inquiry into its actual harm to the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McNellis, </em>15 Conn. App. 416, 433, 546 A.2d 292, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 809, 548 A.2d 441 (1988). I therefore agree that the court\u2019s error was harmless because, whether it is measured by non-constitutional or constitutional standards of harmless error, it could not have impaired the defendant\u2019s right to defend himself, and could not have contributed to the verdict.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-10\"> Section 966 is simply a Practice Book reference, entitled \u201cPresence of Defendant,\u201d that encompasses \u00a7\u00a7 967 through 970.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\"> The entire incident is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">\u201cDefense Attorney:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">\u201cQ.

I ask that the witness be \u2014 I know it\u2019s an offer of proof but if he\u2019s going to start characterizing again, I want the witness, now that he is a witness, I think he should be in the alcove because I think [the defense attorney], I think he will virtually tell him what to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-22\">\u201cThe Court: Okay, take the witness outside of the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-23\">\u201cDefense Attorney: I object to that, your Honor, and I take exception to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-24\">\u201cThe Court: You may take exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-25\">\u201cDefense Attorney: As a witness \u2014 the jury can be excused but the witness should be allowed to remain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-26\">\u201cThe Court: This is not testimony.

I would cite Tait and LaPlante the page that I\u2019ve already given to the Court. You can\u2019t impeach \u2014 the second part of that page talks about impeaching the character and certainly characterizes someone as being involved in drugs as character evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">\u201cThe Court: It says, while it is true that witnesses do not belong to any party and may be called by either or both parties, for impeachment purposes, the rules do assign a proprietary interest to witnesses. Usually there is no question about that a witness belongs to the party who calls him to the stand. If one side recalls a witness first called by his opponent, the Court has the discretion to rule that the witness be deemed that of the recalling party unless that party is seriously disadvantaged by such a ruling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">\u201cDefense Attorney: Seriously disadvantaged by such a ruling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-10\">\u201cThe Court: Now, you called them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-11\">\u201cDefense Attorney: It\u2019s prejudicial to my client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-12\">\u201cThe Court: Excuse me, you called them and none of them were surprised, none of them were hostile, they answered all of your questions directly and you just couldn\u2019t do anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-13\">\u201cDefense Attorney: One of the things that I think the Court has knowledge of is the fact that these people never reported to me, they reported to the State\u2019s Attorney even though\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-14\">\u201cThe Court: You never went out of your way to even question them, they had been outside this courtroom for two days now, two and a half days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-15\">\u201cState\u2019s Attorney: And I will state that as an officer of the Court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-16\">\u201cThe Court: You never went up and said, may I speak to you? You subpoenaed them without even knowing what their testimony was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-17\">\u201cDefense Attorney: Then why would they, without any form of aggravation or argumentation, why did they go to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office when they arrived at court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-18\">\u201cState\u2019s Attorney: Can you state that that is the truth as an officer of the court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-19\">\u201cDefense Attorney: I saw them coming from upstairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-20\">\u201cThe Court: So what?
