J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atb\">In this dissolution action, the plaintiff appeals and the defendant cross appeals from various orders of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">The marriage of the parties was dissolved on July 20, 1978, at which time a written separation agreement was approved and incorporated by reference into the decree of dissolution. The provision of the separation agreement to which this appeal relates provided for postmajority support, namely, the college and professional educational expenses of the parties\u2019 two children. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>According to article 8.2 of the agreement, each party was to pay the cost of the college and professional education of the children in direct proportion to their adjusted gross incomes, as reflected on their income tax returns at the time the expenses were incurred, after deducting the first $25,000 of their incomes. Educational expenses were defined by the agreement to be tuition, room and board, books and fees, reasonable travel allowances and reasonable personal allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">At the time of the dissolution, both parties were employed as attorneys in this state. In 1981, the defendant remarried and in 1983 moved to Virginia, where she did not resume employment. In September, 1987, the defendant filed a motion for contempt, claiming that, for 1986 and for 1987 through the date of the contempt motion, she was not required to contribute to the college and professional educational expenses of the children because her adjusted gross income for those years did not exceed $25,000 and that, accordingly, the plaintiff was solely responsible for payment of the expenses. The defendant further claimed that the plaintiff had refused and failed to pay educational expenses of $22,690.15 during those years and that she had paid them. The motion for contempt sought reimbursement from the plaintiff, as well as attorney\u2019s fees. At the time of the defendant\u2019s motion, both of the parties\u2019 children were over the age of majority and enrolled in a college or professional school.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The plaintiff denied that he owed monies to the defendant for educational expenses and raised as a defense the claim that an oral agreement between the parties had been made in 1983 that modified the education provision of the separation agreement and substituted a new formula for calculating the obligations of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>The trial court found that an honest disagreement existed between the parties over their obligations to contribute to the educational expenses of their children and that the plaintiff did not wilfully disregard an order of the court. It, therefore, did not hold the plaintiff in contempt. The court also found that the parties had entered into an oral agreement in 1983 that altered their obligations for the payment of the educational expenses, but that the oral agreement was not effective to modify the provision of the separation agreement regarding education incorporated into the dissolution judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The court concluded that the provision of the separation agreement relating to education remained as an order of the court and that the provision controlled the court\u2019s determination of whether any monies were due from the plaintiff. The court found that for the years 1986 and 1987, the defendant\u2019s adjusted gross income was less than $25,000 and that, therefore, the plaintiff was solely responsible for the educational expenses incurred during that period. After deducting certain expenses not included in the definition of educational expenses contained in the separation agreement, the plaintiff was ordered to pay the sum of $18,948 to the defendant, payment to be made one year after the date that all college and professional school studies of the parties\u2019 children have been completed. The court denied the defendant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Subsequent to the trial court\u2019s ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion for contempt, the plaintiff filed a motion to modify the provision of the dissolution decree relating to the college and professional education of the children, claiming that a substantial change in the circumstances of the parties had occurred. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>tiff\u2019s motion to modify, on the ground that the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over a motion to modify an order of postmajority child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred (1) in failing to consider the alleged oral agreement between the parties as a defense to the defendant\u2019s motion for contempt, (2) in failing to consider the earning capacity of the defendant, and (3) in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s motion to modify.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant has cross appealed, claiming that the trial court erred (1) in failing to award her attorney\u2019s fees, (2) in delaying the required payment of monies by the plaintiff, and (3) in finding the existence of an oral agreement between the parties. We find error on the cross appeal and no error on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s first claim of error is that the trial court erred in failing to consider the 1983 oral agreement as a defense to the defendant\u2019s motion to hold the plaintiff in contempt for failure to pay educational expenses. The trial court found that, although there was an oral agreement in 1983, that agreement was ineffective to modify the obligations of the parties under the education provision of the separation agreement executed in 1978 and incorporated by reference in the judgment rendered in 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The-separation agreement that was incorporated into the dissolution decree explicitly provided in article 9.1 that any modification of the terms of the agreement was required to be in writing in order to be effective.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Agreements between parties regarding the education <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>of children beyond the age of eighteen are required to be in writing. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66; <em>Arseniadis </em>v. <em>Arseniadis, </em>2 Conn. App. 239, 244, 477 A.2d 152 (1984). The provisions of the separation agreement became an order of the court when incorporated into the dissolution judgment, and could not be modified by the action of the parties without further order of the court. Decrees in a dissolution action cannot be modified by acts of the parties without further decree or order by the court. <em>Grobstein </em>v. <em>Grobstein, </em>14 Conn. Sup. 378, 379 (1946). Thus, although the provision of the separation agreement could be modified by order of the court pursuant to a written agreement of the parties; see <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>13 Conn. App. 355, 364-65, 536 A.2d 985 (1988); the oral agreement of the parties was ineffective to modify the separation agreement incorporated in the decree of dissolution. The trial court, therefore, did not err in refusing to consider the agreement as a defense to the defendant\u2019s motion for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The plaintiff also claims that the trial court erred in considering only the defendant\u2019s actual earnings, rather than her earning capacity in determining the contribution for educational expenses due from the defendant under the terms of the separation agreement. The trial court found that the defendant\u2019s adjusted gross income for 1986 and 1987 was less than $25,000 and thus, under the terms of the agreement, the defendant was not liable for any educational expenses incurred during that period. The plaintiff claims that, because the defendant had voluntarily ceased working as an attorney, her earning capacity, rather than her actual income, should be used in determining his required contribution to the education expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The terms of the separation agreement relating to college and professional educational expenses provided in pertinent part that \u201cthe husband and wife agree to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>be responsible for the payment of the children\u2019s college expenses in direct proportion to their respective adjusted gross incomes as reflected on their income tax returns at the time such expenses are incurred and after deducting the first $25,000 from such adjusted gross income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u201cA judgment rendered in accordance with the stipulation of the parties is to be construed and regarded as a binding contract. <em>Caracansi </em>v. <em>Caracansi, </em>4 Conn. App. 645, 650, 496 A.2d 225, cert. denied, 197 Conn. 805, 499 A.2d 56 (1985). Construction of such an agreement is an issue of fact to be resolved by the trial court as the trier of fact, and subject to our review under the clearly erroneous standard. See <em>Lavigne </em>v. <em>Lavigne, </em>3 Conn. App. 423, 427, 488 A.2d 1290 (1985). The construction and interpretation of the agreement necessarily depends upon the intent of the parties as manifested by the language of the agreement. Id., 428.\u201d <em>Mihalyak </em>v. <em>Mihalyak, </em>11 Conn. App. 610, 616, 529 A.2d 213 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The terms of the separation agreement regarding the college and professional education of the parties\u2019 children provided a precise formula for calculating the amount of the contribution due from each party. The criteria on which such a determination is to be based are the adjusted gross incomes of the parties as reflected on their income tax returns for the period in which the expenses are incurred. There is no mention of the parties\u2019 earning capacities, nor could the language of the agreement be interpreted to include a capacity to earn. In fact, the agreement specifically connects the term \u201cadjusted gross income\u201d to the term\u2019s meaning for federal income tax purposes. The trial court, therefore, did not err in determining the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ties\u2019 respective contributions based on their adjusted gross incomes, rather than on their earning capacities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Finally, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s motion to modify the terms of the separation agreement relating to the college and professional education of the parties\u2019 children. The trial court concluded that, absent written agreement of the parties to a modification, it did not have jurisdiction to modify provisions for the support of children beyond the age of majority. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The jurisdiction of the Superior Court to dissolve marriages and to make and enforce support orders as incidental to divorce decrees, derives from statutory authority. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>177 Conn. 47, 49-50, 411 A.2d 25 (1979). The jurisdiction of the Superior Court to make orders of child support pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56 extends only to minor children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior to the enactment of Public Acts 1977, No. 77-488 \u00a7 1, amending General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Supe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>rior Court lacked the power to enforce postmajority support orders through contempt proceedings, even when the parties had stipulated to such an order. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">In 1977, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66, governing the incorporation of agreements into decrees of dissolution, was amended to provide that \u201c[i]f the agreement is in writing and provides for the care, education, maintenance or support of a child beyond the age of eighteen, it may also be incorporated or otherwise made a part of any such order and shall be enforceable to the same extent as any other provision of such order or decree, notwithstanding the provisions of section 1-ld.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66. \u201cThe purpose of the amendment was to ensure that a written agreement involving support for adult children and submitted to the court by the parties in connection with an action for a dissolution of marriage could be incorporated into the judgment or orders of the court, thereby making such orders enforceable through contempt proceedings.\u201d <em>Arseniadis </em>v. <em>Arseniadis, </em>supra. Thus, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-66, as amended, written agreements for the support of adult children may be incorporated by refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>ence into the dissolution decree or may be the subject of orders of the court and are enforceable through contempt proceedings. Absent, however, a written agreement by the parties, the court does not have jurisdiction to order payment of child support beyond the age of majority and may not enforce such an order. Id., 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Agreements for the support of adult children, once incorporated into or made the subject of orders of the court, may be modified by order of the court pursuant to a written agreement of the parties. See <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>supra. The question presented in this appeal is whether the trial court has jurisdiction, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to modify, without a written agreement of both parties, a postmajority child support order entered pursuant to \u00a7 46b-66.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 provides that the trial court may modify final orders for payment of alimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>or support upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party. The plaintiff argues that the power granted by \u00a7 46b-66 to enforce written agreements concerning postmajority child support includes the power to modify such agreements pursuant to \u00a7 46b-86. His argument rests on the proposition that because \u00a7 46b-86 (a), governing modifications of alimony, support orders and judgments, states that \u201cany final order\u201d may be modified upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party, the statute must permit modification of postmajority child support orders.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The terms of \u00a7 46b-86 (a) cannot be expanded to include matters beyond the court\u2019s jurisdiction. \u201cAny\u201d does not include all possible or hypothetical orders but only those orders that the court has the power to formulate. The jurisdiction of the Superior Court as it relates to postmajority child support derives solely from \u00a7 46b-66. See <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>supra. Pursuant to \u00a7 46b-66, the court has the limited power to accept, incorporate and enforce a written agreement of child support that extends beyond a child\u2019s age of majority. <em>Arseniadis </em>v. <em>Arseniadis, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Public Acts 1977, No. 77-488, \u00a7 1, had the limited purpose of permitting a contract for the support of adult children to be incorporated into a judgment or order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>of the court, thereby making such orders enforceable through contempt proceedings, rather than requiring that such a contract be enforced through a separate contract action. Id., 244-45. The act did not grant the trial court the power to fashion or enforce its own orders concerning postmajority child support. It did grant the court a limited power of veto over the parties\u2019 agreement to provide such support, to be exercised only if the agreement were not \u201cfair or equitable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">A parent\u2019s obligation to support his or her children exists only until the age of majority. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84. The court cannot, without the consent of both parents, alter a voluntary obligation undertaken by a parent beyond his or her legal obligation. See <em>Jones </em>v. Jones, 244 Ga. 32, 257 S.E.2d 537 (1979). To accept the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the trial court has jurisdiction to modify postmajority child support agreements pursuant to \u00a7 46b-86 would be to conclude that the trial court has greater, power during a modification proceeding than it had during the original dissolution proceeding. See id. We conclude that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s motion to modify the provisions of the dissolution decree relating to the college and professional education of the parties\u2019 children, and therefore, it did not err in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The defendant claims on cross appeal that the trial court erred in failing to award her attorney\u2019s fees. The separation agreement incorporated into the dissolution decree provided: \u201c12.2 In the event that it shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that either party shall have breached any of the agreements herein contained . . . the offending party shall pay to the other party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>After finding for the defendant, and ordering the plaintiff to pay to the defendant the sum of $18,948, the court denied the defendant\u2019s request for counsel fees. The court denied the request on the grounds that the plaintiff did not act unreasonably in delaying payments to the defendant and, therefore, did not breach the agreement \u201cunder the circumstances of this case.\u201d The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff owed the defendant the sum of $18,948 pursuant to the agreement was, in and of itself, a finding that the agreement was breached, and that the trial court therefore erred in refusing to award her attorney\u2019s fees. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u201cOrdinarily, the trial court must consider the statutory criteria provided in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-62 and 46b-82 in determining whether to award counsel fees; <em>Turgeon v. Turgeon, </em>190 Conn. 269, 280-81, 460 A.2d 1260 (1983); and its discretion in awarding such fees is rarely disturbed. Id., 281.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Goold </em>v. <em>Goold, </em>11 Conn. App. 268, 288, 527 A.2d 696, cert. denied, 204 Conn. 810, 528 A.2d 1156 (1987). When, however, the parties have provided for the payment of counsel fees in their separation agreement, the court must rely on the relevant provisions of the separation agreement. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">In this case, the parties\u2019 separation agreement required that a party found by a court to be in breach of the agreement pay reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the other party. The trial court found that although a reimbursement was owed by the plaintiff to the defendant, the plaintiff was not in breach of the agreement because he had continued to make direct payments to the children during the period in question and because the delay of payments to the defendant was reasonable in light of \u201cthe defendant\u2019s prior agreements and contributions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>A trial court\u2019s construction of a separation agreement is an issue of fact subject to review under the limited standard of whether it is clearly erroneous. <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>9 Conn. App. 498, 501, 519 A.2d 1237 (1987). The action of the trial court will not be disturbed unless it abused its legal discretion in making its determination. Id. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the plaintiff owed monies to the defendant under the terms of the parties\u2019 separation agreement, but was not in breach of the agreement in light of the facts of the case and therefore not liable for attorney\u2019s fees. See <em>Goold </em>v. <em>Goold, </em>supra, 288-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The defendant also claims that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering that the payment of monies due by the plaintiff to the defendant be delayed until one year after the date all college and professional school studies of the parties\u2019 children have been completed. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The parties\u2019 separation agreement provided that they were to be responsible for the payment of the children\u2019s college and professional school expenses in direct proportion to their adjusted gross income as reflected on their tax returns at the time such expenses were incurred. The agreement, however, does not provide for any specific time by which payment must be made. The court found that, under the terms of this provision, the plaintiff had failed to make required payments for the years 1986 and 1987 and thus owed the defendant monies. Instead of ordering payment of the monies immediately or within some short or certain period of time, however, the trial court delayed the required payment until some uncertain and potentially distant date in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">In determining the obligations of the parties under the separation agreement, the court was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>rely on the relevant provisions of the agreement and was not free to add its own terms to the agreement. See <em>Goold </em>v. <em>Goold, </em>supra, 288. Because the parties\u2019 separation agreement providing for the payment of educational expenses by the parties does not authorize the delay of payments until one year after the completion date of the children\u2019s college and professional education, it was erroneous for the trial court to have grafted such a provision onto the agreement. The sum found by the court to be due was for reimbursement of expenses previously incurred. The defendant is entitled to the sum of $18,948, payment to be made as in any other judgment rendered by a court. Cf. <em>Bucy </em>v. <em>Bucy, </em>19 Conn. App. 5, 560 A.2d 483 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court erred in finding the existence of an oral agreement between the parties modifying their obligations under the education provisions of the separation agreement. The defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s finding of an oral agreement influenced the court\u2019s determination that the plaintiff was not in breach of the separation agreement and therefore not liable for attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The trial court found that the parties had entered into an oral agreement in 1983 that altered the parties\u2019 obligations under the education provision of their separation agreement, but specifically found that the parties\u2019 failure to have the oral modification reduced to writing and approved by the court rendered it ineffective. Although in its memorandum of decision the court mentioned the \u201cprior agreements\u201d of the parties as one factor supporting its determination that the plaintiff was not in breach of the separation agreement and thus not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>liable for attorney\u2019s fees, the court also enumerated other factors. Thus, even if the trial court erred in finding the existence of an oral agreement, there remains an adequate factual basis for its conclusion that the plaintiff did not breach the separation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">There is no error on the appeal. There is error in part on the cross appeal, the judgment is set aside as to the order delaying payment on the judgment and the case is remanded with direction to render judgments in favor of the defendant in the amount of $18,948.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-9\"> Another claim of error, that the court erred in its monetary award to the defendant, encompasses the first two claims of error, and is not, therefore, separately considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b170-10\"> A provision of a separation agreement precluding modification absent a writing has been interpreted to preclude the parties, but not a court, from modifying such an agreement without a writing.

This section shall not apply to assignments under section 46b-81 or to any assignment of the estate or a portion thereof of one party to the other party under prior law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b175-12\"> In <em>Pickman </em>v. <em>Pickman, </em>6 Conn. App. 271, 505 A.2d 4 (1986), the defendant sought a deletion of any obligation to pay postmajority expenses, rather than an alteration or modification of such an obligation. The issue, however, was characterized by the parties as one of \u201cmodification.\u201d In fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>the </em>issue to be resolved was whether a provision that the defendant should pay postmajority educational expenses \u201cas he is financially able to\u201d was invalid because of undue influence or equitable considerations. Id., 274-75.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b176-10\"> The defendant also argues that because \u00a7 46b-86 does not specifically exclude post eighteen years old support, but does exclude assignments of property or estate of the parties to one another or to third parties, the statute must include such support orders. The excluded orders as enumerated in the statute, however, are those which the court would otherwise have had the jurisdiction to modify because it had the power to fashion such orders in the first place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b180-7\"> Because we have concluded that the trial court erred in delaying the payment of monies to the defendant, it is unnecessary to consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the court\u2019s finding of an oral agreement had an impact on its decision to order such a delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
