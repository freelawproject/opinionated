In January, 1984, the respondent initiated a paternity action against the petitioner seeking a judicial determination that the petitioner was the father of her son born on August 26,1983. On August 3, 1984, the trial court approved a stipulation of judgment, agreed to by the parties and signed by their attorneys, in which the petitioner stipulated to paternity and agreed to provide financial support for the child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsequently, on August 16, 1984, pursuant to the stipulated judgment, the petitioner signed an acknowledgment of paternity that was witnessed and signed by a notary public. That document was then signed by the respondent and filed in the court on November 6, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">On November 9, 1987, the petitioner initiated the present action for a new trial pursuant to General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>utes \u00a7 52-270 (a). After a hearing, the trial court dismissed the petition finding that the petitioner had failed to meet his burden of proving he was entitled to a new trial. In both the prior paternity action and the present action for a new trial, the petitioner was represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">A petition for a new trial is a statutory remedy that is essentially equitable in nature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grimes, </em>154 Conn. 314, 325, 228 A.2d 141 (1966). General Statutes \u00a7 52-270 sets forth the limited circumstances in which a new trial will be granted. The petitioner has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to a new trial on the grounds claimed. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 718, 719-20, 461 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1011, 104 S. Ct. 533, 78 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1983). The petition is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Rizzo </em>v. <em>Pack, </em>15 Conn. App. 312, 315, 544 A.2d 252 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u201cA petition will never be granted except upon substantial grounds. It does not furnish a substitute for, or an alternative to, an ordinary appeal but applies only when no other remedy is adequate and when in equity and good conscience relief against a judgment should be granted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grimes, </em>supra; <em>Rizzo </em>v. <em>Pack, </em>supra. \u201cIn considering a petition, trial judges must give first consideration to the proposition that there must be an end to litigation. <em>Krooner </em>v. <em>State, </em>137 Conn. 58, 68, 75 A.2d 51 (1950).\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>supra, 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Although General Statutes \u00a7 52-270 permits the court to grant a new trial upon proof of \u201creasonable cause,\u201d the circumstances in which reasonable cause may be found are limited. <em>Wetzel </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>202 Conn. 561, 565, 522 A.2d 288 (1987). \u201cThe basic test of \u2018reasonable cause\u2019 is whether a litigant, despite the exercise of due diligence, has been deprived of a fair opportunity to have a case heard on appeal. ... \u2018A new trial may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>be granted \u201cto prevent injustice in cases where the usual remedy by appeal does not lie or where, if there is an adequate remedy by appeal, the party has been prevented from pursuing it by fraud, mistake or accident.\u201d <em>Krooner </em>v. <em>State, </em>[supra 60]. Absent such special circumstances, \u201c[a] petition for a new trial does not furnish a substitute for, or an alternative to, an ordinary appeal.\u201d . . .\u2019 <em>Wetzel </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>supra, 565.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Rizzo </em>v. <em>Pack, </em>supra, 317-18. To prevail, the petitioner must establish that the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition constituted a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Wetzel </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>supra, 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in failing to find that General Statutes \u00a7 46b-172 (b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>stituted \u201creasonable cause\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 52-270, thereby entitling him to a hearing on the issue of paternity. The linchpin of the petitioner\u2019s claim is that under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-172 (b), he has an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to be \u201creheard\u201d on the issue of paternity. Because we find this contention to be without merit, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">We begin our analysis by reviewing the purposes and history of \u00a7 46b-172 and paternity matters generally. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-160 through 46b-179d. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-160 sets forth the procedure by which a mother or expectant mother may initiate a paternity action by petitioning the court to establish the paternity of a child born out of wedlock. In a prosecution under \u00a7 46b-160, either party, the mother or the putative father, may demand a trial by a jury of six. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-164.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>is required before a petition is withdrawn or settled, unless an agreement is made pursuant to \u00a7 46b-172. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-170.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-172 provides a procedure by which paternity may be acknowledged in writing by a putative father and mother. Unlike a suit initiated pursuant to \u00a7 46b-160, the acknowledgment procedure provides an alternative to a full scale judicial proceeding, and an agreement reached pursuant to it does not require court approval. The acknowledgment procedure may be followed \u201c[i]n lieu of or in conclusion of\u201d a paternity action initiated pursuant to \u00a7 46b-160. Once a person signs a written acknowledgment form, that form is filed with the court and has \u201cthe same force and effect as a judgment of the court . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-172 (a). As to the issue of paternity, that judgment is res judicata, and is reviewable by the court only through a petition for a hearing on that issue filed within three years of the entry of the judgment. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-172 (b). Since its enactment, \u00a7 46b-172 (b) has been amended by the legislature and interpreted by our courts and a federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Our review of the legislative history and case law interpreting this section convinces us that the petitioner\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 46b-172 (b) and <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Maher, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>527 F. Sup. 10 (D. Conn. 1980), for the proposition that he has an \u201cabsolute right to be reheard\u201d on the issue of paternity, is misplaced. In 1980, \u00a7 46b-172 (b) provided: \u201c[T]he prior judgment as to paternity shall be res judicata as to that issue and shall not be reconsidered by the court.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 46b-172 (b). Thus, under the original version of \u00a7 46b-172 (b), once a putative father acknowledged paternity, that action was conclusive and could not be challenged in a future court proceeding. In interpreting the 1980 version of the statute, a federal court held that, to the extent that \u00a7 46b-172 (b) precluded a putative father who had acknowledged paternity by signing an acknowledgment form from thereafter litigating that issue in a judicial proceeding for the purpose of determining his support obligations, that section was unconstitutional. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>supra. In <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>the putative father signed an acknowledgment form supplied by the family relations office of the state in which he acknowledged paternity and agreed to support the child financially. The form did not contain any information regarding the putative father\u2019s rights to counsel, or to a hearing on the issue of paternity, nor was there any language explaining that the acknowledgment constituted a waiver of his rights. The putative father was not represented by an attorney at the time he signed the acknowledgment form, and no formal judicial hearing was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Since the court\u2019s ruling in <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>our courts have had the opportunity to review that holding and its application. \u201cThe class to which the ruling of <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>supra, applies is clearly that of putative fathers who executed a written acknowledgment of paternity pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-172 and <em>were never given an opportunity to litigate the issue of paternity.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>3 Conn. App. 322, 326, 487 A.2d 1117 (1985); <em>Stone </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>Maher, </em>supra, 18. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Maher </em>is inapposite to a situation \u201cwhere the [putative father], who was represented by counsel, appeared and participated in a judicial proceeding in which his status as father of the minor child was raised and adjudicated. . . . See <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>Vogel, </em>178 Conn. 358, 363, 422 A.2d 271 (1979).\u201d <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>supra. Nor does <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Maher </em>apply under circumstances in which the putative father could \u201chave litigated the question of paternity, but he chose not to.\u201d <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>supra. Under circumstances in which a putative father was represented by counsel and elected not to contest the issue of paternity, we will assume that he, unlike the plaintiff in <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>was aware of the consequences of his decision. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In response to the decision in <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>the General Assembly amended \u00a7 46b-172 (b) to provide a procedure by which a putative father could obtain a hearing on the issue of paternity after signing an acknowledgment form by filing a. petition for a hearing within three years of the judgment. General Statutes (Rev. to 1982) \u00a7 46b-172 (b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Implicit in a petition for a hearing on the issue of paternity under \u00a7 46b-172 (b) is that the defendant <em>never had the opportunity to have his day in court </em>on that issue in the first place. See <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>supra, 326 n.6; <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>3 Conn. App. 235, 486 A.2d 1138 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In view of the established law in this area, we conclude that there is no \u201cabsolute right to be reheard\u201d on the issue of paternity as the petitioner maintains. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>It is equally clear that the petitioner in this case does not fall within the class of persons that the court in <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>sought to protect. The record in the present case reveals that in August, 1984, the trial court approved a stipulated judgment, signed by the parties\u2019 attorneys, in which the plaintiff admitted paternity and agreed to certain support arrangements. Although the petitioner also signed an acknowledgment form subsequent to the entry of judgment, and that form was filed with the court, that acknowledgment was in addition to the stipulated judgment. The petitioner had <em>the opportunity to litigate </em>the issue of paternity, but chose instead, to stipulate to judgment, which was approved by the trial court. Throughout the entire proceeding the petitioner was represented by present counsel. Under these circumstances, we may presume that the petitioner was aware of the consequences of his decision. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>supra, 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Having rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim that he has an absolute right to be reheard on the issue of paternity, and having determined that the petitioner does not fall within the class of persons protected by the holding of <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>supra, we conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing his petition for a new trial. This case does not present a situation in which a litigant has been deprived of a fair opportunity to have his case heard on appeal so as to constitute \u201creasonable cause\u201d pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-270. The petitioner in this case, aided by his present attorney, chose to waive his right to have his case heard on the merits by stipulating to judgment. That judgment was approved by the trial court. If he was unhappy with this determination, the petitioner\u2019s remedy was to appeal the judgment or move to open it within four months. Accordingly, the petitioner having failed to establish \u201creasonable cause\u201d or any other grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>entitling him to a new trial pursuant to \u00a7 52-270, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s action dismissing the petition was well within its discretionary authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-270 provides in pertinent part: \u201ccauses foe which new trials may be granted, (a) The superior court may grant a new trial of any action that may come before it, for mispleading, the discovery of new evidence or want of actual notice of the action to any defendant or of a reasonable opportunity to appear and defend, when a just defense in whole or part existed, or the want of actual notice to any plaintiff of the entry of a nonsuit for failure to appear at trial or dismissal for failure to prosecute with reasonable diligence, or for other reasonable cause, according to the usual rules in such cases.
