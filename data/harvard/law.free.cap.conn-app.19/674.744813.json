The petitioner claims that he was denied his right under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution to effective assistance of counsel at his murder trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">After a trial by jury, the petitioner, Larry E. Chace, was convicted of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. He was subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than seventeen years nor more than life. He appealed the judgment of conviction to the Supreme Court, claiming (1) that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of murder, (2) that the prosecutor made improper remarks to the jury, thus depriving him of his right to a fair trial, and (3) that he had been deprived of his right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chace, </em>199 Conn. 102, 505 A.2d 712 (1986). The Supreme Court found no error as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>the first and second issues and declined to consider the petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because the record was inadequate for proper review. Id., 109. The petitioner subsequently petitioned the Superior Court for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, in violation of his rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. The petitioner\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel involved allegations that his trial counsel (1) failed to seek out essential witnesses and produce them at trial, (2) failed to present available evidence of the defendant\u2019s intoxication, (3) failed to request a jury instruction on the lesser included offense of manslaughter, (4) failed to except to the trial court\u2019s failure to charge on the lesser included offense of manslaughter, (5) failed to argue evidence of the petitioner\u2019s intoxication to the jury, and (6) failed to argue to the jury the lesser included offense of manslaughter. The habeas court rejected all the petitioner\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance, except the claim that counsel had erroneously failed to request-a jury instruction on a lesser included offense. With regard to that claim, the court held that the petitioner would have been entitled to a charge on manslaughter, if such a charge had been requested, and that counsel\u2019s failure to request the charge was not a professionally reasonable judgment under the standards articulated in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 690-91, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1983), reh. denied, 467 U.S. 1267, 104 S. Ct. 3562, 82 L. Ed. 2d 864 (1984). The court held, however, that the petitioner had failed to make the additional showing required by <em>Strickland </em>that there was a reasonable probability that counsel\u2019s error was so prejudicial to the defense that, but for the error, the result of the proceeding would have been different. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>The underlying facts were set out in detail by our Supreme Court in its opinion in the petitioner\u2019s first appeal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Chace, </em>supra, 103-104. To summarize, the victim, Sheldon Merrill, Jr., and a friend became involved in an argument with the petitioner at the Speak Easy Cafe in Berlin. The petitioner and Merrill went out into a nearby parking lot, where a fight ensued and the petitioner stabbed Merrill to death. It was established at trial that the petitioner had been drinking beer for \u201c \u2018a couple of hours\u2019 \u201d before the stabbing, and the victim\u2019s friend testified that the petitioner \u201c \u2018appeared to be under the influence\u2019 \u201d at the time. Id. No other evidence was offered regarding the petitioner\u2019s intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The petitioner\u2019s claims of error fall into three categories. The petitioner contends that the habeas court erred in failing to find ineffective assistance of counsel on the grounds (1) that counsel failed to conduct a proper investigation of the petitioner\u2019s alleged intoxication, (2) that counsel failed to request a jury instruction on second degree manslaughter, and (3) that counsel failed to argue intoxication during his summation to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Before addressing the petitioner\u2019s claims, we review generally the principles governing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner must show (1) that the attorney\u2019s performance was so deficient and his errors so serious that counsel was, in effect, not functioning as counsel, and (2) that those errors functioned so as to deprive the petitioner of a fair trial. <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>195 Conn. 636, 640, 490 A.2d 82 (1985), citing <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 687, 694. The petitioner must show that his attorney\u2019s performance was not reasonably competent or was not within the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number><em>Williams </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>195 Conn. 561, 564, 489 A.2d 377 (1985). Petitioners are entitled to reasonably professional assistance, not to perfect representation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>173 Conn. 153, 159-60, 376 A.2d 1108 (1977). Judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential, and a reviewing court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra. The petitioner must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy. Id. \u201cIn fairly assessing the attorney\u2019s conduct it is required \u2018that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 689. The seeond component of the <em>Strickland </em>test requires that the petitioner demonstrate that counsel\u2019s lack of competency contributed to his conviction. <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra. The petitioner must show that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>211 Conn. 352, 559 A.2d 206 (1989). A \u201creasonable probability\u201d is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The petitioner bears the burden of making both showings. Id. \u201c \u2018Unless a defendant [petitioner] makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction . . . resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>211 Conn. 398, 402, 559 A.2d 1094 (1989), quoting <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The petitioner\u2019s first claim is that his lawyer failed to conduct a proper investigation regarding his claim that he had been highly intoxicated at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>killing. He first contends that, if counsel had conducted a more thorough investigation, he would have uncovered additional evidence of intoxication that would have persuaded the jury that the petitioner was incapable of forming the requisite intent to commit the crime of murder. The petitioner points to two investigatory lapses, claiming that, although he gave his attorney the name of a friend, Eddie Barber, who had been with him in the bar on the date of the killing and who was willing to help locate witnesses, the attorney never contacted Barber or located any witnesses. The petitioner refers as well to his attorney\u2019s failure to contact the administrator of the victim\u2019s estate, who was proceeding with a suit under the Dram Shop Act against the cafe, in order to obtain information developed in that suit bearing on the petitioner\u2019s intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The petitioner\u2019s ruminations on what might have happened if his attorney had conducted a more thorough investigation are largely speculative. Defense counsel is not required to investigate everyone whose name happens to be mentioned by the petitioner. <em>Schwander </em>v. <em>Blackburn, </em>750 F.2d 494, 500 (5th Cir. 1985). \u201cDefense counsel will be deemed ineffective only when it is shown that a defendant [petitioner] has informed his attorney of the existence of the witness and that the attorney, without a reasonable investigation and without adequate explanation, failed to call the witness at trial. The reasonableness of an investigation must be evaluated not through hindsight but from the perspective of the attorney when he was conducting it.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>197 Conn. 280, 297-98, 497 A.2d 35 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The habeas court determined that, under the facts and circumstances of this case, trial counsel\u2019s investigation was not so inadequate as to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. This determination is amply supported by the record. At the evidentiary hearing before the habeas court, counsel testified that his inves<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>tigation of the case included review of a copy of the prosecution\u2019s entire file, discussions with the petitioner and his brother, a trip to the cafe where the killing occurred in an effort to locate an employee who might remember the petitioner, and a discussion with an attorney representing the family of the victim in the Dram Shop suit. Counsel concluded, as a result of his investigation, that the issue of intoxication would be part of the trial defense. Under these circumstances, the habeas court correctly concluded that counsel\u2019s investigation was adequate. Although counsel\u2019s investigation was apparently not broad enough to include interviews with Barber, the petitioner\u2019s friend, and with any individuals Barber might have been able to name, our review of the record persuades us that counsel nevertheless had sufficient information to conclude that additional investigation was unnecessary. See <em>Siemon </em>v. <em>Stoughton, </em>184 Conn. 547, 557, 440 A.2d 210 (1981). Under these circumstances, we conclude that counsel\u2019s conduct fell \u201cwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The petitioner next faults his attorney for not calling the petitioner\u2019s brother, James Chace, as a witness at trial. At the habeas hearing, James Chace, an eyewitness to the killing, testified that the petitioner had been intoxicated at the time of the killing and that he, Jarnes Chace, had told the petitioner\u2019s counsel about the petitioner\u2019s intoxication. The habeas court found that James Chace\u2019s testimony regarding the degree of the petitioner\u2019s intoxication was not credible and would not have been helpful to the defense and that, thus, there was an adequate explanation for counsel\u2019s failure to call him as a witness at trial. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The petitioner\u2019s complaints that trial counsel failed to call certain witnesses are not favored because the presentation of testimonial evidence is a matter of trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>strategy. <em>Schwander </em>v. <em>Blackburn, </em>supra. \u201cThe failure of defense counsel to call a potential defense witness does not constitute ineffective assistance unless there is some showing that the testimony would have been helpful in establishing the asserted defense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>supra, 297. We have reviewed the record and conclude that the habeas court did not err in concluding that counsel\u2019s decision not to call James Chace as a witness was within the range of reasonable trial tactics. The record supports the habeas court\u2019s conclusion that counsel\u2019s decision was predicated upon the belief that any benefit that might have inured to the petitioner from his brother\u2019s testimony would be outweighed by the deleterious effect of other unfavorable testimony James Chace might be called upon to give. The court found, and the record reveals, that counsel reasonably opted to avoid the possibility that the jury would learn, through James Chace, unfavorable facts regarding the petitioner\u2019s words, attitude, and actions following the killing. Moreover, the habeas court noted that James Chace\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with other evidence presented at trial and judged that he was not a credible witness. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the habeas court did not err in finding that the petitioner had failed to demonstrate that counsel\u2019s decision not to call James Chace as a witness at trial failed to meet the objective standard of reasonable competence outlined in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra. In any event, an error on the part of counsel in failing to call a witness cannot be considered prejudicial, as affecting the outcome of the trial, when the evidence the witness would have given would have been cumulative. We reject the petitioner\u2019s claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The petitioner\u2019s third claim is that the habeas court erred in finding that no prejudice resulted from his counsel\u2019s failure to request a jury charge on the lesser offense of second degree manslaughter. At trial, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>conferring with counsel, the court charged the jury on the crimes of murder, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and manslaughter in the first degree, \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (l).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The habeas court found that the failure of trial counsel to request a charge on second degree manslaughter; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> failed to meet the performance standard of <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, but that such failure resulted in no prejudice to the petitioner. Assuming, without deciding, that the habeas court was correct in its initial determination that counsel would have been entitled to a charge on manslaughter in the second degree if he had requested it, we limit our review to considering whether counsel\u2019s failure to request such an instruction constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Our Supreme Court has recently held, in <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, that counsel\u2019s failure to request a lesser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>included offense instruction does not necessarily deprive a petitioner of reasonably effective assistance of counsel. \u201cIt may be sound trial strategy not to request a lesser included offense instruction, hoping that the jury will simply return a not guilty verdict.\u201d Id., citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 729, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985). We conclude that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that counsel\u2019s failure to request a jury instruction on manslaughter in the second degree was anything other than a considered choice among various reasonable trial strategies. Even were we to conclude, however, \u201cthat trial counsel\u2019s assistance was so ineffective and flawed as to have deprived the petitioner of 'counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment\u2019 <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 407; the petitioner has not met his burden of proving prejudice under the second prong of <em>Strickland. </em>While the petitioner clings to the possibility that the jury, given the option of a second degree manslaughter charge, would have chosen to convict him of that charge, on this record we cannot conclude that this possibility was sufficiently realistic to warrant upsetting the guilty judgment. The habeas court held that the facts before the jury were such that it was not reasonable to believe that the jury would find that the petitioner did not either intend to cause serious physical injury or intend to cause death. The habeas court referred to the following evidence: (1) the fact that the petitioner slashed at the victim three times, leaving a cut across his cheek and two stab wounds in his chest; (2) the fact that the petitioner followed the victim after he staggered backwards, again slashing with the knife; (3) the fact that, after the victim called out to the petitioner to stop, the petitioner replied, \u201cIf I catch you, I\u2019ll do it again\u201d; (4) the fact that the petitioner stood over the victim after the victim had collapsed, and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>calmly put his knife away, walked over to his car, got in and drove away. The habeas court thus decided that, even if the jury had been instructed on manslaughter in the second degree, the probability, based on the evidence, that the jury would have chosen to convict the petitioner of second degree manslaughter was not high, and therefore counsel\u2019s failure to request the charge resulted in no prejudice. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Assessment of the possibility that the jury might have chosen to convict the defendant of a lesser offense if it had been properly charged is a proper measure of whether trial counsel\u2019s failure to request a charge on a lesser offense resulted in prejudice to the petitioner. <em>See Fair v. Warden, </em>supra, 410. \u201c \u2018An assessment of the likelihood of a result more favorable to the defendant [petitioner] must exclude the possibility of arbitrariness, whimsy, caprice, \u201cnullification,\u201d and the like. A defendant [petitioner] has no entitlement to the luck of a lawless decisionmaker. . . .\u2019\u201d Id., quoting <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">We have reviewed the record and agree with the habeas court\u2019s assessment of the relative likelihood that the petitioner might have been found guilty of manslaughter in the second degree instead of murder. Intent may be inferred from the conduct of the accused. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofone, </em>164 Conn. 162, 164, 319 A.2d 381 (1972). \u201c \u2018 \u201cAn intent to cause death may be inferred from circumstantial evidence such as the type of weapon used, the manner in which it was used, the type of wound inflicted and the events leading to and immediately following the death.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Chace, </em>supra, 105, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Zdanis, </em>182 Conn. 388, 396, 438 A.2d 696 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1003, 101 S. Ct. 1715, 68 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). In this case, the evidence strongly pointed to the likelihood that the petitioner intended either to cause serious physical injury or death. While engaged in a fist fight with the victim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>the petitioner drew from his belt a knife with a blade over four inches long. The petitioner slashed the victim three times, leaving a cut across his cheek and two stab wounds in his chest. The first chest wound was one and one-half inches deep. The second was four inches deep, penetrated the left lung, and involved a two inch laceration of the heart. When the victim staggered backward, the petitioner followed, continuing to wield the knife. In reply to the victim\u2019s entreaties to stop and put the knife away, the petitioner replied, \u201cIf I catch you, I\u2019ll do it again.\u201d Even assuming that the petitioner was entitled to an instruction on second degree manslaughter, and that counsel\u2019s failure to request such an instruction constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel, this strong evidence of intent to cause either serious physical injury or death renders it unlikely that a jury instructed on murder, first degree manslaughter, and second degree manslaughter would have found that the petitioner acted recklessly, rather than with intent to cause serious physical injury or death. Accordingly, we conclude that any possibility that the jury would have convicted the petitioner of manslaughter in the second degree does not amount to \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The petitioner\u2019s final claim is that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed to argue the evidence of his intoxication to the jury during final argument. The petitioner concedes, however, that counsel did in fact discuss the evidence of intoxication during summation. The record reveals that trial counsel argued at some length the state\u2019s failure to meet its burden of proving intent to kill, pointing in this regard to the testimony of the state\u2019s witness, the victim\u2019s friend, that the petitioner appeared to be \u201cunder the influence\u201d at the time of the killing. Moreover, it is undisputed that counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>argued to the jury that the evidence showed the petitioner did not have the requisite intent when he stabbed the victim. It thus appears that the petitioner\u2019s argument amounts to a claim that counsel failed to emphasize sufficiently to the jury the evidence of intoxication and its implications respecting the issue of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The habeas court found that defense counsel\u2019s closing argument fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. We agree. Moreover, we agree with the habeas court that there is no reason to believe that an argument in some other form or manner on the issue of intoxication would have affected the outcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-9\"> The defendant also briefed a claim that the habeas court erred in failing to hold that the standard for effective assistance of counsel is higher under the Connecticut constitution than under the United States constitution. At oral argument, however, he acknowledged that our Supreme Court has rejected the contention that article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution affords \u201cgreater and more extensive rights to counsel\u201d than the right to counsel provided by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. See <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>Meachum, 211 </em>Conn. 352, 355 n.3, 559 A.2d 206 (1989).
