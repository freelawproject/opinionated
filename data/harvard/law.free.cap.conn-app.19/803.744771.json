The plaintiff\u2019s essential claim is that the court\u2019s determination of her earning capacity was unsupported by the evidence. Our examination of the record indicates that there was ample evidence for the trial court to determine the plaintiff\u2019s earning capacity. We will not retry the facts. <em>Golfin </em>v. <em>Plymouth Industrial Development Corp. of Connecticut, Inc., </em>15 Conn.
