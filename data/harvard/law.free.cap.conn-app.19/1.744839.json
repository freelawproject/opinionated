The dispositive issue on appeal is whether General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 20-427 (b) (5) prohibits a person, whose certificate of registration has expired, from making or offering to make home improvements. We find that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"AZL\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. In July, 1980, the defendant registered as a home improvement contractor with the department of consumer protection and was issued a certificate of registration. Each year thereafter, until 1985, the defendant renewed his certificate. After 1985, the defendant did not renew his certificate of registration. On May 28, 1987, the defendant offered to make renovations at the home of a West Hartford resident.</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 20-427 (b) provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo person shall ... (5) offer to make or make any home improvement without having <em>first obtained </em>a certificate of registration under this chapter . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant maintains that the phrase \u201cfirst obtained\u201d limits the applicability of this section in that it only proscribes the offering to make or making by those who never applied for and received a certificate and does not apply to a contractor who, at some time in the past, possessed a valid certificate. Under the defendant\u2019s interpretation of this section, therefore, the fact that a certificate of registration expired, was revoked or denied is of no import. We find that the defendant\u2019s interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>tion of this section is untenable and undermines the statute\u2019s purpose to regulate home improvement contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"A-G\">In interpreting a statute, some general principles control. Where two interpretations of a statute are possible and \u201cone alternative proves unreasonable or produces the possibility of bizarre results, then the more reasonable alternative should be adopted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158, 165, 496 A.2d 186 (1985). Although as a general rule penal statutes must be construed strictly, \u201cthey are not to be construed so as to disregard the context in which they exist or to frustrate the obvious intent of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 151, 460 A.2d 26 (1983).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>199 Conn. 667, 678, 509 A.2d 20 (1986). In reviewing statutes, we may look to the legislative history of the act to determine its scope and purpose, and in doing so we must consider the \u201c \u2018problem in society to which the legislature addressed itself.\u2019 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (14th Ed. Sands) \u00a7 45.02; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaines, </em>196 Conn. 395, 400, 493 A.2d 209 (1985).\u201d <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>Rindfleisch, </em>13 Conn. App. 194, 202, 535 A.2d 824, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 805, 540 A.2d 373 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"AF\">\u201cStatutes should be considered as a whole, reconciling their separate parts so that a reasonable overall interpretation is achieved. <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>192 Conn. 207, 214, 471 A.2d 1368 (1984).\u201d <em>Shelby Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Della Ghelfa, </em>3 Conn. App. 432, 438, 489 A.2d 398 (1985), aff'd, 200 Conn. 630, 513 A.2d 52 (1986). In reviewing the overall statutory scheme of the Home Improvement Act, it is evident that annual renewal of a certificate is required. The section of the act under which the defendant is charged prohibits \u201coffer[ing] to make or mak[ing] any home improvement without having first obtained a <em>certificate </em>of registration <em>under this chapter.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>1987) \u00a7 20-427 (b) (5). \u201cCertificate\u201d is defined as that which is \u201cissued under section 20-422.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-419 (1). General Statutes \u00a7 20-422 (2) provides that the commissioner may \u201crevoke or refuse to renew\u201d any certificate issued under this chapter. In addition, General Statutes \u00a7 20-427 (d) expressly states that certificates expire annually and provides the procedure by which certificates must be renewed. Accordingly, we conclude that under the overall statutory scheme of the act, the language \u201cfirst obtained a certificate of registration under this chapter\u201d contemplates the renewal of certificates on an annual basis as well as first time renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Furthermore, the primary purpose of the act is to protect consumers who contract for home improvement work by issuing certificates of registration to contractors with \u201cno past history of fraud or deceit, and thereby protecting] consumers from any unscrupulous businessmen.\u201d <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>Rindfleisch, </em>supra, 203. This statute also protects contractors, by regulating \u201c \u2018the influx of irresponsible and fly-by-night operations, which not only undercut the responsible contractor but also contribute to the industry\u2019s negative image with the public.\u2019 22 H.R. Proc., Pt. 33, 1979 Sess., pp. 11, 613-14, remarks of Representative William P. Candelori.\u201d Id. To interpret \u00a7 20-427 (b) (5), as the defendant posits, to apply only to those contractors who never acquired a certificate of registration, would immunize contractors with expired or revoked licenses from prosecution when they \u201coffer to make or make\u201d home improvements. This result would defeat the clear legislative purpose of the act to protect consumers and certified contractors from unscrupulous contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">Finally, we interpret Public Acts 1988, No. 88-269, which amended \u00a7 20-427 (b) (5) by replacing the phrase \u201cfirst obtained\u201d with the word \u201ccurrent,\u201d as a clarifying amendment intended to declare the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>original act. <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>193 Conn. 506, 514, 479 A.2d 208 (1984); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>16 Conn. App. 156, 163 n.6, 547 A.2d 69 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Accordingly, we hold that General Statutes \u00a7 20-427 (b) (5) makes it unlawful for a home improvement contractor whose certificate of registration has expired to offer to make or make home improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
