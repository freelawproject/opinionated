As part of the modified judgment of divorce, the court awarded the defendant\u2019s interest in the income from several trust funds to the plaintiff, allocating one third as alimony and two thirds as support for the parties\u2019 one minor child.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court also ordered that, upon the termination of the trusts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>the distribution of the principal at the death of Grace McLinden, the last holder of a life estate, the defendant\u2019s share of the principal be allocated one third to the plaintiff and one third each to the parties\u2019 two daughters. The defendant did not appeal that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">On February 2, 1988, after McLinden\u2019s death, the plaintiff and her daughters filed a motion for execution of the terms of the judgment regarding the distribution of the trust principal. On March 16, 1988, the defendant filed a motion to strike the plaintiff\u2019s motion and a motion to open and correct the original judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for execution and denied the defendant\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"AUi\">In response to the defendant\u2019s motion for articulation of the basis for the denial of his motions, the trial court stated that the original court had subject matter jurisdiction when it rendered its judgment in 1969 in that it properly transferred to the plaintiff property already acquired by the defendant. The court determined that the defendant\u2019s rights to the funds were vested at the time of the transfer, and that the case therefore was not controlled by <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>204 Conn. 224, 527 A.2d 1184 (1987).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Recognizing that the defendant\u2019s child support obligation ended when his daughters reached majority, the court also stated that the award of the principal of the trust could be viewed as an assignment of property and not as a child support order. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred in determining that the original court had subject matter jurisdiction over the principal of the trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>\u201c \u2018The court\u2019s judgment in an action for dissolution of a marriage is final and binding upon the parties, where no appeal is taken therefrom, unless and to the extent that statutes, the common law or rules of court permit the setting aside or modification of that judgment. Under Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 326, a civil judgment may be opened or set aside . . . where a motion seeking to do so is filed within four months from the date of its rendition. Under \u00a7 326, the parties may waive the time requirements or otherwise submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the court. Absent waiver, consent or other submission to jurisdiction, however, a court is without jurisdiction to modify or correct a judgment, in other than clerical respects, after the expiration of the [period] provided in Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 326.\u2019 <em>Bunche </em>v. <em>Bunche, </em>180 Conn. 285, 287-88, 429 A.2d 874 (1980). After the expiration of the four month period provided by \u00a7 326 a judgment may not be vacated upon the sole ground that it is erroneous in matter of law, except by a court exercising appellate or revisory jurisdiction, unless such action is authorized by statute or unless the error is one going to the jurisdiction of the court rendering the judgment. <em>Kalinick </em>v. <em>Collins Co., </em>116 Conn. 1, 7-8, 163 A. 460 (1932). The court does have inherent authority, however, at any time to open and modify a judgment rendered without jurisdiction. <em>Broaca </em>v. <em>Broaca, </em>181 Conn. 463, 467, 435 A.2d 1016 (1980).\u201d <em>Misinonile </em>v. <em>Misinonile, </em>190 Conn. 132, 134-35, 459 A.2d 518 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The defendant has framed his collateral attack on the 1969 judgment as a challenge to the subject matter jurisdiction of the court. \u201cA court does not truly lack subject matter jurisdiction if it has competence to entertain the action before it.\u201d <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>177 Conn. 173, 185, 413 A.2d 819, appeal dismissed, 444 U.S. 801, 100 S. Ct. 20, 62 L. Ed. 2d 14 (1979); <em>Connecticut Pharmaceutical Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Milano, </em>191 Conn. 555, 559, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>468 A.2d 1230 (1983). The defendant does not suggest that the original trial court was not a proper forum for the divorce action. Rather, he claims that the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction because the divorce statutes did not allow the distribution of the trust principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">This court is not convinced that we should \u201cinvariably characterize as an absence of . . . jurisdiction every failure of a trial court to observe every statutory limitation on its authority to act . . . .\u201d <em>Broaca </em>v. <em>Broaca, </em>supra, 471, <em>(Peters, J., </em>dissenting). \u201cMoreover, to give an expansive interpretation to the concept of \u2018subject matter jurisdiction\u2019 would be to \u2018undermine significantly the doctrine of res judicata, and to eliminate the certainty and finality in the law and in litigation which the doctrine is designed to protect.\u2019 <em>Lacks </em>v. <em>Lacks, </em>41 N.Y.2d 71, 77, 359 N.E.2d 384 [390 N.Y.S.2d 875 (1976)].\u201d <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>Vogel, </em>178 Conn. 358, 363, 422 A.2d 271 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Our Supreme Court has found a lack of subject matter jurisdiction in dissolution cases in which trial courts have ordered postmajority child support without a written agreement of the parties to such an arrangement. <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>184 Conn. 36, 46, 440 A.2d 782 (1981); <em>see Arseniadis </em>v. <em>Arseniadis, </em>2 Conn. App. 239, 243, 477 A.2d 152 (1984). The basis of these decisions is that because the language of the child support statute allows an award of support only to \u201cminor children,\u201d a postmajority award exceeds the jurisdiction of the court as provided by statute. <em>Broaca </em>v. <em>Broaca, </em>supra, 466; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Kennedy, 177 </em>Conn. 47, 49-50, 411 A.2d 25 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">It is not clear that an award of a future inheritance as \u201cpart of the estate\u201d of a spouse under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 or its predecessor, General Statutes (1958 Rev.) \u00a7 46-21, in effect at the time of the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>divorce, implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of the court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or that the transfer in this case, at least as to the plaintiff, was beyond the court\u2019s authority. Even if we assume, arguendo, however, that the original court exceeded its statutory authority and that it acted without subject matter jurisdiction, we conclude that consideration of the merits of the defendant\u2019s collateral action is not warranted under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u201cAlthough we have held that a challenge to a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction \u2018can be raised at any time . . . and the lack thereof cannot be waived\u2019; <em>LaBow </em>v. <em>LaBow, </em>171 Conn. 433, 440, 370 A.2d 990 (1976) . . . <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>[supra 177]; we have also recognized that \u2018[t]he modern law of civil procedure suggests that even litigation about subject matter jurisdiction should take into account the importance of the principle of the finality of judgments, particularly when the parties have had a full opportunity originally to contest the jurisdiction of the adjudicatory tribunal.\u2019 <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>supra, 178; <em>Connecticut Pharmaceutical Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Milano, </em>[supra, 560]; <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>Vogel, </em>supra, 362-63; 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 12; James &amp; Hazard, Civil Procedure (2d Ed. 1977) \u00a7 <em>13.16.\u201d Meinket v. Levinson, </em>193 Conn. 110, 114, 474 A.2d 454 (1984); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Irwin, </em>4 Conn. App. 431, 433, 494 A.2d 626 (1985). \u201c \u2018Litigation about whether subject matter jurisdiction exists should take into account whether the litigation is a collateral or direct attack on the judgment, whether the parties consented to the jurisdiction originally, the age of the original judgment, whether the parties had an opportunity originally to contest jurisdiction, the prevention of a miscarriage of justice, whether the subject matter is so far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>beyond the jurisdiction of the court as to constitute an abuse of authority, and the desirability of the finality of judgments. <em>Connecticut Pharmaceutical Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Milano, </em>[supra]; <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>Vogel, </em>supra; <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>[supra]; 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 12.\u2019 <em>Arseniadis </em>v. <em>Arseniadis, </em>[supra, 243-44].\u201d <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Irwin, </em>supra, 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">In the present case, we are confroiited with a collateral attack eighteen years after the original court rendered judgment. The defendant did not exercise his opportunity to appeal that judgment, and there are no facts before us to warrant a conclusion that there has been a miscarriage of justice. If, twenty years after the rendering of the questioned orders in this case, this court were to set aside the award of the principal of the trusts, we would be creating an unjust situation. As our Supreme Court has recently stated, \u201c \u2018[w]hile an action for divorce or dissolution of marriage is a creature of statute, it is essentially equitable in its nature. <em>Stoner </em>v. <em>Stoner, </em>163 Conn. 345, 356, 307 A.2d 146 [1972].\u2019 <em>Pasquariello </em>v. <em>Pasquariello, </em>168 Conn. 579, 584, 362 A.2d 835 (1975). \u2018The power to act equitably is the keystone to the court\u2019s ability to fashion relief in the infinite variety of circumstances which arise out of the dissolution of a marriage. . . .\u2019 Id., 585.\u201d <em>Sunbury </em>v. <em>Sunbury, </em>210 Conn. 170, 174, 553 A.2d 612 (1989). \u201c[I]ssues involving financial orders are entirely interwoven. \u2018The rendering of a judgment in a complicated dissolution case is a carefully crafted mosaic, each element of which may be dependent on the other.\u2019 \u201d Id., 175, quoting <em>Ehrenkranz </em>v. <em>Ehrenkranz, </em>2 Conn. App. 416, 424, 479 A.2d 826 (1984); <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Weinstein, </em>18 Conn. App. 622, 629, 561 A.2d 443 (1989). In <em>Sunbury </em>the court ordered that after this court found error in one part of a financial award, it was not proper to set aside only that portion of the award but was necessary to remand to the trial court for reconsideration of all of the financial orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>In this case, the original trial court\u2019s award of the principal of the trusts was only one part of a financial award that included alimony, child support, medical insurance, beneficiary interests in life insurance policies and attorney\u2019s fees. It clearly is not possible or desirable to reallocate all the resources of the parties after twenty years of compliance with and reliance on the original orders of the court. \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe law aims to invest judicial transactions with the utmost permanency consistent with justice. . . . Public policy requires that a term be put to litigation and that judgments, as solemn records upon which valuable rights rest, should not lightly be disturbed or overthrown. . . .\u201d \u2019 <em>Lampson Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Hoer, </em>139 Conn. 294, 297, 93 A.2d 143 (1952), quoting 1 Freeman, Judgments (5th Ed.) \u00a7 305, pp. 602-603.\u201d <em>Meinket </em>v. <em>Levinson, </em>supra, 113. Any injustice that might be done here would be in setting aside a portion of the original judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Having examined the criteria for litigating the issue of subject matter jurisdiction, we conclude that the need for finality of judgments and the circumstances of this case require that we not consider the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-13\"> The court awarded no support for the parties\u2019 other daughter who had reached majority during the divorce proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-7\"> In <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>204 Conn. 224, 527 A.2d 1184 (1987), the Supreme Court held that a mere expectancy of a future acquisition of property was not transferable in a dissolution action as either alimony or as a property award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b89-6\"> The court in <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>204 Conn. 224, 231, 527 A.2d 1184 (1987), spoke in terms of exceeding statutory authority, using the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d only once in agreeing with the holding of a Delaware court in <em>Beres </em>v. <em>Beres, </em>52 Del. 133, 154 A.2d 384 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
