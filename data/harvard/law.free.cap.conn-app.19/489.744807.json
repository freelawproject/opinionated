On April 22, 1983, the CRRA issued a request for proposals to redevelop the greater Bridgeport resource recovery facility. In that request, the CRRA stated that it would attempt to protect confidential information from disclosure. In response to the request for proposals, Signal Environmental Systems, Inc. (Signal),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and others submitted their proposals. Subsequently, on invitation, Signal submitted a two part proposal. The CRRA approved Signal\u2019s proposal and negotiated a contract with it. In a letter dated August 2,1986, New England Energy Consultants, by its president Ethan Book,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requested that the CRRA provide it with a copy of Signal\u2019s proposal. The CRRA denied the request on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>basis that the proposal was exempt from disclosure under General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Book then filed an appeal with the FOIC. The FOIC heard the matter as a contested case. After holding hearings, the FOIC concluded that the information contained in the proposal was information that was required by General Statutes \u00a7 22a-266,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and therefore was not exempt under General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (5). The FOIC ordered the CRRA to provide Book with a copy of Signal\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The CRRA appealed the decision to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-183 and l-21i (d), naming as defendants both the FOIC and Book. After the appeal was filed, Signal moved for permission to intervene in the action as a plaintiff and, there being no objection, the trial court granted Signal\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The CRRA maintained that the operative statute governing the proposal was General Statutes \u00a7 22a-268, not \u00a7 22a-266. After a hearing, the trial court concluded that Signal\u2019s bid proposals contained commercial and financial information and were proprietary and confidential. The trial court concluded that the bid proposal had been made pursuant to \u00a7 22a-268 and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>FOIC had erred \u201cin concluding that Signal was <em>required </em>by General Statutes \u00a7 22a-266 to provide proposals to the CRRA for the Recovery Project.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">On September 19, 1988, the FOIC filed this appeal of the trial court\u2019s decision. By letter dated October 19, 1988, Book informed this court that he was not joining in the FOIC\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Initially, the plaintiff Signal contends that the FOIC lacks standing to prosecute this appeal because Book has not taken an appeal to this court, and in fact has expressly withdrawn from this appeal. Signal argues that because the parties requesting these documents have \u201cdropped out of this appeal,\u201d the appeal is not being prosecuted by a party who can derive a benefit from a favorable decision by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">In <em>Local 1303 &amp; Local 1378 </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>191 Conn. 173, 177, 463 A.2d 613 (1983), our Supreme Court dismissed an appeal brought by the FOIC because the court found that the commission was not an aggrieved party. In 1984, General Statutes \u00a7 l-21i (d) was amended by Public Acts 1984, No. 84-311,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which added the following language: \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>commission shall have standing to defend, prosecute or otherwise participate in any appeal . . . from any judicial decision overturning or modifying a decision of the commission. If aggrievement is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the commission taking any such appeal, the commission shall be deemed to be aggrieved.\u201d It is clear from the language, as well as the legislative history surrounding Public Acts 1984, No. 84-311, that the purpose of the act was to bestow upon the FOIC the power to pursue an appeal on its own behalf. Thus, there is no merit to Signal\u2019s argument that the FOIC lacks standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">There is merit, however, to its contention that any resolution of this appeal cannot result in any practical relief to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">It is a fixed principle of law that appellate courts do not decide moot questions. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 112, 445 A.2d 314 (1982); <em>Waterbury Hospital </em>v. <em>Connecticut Health Care Associates, </em>186 Conn. 247, 249-50, 440 A.2d 310 (1982); <em>Rosnick </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>172 Conn. 306, 308-309, 374 A.2d 245 (1977). A case is moot if it is disconnected from the granting of actual relief or it involves a determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>from which no practical relief to the complainant can follow. <em>See Reynolds </em>v. <em>Vroom, </em>130 Conn. 512, 515, 36 A.2d 22 (1944). An appeal can become moot if a new statute is enacted that would prevent a claimant from being able to realize the benefits of any judgment he or she might receive. See <em>DelMastro </em>v. <em>Liqour Control Commission, </em>146 Conn. 740, 154 A.2d 241 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">After this action commenced, General Statutes \u00a7 22a-266 was substantially amended by Public Acts 1987, No. 87-451.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Whether the information in the proposal was required under the language of \u00a7 22a-266 as it stood prior to that amendment is no longer a question of any consequence because there can be no future proposal subject to \u00a7 22a-266 as it existed before it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>amended. See <em>DelMastro </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>supra; see also <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>195 Conn. 24, 42-43, 486 A.2d 1099 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">We note also that Book no longer is a party to this action and, since it does not appear that anyone else is interested in the proposal, the only apparent consequence of an order of disclosure would be to vindicate the FOIC\u2019s prior decision. This case thus involves a superseded statute, the interpretation of which can be of only academic interest to a state agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction. It is not the function of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>206 Conn. 636, 642, 539 A.2d 122 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The appeal is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-10\"> Signal is now known as Wheelabrator Technologies, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-11\"> Book is the president of New England Energy Consultants.
