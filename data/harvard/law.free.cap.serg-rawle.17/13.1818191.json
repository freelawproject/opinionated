To his grandson, <em>John Cross, </em>he bequeathed one thousand pounds, to his grandchildren, the sons and daughters of his daughter, Martha <em>M'Murray, </em>(of whom it appeared in evidence there were eight,) twenty pounds a piece: to <em>Jaihes Dobbins, </em>sixty pounds: to <em>Martha Vanest, </em>two hundred pounds: and all the rest and residue of his estate he directed to be distributed by his executors among such of his grandchildren as needed and deserved it most: and he made <em>James Dobbins </em>and another executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-5\">In the inventory of <em>Cross\u2019s </em>estate, <em>Dobbins </em>charged himself with two thousand pounds agreeably to the will. A judgment was'obtained April, 1822, against <em>Dobbins, </em>by the Bank of <em>Gettysburg </em>for three thousand one hundred and eleven dollars, on which execution issued, and the land was sold by the sheriff to the defendant, <em>Stevens, </em>for six hundred and thirty dollars, who paid the money to the sheriff, received a deed acknowledged, (though the acknowledgment was objected to,) and took possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-6\">It appeared in evidence, that a considerable portion of the legacies had been paid, but that some remained due and unpaid: and a report preyailing prior to the sheriff\u2019s sale, that there were liens on the land on account of these unpaid legacies, <em>Stevens, </em>who was a gentleman of the bar, was applied to for his opinion by a pexson who intended to bid one thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars, if he could obtain a clear title. He stated his opinion to be that there were liens on the land, and the person declined attending the sale. On other occasions before and at the time of the sale he gave the same opinion. \u2022 <em>Stevens </em>afterwards, under an arrangement with other persons, bid for and purchased the property at the sheriff\u2019s sale on joint account, with-an understanding that the legacies wei\u2019e to be a lien on the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-7\">His Honour charged the jury that the conduct of <em>Stevens </em>in giving an opinion, by which persons intending to purchase were deterred, and the property was depreciated, was a legal fraud, and invalidated the purchase, and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover: and a verdict, was rendered in favour of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b14-8\"><em>Stevens, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aae\">The charge put actual fraud out of the question. It was also laid down that being .the attorney did not disqualify. But it was put on the ground of the attorney having been consulted, even though the advice he gives be correct. This is not the case of a trustee \u2014 the sale was not the attorney\u2019s sale. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The same objection would lie to a man, not an attorney, who should give advice as to the title. He cited 2 <em>Dall. </em>131. <em>6 Binn. 395.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b15-6\">\n<em>Dobbins, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao\">cited 11 <em>Mod. </em>208. 10 <em>Wheat. </em>226. The legacies Were not a charge on the land. The executor was only to charge himself with the value of the land in the inventory. The whole will shows a personal trust in the executor. The estate was composed of real and personal blended in the hands of the executor, in which no particular legatee was to have the benefit of the land as a security.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-7\">The attorney, therefore, gave advice calculated to prevent bidders, who would have had a clear title. The policy of the law strongly forbids his becoming a purchaser.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b15-8\">The opinion of the court, (Huston, J., taking no part,) was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b15-9\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO\">Actual fraud cannot be pretended, for I think it clear the advice given, was perfectly correct. A chancellor would raise the legacies out of the land in the hands of Mr. <em>Dobbins </em>or any one claiming under him. He was not an object of the testa; tor\u2019s bounty, but a purchaser for value, and we are not to suppose the testator intended to part with the land as a security. Mr. <em>Stevens </em>was therefore altogether accurate in advising that the legacies were a charge on the land.. The question then is, whether a counsel who has been consulted about a title which is going to be sold on an execution, is to be excluded from becoming a purchaser. I cannot discern the policy of the rule which should disqualify him. A.trustee may not purchase at his own sale, because,being both buyer and seller, he would have it in his power to purchase at his own price; and as his motives could rarely be penetrated, the facility with which he might accomplish a fraudulent purpose, at but little risk of detection, would offer a temptation which ought not to be cast in the way of any one. In such a case as the present, there can be no such temptation. If the counsel were to advise erroneously, it would be easy to show it; .and any other sort of management or trick might^be made apparent as readily when practised by a counsel as by any one else. If no one has been injured by advice which it was proper for the counsel to give, and for the client to receive, who shall complain? I will not say that a counsel, or any one else who has purchased at an under price in consequence of erroneous advice to those who would otherwise have bid, ought to retain an advantage thus obtained. Such a loss ought not perhaps to be borne by an innocent party in favour of him whose act occasioned it. But here was neither loss nor injury. If Mr. <em>Stevens </em>had refused his opinion, other counsel might have been consulted, who, it is fair to presume, would have advised accurately, and consequently in the way that he did: but although it be possible that they might have arrived at a different conclusion, yet the interest which Mr. <em>Dobbins </em>may be supposed to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>had in the chance of their doing so, is one that cannot be recognised here. Doubts of the title once excited, they would not have bid without having those doubts removed; and we ought not to declare the sale void for professional advice given by -the purchaser, correctly, in good faith, and without,injury to anyone. The cause therefore is to be sent to another jury;. but as Mr. <em>Stevens </em>purchased with an understanding that the legacies were to remain charged, instead of being paid out of the purchase money, the new trial is awarded on terms that he stipulate on the record to satisfy the legacies out of the land, if the plaintiff shall not recover. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"AR-\">Judgment of the Circuit Court reversed, and a new trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
