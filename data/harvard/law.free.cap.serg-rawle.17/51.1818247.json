He called on <em>William McDowell, </em>who said, if we would allow him a credit of fifty dollars, which appeared on the book account, he would pay the balance,.as soon as money came to his hands; witness told' him we must take the note'and book account as if stood.' About the beginning of harvest, the witness called on him again; he had the note and book with him. Defendant examined them; he said if we would allow him that credit, he would pay the balance: he objected to the book account; he said, the work-was not done sufficiently. Witness was under the impression it was his duty to collect this money, and urged the payment, and proposed to leave the note and book account to three or five men, and abide by what they decided: he said, if we took the law we must abide by the law, and the law was in his favour. In the spring- of 1S24, he called on <em>William McDowell, </em>again, his reply was as formerly: if we allowed the credit, he would pay the balance; witness said, he did not wish to add any costs. <em>MCullough </em>agreed to leave it to men. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-11\">The witness did not recollect that he said he paid money for which he was not credited; he mentioned something of his having ordered the fifty dollars to be credited on the note. <em>Cunningham </em>died, perhaps, in the spring of 1801. <em>John. MlCullough, </em>and <em>Robert Cunningham </em>were the administrators of <em>John Cunningham; Robert </em>lived in <em>Westmoreland </em>cpunty; <em>M(Cullough </em>lived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>about four miles from <em>McDowell.

If no evidence\u2019 had been produced here, but the single bill, the presumption of payment would have been conclusive on the plea, here entered. , .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-13\"><em>2. </em>The court say that an acknowledgment as well as a demand are necessary to\u00b0prevent the legal.presumption from- arising. A mere demand would be of no use at all to prevent the presumption of payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-14\">3. The -court will not say that the conversations detailed in evidence, if believed by the jury, do not amount to such acknowledgment by the party as the law requires to destroy the legal presumption. This depends upon weight of evidence, of which the jury are exclusive, judges. In the opinion of the court,, whose opinion bn facts is not binding on the jury, the conversations detailed in evidence do amount to such acknowledgment by defendant, as the law requires to destroy the legal presumption of payment of the single bill. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-16\">4. The court say that the.acknowledgment, to be effectual in repelling the legal presumption, must be unconditional and consistent with a promise to pay, or, at least, unaccompanied with words inconsistent with a promise to pay, and the law is here correctly supposed. An acknowledgment must not be extended further than the man who makes it extends it. A condition of every acknowledgment forms a part of the acknowledgment. If the de\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>fendant acknowledged the claim on the note to be just, all but the fifty dollars before paid, then the acknowledgment can be applied only to that part of the claim which exceeded the fifty dollar-payment. ' '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-6\">5. The court say that the whole of the conversation with the defendant is to be taken into view by the jury, as well his allegation of the payment of fifty dollars as-the rest of it. The jury are to judge of the truth of all the evidence. When the defendant\u2019s allegations are given in evidence against him, all that was said by him at the time must be given: and all here has been given, and the whole of the defendant\u2019s declarations must be taken together. <em>Parkhill\u2019s </em>evidence, as the court understood it, was not positive or clear, as to the defendant\u2019s allegation of his direction to credit the fifty dollars on the single bill. If the defendant did give such directions, then it ought to be credited upon the single bill, and it was a payment of the single bill as far'as it went.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-7\">The defendant excepted to this charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-8\">The jury rendered a verdict in favour of the plaintiff for one hundred and eighty-eight dollars, sixty-four cents, and judgment was entered thereon.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-9\"><em>Crawford, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-10\">\n<em>Findlay, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b53-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b53-12\">Duncan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR4\">The difference between actions on special contracts</p>\n<p id=\"Av6\">and specialties as to the operation of time,, is well established. In the first, the bar is by positive statutory provision: the statute must be pleaded: <em>non assumpsit infra sex annos </em>\u2014 Replication, that he did assume within six years. In the latter, there is no positive legal bar, by analogy to the limitation, as to the time of entry.upon lands. Where the debt has been due twenty years, this is a presumption of payment. This presumption, like other presumptions,, may be removed by proof of acknowledgment of debt, payment of interest, and many other circumstances. The plea is payment, and the presumption is, that the debt, after that lapse of time, has been paid. But, if the obligor acknowledges it has not been paid, the-debt is not renewed by any new promise, nor does it require any inference of that kind, but the presumption \"of payment is removed. In' <em>assumpsit, </em>the literal, unqualified acknowledgment, it is to be regretted, has taken a case out of the protection of the statute; but if, at the time of the acknowledgment, any thing be said to repel the inference of a promise, this acknowledgment will not take a case out of the statute of limitations \u2014 the cause of action arising on the new-implied promise. The evidence given, in this case, to repel the presumption from lapse of time, was that the defendant said, \u201c if the plaintiffs would allow a credit of fifty dollars, which appeared on the book account, he would pay the. balance.\u201d This he repeatedly said. Now the book of accounts, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>which he referred, showed that the fifty dollars had been credited in the account. The court left-it to the jury to say whether this acknowledgment did not show that the debt had not been paid\u2014 did not repel all presumption of payment. The court, with superabundant caution, say, that if the jury believe the acknowledgment detailed by the witness, that this does amount to such acknowledgment by the defendant as the law requires to destroy the legal presuihption of payment; but still instruct them, of its weight they must,judge. The court leave the whole to the jury; that is, whether the presumption, of payment, from the lapse of time, is not removed by the evidence given by the plaintiff, that the'defendant acknowledged that the single bill had not been paid. They likewise left to the jury the credit to be given to, his claim for a deduction of fifty dollars, when he made the acknowledgment, when contrasted with the plaintiff\u2019s book, in which he had credit for :the fifty dollars, on'another account Undoubtedly, the presumption of payment from the mere lapse of time, was repelled by the positive acknowledgment that the debt was not'paid. \u2022 The principal foundation of payment stood till it whs contradicted: it was contradicted by the. defendant\u2019s acknowledgment .that the debt was not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The plaintiff in error has failed to substantiate his exceptions to the opinion, and charge of the court, and therefore the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AlT\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
