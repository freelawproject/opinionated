In <em>England, </em>this assize of nuisance would be an original to be obtained from the Court of Chancery, which is the <em>Oficina Justitise, </em>\u2014 the shop or mint of justice, wherein all the king\u2019s writs are framed. It is a mandatory letter from the king in parliament, sealed with the great seal, and directed to the sheriff of the county, wherein the injury is committed, or supposed to be, requiring him to command the wrong-doer or party accused, either to do justice to the complainant, or else to appear in court and answer the accusation against him. Whatsoever the sheriff does in pursuance of this writ, he must return or certify to the Court of Common Pleas, together with the writ itself, which is the foundation of the jurisdiction of that court, being the king\u2019s warrant for his judges to proceed to the determination of the cause. For it was a maxim, introduced by the <em>Normans, </em>that there should be no proceedings in Common Pleas before the king\u2019s justices, without his original writ, because they held it unfit that the justices being only the substitutes of the crown, should take cognisance of any thing but what w\u2019.as thus expressly referred to their Judgment. 3 <em>Black.

The next step for carrying on the suit, after suing out the original, is called the process, being the means of compelling the defendant to appear in court. This is sometimes called original process, being founded on the original writ, &amp;e. But. process, as we are now to consider it, is the method taken by the law to compel a compliance with the original writ, of which the primary step is, by giving the party notice to obey it. This notice is given upon all real <em>prsecipes, </em>and also upon all personal writs for injuries not against the peace, by summons; which is a warning to appear in court at the return of the original writ, given to the defendant by \u201ctwo of the sheriff\u2019s messengers called summoners, either in person, or left at his house or land, in like manner as in the civil law.

If it still exists it is <em>strictissimi juris, </em>1 <em>Bos, &amp; Pull. </em>192, 11 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>275; and if revived must be conducted on the principles, and in the forms of the old books, the only source of authority on the subject. It is a part of the jus <em>antiquum, </em>according to <em>Butler, Pref. Co. Litt. 8vo, 13th Ed. </em>\u2014 Reminiscences, <em>p; </em>97. It was best .understood in the reigns of the first three <em>Edwards, </em>between A. D. 1272, and 1377. <em>Hale\u2019s Hist. C. L. </em>175. From the end of <em>Ed. </em>3, it began to .decline; and in the reigns of <em>Hen. 6, Ed. </em>4, &amp; <em>Hen. </em>7, was less known, and land titles came to be determined in personal, actions, <em>Hale\u2019s Hist. </em>176, <em>cap. </em>8. Ejectment was used to recover a term, as early as the 14 <em>Hen. </em>7, A. D. 1499. <em>Hale\u2019s Hist. </em>175. <em>Adams on Eject, </em>8. <em>4 Dall. </em>140. This new use of the action, originated in the King's Bench, and was designed by that Court to get concurrent jurisdiction with the Common Pleas, in matters of real property. <em>Adams, </em>9. The facilities it offered soon brought it into general use. Recognitors in assize could as such inquire only of the points of assize, and must find on their personal knowledge, 3 <em>Bl. Com. </em>402, <em>Glanv. </em>69, 64, <em>65, </em>67, 60, 61, <em>Steph. on </em>Pl. App. 51. note 44, and <em>a. jurata </em>was often necessary to supply defects in their pow-er. In ejectment the tribunal of fact was a <em>jurata </em>who were competent to inquire of any \u25a0matters however multifarious, and were not. restricted to find on their personal knowledge. <em>Worthington on Juries, </em>114, 115, <em>Fortese, cap. </em>26. 'Add to this, the <em>Statute of Uses, </em>27, <em>Hen. S, </em>changed the whole exterior of conveyancing. Feoffment with livery \u2014 grant with attornment \u2014 exchange with entry \u2014 lease with entry, (notorious facts to which only recognitions were adapted,) were superseded, and the seisin, (of feudal possession,) which was the only subject of a recognition, (See <em>Glanv. </em>5, 304, 311. <em>Fleta, lib. 4, cap. </em>1, <em>sect. </em>7, <em>p. </em>213,) could be ascertained only through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the medium of deeds of which recognitors could never inquire. <em>Fleta, Lib. 5, Cap. </em>6, <em>sect., 55, p. </em>303, <em>Lib. </em>4, <em>Cap. </em>10, <em>sect. </em>2, <em>p. </em>233. Certain it is, that soon after this change in the action of ejectment, the assize was but little resorted to; and, in <em>7 Ed. </em>6, A. D. 1554, <em>Plowd. 89, </em>the course of the action was so far forgotten, that bo.th counsel and the court erred in a matter that must have b\u00e9en familiar to practitioners of the days of <em>Edward </em>3, and the error was corrected by authorities-from 23, and 2.6 assizes in <em>Edward 3, </em>decided more than 200 years previous,' which shows that the intermediate period was not replete with decisions on the law of assize.'. It is doubtful whether the assize can be revived for practical purposes. Printing with fusil types was not introduced \u25a0 into <em>England </em>till 1475, about a century after the decline of assizes. The old <em>Liber Intrationum </em>was not published till A. D. 1510, and the <em>Register, </em>not till some time after, <em>Steph. on PI. </em>7, and these books would probably be printed as early as any other. Much of the minute and practical in the law of assize, it is probable, was never committed to print. If, however, the entire system is extant, it is to be found in <em>Glanville, Bracton, Fleta, Brit-ton, </em>and cotemp\u00f3r\u00e1ry writers, and in the reports previous'to <em>Henry </em>6. Later writers supply but little on the subject, and that little is of less authority. <em>Littleton </em>wrote in. the time of <em>Edward </em>4. when the learning of assize was less known and the actions less frequent, <em>Hale\u2019s Hist, Com,. Law, </em>175.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-4\">I begin with the seventh exception. The/court should have quashed-the writ for want of answer to ;the second plea, setting forth an indenture, &amp;c. No notice is taken of this plea,'unless the words <em>without license and permission </em>prefatory to the plaintiff\u2019s joinder in issue on the third plea, are such. But this at most is denial of the defendant\u2019s inference as to the law, and bad, <em>Steph.' on PI. </em>215. 1 <em>Saund. </em>23, <em>(n. </em>5.) 1 It is a traverse of effect, not of fact, and therefore admits the fact, and the plaintiff is for ever estopped from denying the fact; even in another suit, <em>Steph. on Pl. </em>234. The recognitors or jury, were estopped to find the contrary, <em>Bull. N.

Here is implied -confession of the whole, without avoidance of any thing. And whether the true inference of the law is deduced in the conclusion of the plea, viz. license and permission, is of no consequence; for if iiTany way it can defeat the action, the court will <em>ex officio </em>so declare it, notwithstanding any inaccuracy in deducing the legal inference, <em>Plowd. </em>66. This plea shows <em>prima facie </em>a right in <em>Barnet, </em>(which is enough, <em>Steph. on Pl. </em>354,) and nothing appears in any part of. the record to show that the right is not still sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>sisting. It might have been terminated by three months\u2019 notice. But if such notice had been replied, the replication would have been demurrable, which shows that the assize was not the legal remedy.

As it regards, therefore, the question of remedy, .the erection was thereby made lawful <em>ab initio; </em>and so an erection by license and permission, which is a valid defence. <em>Fleta, Lib. </em>4, <em>Cap. 3, sect. </em>8. <em>Cap. </em>28, <em>sect. </em>15. <em>Cap. </em>26, <em>sect. </em>3, <em>pp. </em>220, 273, 267. It was in law an <em>abatement </em>of the nuisance, for the erection was thereafter rightfully maintained; and it is a good plea that the plaintiff at any time, (or defendant before writ purchased,) has abated the nuisance, <em>Rep. </em>55. <em>Bro.

(I. 2.) <em>pl. </em>1, in margin: and this inference might have been deduced in the conclusion of the plea instead of license and permission. The plea certainly set up a defence to the .claim for damage, from 1806; for it shows a grant of the privilege, for a stipulated sum, since 1808, and shows in effect a release or accord and satisfaction as to all before 1808. Another circumstance demands notice. This plea tendered no issue \u2014 it would have been demurrable if it had, \"because it set up new matter. Of-course <em>joinder in issue </em>on it was impossible. The.plaintiffs joinder in issue, therefore, though informal, (see <em>Plowd. </em>91. <em>Co. Ent. </em>92, <em>b. 61, b.) </em>can refer onfy to the third plea, because he says, that he <em>likewise </em>(i.e.in the <em>like way) </em>puts himself, on the assize, but the conclusion of the second plea is to the court. If the <em>similiter </em>is referrihle to the third plea only, the second plea is unanswered; if to. the second as well as the third plea, (it being nothing more than a joinder in the prayer at the conclusion of each plea,) it is-as to the second plea equivalent to-a demurrer, which admits, as- this plea does, the fact, but denies the effect. In any other view the defendant would be injured. He could, not demur, after issue joined, for a demur.rer is properly an excuse for not pleading on to issue. 3 <em>Tho. Co. Lit. </em>438. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>could not strike out the similiter, and then demur, for it was not his part to add it. , And thus mere matter of law expressly referred by him to the judgment of the court., was, in spite of him, referred\u2019to the recognitors,for their judgment, in direct violation of the maxim <em>ad cjuestiones juris non respondent jur\u00e1tores. </em>The plea concludes with prayer'of judgment that the writ be quashed. The same was repeated <em>ore tenus </em>after the l\u00e1st pleading was put in. This was the proper method. See <em>Fleta, lib. </em>5, <em>cap. </em>6, <em>sect. </em>44, <em>p. </em>301, for the ancient practice, which, however, is proved by the pleadings in assize.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-4\"><em>Exception </em>6th.

If either plaintiff or defendent be not tenant of the respective freehold, the defendant may plead the fact. The question of the plaintiff\u2019s freehold is, however, a partofth'e contents of the general issue, which is, \u201c nothing levied to the nuisance-of the <em>plaintiff\u2019s freehold.\u201d </em>16 <em>Vin. 42, pl. </em>10; and it seems therefore unnecessary to plead it specially, where the general issue is also pleaded. But it is otherwise as to the question, whether the defendant has a freehold in the land on which the nuisance is. \u2018The general issue raises.no question as to this, and the defendant must plead the fact if he would have the benefit of it. .This is a material, distinction. The former, on the plea of <em>mil tenant </em>if pleaded* need not be answered \u2014 the latter, or plea of <em>non tenure, </em>must be; and the distinction supplies a reason for the rule. . The plea in question is <em>non tenure without disclaimer. </em>It is really a bar, though often called a plea in abatement. It gives not a better writ. It denies the defendant\u2019s liability to the action. 2 <em>Saund. 44, note 4. Gilb. C. P. </em>250. <em>Thel. Dig. lib. </em>11, <em>cap. </em>22, <em>sect. 4. </em>It must be answered. In <em>Fleta, lib. </em>5, <em>cap. </em>6, <em>sect. </em>44, a form of this plea is given, and the author adds <em>et quo comperto vel non dedicto cassabitur breve. </em>He then gives two <em>forms of replication. </em>The words, <em>11 or not denied,\u201d </em>and the fact that forms of replication'are given, prove the position. If <em>non tenure </em>of. parcel is pleaded, tenure of the residue is admitted by implication, and the plaintiff may abridge his plaint to the'parcel admitted, which abridgment confesses the defendant\u2019s plea. 2 <em>Saund. </em>44, <em>note </em>3. <em>Gilb.

Lit. </em>362, is a traverse of the plea, (and this shows the plea to be a bar to the action-;) it was the answer requisite to the attainment of damages, and without, which it is expressly said in <em>Co. Lit. </em>362; he would lose them, and judgment therefore is erroneous. As the plaintiff chose not to aver his writ, he should have waved his damage, and taken judgment, .(viz. the judgment prayed by the plea,) and issued execution at his peril. See <em>Bro. Judgment, </em>132, for the nature of the judgment. Suppose, however, the plaintiff was right in his position that the first and second plea required no answer, our next proposition is, that oh that, supposition, they should have been found specially and at large. <em>10th Exception, </em>2d and 3d <em>Specifications. </em>This is proved by the most obvious principles and express authorities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-4\">If special matter be pleaded in abatement or in bar, the assize shall be taken at large. <em>Com. Dig Assize, B. </em>19. To take the assize at large, is to take a <em>special verdict. Booth, </em>212, 213. Here is no special verdict. Non tenure, it is true, can'neither be pleaded nor found specially, it being a mere negative; but <em>tenure, </em>which the recognitors here .have found is an affirmative, and the acts or faets constituting the supposed title of estate holden, admit of a special finding,-so as to leave the question of law whether they constitute a tenancy of the freehold or not to the court. There is no finding at all on the second plea, for the whole residue of the verdict is merely a tautological finding of the general issue. General principles are violated by the course pursued in this case. It is a curious feature of the law of assize that it allows not answers to pleas of a certain description; yet such is the fact. Whafthese pleas are it may be .difficult in some cases to determine; but that being ascertained there is no difficulty in showing that all such must be specially found The object of pleadings is to furnish a medium for the application of the principle <em>ad questiones juris non respondent juratores. </em>So far as the parties agree upon the facts in\u2019 their pleadings, (which they may do wholly or in part,) the office of the jury is superseded, and the jury is estopped to find the truth even against the state of the fae(s as detailed and conceded in the pleadings. <em>Ham. Anal. </em>21. 2 <em>Rep. </em>4, <em>B. N. P. </em>298. Hence demurrers to declarations \u2014 to pleas \u2014 to evidence. Hence the special traverse, the general issue concluding with an <em>issiat, </em>the object of which prevents the law arising from the fact from going before-a jury. <em>Steph. on Pl. </em>201. And these forms of pleading, for this reason were very common before the'practice of granting new trials. <em>Ham. Anal, of Pl. </em>13, 14. Judgments <em>non obstante verer dicto </em>and the power of the court to control the jury on the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>pound or complex issues, show it the constitutional power of the court to decide the law. <em>Willes, </em>583. <em>Vaughan, </em>135. <em>Bushel's </em>case. There is no equivalent in the law of assize by which this object may be attained in regard, to pleas'not answerable, but the' special verdict, and without this the recognitors become uncontrollable arbiters of. the law arising on such pieas. In this case the question of freehold raised by the\" first plea is a mere question of-law, and the colourable matter usually pleaded in assize involves this question. <em>Steph. on Pl. </em>193, 228, 230, 231, and colour to be good must be doubtful, to <em>lay gents </em>or the jury, <em>tdreh. Dig. Pl. </em>212. A series of inferences results from the position that these pleas were not answerable. They were\u201d not demurrable, <em>Plowd. </em>91. <em>Booth, </em>270, consequently they could not be proved or disproved by testimony, for <em>frustra fit per plur a quod fieri potest per pandora. </em>See <em>Bl. Com. </em>402. The court could not charge, not knowing the facts, nor grant a new trial or recognition <em>de novo. There </em>is no example of a recognition <em>de novo, </em>new trials having come in lieu of attaints, which went into disuse with recognitions. Nor would a recognition <em>de novo, </em>meet the exigency of a supposed error not in the recognition, but in a plea collateral to it. But suppose evidence adduced under these'pleas, it could not be demurred to, for. the plea itself is not demurrable. <em>Plowd. </em>91. In short, the court can take no notice of such pleas till after verdict found on them., <em>Plowd. </em>.89, <em>elseq. </em>proves this. In that case the plaintiff demurred improperly to a plea.of this description. The court, after argument and consultation, sustained the demurrer. Then the plaintiff discovered his error, yet the court put it to the recognitors to inquire of this plea, and it is.absurd to suppose they admitted testimony and charged on a plea which they, had already adjudged idle. Anciently the maxim <em>ad questiones, juris, </em>&amp;c. was adhered to with great strictness. The assize could not decide on the law connected with disseisin, though involved in the general issue. <em>Worth, on Juries, </em>118, <em>119. Glanv. Lib. </em>2, <em>Cap. </em>6, <em>p. </em>61. The <em>Stat. of West. </em>2, <em>Cap. </em>30, however, declares that if the jury will of their own head say it is disseisin, their verdict <em>shall be admitted at their peril. Rob. Dig. </em>326. -. The <em>peril </em>attached to the performance of this act, amounts to a\u2019restriction upon the performance. With much less plausibility can it be contended that they could decide the law arising from collateral matters. See <em>Worth, on Juries, </em>119, 173, 174. They do, however, unless they render a special verdict. But waving the. argument thus far, the oath \u201c well and truly to try this <em>matter of assize </em>according to the evidence,\u201d does not comprise these pleas, which are collateral to the \u00e1ssize; and so the finding on them, if otherwise unobjectionable, was not under oath. <em>(9th Exception. </em>In regard to all' matters collateral to the assize, or not of the point of assize, the recognitors could act only as a <em>jurata, </em>arid should have taken the juror\u2019s oath. <em>Booth, </em>210, <em>pl. </em>10, <em>pp. </em>213, 214.

It is not the oath prescribed by the ancient law; for which see <em>Fleta, lib. </em>4, <em>cap. </em>9, <em>sect. </em>1, <em>p. </em>230. <em>Worth, on Juries, </em>86, 7. The ancient oath was administered in 3 <em>Wils. </em>541. <em>Litt. sebt, </em>514. The oath in this case, is evidently formed on the-modern juror\u2019s oath. It omits, however,- the phrase, \u201cand a true verdict give,\u201d which hath its equivalent in the ancient oath. No ancient oath\u2019 can be altered or new one imposed but by act of parliament. 2 <em>Inst. </em>479. 3 <em>Inst. </em>165. Either the ancient oath, or the. oath prescribed by the act of assembly, 4 <em>Smith, </em>329, should have been adopted. , Courts cannot compel a juror to take an oath unknown to thb law. The principle assumed in this case, is legislation, and would authorize the devising of an oath on every trial. This oath,is also defective in this. It does not comprise the question of damage.. (11th <em>Exception.) </em>Damages are not of the <em>matters of assize. </em>The assize is taken at large when the recognitors inquire of the damages. <em>Booth, </em>213, <em>pl. </em>10, 2. This error is'traceable to another, that of counting for damages. (15th <em>Exception.) </em>The whole duty,of the assize is specified in the recital of the writ in the plaint, v.iz, to inquire of the plaintiff\u2019s freehold, the wrongful act, and whether the act is a nuisance. <em>Co. Ent. </em>92, <em>a. </em>The plaint is merely an amplification of the. writ. In the conclusion the nuisance is assigned in particular, but no sum in damages is demanded.' So are all the plaints, <em>Lib. Intrat. 122. Rastal\u2019s Ent. Browne, Dec. </em>&amp; <em>Pl. </em>67. Which shows that assessing damages is not part of a recognition But it is itself error. In <em>Pilford\u2019s </em>case, <em>cap. </em>9, 10 <em>Rep. </em>117. <em>a. </em>it is said that in real actions the demandant shall never count of damages. <em>Booth, </em>75, <em>note </em>2, <em>Burr. </em>1086, 7. The course of the proceeding is detailed in <em>Fleta, lib. 4, cap.,9, p. </em>230, from <em>sect. </em>1, to <em>sect. </em>9. In <em>sect. </em>9, it is said after judgment as to the assize, the justices inquire of the damages. The inquiry of damages, was therefore premature. The defendant .was not bound to come ,prepared to go into it at that time, as he could not know any other course of pror ceeding than that detailed in the books.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-8\">.

Fleta, lib. 4, cap. </em>5, <em>sect. 8, p. </em>2.23. But it giyes the defendant the benefit of having it inquired of, and the judgment at common law varies according to the finding. If force be found, the judgment is a <em>capiatur pro fine. Lib. Intrat. </em>122, 3. If negatived, the judgment is a <em>misericordia. Co. Ent. 92, b. </em>Neither of .these judgments (the only forms at common law) can be entered, for the law \"does not presume that there was no force from the, omission in the verdict,, as it does in trespass. <em>Bro. Assize, </em>67. This defect cannot be cured by-verdict, as it arises on it. The statute 16 and 17 <em>Car. 2, cap. </em>8, <em>Rob. Dig. </em>39, 40, does not apply to this case. It -gives, the court power only to amend, and of course applies to amendable errors only. In this case either judgment would be incongruous with the previous part of the'record. No legal judgment'could be entered, but judgment <em>nisi </em>was certainly improper. (12th <em>Exception.) </em>It is obvious that the provisions of the judgment must be adapted to the state of the fact, and the nature of the nuisance, and must therefore be in definite arid precise, terms. -Hence, on this view, the plaintiff must show the jurors, <em>de eo quod'nocet qualecunque sit illud'vel quantum velper quas metas ut certa res in Judicium reducatur. Fleta, lib. 4, cap. </em>27, <em>sect. </em>19, <em>pp. </em>269, 270. The redress is specific, by prostration, rebuilding, repairing, opening, ad-measuring, so as to conform to the ancient state in height, breadth, length, depth,- narroWness, &amp;c. <em>Fleta, lib. 4, cap. 28, sect. 4, p. </em>270. Sir <em>William Blackstone </em>supposes that the remedies of. the ancient law contain an equivalent for the specific remedies of chancery. 3 <em>Com. 52. </em>The, courts, in ancient times, pronounced their judgments in actions of assize of nuisance with great deliberation upon the case settled by the verdict. <em>Fleta, lib. </em>4, <em>cap. 9, sect. </em>8, <em>p. </em>231. <em>Worthington on Juries-, 95. </em>In no real actions can judgment be entered without motion in open court. 3 <em>Caines, </em>139. The practice adopted in this case is,exceedingly dangerous. In dower, and in those real actions where the judgment is executed by a writ of <em>Habere fac. seis., </em>there is little danger: the realty remains, but the execution in this case is destructive, and should not be moulded by the party to suit his own views. A house, a mill, or a dam may be reduced to ruins, when the judgment of the court would require but a slight alteration. Admitting, therefore* that in those real actions tp which a general form of execution- is applicable, and which effect only a transmutation of possession, a judgment in .this form would be good; the peculiarity of this action of assize of -nuisance is one in principle, and is sufficient to bring it-within the rule contended for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-6\"><em>2nd Exception. </em>The writ of assize is defective in form and substance, and without precedent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-7\">This exception touches a vital part\u2019of the case, and, if tenable, must be fatal. -Original Writs are the subjects of legislative en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>actment; they were all established and approved by the common council of the whole realm, and can <em>(nulla terms) </em>in no respect be altered. <em>Co.

The originals were essential to the due institution <em>of </em>the suits, and limited and defined the action itself. Anciently no case was remediable to which the language of some known writ did not apply, and hence the enumeration of writs and that of actions became identical. <em>Steph. Pl. </em>8. This .writ contains the clause that the defendant be put, &amp;c. to appear <em>and recognise. </em>This is not the object of the original in assize.. The object of the appearance is to <em>hear </em>the recognition: See <em>Co. Ent. 92, a. Glanv. </em>336, <em>et passim. </em>This is a variance in substance. See <em>Glanv. </em>278, <em>(note,) </em>and is fatal. <em>Cro. Eliz. </em>402. It omits the phrase in the original writ, <em>vel ballivum si ipse non inventus est, </em>and the defendant has a right to appear by bailiff in assize. <em>Com. Dig. Assize, B. 8, p. 563.

Another objection is, that the writ in this ease has no precedent. It may be described an <em>action of assize of nuisance on the case, </em>which is a novelty. All writs of assize of nuisance are <em>brevia format a. </em>The want of power to form writs upon the circumstances of the ease, occasioned the statute of <em>Westminster, </em>2 <em>cap. </em>24. <em>Rob. Dig. </em>157. This statute gave the power of forming writs to the clerks in chancery only; and to them only in cases closely analogous to existing writs, <em>in consimili casu. </em>It has long since been expended. No new writs at the present day can be formed by authority of it. 3 <em>Bl. Com. </em>52. The general form of the modern action on the ease, was devised by the clerks to provide for all the cases similar to those provided for by formed writs in assize of nuisance, and it is this mode of executing the power given to that state, which Sir <em>Wm. Blackstone </em>regrets. And not only were the similar cases provided for in this way, but the formed <em>brevia </em>in assize then existing, have been converted into the action on the case. This conversion of formed writs into actions on the ease, was, for some time, resisted, but was long since fully established; <em>Ham. N. P. </em>8, 30, <em>note. </em>4 <em>Co. </em>94. <em>Yelv. </em>21. <em>Cro. Eliz. </em>198, 199, 520, 845. This is a writ of assize, for obstructing a watercourse. There is no such writ: 2 <em>Roll. M. </em>144, (P.) <em>pl. 6, </em>16 <em>Fin. </em>37, <em>pl. </em>6, are authorities in point. The register of writs contains no such writ. See <em>pp. </em>197, 199. <em>Fitz. N. B. </em>183, 184. The objection of novelty is not new. It was taken to a writ of assize of nuisance in 22 <em>Hen.

The plaint or count, is the plaint of the writ amplified. No writ, of course, exists for the, casq, if the assize is not applicable to such seisin, as is alleged. The seisin in assize must' be in <em>demesne. </em>Real actions are divided into four classes, corresponding with the. four kinds of seisin. <em>Booth, Int-rod. pp. 2, </em>3; viz. seisin, (1) as of fee, demesne, and rights, (2)s\u00e9isin as of fee and rights, (3) seisin as of fee and demesne, (4) seisin as of demesne. <em>Fleta, Fet Assavoir, p. </em>446, <em>sect. </em>14. See <em>Glanv. </em>39, <em>note. </em>Writs of assize of <em>Nov. Diss., </em>and writs which begin <em>Si a. te fecerit securum, </em>are applicable only to seisin in demesne. The. writ of assize of nuisance is of this class. <em>Fleta, lib. </em>4, cap. 28, <em>sect. </em>8, p. 271.' <em>Davis\u2019s Rep. </em>151. See <em>Plowd. </em>154, and <em>Fleta, lib. 5, cap. </em>10, <em>sect. 1, p. </em>316. A man cannot be seised in demesne of any thing incorporeal. 2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>106, 107. Seisin in demesne applies to such property only as can be subjected to some service, and not to a service to which corporeal property is subjected. See 1 <em>Bart. Elem. Con. </em>58, <em>note. </em>The. <em>dominicum </em>may be in one while an appendage or service is in another. 2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>104. <em>Non dominici pais est usufruclus.

Hence, in the action on the case, after alleging seisin or possession, it is necessary to aver, in order to exclude, this inference or conclusion, that by \u2022 reason thereof, the plaintiff ought to have the benefit of the current, &amp;e., as in 1 <em>Saund </em>346, note.(2,) 8 <em>Wentworth, </em>535, or prescribe in a <em>que estate, </em>as in <em>Lil. Ent. </em>62; <em>Co.

If it\u2019be in gross, assize lies not, but covenant, or case. 2 <em>Roll. Ass. </em>141, 142. <em>Ass. H. pl. </em>12, 13. , A man cannot .be seised in his demesne of a stream of water, 2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>18, nor bring his action to recover possession of water by the name of a po\u00f3l or watercourse. A watercourse is a thing quite distinct from the land.- 1 <em>Wils. </em>175. <em>Poph. </em>166. So of the mill site. This is not alleged <em>qua </em>land, but as a possible'use of the-stream <em>and </em>the-land. The stream, or rather the <em>impetus </em>of the stream, is the thing of value, and the invasion of the plaintiff\u2019s property in it, is evidently the <em>gravamen </em>of the plaint. Undoubtedly a man may grant the rights of erecting a mill on his land between given points, (see <em>Angell, </em>10.) and this would be the grant of a <em>mill site, </em>and yet, (notwithstanding such a grant,) the <em>demesne </em>would still remain in the grantor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>and a use only be parted with, of which the grantee might be seised as of fee, but not in demesne. The precedents of this action all show an actual present injury done to some <em>corporeal </em>tenement, of which seisin in demesne is with propriety alleged. <em>Co. Ent. </em>92. <em>Lib. Intrat. </em>122. <em>Rastal Entr. </em>See also <em>Bro. dlbr. Nuis. pi. 16; </em>14, 19, 18. Action <em>stir le case, </em>57. But, again, this action is never applied to nuisances, which are not by law'abateable, although the action on the case often is; and this is a characteristic distinction between the action on tlje case and the assize of nuisance. The rule on the subject of redress by act of party is laid down in 4 <em>Burr. </em>2428, and in 1 <em>Burr. </em>265, 267, and restricts this mode of redress to actual palpable injuries, requiring no exercise of judgment. In. 9 <em>Rep. </em>55, <em>(a.) </em>redress by act of the party, and assize, are spoken of .as co-ordinate remedies, See also <em>Cro. Car. </em>184, 185. <em>King </em>v. <em>Wharton, </em>12 <em>Mod. </em>510, If a way be only narrowed, case lies; if wholly stopped, assize of nuisance lies. <em>Bro.

I argue from the coincidence. The cause of this distinction is supplied by the history of the. origin of the writs themselves. When every writ was the result of legislative enactment, the grosser and palpable injuries would be naturally the first objects of attention. Mills would be provided for before mill sites, and actual uses before possible and prospective uses. A man\u2019s visible and productive freehold rather than his purposes. The catalogue of grosser injuries was not exhausted when the compendious and general form of the action on the case was devised by the clerks, into which the whole residue of similar injuries was .thrown. This mode of providing for them, was in some measure dictated by necessity. To have pursued the mode of legislation for each particular case, into thewide field now occupied by the action on' the case, would have swelled the register to many volumes. Chief Justice Holt\u2019s reasoning in 2 <em>Lord Raym. </em>958, applies, and is applied by him to the action on the easel it is not true as applied by Mr. <em>Lewis </em>to the assize in <em>Brack. L. Mis. </em>447. The fallacy consists in the misapplication of correct principles. The assignment of the nuisance, in this plaint, indicates the real nature of the grievance. It is, diminishing the fall of the water, so that the plaintiff could not do (not as he had done) but as he <em>otherwise would </em>have done. In \u00e1ll the plaints cited, and the pleas cited, from <em>Bro. Abr. Nuis. </em>14, 16, 18, 19, the averment is, that the plaintiff could not do as he <em>had used to do; </em>thus averring, the interruption of an actual existing use, which is essential to a nuisance in the sense of this action. <em>Baten\u2019s Case, </em>in 9 <em>Rep. </em>54, is an exception <em>et exceptio probat regulam. </em>The principle vouched is, <em>Lex non requirit verifican quod apparet -curiae; </em>and, on that ground, the court distinguished the case from those cited by the defendant\u2019s counsel, otherwise it would have fallen under this rule. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>action on the case, you need not prove a specific injury. Show a right, and an invasion of it, and it is enough to recover, even if the defendant show that such invasion was in fact a benefit. <em>Nor. Peake, </em>493, 494. But it is not so in assize; \u2014 it must be injurious as well as prejudicial. <em>Fleta, lib. 4, cap. 28, sect. </em>13, <em>sect. 14, pp. 273, 274. </em>This reasoning is not evaded by saying that this writ is <em>in consimili casu.-. </em>The argument is, that there is no such writ among the ancient originals formed by parliament, nor <em>in co.nsimilt casu </em>formed by the clerks in pursuance of the authority of the statute. The clerks did not form this writ. All the special writs which they formed are in the register. <em>Steph. on PI. 7; </em>but they provided for the case detailed in it by the general form of the action on the case, which is the writ in <em>consimili casu </em>that the plaintiff should have adopted. The principle assumed by the plaintiff would allow the conversion of every possible declaration in the action on the case for a nuisance, into an assize of nuisance on the same'case. This would be opening a wide field for this action, and the application of its specific redress would be a^'ample, as the greatest diligence of the ancient clerks in the chancery, or the utmost liberality of the judges could have made if. See 3 <em>Blacks. Com. 52.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-5\"><em>Exception </em>4th.

It does.not appear, from any .thing averred, that the plaintiff had any thing more than a momentary seisin.on the 1st of <em>January, </em>1806. Such a seisin would satisfy the averment; nor that this momentary seisin was not after the act complained of; nor that the seisin had not passed t\u00f3 some other before the act complained of. Yet, if it was the seisin of any other, and not of the plaintiff, that was violated at the time of the act done, the plaintiff cannot have this action, though the seisin subsequently came to him, <em>Bro. Nuis. </em>16. 16 <em>Vin. 41, </em>(X.) <em>pl. </em>1, and <em>note pl. 3, pa. 29, pl. 20. Fleta, lib. 4, cap. 27, sect. </em>19, <em>p. 270; </em>but <em>quod permittat, </em>if any thing would be the remedy. For the requisite degree of precision in averment, see <em>Leeds </em>v. <em>Shakerly, Cro. Eliz. 751. Stansby\u2019s Case, Id. 754, Sir Nicholas Point\u2019s Case, Cro. Jac. 214. </em>The two last are cases of forcible entry, yet the rule is equally rigorous in assize of nuisance; for anciently it was equally penal in its consequences. See <em>Fleta, lib. 4, cap. 28, sect. </em>1, <em>p, 270. </em>Hence the necessity to inquire after the force. If the recognitors had found force,,the defendant might move this obj\u00e9ction in arrest of the judgment <em>cap. pro fine, </em>and conclude <em>non constat, </em>whose seisin was violated, as in the cases cited. See the plaint in <em>Co; Ent, 92, </em>where the ahx<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ious precision of the pleader in averring the seisin, was unnecessary, unless this be fatal neglect. The verdict in this case cures nothing. It derives all its certainty from the plaint. Unless title is alleged, the recognitors find none, for they find the fact to.be as the plaintiff has declared. The rule on the curative operation of verdicts, is well laid down in 1 <em>Day\u2019s Rep. </em>186, 187, <em>note. </em>, See also 9 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>91. <em>Steph. on Pl. </em>166, 167.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-5\"><em>Exception </em>1st. The writ is contrary to the act of the 20th of <em>March, </em>1724-5, <em>Purd. Dig. </em>28, 1 <em>Sm. Laws, </em>165, which makes it the privilege of freeholders to be sued by summons. The proof that the defendant is within the protection of this act is on the record, and also the decision of the court below, that the use of this, writ is consistent with the protection intended to be given,by it. The act declares that the writ against freeholders shall be a' summons in the form there given. \u2022 This writ is . certainly not a summons, nor in the form prescribed, and fhe protection of the act, by express terms, extends to matters of form. <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Field, </em>1 <em>Dall. </em>348, 349. <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Howell, Id. </em>310.

The cdurt below, in their opinion, say \u201c the sheriff has <em>only served </em>the writ on the defendant.\u201d <em>Serving </em>a writ is executing its exigency \u2014 doing what it bids to be done, which in this case is putting by sureties and safe pledges. No specific return, but attached by pledges, or by goods, or attached and committed for want of sureties, or <em>non es't inventus, </em>(see the returns cited, and see another form of return in Fleta, <em>lib. </em>2, <em>cap. 69, sect. 1, p. 153,) </em>would answer the exigency, or be otherwise than merely void.

Every evil intended to be remedied by .those acts exists in regard to recognitors, as well as jurors. The sheriff, by this practice, is relieved from the check of the wheel, the commissioners and the statutory oath. . He acts also without the sanction of the common law oath, provided for the case. See the <em>Register, Cro. Car. </em>26. <em>Imp. Sheriff, </em>32. Unless the objection is tenable, this is an instance in which the policy of modern law is,evaded, by the revival of an obsolete remedy. If the plaintiff sues in case, the act applies, and the defendant is protected;, if in assize, he is at the mercy of the sheriff,, and so by the election of the party his rights are varied. .

Its object probably is to indicate the opinion of the court whether collateral matters pleaded are triabl\u00e9 by the assize or not, or whether.in point of law they \u00e1re a bar to the action.

The process, in 'assizes, was a summons; attachment never went but when the party was in,contempt. It never was necessary that the tenant in an assize should be a freeholder. It was enough that he claimed to have right to do the thing complained of. In-early times the recognitors must know the facts of their own knowledge, and decide solely on that knowledge without witnesses. The first notice we have of any recognition or assize, is in the constitutions of <em>Clarendon, </em>A. D. 1164. It'was not until many years after the reign o\u00a3 <em>Edw. </em>1, that juries were permitted to judge of presumptions, in other words to decide upon evidence submitted to them.Previous to this tim\u00e9, trial by jury or recognitors was but a- trial by witnesses. Indeed the system of trial by jury was not fully adopted, and the rights and power of jurors defined until the time of <em>Edw. </em>6, and of <em>Mary.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-5\">There was in the early and unimproved ages of the law, say up to the reign of <em>Henry 3, </em>much true legal learning on the subject of exceptions to the assize; that is, other matters than the mere seisin and disseisin, and as to the mode of trying them, the differences between <em>assisa </em>and <em>jurqta,' </em>what matters were properly triable by assize, and what not. .- These exceptions or incidental points in <em>Glanville\u2019s </em>time, and he is supposed to have been Chief\" Justice to <em>Henry 2, </em>were generally decided' either by .duel or by summoning other recognitors to try such exceptions or .incidental facts. It was, however, before the close of the reign of <em>Henry </em>3,' adopted as the rule that the incidental points should be tried by the-same recognitors, not in <em>modum assisse, </em>but in <em>modum </em>juratse, <em>as it were </em>by consent. On the trial it was finally determined as a disseisin or a trespass, according to the nature of the case. In the latter case the assize was turned into a jury. ' This was the rule, it would appear, too, as well in <em>Bracton\u2019s </em>time, as in the reigns of <em>Henry </em>3, and <em>Edw. 2. </em>' '</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-6\">In the early stages of jurisprudence in <em>England, </em>the only contests arising among the people, for the determination of which the intervention of the courts was necessary, were those in relation to real estates and the possession of them: for of so little importance was personal property considered, that it 'was not until the statute of <em>Westminster\u2019 </em>3d, that any execution in personal actions was given.

It was the simple remedy of unsophisticated times to restore a party to his rights, whether deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>of them by lawless force, or as a consequence of tortious acts. It lay in all cases of disseisin and re-disseisin. \u25a0 The most common writs of assize were <em>navel disseisin, de marte anticessoris, ultimas presentationis, de nocumento liberi tenementi, </em>and <em>de communse pasturas, </em>and these were all the writs of <em>novel disseisin </em>mentioned by <em>Glanville; </em>and, upon judgment being given for the demandant, a writ of seisin issued to restore the party to his rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-5\">In- the reign of <em>Henry </em>3, the meaning of the term disseisin became enlarged: every wrongful withholding from a man his tenements \u2014 -every obstruction of the free use of his freehold to its full extent \u2014 putting sheep, or digging upon a man\u2019s land, under claim of an easement, (for if done without claim of right it was a mere trespass,) \u2014 the improper use of an easement to which one had a right \u2014 distraining for service not due, or where due-exceeding the bounds of a reasonable distress, were all considered disseisins and the subject of assizes. .In short, if-one claimed-to partake with the right owner, or raised an unjust contention against him, it was a disseisin of the freehold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-6\">Nuisanee being an injury'to the freehold, was considered in the nature of a disseisin, and like it w\u2019as redressed by assize, and the proceeding on it was precisely .the same, <em>(mutatis, mutandis,) </em>as in assize of <em>novel disseisin.- </em>In <em>Glanville\u2019s </em>time no mention is made of any other writ for the redress of injury by a nuisance than assize; but in the time of <em>Henry </em>3,- we find several writs to the sheriff on questions of nuisance, commanding .the sheriff to hear and determine the plaint, &amp;c. of <em>quare proslavit, ad noc..lib. ten. Quare, fyc. viam obstruxit, fyc. Quare divertit cursum etquse, S\u00a1-c.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-7\">Nuisance was so much in the nature of a disseisin, that sometimes it might, be treated either as a nuisance or a disseisin. If a person caused water to overflow, if it rose on the complainant\u2019s own freehold, which it most probably would if he had land on both sides, this was thought rather- a disseisin than a nuisance. But if part was in one and part in the other, and-the water run over both grounds, then for one part he - might have an assize of <em>novel disseisin </em>of freehold, for the other an. assize- of nuisance. So that here would be two assizes on account of the same land. Of the two remedies, however, <em>Bracton </em>advises the assize of nuisance as the most likely to remove the whole mischief, by removing the cause. s \u25a0 .. -</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-8\">The statute <em>de consimili casu, Westminster, </em>2, <em>c. 24, </em>in effect directed the framing of writs for remedy of every wrong; under its provisions, in the 22 <em>Edw. 3, </em>the action of trespass on the case was adopted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-9\">We have no cases reported until the time of <em>Edw. 2: </em>up to and during the reign of <em>Edw. </em>1, all the pleas were, <em>viva voce.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-10\">The distinction between <em>assisa </em>and <em>jurata </em>was, in effect, abolished by the statutes passed in the reign of <em>Edw. 3, </em>which gave at-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>taint in all pleas of land against jurors as well as recognitors, which destroyed the reason for the difference: and thenceforth the assize was turned,into a jury as often as they were put to inquire of any matter besides the mere seisin and disseisin,. ...</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-6\">The assize could be taken four ways: \u2014 1st, In the point of assize; \u2014 2d.

The assize <em>taken at large </em>was when, notwithstanding some deed or special matter pleaded, the title and all the,circumstances were sent to be tried by -the recognitors. <em>Taking at .large </em>was the most liberal way of doing justice to the parties.

The refusal to quash for want of answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>to the first plea. This was a plea .of non-tenure. Non-tenure is a plea in abatement, 3 <em>Reeves, </em>459. <em>Booth, </em>8. It should have beep verified.

If tenant plead not'tenure, the demandant may aver his writ, and go on for .damages. But, as said in answer, to the 7th error assigned, the refusal to quash is_ not error. No replication was necessary. The defendant went on to trial, and the recognitors passed on the matter of the plea, and found it against him. tie made no objection to the jury being sworn for want of the cause being at issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"182\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-6\">10th <em>Error. </em>The insufficiency of the verdict to support the judgment, \u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"183\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-7\">1. As to the recognitors not inquiring of the force. The writ of assize sets forth no force. But it is no error if force is not found. 2 <em>Inst. </em>236, <em>note 5</em>. It was not necessary that they should find that-the injury was committed with force, or without it. 2 <em>Inst. </em>399, 2 <em>Bulst. </em>160, 161. In <em>Wentz v.Kline, </em>affipnedin this court, the jury say nothing about the force in their verdict. There is no difference in the consequences resulting from a verdict in assize, whether the injury was done with force or not, at this day. The distinction between \u00a3\u00a3 <em>capiatur pro fine </em>and <em>in misericordia, </em>&amp;e. is at this day mere form, a distinction without a diffei\u2019ence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"184\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-8\">2d <em>Specification </em>\u2014 That the matter of the first plea should have been found at large, divested of all questions of law, as to what was a freehold and what not. The finding is as specific, and as much at large, as the plea. The recognitors have negatived the plea in its own words. All the pleas out of the points of assize, go before the recognitors, 3 <em>Reeves, </em>23; and their finding, as to the matter alleged against it, in its own words, is sufficient. The question of freehold might be a mixed question of fact and of law, on which it was the province of the recognitors under the direction of the court as to the law, to pass. If the court misdirected as to the law, the party could except to the opinion. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"185\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-9\">The 3d <em>Specification-o\u00ed </em>this error\u2019 \u2014 That the m\u00e1tter of the 2d plea should have been specially found, is answered already. None of these pleas ought to have been treated as pleas. They were not verified, and were defective, and the matter of them could be properly tried under <em>mil tort -nul disseisin. </em>If they were not pleas in abatement, they were pleas out of the points of assize, upon-which the recognitors liad a right to pass, and give a general verdict. 3 <em>Reeves, </em>23, 27, 28.</p>\n<p data-order=\"186\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-10\">\u25a0 9th <em>Error </em>\u2014 That the recognitors were not properly sworn. They were sworn as the recognitors were in <em>Livesay </em>v. <em>Gorgas. </em>The form of that oath was adopted by <em>My.'Lewis, </em>whose character for accuracy, and correct practice, needs no commendation to give ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>it weight in this country. His opponent, Mr. <em>Rawle, </em>another veteran at the bar, would have availed himself of the error, if one it was, in a case which was fought inch by inch. The ease of <em>Livesay </em>v. <em>Gorgas, </em>has in all its details, and particularly in this, been followed in practice for 18 years, in a number of, cases which have been mentioned. This decision at <em>Nisi Prius, </em>thus tacitly sanctioned in this court, by rendering judgment on it, and acquiesced in so long, is surely as good authority as to the groper form of the oath, as any of the- old authorities in <em>England, </em>when oaths were different from what they are now. The court will intend nothing against the proceeding. 3 <em>Bulstr. </em>80.</p>\n<p data-order=\"187\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-5\">The jury laws of this commonwealth do not apply to assizej nor does the oath of jurors prescribed by \u00f3ur act of assembly. The case of <em>Livesay </em>v. <em>Gorgas </em>was tried after the oath to jurors in common cases was prescribed by our act of assembly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"188\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-6\">As to the objection, that the oath administered does.not embrace the matter of damages, neither does the oath of an ordinary juror, or the oath of an arbitrator, who are sworn \u201cjustly and equitably to <em>try </em>all matters in variance submitted to them,\u201d <em>Purd. Dig. </em>19: not a word is said about making their award; all is embraced in the word <em>try. </em>So here the oath to try the matter of assize meant every thing relative to the assize. The attaint layas well for findings on collateral matters, as on the points of assize.</p>\n<p data-order=\"189\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-7\">15th <em>Error </em>\u2014 ^That the count was erroneous in counting for damages. As, under the statute of <em>Gloucester,' </em>damages are recoverable in assize, it is right they should be counted for.\u2019 They were counted for in <em>Livesay </em>v. <em>Gorgas, </em>and, as we claimed to recover damages, that claim should appear on the record,- <em>Wentz v. Kline, </em>It could, at all events, do no harm, even if it were not necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"190\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-8\">12th <em>Error </em>\u2014 That the judgment should not have been entered <em>nisi, </em>but at large. The judgment <em>nisi </em>is the, <em>Pennsylvania judgment:, </em>it is the judgment which the 'court entered in <em>Livesay v. Gorgas, </em>and the same kind of judgment which has been entered in all subsequent cases. It accords with the loose practice in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>where the docket entries are mere <em>memoranda. </em>It is to be moulded into form, and is gen\u00e9rally recited in form in the execution: it.is the j\u00fcdgm\u00e9nt of law, whatever that is, on the finding. .If the defendant wishes to see the judgment in this case reduced to form, it may be found in the execution which has been issued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"191\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-9\">Whatever may be, the decisions -about the necessity of entering judgment in real actions on motion in open, cpurt, they do not apply to this case for two reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"192\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-10\">1st. Assize of nuisance is not a real, but a mixed-action. <em>Woodeson, </em>23. <em>Roberts\u2019s Dig. </em>Whatever might have been its character originally, when by the statute damages were recoverable in it, it ceased to be a real action, and became a mixed one. And, it is from not. attending to this alteration in the law of assize, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>judges, in incidentally speaking of the remedy, have called it a real action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"193\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-4\">2nd. If it were necessary that the judgment should entered on motion, the court would,,in. this case, intend from the record, that it was done so, 5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>166. But, in point of fact, this judgment was rendered on motion, and the record returned shows that fact; for in the opinion of the court below in refusing to quash .the exegution, that fact is explicitly stated to be within the recollection of the court, if it were\u2019 necessary to be so entered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"194\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-5\">4th <em>Error. </em>\u2014 That the seisin is not alleged, &amp;c. This is not founded in fact: the plaint follows, <em>mutatis, mutandis, </em>that in <em>Livesay </em>v. <em>Gorgas, </em>and the subsequent cases. It alleges, that on the 1st of <em>January, </em>1806, the plaintiff was, and still is seised; <em>and being so seised, </em>the defendant, on the day and year aforesaid, unjustly and without judgment, &amp;c. The cause of action is well laid in this manner. In 2 <em>Bulst. </em>119, and <em>3 Bulst. </em>86, the court have decided, that the laying the seisin and the nuisance as we have done it-in this ease, is good. The court will intend it as an allegation of continuity of Seisin, after verdict, more especially a verdict distinctly finding the fact to be'so as in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"195\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-6\">1st <em>Error </em>\u2014 The refusal to quash the writ, tinder the freeholder\u2019s act.of 1724-5.. That act does not extend to real or mixed actions. \u25a0 The preamble recites, \u201cthat the'common law permitteth not the body, <em>in case of debt, </em>to be detained,!\u2019 &amp;c. The act' extends only to <em>process, </em>riot to <em>original writs. </em>-. It gives the form of the two kinds of <em>process </em>to .be used under it; neither of which would answer in an assize of nuisance, which is framed under the' <em>British </em>statutes, and modified to suit any case under the statute <em>in cpnsimili casu. </em>The uniform understanding has been, that the act of 1724-5 extends only to personal actions..</p>\n<p data-order=\"196\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-7\">The old form, \u2018\u2018put by sureties and pledges,\u201d, is preserved in replevin. <em>Graydon, </em>152. <em>Arch.

So also <em>in the capias </em>in <em>Withernam. </em>After the act of 1724-5 was passed, the common law forms and mode of proceeding, were pursued in ejectment (until it was altered by act of assembly,) \u2014 in dower \u2014 in partition \u2014 in waste, and I may add in an-assize of nuisance, <em>Brack. L. M. 438; </em>in which case a motion to quash the writ was made in the Court of Common Pleas, and overruled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"197\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-9\">The original writ in.assize never was considered a writ of arrest or attachment, Attachment never went until a failure to appear on the third summons; the summons not being the <em>process </em>on the original,writ in assize. 1 Reeves, 114, 117. The attachment or <em>capias, </em>was only awarded by the court, and was issued for the contempt in not obeying the summons at their, discretion. 3 <em>Reeves, </em>113.</p>\n<p data-order=\"198\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-10\">The record shows, that in executing this assize, the sheriff <em>summoned </em>the defendant; a copy of that summons is contained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>sheriff\u2019s return. There was, therefore, no violation of personal liberty, and it is an attempt to set aside a proceeding on a mere fiction of law. The argument on the other side is a circle; it ends where it begins. If it has any meaning, it denies the existence of the remedy by assize. They say you can only proceed in the ancient manner, pursuing the ancient form; that assize can only be maintained against a freeholder': and, that a freeholder .cannot be proceeded against in the ancient form, because, that form is, technically speaking, an attachment, although riot executed as one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"199\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-6\">But this being the decision of the court below, as to the execution of its own process, they alone are the judges of privileges claimed in their own courts, and their decisions bn those matters are not examinable in error. 2 <em>Yeates, </em>16. 4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>150. 8 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>528.</p>\n<p data-order=\"200\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-7\">If it was, there is no evidence that the defendant was one of those persons protected by the acts of 1724-5.

The statute <em>in consimili casu, Roberts, </em>157, and the other statutes referred to, expressly say the remedy shall .be extended to cases in which it hath not theretofore lay; that the party shall not go without remedy, but shall have a count to suit his case, and this is a sufficient answer to all the decisions produced about the framing of original writs, their requisites, &amp;c._ But if the defendant did not like our writ.,' he should have demurred to it. Having pleaded to the plaint he cannot now object, after verdict against him, to the writ.\u2019 \u25a0 The writ, however, does, correspond substantially with a variety of those produced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"202\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-9\">5th <em>Error. </em>\u2014 We disagree as to the fact. Our plaint alleges that the plaintiff, on, &amp;c. at, &amp;c. was and still is seised in his demesne as of fee, of and in \u00e1 certain water mill site and two acres and fifty-nine perches of land, situate, &amp;c.-, together with a certain watercourse and stream of water, called <em>the Bushkill </em>creek, running through and along the said land from the said mill site, &amp;c.; and that the defendant unjustly, &amp;c. did'the nuisance thereto complained' of. 1 understand this allegation' to mean that the defendant was seised in his demesne as of fee, of and in a tract of two acres and fifty-nine perches of land, through which the watercourse of the <em>Bushhill </em>creek passed, affording a mill site on the land. This being precisely the case in which all the books agree, that in case of a nuisance by draining the water in the creek by a person below, an assize will iie, it is unnecessary to answer Cases which have no bearing upon this state of facts. It is as much an injury to prevent a man from using a water power, as it is to swell upon his water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>wheel in use'. The swelling on the <em>land </em>is a nuisance remediable by assize.;</p>\n<p data-order=\"203\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-6\"><em>3d Error </em>\u2014 This is in fact the only plausible one assigned. The jury acts of 1805 and-1806, apply only to ordinary trials by jury in the Courts of Common Pleas, Oyer and Terminer, Quarter Sessions, Mayor\u2019s Court, and Courts of <em>Nisi </em>Prius, and Circuit Courts, for the trial of <em>issues. </em>They do not extend, to cases in which the judg\u00e9s sit as justices of assize, as is manifest from the 11th sect, of the act of 1805, <em>(Purd. Dig. </em>440,) which speaks of i\u00a3 where views are allowed.\u201d This cannot apply to assize, because a rule for a view is a preliminary to a view under .the act. But in assize the <em>venire facias </em>is in the original process. The terms of the a.cts of 1805 and 1806 do not embrace \u201c pleas of assize,\u201d and the common law remedy remains where the act does not expressly or by necessary implication take it away. The cotemporaneous exposition of those acts in the case of <em>Livesay </em>v. Gorgas, shows'that the legislature did .not intend those jury acts,to embrace this remedy. Those acts only embrace issues in civil and criminal cases. Assize is not strictly an issue: it is a mere inquiry, a hypothetical writ. <em>Bob. Dig. </em>148,</p>\n<p data-order=\"204\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-8\">The terms uall issues,\u201d although general, would not embrace issues of law. The terms of the arbitration law are general, that all suits depending may be arbitrated. Yet it has been held that under it, certiorafis, suits on official bonds, and actions of account render, are not within its provisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"205\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-9\">The practice in <em>Livesay </em>v.' <em>Gorgas </em>has been followed ever since, for the sheriff to select the jury: there the jury was selected-by the sheriff as at common law: and this court has said the same jury who recognised must try. 2 <em>Binn. </em>195. The sheriff selects the jury as at common law in cases of inquests of damages on interlocutory judgments; on inquests of condemnation on writs of <em>fieri facias; </em>on writs of partition; on w.rits of inquiry in dower, and in partitions in the Orphans\u2019 Court. So, too, in landlord and tenants\u2019 juries, and in cases of summary proceedings to .obtain possession of property bought at a sheriff\u2019s sale, and in cases of inquisitions of forcible entry, and of lunacy, and under the act relative to habitual drunkards. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"206\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_N\">But it does not appear by the record that the facts on which the challenge to the array were alleged to be predicated were proved. They are not stated to be admitted, or not denied.. <em>Lil. Ent. </em>472. This court, therefore, cannot know from the record in what manner the recognitors were selected, and will presume that they were selected-according to the law, as the contrary does not appear. If they were even proved to have been improperly selected, the challenge was not made at the proper time. The challenge to the array is to be made when the- jury are called over to be sworn, and before they are sworn. <em>Arch. Pr. </em>181, 185. <em>Arch. Forms, 120. Lil. Ent. </em>345, 472. Here the challenge was made before plea put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>in. There was no objection to the jury being sworn at the time they were <em>sworn. </em>And a challenge to the array shall not be until issue is joined. <em>Booth, </em>282, 2S3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"207\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-6\">8th <em>Error. </em>\u2014 The matter alleged as error -is contradicted by the record. The judgment <em>quod capiatur assisa </em>was given. The record says, \u201cThe plaintiff, by his counsel, prays that the recognitors may be called and sworn to try the matter of assize, which was -granted by the court; and thereupon the recognitors of assize, being severally called,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"208\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b211-7\">Tiighman, for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"209\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b211-8\"><em>Bi-nney </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"210\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b211-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b211-10\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmN\">Notwithstanding the recognition of the assize off nuisance as an existing remedy in <em>Livesay </em>v. <em>Gorgas, </em>(2 <em>Binn. </em>192,) it has incidentally been suggested that it is still not too late to discard it. I certainly have not been in favour of reviving obsolete forms, which, from the disuse of them by our forefathers, might well be considered as having been rejected at the settlement of the province. It is, however, too late to make \u00e1 stand against them now, it having been established, by repeated decisions of this court, that all common law actions which have not been abolished by the legislature, are in force here-precisely ds they are in <em>England; </em>and, although no one is more sensible of the inconvenience of this, of which the case before us is a pregnant instance, yet I would be the last to .-shake what has been as firmly established as a train of decisions by the court in the last resort can establish any thing. If the principle is not to be considered as settled by <em>Livesay </em>v. <em>Gorgas, Lisle </em>v. Richards, (9 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>323,) and <em>Witherow </em>v. <em>Keller, </em>(11 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>271,) we have no certainty for any thing that is not backed by an act of the legislature. This being so, we have nothing left for it but to adapt the action to modern use, by purging it of its subtleties in mere matters of form, without presuming, however, to meddle with essentials. The ground on which it has been recognised is, that it was all along a living remedy, although dormant; and, like the man who awaking from a tranee of twenty years in the <em>Catskill </em>mountains, was so altered that on returning to his- native village his former acquaintances did not know him, the assize of nuisance is to be received with the same modifications in practice which time has impressed on- the forms of our other actions. It would be a sad and sickening task to take it up now just as it was'two hundred years ago,.when the <em>English </em>eourts laid it down, without extending to it the benefits of modern practice, or of the statutes of jeofails, or even our own act of assembly for the amendment of slips in pleading. And this leads to the first of the few errors which I shall notice in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">It is alleged that the recognitors ought to have been summoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>and sworn, according to the <em>&lt;( </em>Act directing the mode of selecting and returning'jurors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">If there is any distinctive peculiarity in this action, it is in the mode of trial. The act of assembly is inapplicable fo it, because' the recognitors are not jurors; nor are their duties analag\u00f3us to those of jurors. In the course of the proceedings, issues may'be joined on points collateral to the issue, and these they are incompetent to try, unless where they are sworn as a <em>jury pro hdc vice, </em>or the issue is ordered to be taken at large; in. the absence.of which a-jury, properly so called, must be empanneled. They are not summoned fora single term, but attend the .cause from its inception to its termination; and this they must necessarily do, as they are to have the view before the return of the writ. They .are in. fact an inquest, the proceeding being <em>festinum </em>remedium, and their finding not a verdict, but an inquisition: so that-as well might the com-, purgators of a defendant who wages his law in debt on simple contract, (which has been done in Pennsylvania,) or a jury impannelled pursuant to a writ, to make partition, be selected according to the act, and sworn as it directs, to try the issue,-although there be no issue to try. To swear the recognitors <em>who may </em>find on their own view, to find according to the evidence, would, introduce a fundamental alteration in the nature of their duties, unless it were understood that they should swear to one thing .and do another; and can any one think the legislature had such an alteration in view. They were not legislating on the subject of the assize of nuisance; for, the truth is, no one \u25a0 suspected that there was any such thing in existence; and to apply the provisions of the act to it, would, it seems to me, carry the construction beyond the spirit and the letter, and introduce confusion and substantial inconvenience into the proceedings. Beside, we have cotemporaneous exposition sanctioned by this court.in <em>Livesayv. Gorgas; </em>which, as it has produced no particular mischief, ought itself to be decisive.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In this action the proceedings are the same as in an assize of <em>Novel Disseisin; </em>and a variety of exceptions have been taken in the cas\u00e9 at bar, which doubtless would have prevailed in the time when <em>Fleta </em>was written. It. is urged, that the court should have quashed the writ for want of an answer to the first and second special pleas. As the pleadings were clearly defective in this respect, there certainly was a time when courts - would have done so. But so early as the reign of <em>Edward </em>the Third, it came to be the practice in cases like the present and some others, to put the whole case before the recognitors without regard to the pleadings. \u201c The taking of an assize <em>at large\u201d </em>says Mr. <em>Reeve </em>in. his history of the <em>English </em>law <em>[Vol. </em>3, <em>p. </em>23,) <em>\u201c </em>was considered as the most liberal mode of .doing justice betw\u00e9en the parties; it was. breaking through the plea which was designed to stop the assize being taken, and it was throwing the merits of'the question, whether it depended on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>a fact ora title, fairly before the recognitors.\u201d And again; <em>\u201c </em>An assize would be taken at large on a defect in the pleadings; for as the direct point in the proceeding ought to go to the assize, if what was pleaded in order to .prevent the assize, by throwing the question upon another, fact, failed to do so, the result was that the assize should pass. Thus it was laid down as a rule,, that where abar was pleaded, and the plaintiff, in reply, made out his own title <em>without traversing the bar, </em>and the tenant omitted to rejoin to the title, the assize should, not be taken on .the title, but at large.\u201d Thus w\u00e9 have, as an instance, the very case under consideration; and, as such proceeding'was not irregular in the time of <em>Edward </em>the Third, it is in vaiu to look for more technical strictness now. Here the assise was substantially taken at large, by putting the whole, case before the recognitors; and the exception cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">But it is urged that judgment <em>quod capiatur assisa </em>was not en- _ tered. It certainly was not entered in form, although the substance of it was preserved in having the assize actually taken. This judgment is proper after issue has been joined on the point of assize, and after special pleas in bar of taking the assize, (if there are any,) have been disposed.of; and' it is therefore in the nature of a rule'for trial after joinder of issue .in a modern action. Until of late, it was the practice to enter such a-rule in this state; as it was absolutely n\u00e9c\u00e9ssary at the common law. But would a court of error have reversed for want of it on the,ground of there having been a mistrial ? To have done so would'have brought a scandal on the law; and it would reflect as little credit on the administration of justice, to reverse for the same cause here.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">These are the exceptions on which the plaintiff in error has mainly relied, and we think they ought not to prevail. There are others of less note, which we are of opinion are worthy of still less consideration; and on which, being purely technical, it is deemed unnecessary to bestow a particular consideration.</p>\n<author id=\"b213-8\">Huston, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcX\">This was an assize of nuisance brought by <em>Peter Ihrie </em>against <em>William Barnet, </em>in which the plaintiff recovered a verdict and judgment, and on which judgment an execution issued, under which a mill -dam, was prostrated, within the borough of <em>Easton, </em>in <em>Northamptoncouniy.. </em>, \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">The proceeding is novel, the effect striking; and, whatever may be said of summary justice and effectual redress, yet the one and the other may be attained in a manner w'Kicb will excite inquiry, and, perhaps, occasion some alarm. This country had been settled more than a century, and all the citizens, and all the lawyers, and all the'courts had progressed under certain notions of right, and certain remedies for wrongs, which, if not the very best, yet were so far good and effectual, as that the country prospered greatly, and there was, at least, no general complaint for want of redress of injuries, or of insecurity of rights. Our aficestprs had removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>from <em>England-, -England </em>had once been in a state of barbarism \u2014 \u25a0 had, at one time, not much law except that of force, and not much right except that depending on power. . In progressing from this state to its present situation, the change was gradual. The first improvements gave place to further.improvement, until it has attained to such certainty and security in all the different departments of rights and remedies, as had not been exceeded in any other country. - . \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">When our ancestors emigrated, it had, in this respect, attained nearly to .its present state; and much of the remedy, and many of the customs and forms of the thirteenth century, had become obsolete, and their place supplied by others better fitted to the present state, and more consonant to sound' principles and civilized manners. As colonists, the law of the mother country, to a certain extent, was brought here. But was it the law as then understood and practised, or what was. no longer law there, but what had been rejected, and hadbecorpe obsolete? Did we bring the existing forms of action, or those which on trial had been disapproved of and changed, those after the <em>Norman </em>conquest, or those of the present century.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The original settlers of this country, and their successors for more than a century, had no doubt on this subject. No one thought of going to the times of <em>Edward </em>and <em>Richard </em>for correct views of the rights or remedies necessary for more enlightened times. Trial by battel and attaints.and assize were equally unknown. We must .now decide whether they are to remain so, or are to be dug from the rubbish in which they had been forgotten, and introduced to our courts, and forced on our citizens, till again experience sends them back to obscuritj\u2019\u2019. The only difficulty, or, at least, the greatest which meets us is the fact, that in 1809, there was an assize of nuisance tried' in this county, and about the same time the judges, as is supposed, reported that several acts'of parliament prescribing the forms, &amp;c,, of assize, were in force. As to the trial, let those who choose read it, and those who wish for .such another, say so. -,</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">As to .the report of the judges, it is not so explicit as could have been wished. Their notes to several statutes \u201c to be incorporated,\u201d and <em>\u201c </em>this statute, or certain sections of it, are in force,\u201d leaves an uncertainty as to what is x\u2019eally meant in each case. I shall show that the words \u201c to be incorporated\u201d did not mean as they do not purport to mean, that the statute has ever been - in use in this country, \u2022 '</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">I think no one will say, that an appeal of murder or felony was ever in Use .in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>or .that if can be, since the present constitution; yet four statutes, (the last in 1300,) are mentioned, and.have the note {Cto be incorporated\u201d added to them; and if incorporated, we may see a trial by battel, for it is as much a part of the law as the'appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>The punishment of a juror that is ambitexter and taketh money, and two other statutes, all in the reign of <em>Edward </em>3d, empower the court, in which the cause is tried, (or the justices before whom he did swear) to put him to trial without delay; to put him to' plead to the country and take the inquest presently; and if he be attainted,to fine, imprison, &amp;c. Now the trial may,be in the Court of Common Pleas, and the constitution requires an indictment, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In <em>Jourdan </em>v. <em>Jourdan, </em>9 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>Chief Justice Tilghman says, \u201c voucher is unknown, unless in a common recovery.\u201d This is not now an action; .yet, half-a dozen statutes regulating voucher are put in the list, and marked <em>\u201c </em>to be incorporated\u201d in one of which, trial by battel is expressly recognised. I stop here for the present, there is no end-to this inquiry, but the .end of the book.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u201c To be incorporated\u201d does not mean that the statute is in force. I have said thus much, not to censure the judges who made that report, for no man respects more than I do some of them, both as men and as judges; but to show that it is, and must be a mistake to say, or suppose they thought, or meant those statutes to be now in force. . In their report they say, \u201cIn perusing the statutes referred to in the report, the legislature will perceive, that in many of them, the language is upcouth, and unsuited to our present form of government;\u201d and again; \u201c there is no other way of curing these defects than by re-enacting the <em>substance </em>of .these statutes in language suitable to our present condition,, &amp;c.;\u201d and I will add with great deference, that neither rights or remedies are treated in some of them, in a manner at all consistent with the general sentiment, or with the spirit of our own laws and constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Several statutes relating to, and some of them minutely directing the proceedings in assize, are reported:.and the present case brings the subject before the court for its consideration. I admit, that of this action, I know little; of that little, I-dislike every part. The assize fell into disuse in <em>England 'so </em>long.ago, and the cases and the books would seem to show such variety in the courts, and in the proceedings, that I must conclude, that many things relating to it were in a state of change, and very few were settled and certain, when it was abandoned; I shall mention some matters of which there seems to be no doubt. '</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">And first, if the recognitors could not. agree, the assize was afforced or forced by adding others, until twelve were either for demandant or tenant. Whether these new jurors .heard the evidence I cannot learn. \u25a0 -</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Next, although the sheriff returned, that defendant was not found in his bailiwick, and had no goods by which he could be attached, yet shall the assize be taken, 3 <em>Vin. </em>197, <em>F. N. B. </em>410; and this is so well settled, that in a statute which I shall cite presently an enactment is made expressly on this ground, and prescribing a remedy. If defendant do appear, he cannot plead that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>has enfeoffed .another, who is in full life, or that a feme plaintiff is a married woman. He may plead a release from the plaintiff of all actions personal, which is in bar of damages; but he cannot plead a release of the right, or any plea in extinguishment of the plaintiff \u2019s right,\u2019 <em>3 Vin. </em>219, 220: it seems he is confined to the plea of <em>nul disseisin. </em>If the defendant appears by bailiff, he cannot plead any special plea, except what is <em>nul tenant, nul disseisin, </em>nor any plea on which a certificate of assize lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The assize might be brought before the Court of Common . Pleas or King\u2019s Bench, if either was in the county where the lands lay. The judges .of these courts have authority without a patent, but generally, a, patent issued to certain persons named, either, to take all assizes in that county, or to take a particular case, and it would seem, these persons were named by the plaintiff. <em>F. N, B. </em>409, <em>et seq.; </em>and in all cases, the certificate may be before other justices than those whoto.ok the assize, if the party\u2019suing it wishes. <em>F. N. B. </em>425.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">But the statute 13 <em>Ed. 1, c. </em>25, among other things enacts, that if exception be alleged by a bailiff, the taking the assize shall not be delayed therefor, nor the judgment upon the restitution of lands and damages: but, if the. master of such bailiff, that .was absent, come after, before .the same justices that took the assize, and offer to prove by record or rolls, that at another time an assize passed between the same parties of the same land,, or that the plaintiff at another time did withdraw his suit in a like writ,-or that a plea liangeth by a writ of more high nature; a writ of <em>venire facias </em>shall be granted unto him to cause the same record to be brought, and when he hath the same, and the justices do perceive that the said record shown by him would have been available before the judgment, that the plaintiff by force -of the same would have been barred of his action, the justices shall presently .cause the party to be warned, that, first recovered, that he appear at a certain day, at which the defendant shall have again his seisin and. damages, (if he before paid any .by the first judgment, given,) which shall be restored to him to the double, as is before said. And, also, he that first recovered shall be punished by imprisonment, according to the discretion of the justices. Now rpmember it is settled, that if the bailiff offered to show all or any of these things to the suit of assize, he will not be permitted; because his master may have this -remedy and recover again. The statute then adds, in the same manner, if the defendant, against whom the assize passed in his absence, show any deeds or releases, upon the making whereof the jury were not examined, nor could be examined, because there was no mention made of them in pleading, and 'by probability might be ignorant of the making of those writings, the justices upon the sight of those writings shall cause the party to be warned that recovered, that he appear at a certain day, and shall cause <em>the </em>jurors of the same assize to come; and if he shall verify those wri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>tings to be true by the verdict of the jury or by enrolment, he that purchased the assize contrary to his own deed shall be punished by the pain aforesaid. Now, this re-examination was on what was called a certificate of assize, and was&gt; before those who took the first assize, or before others \u2014 if the party su.ing it so willed. And a new patent of assize and a certificate issued to the sheriff, (see the forms of those writs, <em>F. N. B. </em>421, <em>et seq.) </em>There was, also, another certificate, where the verdict was not well examined by the justices when'they took the verdict; or when they have not well examined or fully inquired of the issue joined, &amp;c. Now, this re-examination ivas as well known, and in as constant use as the assize. It was prescribed by the statute; but it did not In practice depend on the will of those who took the assize. The party injured could obtain the writ and the hearing. \" What mode shall we adopt to obtain it here, or are we to.have it here? Are we to have only half and the worst half of the proceeding, or the whole? And is that whole consistent with our system of government and judiciary?</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">If it shall be said, that'the absurdities and injustice of refusing a defence to-day and receiving it to-morrow; or of trying and deciding the cause of a man never summoned, and pulling down his house, &amp;c., and then giving him a new trial, and fining and imprisoning the plaintiff, would not be adopted here, the answer is \u2014 then state what will be adopted and what rejected, and prescribe new forms and new rules.' But this will make it not the old assize, but a new kind of action, which I doubt our power to prescribe. As it is, it is, from all I can learn of it, unfit for use: it has not been used, and in my opinion cannot, until enacted by our own legislature. \u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">If it is said it has been decided in <em>Livesay </em>v. <em>Gorgas </em>that this remedy is in force; my reply is, it was not so decided. The whole opinion leans the other way; it only decides that if the action lay, it could be removed from the Court of Common Pleas to the Circuit'Court: and, to prevent mistakes and leave' the matter open, the Chief Justice expressly says that was the only point made, and the only one decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">But so far as that case goes, it proves that if the remedy exist, it is an action, and not a mere inquest. An inquest never was removed or removable after it was begun, and before finding, from the Court of Common Pleas to the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">If it is an action, there was error in not quashing, because a <em>capias </em>and not a summons issued against the defendant; who was1 proved and admitted to be a freeholder. The act is peremptory; we have no power to dispense with or repeal it. If it is an action, the exception to the jury was fatal. \u2019 ,</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">By our acts of assembly jurors are .to try all actions in court, must be selected, put in the wheel, drawn and' Summoned in a particul\u00e1r manner. These acts bind all our courts, and apply to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>cases. It will not do to say this is not an action, but an inquest: it is an action, or it is nothing. Who has heard or read of a writ, a <em>narr., </em>a plea in abatement, in bar, &amp;c., in an inquest of,office, or of a plaintiff being nonsuited for not declaring? It is true the old books call these jurors recognitors; but the statute above cited, though not a modern one, calls them the jury. The law which says the assize may be brought and tried in the King\u2019s Bench and the Court of Common Pleas, says so. It has all'the distinguishing characteristics of an action, and not one of an inquest. There was error in deciding that the plaintiff need not reply to the. release pleaded, by the defendant. It is true that it may happen that a plea is put in, requiring a replication, and this may be forgotten or overlooked, and the court may, after trial on the merits,).refuse to reverse on this ground. But it is not true that any court- can compel a. party who has pleaded to proceed to trial, and to try the cause until his plea is answered; unless, perhaps, in. the case where the plea is palpably fictitious and impertinent. This was not so. I do not say positively that it was a bar to the assize, though - I incline to think it was in reason and in law, but it was at least a bar to the recovery of damages. Where the defendant pleads in bar, and gives colour to the plaintiff, a replication is necessary; it is necessary in all cases where it do\u00e9s not amount to the general issue: though it need not generally be set out at' large. 16 Vin. 230, title <em>Assize, (y. a. </em>and <em>B.) Replication. </em>That the plea was a good bar to the assize, see 16 <em>Fin. Assize G. a. </em>and <em>Pleas in Bar, </em>12. Note <em>per Littleton </em>and <em>Favasor, </em>that it was held by all the judges in <em>England, </em>that a lease for years, the reversion in the plaintiff, was a good bar in assize,\u201d and the-rest of that page. And I have not been able to find any decision to .the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">There are other parts of this record to which.I cannot reconcile my ideas of law or of justice: but I pass, them over. I feel that in the opinion now delivered I ,shall be supposed to differ from men now gone; and for whom I felt more than ordinary respect; but I also suppose that the- general opinion, that the statutes included in their'report by the judges, \u2022 were believed by them to have been,'and to be now in force; is doing them great injustice. I know that some of them expected an act of assembly to follow that report; and that it was rather the principle of the statute than' the statute itself of which they approved and which they wished.to be incorporated. We have in point more than one expression of our late Chief Justice, that he did not know why particular statutes, not reported, were omitted: and have heard him state more than once his doubts of the propriety of others being included. And I feel confident, that where either the provisions of one of our acts of assembly, or the spirit and principle of our constitution is infringed by the words or the scope of - an old statute, or the forms of an antiquated action, it was not intended or expected they would or could be revived, except by the legislature. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>I'also differ from the rest of the court; but.I cannot believe that our statutes of limitation, which were supposed to embrace every case, can be evaded by the introduction of antiquated and forgotten forms of action; or that our system of jury trial, so carefully and so repeatedly revised, shall be rendered useless; or that the privilege of freeholders, so long and so constantly protected; our acts of arbitration, and several parts of our constitution, are all to yield to a form of action, of the'good effects of -which we only know that on trial it was suffered to fall into disuse; of particular parts of which we know that they contradict our general notions of rights and remedies \u2014 and of the whole of which I confess myself to be so ignorant, that \u00cd dread the labour it must cost me to form any correct opinion.
