In the Court of Common Pleas, the cause was submitted to arbitrators, who awarded that the plaintiff had no cause of action.

It may be.said the plaintiff was originally in fault in suing for what w\u00e1s not due; but that is no justification of the unjust claim of the defendant. The demerits of the parties before the justice\" are exactly balanced. But the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>is not, who was the original aggressor, but who was the efficient cause of these costs being incurred i'n the Court of Common Pleas. Undoubtedly, the defendant drove the plaintiff there, who, for aught that appears, would have been satisfied' to be left as he began, before the'justice. The plaintiff then, standing in the attitude of a defendant who has foiled his antagonist, is entitled to the costs in the Court of Common Pleas, \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Judgment reversed, and judgment for the plaintiff for the costs of the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
