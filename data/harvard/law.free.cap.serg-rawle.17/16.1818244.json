'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-9\">The inquiry is, whether any acts wer\u00e9 done or declarations made by the widow establishing her choice. When the will was first read to her, the witnesses say that she was dissatisfied, and said she should not abide bjr it. Other witnesses state that within a few days afterwards, when the appraisers were taking an inventory of the estate, she pointed out the articles willed to her, and objected to their being appraised. She remained in the house of her deceased husband and occupied the privileges willed to her. \u2022 About' two months-afterwards she-filed, in the Register\u2019s Office a formal renunciation of all claims'under the will, and made her choice of dower; I do not consider these unimportant acts done by her as concluding her right and preventing her from the election. The question is, was it a series of deliberate acts done under a knowledge of her rights, evincing a determination of her mind to take under the will, not to claim her dower; if so, then in law it would conclude her. But if there was no deliberate act,' no decisive step, nothing don\u00e9 evincing her determination to take und\u00e9r the will, then in law she was not concluded from taking her dower. The paper filed in the Register\u2019s Office on the 10th of <em>November, </em>1823, is an'unequivocal-act clearly evincing its object.- In it there can be no mistake. But if it is said after this, that the widow claimed and took under the will,'that she held and enjoyed the privileges specified in the will, and received the money bequeathed to her; if these were so, and remained unexplained, it would demonstrate her choice notwithstanding the paper filed. But these matters seem to me to be s\u00e1tisfactorily explained. On the -10th of <em>November, </em>1823, the same day the paper was filed, the widow, <em>Benjamin Eberly, Isaac Cauffman, </em>and <em>George Rupp, </em>the principal devisees and legatees under the will, met and entered into an engagement; <em>she released the parties named </em>from her choice of dower on their estate derived from her husband, on their agreement that she-should receive the articles and money specified in the will, and a further sum of four hundred dollars not under the will. But it is with clearness and precision specified in that agreement that she refused to take under the will, and that she did expressly state in the agreement that she refused to take under the will. It is proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>by <em>B. Eberly,_ I. Cauffman, </em>and others, that they and <em>Rupp </em>did agree that she was to have the four hundred dollars beyond the sum mentioned in the will, and the same articles that were specified in the will; and after this agreement, and after this suit brought, we find the receipt of the widow to <em>B. Eberly </em>for the articles, and also at a subsequent period for the twelve hundred dollars. I see nothing to preclude these persons from making the agreement \u25a0with the widow. They had large interests under the will and were residuary legatees of the personal estate. Why might they not specify what they would allow her .in consideration of her release as to them, and agree with her that such an agreement should not affect her right to election, as it regarded other lands of her husband devised to <em>other persons? It is to </em>be remembered that <em>Eberly.was </em>the acfing'executor. 'In case a widow refuses to take under the will of her husband, and elects her dower, I am not certain that she would not be entitled to the.portion allowed by the intestate laws; but of this I have my doubts. It is not necessary to decide: but if such was the view of the parties to the-agreement, and no order to settle all disputes about it, it was intended that the articles and money should go to her as her portion of the personal estate, agreeably to the intestate laws, I'cannot see how that would take away her right of election, for still she would not have received them under the.will, but without as opposed to the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-6\">To this charge the defendant excepted, and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff..</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b21-7\"><em>Penrose, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0k\">The devise was in satisfaction of dower, and put her to. an election.

That is to be on a citation issuing from the Orphans\u2019 Court, calling on her to appear in the Orphans\u2019 Court, either to elect such bequest or devise, or waive it and take to her dower: of which election a record is to be made, which shall be conclusive on all parties. This election is to be made by the widow personally, appearing in court. Of this personal appearance, and election a record is to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">The paper filed on the 10th of November, 1823, with the register was altogether extrajudicial, and was no more a compliance with the direction of the act, than if it had been filed with the cryer of the court. Not only is the fact as I have .stated it, but the forms used to enable her to take both the bequests, and' the dower in this infant\u2019s house, however ingenious the expedient may have been, shows that she stuck to the will as to all the benefits to be derived-from it, though'she was desirous of avoiding the effect of such an act. The election of the demandant, filed in .the Register\u2019s Office, is dated the 10th of <em>November, </em>1823, and the agreement between the devisees and the principal legatees, <em>as Cauffman, </em>and the two sons-in-lawj <em>Eberly </em>and <em>Rupp, </em>are styled, and the release to .the executors or heirs was of the same date, witnessed by the same persons, the counsel of <em>Isaac, </em>and <em>Eberly </em>and <em>Rupp.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">These papers are .to be considered as the same transaction, done <em>uno fi'aiu, </em>and for the purpose clearly of the demandant\u2019s taking under the will, without the legal'consequences flowing <em>from </em>such an act. The election in the paper filed in the Register\u2019s Office, is an election to take according to.the intestate laws, and a refusal to take und'er. the will.. But,-take this in connexion with'the concomitant agreement, \u2014 stating that the consideration was an agreement to take from <em>Isaac </em>four hundred dollars, in addition to' the bequests under the will, and in addition to the privileges and specific legacies, \u2014 there is no ambiguity. \u00a3\u00a3\u2019 Whereas it has been agreed between me and the principal devisees 'and legatees, that <em>Isaac Cauffman </em>pay me, in addition to the bequests under the will of the said <em>Christian, </em>the sum of four hundred dollars, in addition to the privileges and specific legacies.\u201d And, in the releasing part,, it is a release of all the estate, \u00a3\u00a3 both real and personal, of the late <em>Christiana Cauffman, </em>and all dower, or right of dower, to any lands'or tenements of the said <em>Christian Cauffman, </em>and all suits for or on account of dower to the executors or heirs,\u2014 excepting and reserving to myself, my heirs, executors, and administrators, all privileges, legacies, and rights, under the will of my husband given to mej and also reserving'all my right of dower to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the real estate of the said <em>Christian, </em>situate in the borough of <em>Car-lisle, </em>the parts thus reserved to be and remain vested in me, the same as if this release had never been given or executed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">'\u25a0Now nothing can be clearer than the'substance of this agreement. It was an agreement'that she should take all given to her,by the will, and, in addition, receive four hundred dollars. And, in.the very same words that ,she reserves her right to all the privileges, legacies, and rights under the will, she reserves her right to dower to the property in <em>Carlisle. </em>Then comes the <em>salvo: </em>\u2014 \u201cAnd it is expressly understood, that I have refused to take under,the will of my late husband, <em>Christian Cauffman, </em>and that I elect to take according to the intestate laws of this, state, and that the foregoing release is a compromise with the legatees of <em>Christian Cauffman, </em>as far as affects <em>Isaac Cauffman, George Rupp, </em>and <em>Benjamin Eberly, </em>and that the reference to the will is only to designate the privileges, money, and other articles, I am to receive from those who by law are bound to pay the same.\u201d We are not to b\u00bf. governed by the sound of words, but by the substance. By the words, it was a compromise, an. agreement, that .she should have all given to her by the will, and a reservation of all her rights to the personalty given to her by. the will; and the <em>salvo </em>is to guard against the legal consequences arising from that agreement and reservation. And, in point of fact, she did take all under the will\u2014 all given to her by the will. She could not take it by agreement with <em>Isaac Cauffman, </em>and <em>Rupp </em>and <em>Eberly </em>\u2014 it was not theirs to give, as I shall presently show, if she had renounced it; for if she took to her dower, then she was bound to surrender up'to the disappointed devisee, <em>John Cauffman, </em>by way of compensation or satisfaction, every thing given to her by the will. It did not go to the residuary legatees, nor to <em>Isaac Cauffman; </em>and it will not escape observation, that, in the concluding lines of the <em>salvo, </em>in speaking of the privileges, money, and articles \u201cI am to receive from those who by law are bound to pay the same,\u201d all those acts \u2022 were done and the papers prepared, by her own counsel, and the counsel of <em>Isaac Caiiffman, </em>and <em>Rupp </em>and <em>Eberly; </em>arid, so far as respected themselves and their own interest, it was very well; but, so far as respected, the plaintiff in error, he Was no party <em>to </em>it; he was an infant; neither himself nor his guardian consented, and'it whs an agreement sacrificing his interest. The parties took care of themselves \u2014 their acts bound them \u2014 and of their acts he may take advantage, and of the legal results of their acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">The receipts of <em>Elizabeth Cauffman, </em>the demandant, whatever may have been the real dates, to the executors for the specific articles, show that she received from the- executors, in their character of executors, and in pursuance of the will; and the receipt for the money legacies, explicitly and conclusively proves what the real transaction was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-8\">\u201cReceived of <em>Benjamin Eberly, </em>one of the exeeutbrs of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>last will and testament of <em>Christian Cauffman, one </em>thousand two hundred dollars, in full, the sum bequeathed to me by my late husband, the said <em>Christian </em>Cauffman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">These papers, the work of the parties to the original agreement, carefully read over to her when'she signed them, show what this transaction really was: that the demandant should take all under the will; but it was to be so conducted, that she should appear to acquit them under the will, but would take them by way of compromise from those who had no power to give them-in any other character than as executors. -</p>\n<p id=\"AAB\">It may be said, that .these subsequent acts were acts of ignorant people, unacquainted with .legal forms. It may be so, or it may not be so; but it clearjy shows their understanding of the transaction, and they had sufficient knowledge of their own int\u00e9ntions and views. It may be true enough that the counsel did not draw the receipt in this form:\u2019 it may be true'enough they may have recommended a <em>salvo </em>to be adopted; but.these receipts incontestably and conclusively prove acceptance and election under the will, the real undisguised intention. The papers, taken together, prove the character in which she took the legacies \u2014 a legatee; and the character in which the persons stood who. were the executors, executing the last will and testament of the testator. .There.is nothing equivocal in.this., She could take them in no other character than that given to her by the will, the executors could give them in no other character, and I\u2018 think amount to conclusive evidence of election: they recite the character in which she claims them.. However it may be as to.others, as to <em>John </em>it was an acceptance and election. It matters not how they concocted the matter, the question is, did she take them under the will? \u2014 mo matter whether by compromise or otherwise.- The agreement,-was, that she should have them in addition. The reservation of them in the release was a reservation under the will:- \u2014 \u201creserving to me all the privileges, legacies, and rights under the will of my late husband given to me.\u201d And the evidence is, <em>that she constantly has possessed </em>all these rights and privileges, in literal and exact conformity to her husband\u2019s will, down to the very table made by Mr. <em>Snively. </em>How, then, can it be said that she renounced the bequest when she reserves these, when she constantly has enjoyed that? How could she be said t\u00f3 renounce that which she in terms reserves?</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">The doctrine of election has long prevailed; it has,undergone many modifications. The- eases cannot all be reconciled; but these clear principles may be deduced from them: It is a conclusion in equity, that where any person having a claim on a m\u00e1n\u2019s estate independently of him, and also a claim on his estate under his will, which claims are repugnant to each other, pursues the former, the latter is thereby waived or abandoned. This was the case of <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Mordaunt, </em>2 <em>Vern. </em>581, and <em>Streatfield </em>v. <em>Streatfield, Talbot, </em>176. In other cases it is put in this way: that no one claiming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Under a will, shall have any part of the estate to the disappointment of those' to whom it is given by the will. If they will have the estate, chancery will take away their legacy/ You cannot come into a court of justice claiming repugnant rights.. The principal question is, whether such taking induces absolute forfeiture, or only imposes an obligation to indemnify the claimants when it disappoints them. In <em>England, </em>though decisions and <em>dicta </em>have been both ways, the latest authorities seem to sanction the doctrine of compensation: that when a case of election is raised, it does not give a right to retain the thing itself, though it gives a right to compensation out of the thing devised to a legatee attempting to defeat the devise to others. Chancery would sequester the thing devised, to make compensation and satisfaction to the disappointed devisee. This subject is very, fully considered in a note to <em>1 Swanston Ch. Rep. 425, </em>in which all the cases extant are reviewed. But the dif-' Acuity with us would be, how to get at the compensation. A conditional verdict, under the equitable powers of the court, restraining execution till the compensation has been made, or the amount of the legacy and bequests to the widow applied, has not yet been adopted. So far as I have any knowledge of the practice, it has been considered as a bar to the recovery. In <em>Miller\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>this was so considered by the court of <em>Nisi Prius </em>at <em>Carlisle, </em>by Justices Yeates and Smith; and <em>in Hamilton v. Buckwalter,2 Yeates, 392, </em>M\u2018Kean C. J., said, the entry and possession of the. widow upon the land devised to her, was not a suspension merely, but an utter extinguishment of her right of dower. . But the acts of assembly to which I have referred, seem to put the question at vest, by enforcing the widow to make choice: if she does so make choice, and has not done any act previously to determine her election, before slie can take under the will she must renounce her dower. \u2022 But, in the present case, I think the demandant has made a binding election, and one that bars her recovery. The agreement and receipts to the executors, are, in my mind, conclusive. The determination of her election was by plain and explicit acts. Her bare receipt for the articles bequeathed to her would not have been sufficient; but the agreement, release, and receipts, taken in connexion with the document in the Register\u2019s Office, was with full knowledge of the circumstances of the testa-. tor and her own rights \u2014 unequivocal acts, performed not in ignorance, but with full knowledge; not by inadvertency, but by choice; and where the demandant cannot restore the plaintiff in error to the same situation, as if these acts had never been done. But even if she were yet at liberty to make her election, it must be by surrender to the disappointed devisees of all the bequests under the will, or their value.. This should be a condition precedent \u2014 tender be-. fore action brought: in no other way could compensation or satisfaction be made. In case of her rejecting the will, the property did not vest in either the executors or the residuary legatees: if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>agreed that the widow should hold it,' and that she has the right to it, it could only be for the reason that she accepted it under the wills if she did not, she could neither reserve it, nor they relinquish it. Chancery would sequester for the purposes of the will: if they .would sequester the fund for that.purpose, on the principles on which equity is distributed in this country, the satisfaction, should be made in the first instance, \u2014 it should be the first Step.</p>\n<p id=\"A1Z\">By the doctrine of sequestration to make compensation, the intention of the testator, so far as circumstances will admit, is effected; by the doctrine of forfeiture, that intention, in many cases, would be defeated. If, in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>the forfeiture would not be exacted absolutely, still it would be a forfeiture, until the party made compensation and satisfaction. But though the usual course, in <em>England, </em>is to resort to a court of equity, because at law the party cannot be put to elect, yet even courts of law apply the principle of election; and it is a good defence in \u00e1 court of law, where the party has acted upon it in such a manner as to be concluded by what he has done; that is, to have elected; But if it be a matter only in equity, equity would grant relief in case of a recovery at law in an action of dower, where the devise was in bar of dower, (as all devises here are, by positive law,) and carry into execution the trust of the will. 2 <em>Vern. 366. For </em>a history of this case, see note to 1 <em>Swanston, </em>398. If there had not been an election here, then how would the case stand? <em>John Cauffman </em>and <em>Isaac Cauffman </em>would, if the widow proceeded against them in a claim of dower, be entitled to the bequests to the widow, each in proportion to the value of the land devised to them. But I judge the widow to have so acted, to have so elected to take to the will wholly, (for:she could not do it partially,) as to have foreclosed herself from now maintaining this action of dower. I have not considered it necessary to go formally through all the objections made to the opinion of- the court. The way in which it was argued, and properly argued, too, was on one general objection \u2014 on the doctrine of election \u2014 on which the Cause mainly rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">It is proper to notice the doubt expressed by the court as to the widow\u2019s right to the personal property, on her repudiating the will, under the intestate law. There is no foundation for this doctrine. The- husband can strip'his wife of all the personal property by the will; and so he has done here, except so far as he has bequeathed her; and the jury would naturally be misled by what the court say, or their supposition, \u201c that the agreement of the parties was or might have been, that the money and articles bequeathed to her, should go to her as her part of the personal estate, agreeably to the intestate laws: and that would not alter the case, for she would not have received them under the will, but in opposition to the will.\u201d There is no evidence of any such mistaken views between the parties. The highly respectable counsel, who advised the-measure did not fall into this errorj or lead their clients into it.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>I add, in conclusion, that the claim of the widow is to deprive the defendant of the whole property devised to him, to defeat <em>in toto </em>the provision intended by his grandfather, clear of taxes and repairs. The house .would not rent for more than two hundred dollars, \u2014 the charge of three thousand dollars to be paid to his brothers and sisters: the interest of this money would leave him little more than twenty dollars per year.; and, if the widow recovers in dower* instead of a benefit it would be a burden to him. Rights of widows to dower are favourite rights, but are not to be favoured by the sacrifice of the interest of others. Now, here, the sacrifice of the rights of this infant is very apparent. <em>Rupp </em>and <em>Eberly </em>had nothi.ng under the will which could be affected by any claim of dower. <em>Isaac\u2019s </em>estate, though much more valuable than <em>John\u2019s, </em>is compromised by giving up to the widow every thing given to her by the will, and four hundred dollars, \u2014 twenty-four dollars per year; so that this compromise is effected by talcing the compensation which <em>John </em>would be entitled to by the rejection of the will, to make up a consideration to the widow for the release of <em>Isaac\u2019s </em>l&lt;mds from the claim of dower. And, though it doth not appear on the record, yet it is admitted that <em>Rupp </em>and <em>Eberly, </em>the sons-in-law, held lands by conveyance from the testator, in which the demandant did not join; so that all gained but <em>John </em>by this compromise, made at his expense, and with the consideration that <em>John </em>would be partly entitled to some compensation. These, s'ons-in-law would not be entitled to any satisfaction, if the widow had recovered in dower from them. <em>John </em>could neither recov\u00e9r from- <em>Isaac </em>nor from the executors, any satisfaction, as has been supposed by the defendant in error. It is admitted <em>John </em>should have satisfaction somewhere, from somebody, out of the thing devised to the widow. From the widow he cannot gain it, because she has givfcn the executors a receipt for it, under the will: they stand acquitted from <em>Isaac: </em>he cannot gain it in any form of action; and, unless he can retain the thing devised to him, he is without remedy. \u25a0 The widow took the whole devised to her from the executors, and /in exact and literal conformity to the will. , The parties, by their agreement and release, attempted to do that which the law.would not allow; v.iz. to take the thing devised to her, and defeat the will of the testator, as \u2022 to the devise of <em>John. </em>Instead of declining altogether by her deed all claim under the will, she reserves in explicit terms all her bequests under it; in addition to this, she is also to have the compromise from <em>Isaac, </em>\u2014 four hundred dollars: This was a clear, manifest assumption of property, hy virtue of the will. She certainly never did relinquish her claim under the will, but reserved it, exacted it, and received it from the executors, and now enjoys the particular privileges in the mansion house of the testator. She accepts-the benefit, while she declines the consequences. She says, \u201c I reserve all benefits under the will of my husband; but I shall retain to myself the right to disappoint <em>John </em>of what hjs grandfather has given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>him. She takes the benefit of the bequest, though she discards the condition annexed to these bequests \u2014 not to disappoint <em>John, </em>the devisee. Now, to accept the benefit, while she declines the burden, is to defeat the design of the donor. I hold she cannot say, \u201cI will retain what is given me by the will with a <em>salvo, </em>that I do&gt; not mean by this to give up <em>John. </em>My.intention is, to take both the bequest and the dower out of his estate.\u201d Now this she cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Equity, if she had not made her election, and had brought a writ of dower, would stay her suit at law. The earliest case on this-subject, is noticed, 1 <em>Swanston Ch. Hep. (in note,) </em>397, which was a \u00a1suit at law in a writ of dower, brought by the defendants. The bill for relief stated,- that the defendant\u2019s wife had certain copyhold lands devised to her in lieu of her thirds at law, which she accepted and enjoyed twenty years, and yetseeketh now'to recover dower of the freehold lands. The defendants demurred, because copyhold lands can be no bar to dower; but the court say, that it is no conscience she should have both, and therefore ordered to answer. The defendants were afterwards permitted to proceed to a judgment on the trial'at law with stay of execution. Wherever chancery would restrain execution, \u00f3ur courts of common law would hold there should be no recovery, as this is the only way in which equity could be administered; for'the conditional verdict and judgment, though frequently, resorted to, to enforce equity, yet never have been applied to cases of election. , But the election and acceptance here were perfect, and the right to choose <em>again </em>extinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">1 am therefore of opinion, for all these reasons, that the judgment should.be reversed. '</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b28-6\">Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqq0\">I will briefly state the reasons of my dissent from the opinion just delivered. I throw out of view the acts of the widow, previous to the 10th of <em>November, </em>1825; for I admit that if these acts amount to an election to take under the .will, she cannot after-wards have her dower at common law. On the first point, these were properly left by the court to the jury, with the expression of the opinion, in which I concur, that they were unimportant acts done by her, and did not conclude her rights, nor prevent her. from her election.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">I'discard, also, all idea of combination a.nd fraud, for such was not pretended in the Court of .Common Pleas; and is thrown in here, as a mere make weight in a question, I apprehend, of mere law. If the jury should believe there was actual fraud, there would be an end of the controversy; but the persons who were concerned in the settlement of this business, forbid all supposition with me that this was the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">That this is the case of election is not doubted; the widow cannot claim under the will, and at common law. The devise to the widow is not expressly in lieu of dower, but it is m\u00e1de so by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the 10th section of the act of the 4th of <em>Upril, </em>1797, with an express saving of her choice either of dower, or the estate devised. It may be as well here to observe, that it is not necessary the widow\u2019s election be made in the Orphans\u2019 Court, but in one event; that is, when she has not made\u2019her election within twelve months from the death of the testator. The act of assembly does not preclude from her election, before the expiration of that time; and I know of no place where it can be more properly made than in the office of the register, which has jurisdiction of the probate of wills.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">By the instrument of the 10th of November, 1823, she manifests her intention, by an unequivocal act, by which she was \u00e1bsolutely bound; for it is not pretended, but it was voluntarily done, and of her own free will and accord. It was a determination of her election, which may be either by express words, or by act. 3 <em>Com. Dig. title </em>Election, 540. After this solemn act, she was entitled to her dow\u00e9r, and nothing else: she could not take under the will, without the consent of those who had interest under it. Their rights vested and could not be' devested without their assent. An equivocal act may be explained, but not such an act as this. The election may be kept open for twelve months, but when once made, it concludes the parties. 3 <em>Com. Dig. title Election, </em>540.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Standing in this situation, the widow came to .the agreement of the 19th of <em>November, </em>1823, with <em>Isaac Cauffman, </em>and the residuary legatees, and the executors nf the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">It will, I am sure, be conceded that her right of dower, in the lands of <em>Isaac, </em>was a fair article either of sale, or compromise. This free privilege has never yet been denied her, and, I trust, never will. If <em>Isaac </em>and the residuary legatees, or the executors, had agreed to .give her one thousand, pounds for her right of dower in his land, it .would surely have bound them; and <em>John Cauffman </em>would have had no right to complain. It would have been open to him, to make the same compromise. , But the argument is, that because they undertake to give, and she accepts the same property devised her by the will, that their acts amount to an election to take under the will. The principle is not denied, that a person shall not claim -under an instrument, without giving full effect to that instrument, as far as he can. 2 <em>Mod. </em>640. 2 <em>Vern. </em>581. 2 <em>Vern. </em>617. 2 <em>Atk. </em>629. The question here is, does she take under the will, or the agreement of the 10th of <em>November. </em>If ever there was care taken to exclude a conclusion, it has been done here. The parties to the agreement expressly say, that the release is a compromise with the devisees and legatees, of <em>Christian Cauffman, </em>so far as respects <em>Isaac Cauffman, George Eupp, </em>and <em>Benjamin Eberly, </em>and that the reference to the will, is only to designate the privileges, money, and other articles she is to receive from those, who, by law are bound to pay the same. She also expressly refers to the filed paper of the 10th of <em>Novem</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>ber, </em>and again confirms and solemnly ratifies it. In the face of all this, we are gravely told, that the acts of the widow amount to an election to-take under the will. By a system of'legal metaphysics, which I cannot comprehend, the counsel for the defendant in error compel her to elect contrary to her intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">But what is the justification of this? It is said, at the bar, that after sh\u00e9 expressly disclaims all intention of taking under the will, yet she now enjoys the articles devised to her by the will. If the interest of <em>John Cauffman </em>were affected, there would be some show of sense in the argument. It is, however, plain, that he is placed-in no worse situation by the arrangement, for the grandson has the same right, and the same remedies, as if the compromise had not been made. Had the widow, without entering into agreement, recovered her dower, what would have been his remedy? He would have been entitled to a compensation, for his proportional share of the privileges relinquished by the .widow, and the remedy would have been by an action- against Isaac, and the exetors. Although the course of a Court of Chancery would be to sequester the devised interest' <em>quousque, </em>till satisfaction is made to the disappointed devisee; yet, in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>where we have no Court of Chancery, it is submitted there is no such power: the articles would go into the hands of the executor, he would have a legal right to them; they would be subject to his disposition. The land of <em>Isaac </em>would have been discharged from the burden imposed by the will. The action then would have been against \u25a0the executor, and the owners of the land, for a compensation, and \u25a0the jury would have been directed to give such damages as were right, under the circumstances of the case. The measure of damages would be the value of the articles and privileges relinquished,. and that in proportion to the respective value of the .dowers recovered. If this suit prevails, he has precisely the same remedy and no other. \u2018 How then, has he a right to complain of the agreement, when his rights are not affected? He would not, I expect, be entitled to the articles, but a compensation, to be ascertained by suit.. But, if we adopt the argument of the plaintiff in error, the loss is thrown upon the widow, by a construction in express contravention of the intention of all the parties to the agreement of the 10th of <em>November, </em>1S23. In my view of the case, justice would be done to all.. On the contrary, the widow loses all.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">But it has been said, that the legatees are .not parties to the contract. This idea was not hinted at in the Common Pleas: it was left to be discovered by legal ingenuity here. They were present when the agreement was made, took possession of it, put it on the record, and performed their part of the agreement, by payment of the money, and by putting the widow in the possession of the articles referred to. it would require some assurance for them, now to allege they were not parties to the agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The la.w regards substance, not shadows. They do not now make the objection: it is <em>John Cauffman. expressly, </em>not \u00e1 party, and who I have shown is not injured by thebarrangement, who takes the objection. On the best consideration which I have been able to give this case, I am of the opinion, that justice and the law of the country requires, that the judgment of the Common Pleas be affirmed. -</p>\n<p id=\"Aul\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
