Woods, Samuel Woods, </em>sen., <em>Jane Woods, </em>jr., and <em>Richard Woods; </em>whereupon, at the suggestion of the court, it was agreed that an issue be directed to,,the Court of Common Pleas, in which the said <em>William Woods, </em>jr., and others above-mentioned, be plaintiffs, and <em>Nathan Woods </em>defendant, as of <em>Jlpril </em>term, 1825, in which the plaintiffs are to declare for. money had and received and the defendant to plead payment; upon which issue the right of the defendant to retain the'said sum of money, or any part thereof, or not to retain the sam\u00e9, or any part thereof, is to be tried without regard to the particular form of the issue. Done in open court by consent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-14\">The issue thus directed was accordingly entered in the Court of Common, Pleas of <em>Jlpril </em>term, 1825, and was removed by the defendant, by <em>certiorari, </em>to the Circuit Court for <em>Cumberland </em>county.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b12-15\"><em>Penrose, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIE\">moved that court to quash the <em>certiorari, </em>which was refused, and an appeal was now taken from this decision to the court in bank.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AlD\"><em>Penrose </em>and <em>Metzgar, </em>for the. appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfE\">In <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>4 <em>Yeates, </em>175, no objection was made to the appeal, and no \u00bfuthority is to be derived from a single case which has passed <em>sub silentio. </em>An issue is not an action. The court directing it has a right to name the <em>forum, </em>and to leave the decision of the fact to the tribunal in which it may have most confidence; especially as the proceeding is for its own information. The issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>is not the cause of the <em>forum.to </em>which it has been sent, but of the forum <em>from </em>which it has been sent.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b13-4\"><em>Carothers </em>and <em>Ramsay, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1i\">cited <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>4 <em>Yeates, </em>175. <em>Sterret </em>v. <em>Douglass, 2 Yeates, </em>46, and <em>Hiester </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>1 <em>Yeates, </em>108.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b13-5\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AZK\">The argument for the appellant would have weight, if an issue directed by the Orphans\u2019Court were like an \u2022issue sent from chancery, which continues to be under the control of the chancellor throughout, the judges to whom it is sent being merely commissioners to try the fact and certify the verdict without rendering their judgment: so that it is the province of the chancellor alone to judge of the regularity of the trial, \u00e1nd of the propriety of again sending the question to a jury. With us, however, a feigned issue is to every legal intent an action; the motion for a new trial being entertained by the court\u2019in which the question has been tried, and the practice being to render a judgment on the verdict for the purpose of enabling the unsuccessful party to have the proceedings reversed on a writ of error. The Orphans\u2019 Court .therefore is not to be governed exclusively by the opinion of the court to which the issue is sent, nor does it exercise any power of selection, as .it can send an issue to no other court than the Court of Common Pleas. But as there is neither reason nor authority for restricting the trial of an issue' to that court, it may be removed subject to the limitations which are applicable to other actions. We do not admit that a motion like the present is a proper subject for an appeal to this court; but as a de? cisi\u00f3n of the principal question may be useful in practice, we have availed ourselves of the occasion to express our opinion on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b13-6\">Appeal dismissed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
