Esher, </em>the defendant below and plaintiff in error, by summons issued by <em>John </em>Thompson, Esq., a justice of the peace, under the act of assembly, entitled <em>\u201c </em>an act regulating the proceedings of justices of the peace and aldermen in cases of trespass, trover, and rent,\u201d passed the 22d of <em>March, </em>1814, for damages not exceeding one hundred dollars, in holding and detaining a horse and selling him contrary to law. After hearing, judgment was entered by the magistrate for the plaintiff for twenty-nine dollars; and the defendant appealed to the Court of Common Pleas. The plaintiff filed a declaration for money had and received. The defendant, <em>Esher, </em>obtained a rule on the plaintiff to show cause why he should not declare according to the circumstances of his case; which rule was subsequently dismissed by the court below. On the 13th of <em>February, </em>1824, the plaintiff\u2019s death was suggested, and <em>Elizabeth Flagler </em>was substituted as administratrix. A rule of reference was entered by the plaintiff below, and arbitrators chosen, who awarded for the plaintiff twenty-five dollars. On the 20th of <em>October, </em>1824, judgment was entered nisi, and, on the 10th of <em>November </em>the judgment was made'absolute. On the 11th of <em>November, </em>1824, a writ of error issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AP5\">The following errors were now assigned:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-14\">1. That the caus\u00e9 of action, before the justice, was founded on a tort; viz., <em>trespass vi et armis, </em>and that proceeded on in the Court of Common Pleas subsequently to the appeal, and contained in the declaration, was different, and founded on contract; to wit, <em>assumpsit </em>for money had and received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>3. That the action was founded on the act of 1814, in relation to trespass, trover, and rent; and, the action in the Court of Common Pleas was proceeded in,under the act of 1810, in relation to debts founded on contract.-</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b142-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AEP\">Where the declaration and the transcript agree ' in substance, we will disregard variances in form. Justices of th'e peace are not familiar with technical distinctions; and it would'be monstrous to suffer an error in the style of the action to deprive a party of his appeal. It, however, happens here, that the justice was even technically accurate in his notion of the action, which he styles, <em>\u201c trespass </em>for holding and detaining a horse and selling him contrary to law:\u201d in other words, trespass on the case on promises, which is exactly the form of the action in the Court of Common Pleas, the plaintiff having counted for money had and received. Prom this one would be tempted to believe the justice had in his mind\u2019s eye the familiar case of <em>Longchamps </em>v. <em>Kenny, </em>in which the price of a masquerade ticket, owned by the plaintiff, but sold by the defendant, was recovered in this form. But, wherever the,justice had-jurisdiction, in <em>any shape, of the </em>cause of action laid in the declaration, we will suffer no misconception of form to stand in the \u00a1way of the .appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
