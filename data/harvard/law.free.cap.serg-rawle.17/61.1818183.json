It is not an executory devise in fee, with a devise over on contingencies .which might reasonably happen, but an express estate tail. \u201c In case either or both of my said sons <em>Joseph </em>and <em>David, </em>should die without heirs-of their bodies, then I allow their share to be divided among the above legatees.\u201d The legatees were persons living at the death of the testator. It is as if the remainder had been to them <em>nominatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AGz\">It is as .unnecessary to cite cases, to prove a position so clear as this, as it would be to quote authorities to prove that a devise to a man and his heirs is a fee simple. The question, whom the testator intended by \u201c all the above legatees, (except <em>Sarah 0\u2018Farrell,y\u2019 </em>is one of very great difficulty; .and I must confess, if I was left to surmise and question, or wills were to depend on conjectures, I would conjecture that he intended all the persons <em>above named </em>\u2014 his. children and grandchild. But this intention is far from being so plain and manifest as to satisfy Ihe conscience of a judge. The word legatees is not a word of art, nor does it require any technical construction; but it is a designation of persons not by name, but by characters, in which he has placed them by his will. <em>James </em>and <em>David </em>are named, but not as legatees: on the contrary, he excludes them, by declaring that he had paid them the full share of his estate. They do not answer the description of persons to take the remainder. It is a general rule, (though there may be some exceptions in the case of wills, which do not apply to the present ease,) that if an -w/i-nominated person takes, he must answer the whole description of the designation by which he is mentioned in the instrument. It would be difficult to maintain that they agree fully with the description of legatees, merely because they are mentioned and excluded from legacy. If the name of one of the children had been omitted, he would not have taken: it is stronger where he is named, but excluded. This construction is fortified by the exception of <em>Sarah O\u2019Farrell. </em>If it was the testator\u2019s intention, it is so latent, so merely conjectural, so problematical, that it would be rather making than construing the will, to introduce those by the name of legadees, to whom nothing of his estate was given by the will, and who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>were said by the testator to be fully advanced. <em>David </em>answers the description of a legatee fully: he has bequeathed to him both real and personal estate, and he is-entitled to one sixth part.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">On the whole, my mind has settled down to adopt the construction given by the Court of Common Pleas, so far as it goes, \u2014 but adding <em>David </em>as a legatee entitled to take. I would willingly have caught at any expression, any hint, to have brought in all the persons named, because I conjecture equality was the intention of the testator; but.I cannot supply the omission, nor change the.universal meaning of the word legatee. I cannot substitute persons above named for legatees above named.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The judgment is therefore reversed, and judgment to be entered for one undivided sixth and one undivided seventh of one undivided sixth.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
