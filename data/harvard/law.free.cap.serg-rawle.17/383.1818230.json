It <em>appeared.in </em>evidence, <em>that Frederick Ritter, </em>under whom the plaintiff claims, was in possession of the <em>Jew's Mill, </em>from 1811 till 1815.. The spring he came there was no dam, but in the summer of that year, Drake; under whom the defendants c-la.im, drove, and put in some stakes and bushes; and made a dam, as the witness says, like a fish-dam. It was swept away in a short time by a fresh. <em>Drake </em>then asked <em>Ritter </em>if he would help him to make a little dam, with which <em>Ritter </em>complied, by assisting him to get logs, and to lay them across the creek, to cut bushes, and to lay them on the logs, and that then <em>Drake </em>hauled stone on the top of the bushes. <em>Ritter </em>cannot say that the dam was ever finished, but believes that it stood that winter, but was gone the next. He says he did not tajee particular notice how high it came, for he did not care much about it, as it-did not injure him, and that he never gahe <em>Drake </em>any right to overflow the ford. He was sure the dam lie made would not stand long. That he gave <em>Drake </em>no grant of the right, and that there was a saw mill on the property at the time. This permission, or license, has been attempted to be magnified into a grant of a right to erect a dam of a permanent nature for a grist mill, of the same height, which it is alleged was twenty inches. As a license for the erection of the present dam, the assistance, or permission of <em>Drake, </em>as disclosed by the evidence, is entitled to no weight. It was a license for a temporary purpose, (which appears \u25a0to have been answered,) which would have excused <em>Drake </em>from a suit by <em>Ritter, </em>but does not amount to a grant for any other purpose than was in the immediate contemplation of the parties. It is manifest it was neighbourly kindness on the part of <em>Ritter, </em>without the slightest view of granting a right'to a permanent use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>water. To make the most of it, it was a license during the continuance of the dam, and as soon as the dam was swept away, the license ceased to exist. To justify a new erection, even for a temporary purpose, a new grant, or permission was necessary. I mean, if the effect was, to swell the water on the land of <em>Ritter. </em>In <em>Rerick </em>v. <em>Kerr, </em>the distinction is taken between the cases, where the object to be,accomplished is temporary, and where it is permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"ASMu\">Permission to use water for a mill, or any thing else that was viewed by the p\u00e1rties asa permanent erection, will be of unlimited duration, and survive the erection itself, if it should be destroyed or fall into a state of dilapidation. But it is oth\u00e9rwise where the object to be accomplished is,temporary. And, the court then instance a saw mill as a-temporary erection. 14 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle. </em>No person can avoid seeing, that it was not within the comprehension of either of the parties, that <em>Ritter </em>had made a grant to <em>Drake </em>of a right to a permanent use of the water. It was a temporary use that was intended to. be conferred, and for a particular purpose, and it would be the height of injustice to extend that to any other purpose than that intended by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">On the trial, it was contended, first,- that <em>James Hepburn </em>was bound to give <em>M'Dowell </em>notice, and that the notice which was given was insufficient. If <em>M\u2018Dowell </em>stood in the situation of a man totally uninformed and ignorant of his rights, it would be the duty of <em>Hepburn </em>to put him on his guard. He, however, was acquainted, or ought to have been with his own and his neighbour\u2019s lines, and was well aware, or ought to have been with the effect of the dam: He at'least was as well acquainted with those matters as <em>Hepburn </em>could be. He acts then at his own peril, and if under such circumstances he swells on his neighbour, he must answer for the consequences. Notice is required-to a man who acts <em>bona fide, </em>not. to him who wilfully and obstinately persists <em>in </em>using that to which h\u00e9 has no title, or pretence of title, without giving or offering compensation for its use. It rnay be asked^ why give <em>MiDowell </em>notice? Was he ignorant of his own or his neighbour\u2019s lines, or the effect which his dam would produce? That is.not pretended; or,.if he was ignorant, it was because he would not take ordinary pains to inform himself.. .It was his\u2019duty to obtain the necessary information, and as a just man, he should have obtained the permission of <em>Hepburn </em>to swell the water beyond his lines. It is in the opinion of the court, no answer ..to say, that <em>Fishing Creek </em>was a public highway, and that the injury done to <em>Hepburn </em>was trifling; and t\u00f3 apply the maxim, <em>de minimis non curat lex. </em>He has swelled, for his own purpose, and to his great advantage, on the soil of his neighbour; and there is that special damage which the law contemplates: It, in its consequences, lessens the value of <em>Hepburn\u2019s </em>mill, and without determining the point, it may be matter well worthy.of inquiry, whether the measure of damages be hot the benefit deriyed from the erection to <em>M\u2018Dowell, </em>rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>than the special damages of the plaintiff. Although <em>Fishing Creels </em>be a public highway, it is an easement merely; the right of soil remains in the owners of the adjoining property.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">But, even if notice was necessary, (and it would be strange if a man was bound to give another'notice not to violate the law,) the plaintiff has done all that was required. <em>Hepburn </em>gave a power of attorney to <em>Hopkins </em>for the special purpose. <em>Hopkins </em>informs us he-went three times, and could not find then?. He then went to <em>Jlndrew Shreiner, </em>who was <em>M\u2018Dowell\u2019s </em>contractor, and gave him notice not to build the dam. <em>Shreiner </em>said, he cared nothing about it, that <em>M&lt;JDowell </em>and <em>Milland </em>were bound to indemnify him, and he would go on, and put up the dam.' If notice be necessary to persons who are engaged in a work with a full knovyledge, or who may have knowledge that it will prove a nuisance, notice to one is notice to all. They are engaged in a joint act, the consequences are .visited on all, they are affected by the acts of all; and even if <em>Shreiner </em>should-have omitted to inform <em>MHowell </em>and <em>Milland, </em>(which is highly improbable,) it would make no difference. <em>Hepburn,Jay </em>his attorney, has done all the law requires, and shall, not be answerable for the omissions of <em>McDowell\u2019s </em>and <em>Milland\u2019s </em>contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"AhSB\">Nevv trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
