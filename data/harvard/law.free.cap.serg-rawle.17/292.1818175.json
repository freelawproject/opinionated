Auditors were assigned to apportion the assets. They rejected the demands of <em>Williams </em>and <em>Dimmy, </em>who claimed to be first paid their debts in full, due to th.em as servants of. the intestate, under the act of assembly which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>gives'a priority of payment to \u201cphysic, funeral expenses, and servants\u2019 wages.\u201d The Orphans\u2019 Court reversed the decision of the auditors. From, that sentence of reversal this appeal was taken by <em>Seiler, </em>a creditor by single bill. Many depositions were produced on both sides; the most material of them given since the decision of the court below. It was contended by the appellant, that <em>Williams </em>and <em>Dimmy </em>never were domestic servants, and therefore entitled to no priority of payment,. 2. That, whatever their service was, <em>Williams </em>had left it a year or two before the intestate\u2019s death.- 3. That each of them had taken a single bill from <em>Greider, </em>the intestate, for the money due: <em>Dimmy </em>a bill payable in one year, with interest, and with <em>John Zerker </em>as a surety for the money, bound jointly and severally; and <em>Williams </em>a singl\u00e9 bill payable in nine months with interest, but without any surety. 4. That the bill to <em>Dimmy </em>was for money lent, as well as for wages.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-6\">After a concise argument, chiefly , upon the facts, by <em>Douglas </em>for the appellant, and by <em>Elder </em>for the appellees, the opinion of the court was given by</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b293-7\">Tod, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxaX\">As well as can be judged of proof from depositions, there is strong doubt whether the appellees ever were employed as domestic servants.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">There is contrariety pf evidence; and the time of the completion of the service is not fixed eith\u00e9r in the case of <em>Dimmy </em>or of <em>Williams. </em>We decide the case on a point relative to which there is, as to the fact, no dispute;- and, as to the law, no-diflerence of opinion on the bench. We all think that the right of preference of the appellees, as- servants claiming their wages, supposing them even to have once had such right, has been waved and extinguished by their taking from the intestate single-bills payable at a future day, with interest, and one of them with a surety. \u25a0 The decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court is reversed, and the report of the auditors confirmed.
