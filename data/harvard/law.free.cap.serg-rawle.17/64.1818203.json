That by the omission of the plaintiffs to pay to the commonwealth six <em>per cent, </em>on their dividend of <em>November, 1819, </em>the charter was forfeited, and the said bank dissolved, unlawful, and unincorporated, and every note taken by the said bank after the first Monday of <em>January, </em>1820, was null and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>2. The plaintiffs cannot recover in their corporate name, on any note or contract by them, after the 20th of January, 1820; and, as the note on which the suit is founded, is after that dale, there can be no recovery on the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-6\"><em>Charge of the Court. </em>\u2014 By the omission of the plaintiffs to pay to the commonwealth six <em>percent, </em>on their dividend, of <em>November, 1819, </em>the charter of the plaintiffs was forfeited, and the bank dissolved, unlawful, and unincorporated; and every note taken by the said bank after the first Monday of <em>January, </em>1820, was null and void; but the act of assembly of <em>Jlpril </em>1st, 1S22, entitled, \u201can act providing for the closing of the concerns of banking institutions,\u201d restores the bank, legalizes the note which was before illegal and void, and makes it as effectual to all intents and purposes, as if the omission of the bank to pay to the commonwealth the six^?er <em>cent. </em>on their dividend had never existed. Therefore the plaintiffs are not precluded by any thing suggested &gt;in these two points, from recovering on this note in their corporate name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-7\">To this charge the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-8\"><em>Dunlop, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-9\"><em>Craivford </em>and <em>M\u2018Cullougk, contra.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b65-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b65-11\">Duncan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Adb\">The plaintiffs in error have confined their exceptions to the answer of the court to the two points made by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">It is objected, 1. That the act is unconstitutional, because it is retrospective and impairs contracts; and, 2. If it was constitutional, still it did not operate on actions pending at.the time of its passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">In a case in principle the same as this, <em>Hess and others </em>v. <em>Werts, </em>(4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>356,) it was decided that such legislation was not prohibited. It impaired no contract, but removed an impediment to a contract fairly entered into by the defendant. ' It is so far retrospective; but every retrospective act is not void. Retrospective laws divesting vested rights \u2014 working the destruclion of a right previously attach\u00e9d, are contrary to the principles of sound legislation; but every.retrospective act is not void. An act making that a crime, which was not one when committed,'is retrospective;, but there is a great difference between making an unlawful act lawful, and making an innocent act criminal. This law divests no right, but removes an impediment or disability'. It renders lawful an act prohibited, as if it had been lawful <em>ab initio. </em>It works no injustice \u2014 infringes no man\u2019s right \u2014 it impairs no contract \u2014 but takes from the contract the taint which the policy of the law interposed, and gives to the holder of the note a right to recover on the contract \u2014 a right which he would have possessed if there had been no legislative interposition. The party i.s restored to his common law right and c.ommon law remedy. In <em>Ogle </em>v. <em>The Somerset and Mount Pleasant Turnpike Co. (5 Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>256,) the constitutionality of the law was not questioned; but the point was, whether the act operated oh suits pending..</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The second objection \u2014 that the act does not operate on this pending suit \u2014 \u2014is one which has received the fuli\u00e9st consideration of the court; but if it cannot be distinguished from <em>Bedford </em>v. Shilling, and <em>Ogle </em>v. <em>The Turnpike Company, </em>we would not be. disposed to depart from the-principles established in these cases.\u2019 The case of <em>Bedford </em>v. <em>Shilling, </em>was decided on the ground that the word <em>recover, </em>might, without violence, be confined to suits commenced after the act, and a subsequent provision showed, decisively, that this was the meaning. In <em>Ogle\u2019s </em>case, the provision was clearly prospective. \"The respective companies shall have the same legal remedy for the recovery of the amount of subscriptions, as if such, provision requiring the- payment of a certain sum for each share had hot been required in the acts aforesaid.\u201d And, by Chief Justice Tilghman, who delivered the opinion of the court; <em>ie </em>When it is said, that the,turnpike, companies shall have the same legal remedy as if the repealed acts had never been passed, it is to be understood that the action is to be <em>in futuro, </em>by,an action commenced after the passing of the law.\u201d But the provision in the act of the 1st of <em>April, </em>1822, providing for the closing of the concerns of banking institutions, is differently expressed. It provides, \u201c that the acts and proceedings heretofore done and performed by the board of directors of such bank\u2019subsequent to the forfeiture of its charier, if the said acts and proceedings have been done and performed in the manner, as they might or could have been lawfully done previous to such forfeiture, be and the same are- hereby confirmed and-declared valid in law, with, the same force and effect as -if the same acts and proceedings had been done previous to the forfeiture of such charter.\u201d\u2019 The bringing an action' is an act and proceeding; and the act,,done after the forfeiture, is legalized, as if there had been no forfeiture of the charter. The bringing an action is an act which they might have lawfully performed, if the charter had not been forfeited; and the act is in language so plain, that it would be affectation or stupidity to misunderstand it; it ratifies the bringing of the action, as if it had been done before the forfeiture, ^nd gives it the same force and effect. It is the very case provided for; and if it did not mean to embrace it, it-meant nothing. It is to operate on all the past acts and proceedings of the bank,\u2014 all those acts and proceedings theretofore done.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The cases of <em>Bedford </em>v. <em>Shilling </em>and <em>Ogle </em>v. <em>The Turnpike Co. </em>were decided on the words of the several acts of assembly, where the remedy ,was prospective; but this act of assembly legalizes the act <em>done </em>\u2014 all that could have been done, had there been no forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The construction of the Court of Common Pleas on the healing nature of the provision of the act of assembly, was the true and legal construction, and the judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"ALR\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
