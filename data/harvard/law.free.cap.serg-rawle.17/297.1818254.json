To be sure, there was a mistake in finding the value of the fee simple, instead of the annual value; or,, rather as <em>T. Stoever </em>did not die seised, it was surplusage to find any thing about the value.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The jury have found all the material facts, and one totally immaterial; if the plaintiff should ever take a writ of inquiry for damages; or, mesne profits,-she may subject herself to a writ of error; but, if she only takes her writ of seisin, there will be no harm done,, even if this were more than surplusage and actual error, the Court in this action can affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Judgment affirmed, considering this finding as to value in this case as mere surplusage.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
