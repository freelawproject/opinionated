It is settled by all the authorities, that matters of fact, when alleged for error, must be tried by jury, and not otherwise. The law has given us.no jury in this district; therefore, in our opinion, it has given us no jurisdiction in this case. Nothing can well be imagined more nugatory than to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>affect an authority which must'exist only by the consent of. the party complained of. It certainly must be but a pretence of ju* risdiction which can be stopped by-the bare denial of the defendant. As soon as issue shall be taken upon the facts asserted by the plaintiffs, we are at a stand. To support the writ, the cases of <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Shellback, </em>(1 <em>Dall </em>165,) and <em>Moore </em>v. <em>M\u2018Ewen, </em>(5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>373;) h\u00e1ve been.relied on. To be sure, the error alleged in those cases was error in fact only, and precisely such as here, viz., that the party complaining , being an infant, had appeared in the court below by attorney. But those cases arose in <em>Philadelphia, </em>where our system of jurisprudence gives this court a jury to try contested facts. There the court- took in' hand what'they had the means of completing. Here our jurisdiction can be effectual only in case the - party charged, shall think'fit to confess himself-in the wrong. We have no jury here; no venue for which they may be summoned; no names in the jury box for this court. To send the matter for trial to the Court of Common. Pleas, or'the District Court; would seeni to be without any precedent existing in this state, or any where else. The Circuit Court has been suggested as a fit place for the trial; but the acts- of assembly establishing that court, appear not to afford the semblance of authority for such removal,of the cause. That court is not an emanation from this. - It is not a Court -of <em>Nisi </em>Prius.' Its jurisdiction is defined by the acts of assembly, and there is no provision, express or implied, for removing a question on a writ of error pending here into the Circuit Court for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Therefore, having no means, in this district, of deciding upon alleged errors of fact, we follow the authority of <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>(4 <em>Binn. </em>117.) That case called much more strongly than the present for the interference of this court. A rule for an information, in the nature of a <em>quo warranto, </em>was applied for. There was no other possible.mode of redress known to the law.. The application was denied solely because this court, sitting, \u25a0as it then was, but-of <em>Philadelphia, </em>had no <em>power of </em>summoning a jury, and because the defendant, merely by denying the facts, could put an end to the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">It has been made \u00e1 question in the argument, whether a writ of error, <em>coram nobis, </em>lies in the District Court, oh in.the Court of Common Pleas. We do riot decide that question, nor can we; - it not being upon the record. We are of opinion that this writ of error, being for error in fact only, be quashed. ,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
