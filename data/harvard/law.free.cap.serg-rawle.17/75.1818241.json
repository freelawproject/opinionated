That it was immaterial whether the fees were paid by an agreement' of the parties for a settlement or. discontinuance of the suit or not; as such an agreement.of the parties for a compromise,, could only mean an agreement to pay the <em>legal fees </em>to the magis.trate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b78-7\"><em>F\u00f3wle </em>and <em>Mahany, </em>for the plaintiff !in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOW\">contended, that the notice was insufficient, as it did not specify what amount of fees the justice should have taken, arid this should have been explicitly specified, as-it was the <em>cause of </em>action,\u2022 and the justice, could have tendered the excess of -fees, as amends. Its omission prevented him from doing so. <em>Purd. Dig. tit. Justice of the Peace. </em>According to this notice, <em>Coates </em>was entitled to no fees at all, as it says, <em>the whole axe </em>illegal. <em>The </em>transcript of the justice sets out the items, and it is admitted, that he is entitled to some of them. A notice should specify the <em>wrong </em>done by the officer\u2014 here the wrong complained of is the taking the <em>excess, </em>of the legal amount of fees. Of this wrong, the justice has no notice. It is, therefore defective. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Cowgill, </em>4 <em>Binn. </em>25. <em>Little </em>v. <em>Toland, </em>6 Binn. <em>85. Slocum </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>3 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle,. </em>295. <em>Prior </em>v. <em>Craig, 5 Serg, &amp; Rawle, </em>46. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hughes, 5 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>299. <em>Lake </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>518.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-8\">1, On the first poin.t, they said, that <em>the practice </em>of magistrates is universal, to take a recognisance for each person. (Judge Rogers here remarked, that there was a very general belief, that magistrates were in the practice of taking much greater fees than the law allows them.) If the services are performed at different times, as where there are several postponements, is the justice only entitled to the fees for two recognisances? The services may be rendered at different times, as if the case is postponed, a recognisance must be taken for the reappearance of the, parties and witnesses,as they would not be bound to attend. Suppose an action brought on a forfeited recognisance against a-witness or a party for not appearing, he could plead that it was <em>a joint </em>recognisance, and thus defeat\u2019 the suit, if the opposite doctrine, prevails. They cited 4 <em>Black. Com. 262. Fee Bill Acts of </em>1795, 1814 and 1821, and <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Emery, </em>2 Binn. 431.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-9\">2. The act of 1806, giving twenty-five cents for settling an assault and battery suit, is not repealed. The act of 1821 gives twelve and a half cents for entering <em>discontinuance. </em>Now a <em>discontinuance </em>is the act of <em>one </em>party, but \u00e1 <em>settlement </em>is the act of <em>both. </em>When the justice acts as a mediator, and gives his advice,' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>and the parties agree to dismiss the suit, if, is a <em>settlement, </em>and he is entitled to a larger fee than when <em>one </em>party only comes and <em>discontinues </em>it of his own accord. 3 <em>Black.

The act requires notice to be given, that the justice may know the cause of complaint, may reflect on it, and may have an opportunity of tendering amends. Under this notice, he has all these. To inform him of the items in which there is an overcharge, would not benefit him, as the <em>cause of action, </em>taking illegal fees, could not be. more clearly and explicitly stated. Besides, an aggregate sum was.demanded, and it would be impossible for the party to . ascertain h.ow the justice would apportion it. . In many cases, it is impossible for the party to know on what items the excess of fees is charged. The magis-r trate is a public officer, and the law presumes, that he .knows the fee bill; he is bound by law to have it hung upjn his office. \u2022 We are not bound to tax it for him. He takes his fees at. his peril. The <em>aggregate </em>amount of fees paid, exceeds the aggregate that he should have received; and therefore, the aggregate amount received is illegal. The legality or illegality of the .aggregate is the very gist of the action. <em>Substantial </em>notice of every thing is given to him. The fee bill consists of an infinite number of items, and if the law requires a notice that -shall specify each, which is legal and which is not, and how much is the excess; it will- be almost impossible to draught one. It would be a judicial repeal of the salutary provisions of the act. They cited 4 <em>Binn. </em>25. 6 <em>Binn. 87. </em>2 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>235. 5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, 46, </em>299, 518. <em>Bates v. Shaw, </em>13 <em>Serg, &amp; Rawle, 493. Miller </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>12 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>147, \u2014 where the court say they will not construe the statute requiring notice with so much strictness and technicality, as to defeat these actions. <em>Substantial </em>notice of the .cause of action is only necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-10\">1. The <em>practice </em>to charge a fee for a recognisance for every person before the magistrate, is \u00e1 vicious one, and one <em>sub silentio. </em>Two recognisances for all parties, and' witnesses; will answer as well as one for each..' The language of the act, <em>\u201c taking recognisance in any criminal case, and, returning the same to court,\u2019\u2019 </em>is not to be construed to impose a heavy burden,on a party, merely to enrich the magistrate\u2019s pocket. If there were fifteen or twenty witnesses, as frequently happens,, the expense would be enormous, without any benefit to the party, and that too, where, in point of faet, the magistrate only <em>nominally </em>.performs the services. <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Emery, </em>2 <em>Binn. </em>434. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>referred to the analogous cases of the attorney general .being required.to indict all parties concerned <em>jointly, </em>and where a number of persons are charged in' the- indictment, the costs are to be taxed as if on.e person only was indicted, to diminish costs: to ejectment cases, where persons are in possession, not named in .the writ, and the sheriff is bound to return, and the prothonotary to enter them as defendants; to cases settled with leave of the court <em>before </em>bill found, the fee of the attorney general is less than after \u2014 to subpoenas, where all names must be put in one \u2014 in ail these cases, the legislature has clearly shown the spirit of construction that should govern this court \u2014 that an officer is. not necessarily to multiply his official services, for the sole purpose of augmenting his costs. <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>506, 7. <em>Ramsey </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>5 <em>Serg. 4 Rawle, </em>348.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-6\">2. They referred to <em>Pray </em>v. <em>Bussier, </em>7 <em>Serg &amp; Rawle, </em>447. <em>Prior </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>5 <em>Serg. 4 Rawle, </em>44, and <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>13 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>449, without argument.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Thd opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b80-8\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbE\">It is objected, that the items on which it' is supposed there has been an overcharge, ought to have been specified in the notice.. This would require more to be done by the injured party, than might be in his power. He has paid a gro.ss sum, and may not have known how the justice intended to apportion it to the services. He might, it is true, have demanded a bill of costs, which would have shown the particular charges; but the justice might have refused it, and <em>vye </em>are not to, take for granted,\" that he would certainly have done his duty in this particular, for the very action is founded on the supposition of his being a wrongdoer. But waving all this, the notice is specific enough for every purpose of convenience, and the legislature never intended to re-, quire more. The justice was apprized of the sum, and the occasion on which it is alleged' to have been extorted; and this is sufficient to enable him to judge of the extent of the injury, and the propriety of tendering amends. All beyond this, lay more in the knowledge of. the justice, than any-one else: .and to exact more, would involve the injured party in a labyrinth of subtleties, which the legislature never intended to encourage.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">The justice claims a right to charge the costs of a separate recognisance for each person bound, whether all. might have been included in one recognisance or not. There is no provision in the act of assembly particularly applicable to this part of the case; but analogous instances are not wanting, in which the legislature has evinced a general repugnance to the multiplying of official services, for the purpose of enhancing the costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">It has thought proper to require a party to include the names of all his witnesses in one subpoena; and where a number are .accused of one offence, the Attorney General is required. to indict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>them jointly.' There may be other instances which do riot at present occur to me. Now in a matter which is-altogether open to construction, we are to be governed implicitly by the spirit of legislation, evinced in parallel cases; and the more so, where this spirit has a decisively salutary tendency. Nothing is more liable to abuse than the right'which the law gives to' compensation for official services, and nothing requires to be more strictly guarded. To allow compensation for services which cost no trouble, having been rendered only theoretically, would be palpably unjust. The item of twenty-five cents for compromising the assault and battery, is manifestly wrong, the act of 1822 having reduced the former allowance to twelve and a half cents.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The penalty imposdd by this act may be incurred by exacting fees, which are supposed at the time to be legally demandable. By the very words of the prohibitory clause, the <em>taking </em>is the gist of the offence. Ignorance of the law will not excuse in any case; arid this principle is applicable,and with irresistible force, to the case of an officer selected for his capacity, and .in whom ignorarice is unpardonable. The very acceptance of th\u00e9 office carries with it an assertion of a sufficient share of intelligence to enable the party to follow a guide provided for him, with an unusual attention to clearness and precision. On any other principle, a conviction would seldom take place, even in cases of the most flagrant abuse; for pretexts would never be wanting. Sound policy, therefore, requires that the officer should be held to act at his peril, and we are of opinion, that the absence of a corrupt motive, or the existence of an agreement by the party injured, furnishes no justification for doing what the law forbids.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b81-7\">Tod, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZC\">I concur with the Chief Justice most fully, for the reasons he has given, on all the points except one; that of the recognisances.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">It was of the strictest and severest law to hold that <em>Coates, </em>the justice, was liable to the penalty,' for a mistake, in supposing that the fee of tvyenty-five cents, given by the act of the 17th of <em>March, </em>1806, was hot taken away afterwards by an implied repeal only. Nevertheless, it was law.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">* But when the court below charged the jury that the justice was entitled to but one fee of twenty cents for one recognisance of the defendant and his surety, and one fee of twenty cents for one recognisance of the prosecutor and his witness; that, is, that the justice had no authority to take separate recognisances from the defendant and his bail* and charge for each, or separate recognisances from the prosecutor and his witnesses; and charge.foreach, there the court, .in my opinion, was manifestly wrong. The fee bill gives to the justice for \u201c taking recognisance in any criminal ease, and returning the same to court, twenty cents,\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>charge to the jury on this point was, \u201c that as the hearing of the parties arid witness, and the binding-over before the justice took place at one and the-same time, the defendant, <em>Coates, </em>was only entitled, at most, to two fees of twenty cents for two recognisances, viz. one fee of twenty cents for one recognisance, of the prosecutor and his witness or witnesses, and one fee of twenty cents for one recognisance of the defendant before him, and his surety or bail.\u201d Now, I take it, this is not the law: it is a great mistake, that the prosecutor and all the witnesses are to be bound over in spite of- them, for the appearance of all at court; for this must be the inevitable effect of a joint recognisance\u2019. As to binding the principal jointly with his bail, such may have been the practice of some magistrates,, but I am not avvare of it. I have taken some pains to effect a search among the records of one of 1he courts in this city, and am informed, no trace can be found of a joint, suit in such case. In those parts of the country where I have had an opportunity of seeing the practice, the suits have been invariably separate, which, it is believed, never could be upon a joint recognisance. Nor have I .been able to find any precedent of any-such joint recognisance in the books of forms. A practice of taking such joint recognisance in criminal cases, might be very inconvenient. To say nothing of the event of the death of the bail, who is usually the only person relied on, suppose the principal to be a man of substance, and after forfeiture, to die; would not the whole burden be thrown off his estate, and survive against the surety? The charge being in this part erroneous, in my apprehension, I am for reversing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Judgment affirmed..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
