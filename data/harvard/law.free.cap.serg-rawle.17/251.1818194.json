By this deed, after reciting the grantor\u2019s inability to pay his debts by reasons of losses, &amp;e., in consideration thereof, and of one dollar paid, <em>Adam Rice, </em>by a general description, .transfers' all his estate,. real, personal, arid mixed, to the defendants in error, in trust, to sell with all convenient speed, &amp;c., and pay off first a judgment bond to <em>John </em>Rice, (mentioning the sum.and the time of payment,) as also two several judgment bonds, one to <em>Matthias Gilbert, </em>the other to <em>Henry Geesaman, </em>(mentioning Sums and days of payment,) both given for the purpose of securing them as bail or surety, as would appear by endorsements On the bonds. Next to pay a debt due to <em>John Krause by note, </em>(stating the date,) as also one hundred and fifty dollars to <em>Samuel Light, </em>the grantor\u2019s endorser to the Farmers\u2019 Bank of <em>Lancaster. </em>And then to pay all his other debts in equal proportipns.

The sheriff also, previous to the sale, had written notice of the claim of the assignees. But the .assignees took no possession of the goods. On the contrary, <em>Adam Rice, </em>the assignor, held the possession \u2014 carried on the tavern \u2014 carried on the bat-making business in a shop with three or four hands\u2014 and disposed of and sold the property as his own, as usual, up to the time of the sale by the sheriff.

It has been, given in- evidence that <em>Adam, Stoever, </em>the plaintiff in the execution issued on the 20th of <em>October, </em>1823, by virtue of which the sheriff on the same day seized and afterwards sold- the goods, had' full notice <em>pi </em>the said assignment on the 16th of <em>October, </em>1823, before he obtained his judgment on which he issued his said execution. The deed of assignment, unaccompanied by delivery of possession of the' goods, or of an inventory or schedule of the same, and the debtor nominating and appointing trustees' without consulting his creditors,, and without limiting the time for the execution of the trust, is not fraudulent <em>per se. </em>They are circumstances which may be taken into consideration, but are not in themselves evidence of fraud. The deed was executed on the 13th, and the sheriff seized these-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>goods in execution on the 20th of <em>October, </em>1S23, after the plaintiff in the execution had full notice of the deed of assignment? and although the deed is absolute on the face of it, and n.o actual delivery-to the assignees, the mere permitting the property to remain for seven or eight days in the possession of <em>JLdam Bice </em>does not in point of law make the deed fraudulent.\u2019 It has also been given in evidence that the sheriff had notice of the plaintiffs\u2019, claim to the goods before he sold them. If the jury are of opinion that there is no fraud on the part of the plaintiffs, it will be their duty to find a verdict in their favour for such amount of damages as they think the plaintiffs are entitled to. ,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-6\"><em>Weidman </em>and <em>Norris, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_f\">The court below erred in supposing us bound to make out a charge of actual, personal fraud. The deed is fraudulent and void-in law.- The grantor\u2019s relations are made trustees. His relations are put among the favoured creditors. There is no description of.the property: no schedule. The creditors have no means of compelling a fair appropriation: no protection against fraud: no means of knowing for what the assignees ought to be held accountable. Our law trusts no man, not even public officers, not even those -who give security for their honest behaviour, with goods untold and unknown. If there is a domestic attachment, or a levy by a sheriff or constable, or if an insolvent, debtor gives up his property, or a man administers upon an estate, in every-instance-a schedule or inventory is required. The retaining possession-of the goods by the grantor was inconsistent with the deed; it was a legal fraud, and incontrovertible. <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>1 <em>Cranch, </em>313. 9 <em>Johns. </em>337. <em>Ibid. </em>342. <em>Clow </em>v. <em>Woods, 5 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>282. The.court erred also in denying that a person being in debt when.he makes-an assignment, is a circumstance from which the jury may infer fraud. <em>Pet. Rep. </em>454. At any rate the sheriff cannot be liable in trespass. An officer is bound by no constructive possession. Here was no possession in the plaintiffs to support this action against any person. In every case we have found of trespass by assignees in trust for creditors there was actual possession. They cited Lip<em>pencott </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>2 <em>Binn. </em>174. <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Neville, </em>10 <em>Serg. &amp; Bawle, </em>201. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Mathiot, </em>14 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>214. <em>Selw. N. P. </em>1108.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-7\"><em>Elder, </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmZ\">The sheriff appears to have</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMl\">taken an indemnity. He had express notice of the transfer. ^Butthat is not necessary to the case of the defendants in error. If upon an execution against one, the sheriff takes the property of another, he is responsible to the owner: and upon no principle of law can his ease be distinguished from the Case of <em>Stoever, </em>had <em>Stoever </em>been defendant. The preference given by the deed of assignment is not illegal. It is the invariable practice.1 It is supported by all. the decisions in <em>Pennsylvania. </em>To meritorious creditors a preference is permitted. There is no fraud in the case, either in lav? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>or in fact, unless in <em>Stoever, </em>who attempts to grasp all for himself* and exclude the rest of the creditors by means of a judgment obtained with full knowledge of the assignment. Our case is fully supported by <em>Wilt </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>1 <em>Binn. </em>502. In\" that case there was no schedule, no time limited for the performance of the trust* no actual taking of possession. That case is the settled law of the land. Here, as to delay, there was none, either unnecessary or unusual, in taking possession. It would have been inconvenient, to convey the goods out of the tavern to another place to be sold; nor does the law require any such removal. As to the omission to limit the time for performing the trust, there appears no semblance of authority for that objection. The law fixes a reasonable time. The possession was sufficient to support trespass; actual possession is not required. Constructive possession is enough. 6 <em>Bac. Ab.(Wilson\u2019s Ed</em>.) 563, is to the very point. Take the whole charge of the court together, and the main principles of the law are laid-down correctly. .</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b254-6\">-The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b254-7\">Tod, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiJ-\">I do not apprehend there was any errar in refusing to charge the jury'th'at the deed was fraudulent and void, because it eoiitained no schedule of particulars, nor limitation of time for the execution of the trust; or because it .gives a'preference of some creditors above others: or because the grantor was in debt at the time of the assignment. No doubt all these were matters proper for consideration: and so the judge told the jury. They were inferences of fact, and from them.in some cases and under some circumstances fraud might perhaps be deduced, in other cases not at all. Whether the possession' was sufficient to maintain this action of trespass depends upon the question, whether the property vest-' ed in the assignees. If the property, was theirs, there would, I think, be possession enough to enable them to defend it by this sort of action. But we are all of opinion that the deed of assignment was null and void as against creditors, and fraudulent in law. The deed is absolute upon the face of it. The grantor retained possession. He held and. used the property as before:' sold and' disposed of it.as his own. \u2022 To make such a deed valid in any case the possession must accompany and follow the transfer. The notice to <em>Stoever </em>Was immaterial, it being only notice of a transaction void and fraudulent .by the rules of law. The question here-presented seems put' beyond all 'argument. It is settled, if any principle can be said to be settled by precedents. <em>Clow </em>v. <em>Woods, 5 Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>275. <em>Cunningham </em>v.
