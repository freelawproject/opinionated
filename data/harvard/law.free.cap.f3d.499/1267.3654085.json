Otero, who was repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>sented by a lawyer in the district court proceedings, was sentenced to 135 months in federal prison. Otero did not appeal his conviction or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-4\">In 2004, Otero, without representation, filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. Among other things, Otero alleged that his trial lawyer rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance when he failed to file a notice of appeal of Otero\u2019s 135-month sentence even though Otero specifically \u201cinsisted\u201d that he do so. The district court scheduled an evidentiary hearing on Otero\u2019s ineffective assistance claim and appointed a new lawyer to represent him. Following the evidentiary hearing, the district court rejected Otero\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, expressly finding Otero\u2019s \u201ctestimony that he directed his attorney to appeal is not credible.\u201d The district court considered and rejected Ote-ro\u2019s other claims on the briefs and they are not before us in this appeal. The district court denied Otero\u2019s subsequent request for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">We granted a certificate of appealability on two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-6\">(1) Whether counsel\u2019s communications with Otero regarding his right to appeal were sufficient to fulfill his duty to consult. <em>See Thompson v. United States, </em>481 F.3d 1297 (11th Cir.2007).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-7\">(2) Whether, if counsel did not fulfill his duty to consult, Otero has shown a reasonable probability that he would have appealed. <em>See id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1295-10\">After a thorough review of the briefs, the record, and the relevant legal authority, we conclude that Otero\u2019s trial lawyer had no constitutional duty to consult Otero about an appeal and thus did not render constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment denying Ote-ro\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-11\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-12\">\u201cIn a Section 2255 proceeding, we review legal issues <em>de novo </em>and factual findings under a clear error standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Walker, </em>198 F.3d 811, 813 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-13\">At the outset, we must reject Ote-ro\u2019s assertion that he directed his lawyer to file a notice of appeal on his behalf. The district court heard live testimony on this issue from Otero, Otero\u2019s trial lawyer, and the Spanish-English interpreter who participated in Otero\u2019s sentencing hearing. The district court expressly credited the testimony of Otero\u2019s lawyer,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who said that Otero never instructed him to file a notice of appeal, and expressly discredited Ote-ro\u2019s contrary testimony that he did in fact give such instructions. We must respect the district court\u2019s credibility determination on this issue; the district court\u2019s factual finding is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Thompson v. United States, </em>481 F.3d 1297, 1300 (11th Cir.2007). We thus conclude that Otero did not direct his lawyer to file a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>We have been told by the Supreme Court that in cases like this \u2014 \u201ccases where the defendant [does not] instruet[ ] counsel to file an appeal\u201d- \u2014 -\u201cthe question whether counsel performed deficiently by not filing a notice of appeal is best answered by ... asking a separate, but antecedent, question: whether counsel in fact consulted with the defendant about an appeal.\u201d <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 478, 120 S.Ct. at 1035, 145 L.Ed.2d 985. As we noted above, we will assume for the sake of argument that Otero\u2019s lawyer did not \u201cconsult\u201d \u2014 as that term is used in <em>Flores-Ortega </em>\u2014 with Otero about an appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Given this assumption, the dispositive question in this appeal is \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s failure to consult with the defendant itself constitutes deficient performance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">A criminal defense lawyer is not under a per se constitutional obligation to consult with his or her client about an appeal. In some cases, the Sixth Amendment requires such consultation; in others, it does not. \u201cWe cannot say, as a <em>constitutional </em>matter, that in every case counsel\u2019s failure to consult with the defendant about an appeal is necessarily unreasonable, and therefore deficient.\u201d <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 479, 120 S.Ct. at 1036. The Supreme Court has rejected a bright-line rule in this context because such a rule would be \u201cinconsistent with Strickland\u2019s<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> holding that \u2018the performance inquiry must be whether counsel\u2019s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478, 120 S.Ct. at 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-7\"> Rather than countenancing an inflexible rule, the Court in <em>Flores-Ortega </em>held that \u201ccounsel has a constitutionally imposed duty to consult with the defendant about an appeal when there is reason to think either (1) that a rational defendant would want to appeal (for example, because there are nonfrivolous grounds for appeal), or (2) that this particular defendant reasonably demonstrated to counsel that he was interested in appealing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480, 120 S.Ct. at 1036, 120 S.Ct. 1029. This inquiry is informed by several \u201chighly relevant\u201d factors, including: whether the conviction follows a guilty plea, whether the defendant received the sentence he bargained for, and \u201cwhether the plea [agreement] expressly ... waived some or all appeal rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-8\">Here, Otero\u2019s conviction was the result of a guilty plea, which tends to indicate that he was interested in \u201cseeking] an end to judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And although his sentence of 135 months was lengthier than his lawyer told him he might possibly receive if the court were to grant him a minor-role reduction under the Sentencing Guidelines, his lawyer advised Otero that he would probably receive a sentence within the range of 135 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>to 168 months and that there would be no promising appeal of such a sentence. After receiving and understanding this advice, Otero explicitly agreed as part of his guilty plea to waive the right to challenge on appeal any application of the Guidelines (with exceptions which are not relevant). Otero actually received a sentence of 135 months, the low end of the guideline range predicted by his lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-4\">In answering the question of whether a rational defendant would want to appeal his sentence, it is relevant to ask whether there are any potential non-frivolous grounds for appeal, whether there was a guilty plea, and whether the plea expressly waived the right to appeal. See <em>Flores-Ortega, id. </em>at 480, 120 S.Ct. at 1036. All those factors weigh heavily in favor of the government in this case. The plea agreement signed by Otero contained a typical appeal-waiver provision, pursuant to which Otero \u201cexpressly waive[d] the right to appeal [his] sentence, directly or collaterally, on any ground.\u201d This broad waiver contained four exceptions. Those exceptions allowed Otero to appeal (1) \u201can upward departure by the sentencing judge,\u201d (2) \u201ca sentence above the statutory maximum,\u201d (3) \u201ca sentence in violation of the law apart from sentencing guidelines,\u201d or (4) any sentence if the Government appealed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Otero does not argue that any of these exceptions apply in this case. Therefore, on account of the plea agreement\u2019s broad appeal waiver, any appeal taken by Otero would have been frivolous and would have been an appeal that no rational defendant would have taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">The only evidence relied upon by Otero to establish that he showed any interest in appealing is his own testimony at the evi-dentiary hearing in which he said that (1) he instructed his lawyer (through the interpreter, at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing) to file a notice of appeal and that (2) he tried to contact his lawyer via letter and telephone to communicate this request. As we noted above, however, the district court discredited Otero\u2019s testimony on both of these points, and we are bound to respect the court\u2019s factual finding. We therefore conclude that there is no evidence indicating that Otero reasonably demonstrated to his lawyer any interest in appealing his sentence. To the contrary, Otero\u2019s lawyer testified that Otero never indicated a desire to appeal. The district court, crediting counsel\u2019s testimony, so found. Indeed, the district court found: \u201cPrior to sentencing, Petitioner agreed with Ostrander [his counsel] that no viable appeal would be available if a sentence within the guideline range was imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-11\">Because no rational defendant in Otero\u2019s position would have sought to appeal in light of the broad appeal waiver, and because Otero did not communicate to his lawyer a desire to appeal, we conclude that Otero\u2019s lawyer was not under a constitutional obligation to consult Otero about an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-12\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-13\">For these reasons, we conclude that the performance of Otero\u2019s trial lawyer was not constitutionally deficient. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment denying Ote-ro\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1295-8\">. We will assume for the sake of argument that Otero\u2019s lawyer failed to consult with Ote-ro about his appeal options \u2014 that is, failed to \"advis[e] [Otero] about the advantages and disadvantages of taking an appeal\u201d and failed to \"mak[e] a reasonable effort to discover [Otero\u2019s] wishes.\u201d <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 478, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 1035, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). This means the answer to the first COA issue is no. However, for the reasons discussed in the text, the failure of Otero's lawyer in this regard does not itself constitute deficient performance because there was, under the circumstances of this case, no constitutional duty to consult in the first place. We therefore need not address the second COA issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1295-15\">. The testimony of Otero\u2019s lawyer was corroborated by the testimony of the interpreter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">.The testimony of Otero\u2019s lawyer, which was credited by the district court, was that he did consult with and advise Otero on three occasions concerning the appeal waiver. He advised Otero that with the guilty plea he would likely receive a sentence within the guideline range of 135 to 168 months (that is, receiving acceptance of responsibility and safety valve reductions), and that if he received such a sentence, there would be no promising basis to appeal. He fully advised Otero about the appeal waiver, although counsel also told Ote-ro that even though he had signed the appeal waiver, counsel would nevertheless file a notice of appeal if requested (although it would probably be futile). Finally, counsel told Ote-ro he intended to seek a minor role reduction (which would further reduce the likely sentence), but that this was only a possibility. However, counsel acknowledged that, after the sentence was imposed, he did not consult with Otero about appealing. Accordingly, we assume <em>arguendo </em>(but expressly do not decide) that counsel did not consult with Otero as that term is contemplated in <em>Flores-Ortega </em>and <em>Thompson.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1296-10\"><em>.Strickland v.

The district court rejected Otero\u2019s allegation (also contained in his motion for relief under \u00a7 2255) that his sentence should be set aside because he did not fully understand the terms of his plea agreement. Otero does not challenge that ruling on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
