Counsel was appointed to represent the accused at the outset of the case. However, after the return of the indictment he insisted upon representing himself. The offer of this court to designate counsel for him was like-was declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-18\">The charge against appellant was fully proven; and while he complains of mistreatment we find no evidence thereof in the record. Every effort appears to have been made by the trial court to safeguard his rights and to insure him an impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-20\"> 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 76 [1948 Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 912],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b758-21\"> 1948 Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 702.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
