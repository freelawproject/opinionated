Burden, paid workmen\u2019s compensation awarded to and accepted by Burden on July 1, 1946, and brought suit on April 9, 1947, against the defendant, a citizen of Indiana, alleging that Burden\u2019s injuries, sustained on November 16, 1943, had been caused by the defendant\u2019s negligent operation of an automobile. The. defendant\u2019s answer pleaded the two-year statute of limitations in personal injury cases,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the District Court gave summary judgment for the defendant; from which judgment the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-15\">Under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. of Indiana an employee now must file claim for compensation within two years from the accident;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time of the accident here involved, .Section 13 of the Act provided that upon payment and acceptance of an award, the employer might file claim against the person in whom legal liability for damages existed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An action by the employer also had to be filed within two' years after the accident. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York v. Miller, 111 Ind.App. 308, 314, 38 N.E.2d 279, 281. The. requirement that the employer\u2019s claim against the person legally liable had to be filed within the same period of time after the accident, two years, within which the employee had to file his claim against the employer often made the employer\u2019s right of action worthless.. The employee\u2019s claim \u2018against, the employer might not be filed until the two-year period was almost up, and the award made some time thereafter. As the employer\u2019s, right to bring the action did not accrue until he had paid or had become liable to pay. the award, the employer\u2019s right often did not accrue until the two-year statute had run.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-16\">In order to remedy this situation, the Indiana Legislature amended Section 13 of the Act. The section as amended, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>became effective April 1, 1945, was enacted in its entirety as set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (The italicized part of the section represents the amendment.)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Burden filed his compensation claim August 16, 1945, and the plaintiff paid and Burden accepted the award of compensation on July 1, 19'46. The plaintiff filed this action to recover the payment on April 9, 1947, which is admittedly within a year after the acceptance of the award, but over three years after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The plaintiff claims the benefit of the am'ended act of 1945 and asserts that the limitation contained therein of one year from the date of the acceptance of the award is the limitation applicable. The defendant contends that the 1945 amendment can be construed to apply only prospectively, that is, to accidents occurring after April 1, 1945, and cannot be construed retrospectively to include an accident which occurred in ' 1943; apd that therefore the ordinary two-year statute of limitations applies, which in this instance had expired by more than a year when this suit was brought on April 9, 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">It is true as a general proposition, as the Supreme Court of Indiana said in Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Talbot, 113 Ind. 373, 378, 14 N.E. 586, 589, 3 Am.St.Rep. 655, that \u201cstatutes .are to be construed and applied prospectively, unless a contrary intent is manifested in clear and unambiguous terms.\u201d The statute as amended does not provide that it shall be applied retrospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The defendant argues that since the statute as re-enacted provides: \u201cWhenever an injury or death, for which compensation is payable under this act, <em>shall have been sustained </em>under circumstances <em>creating </em>in some other person than the employer a legal liability\u201d (italics ours) that the statute was intended to be applied prospectively only. We think that the future tenor of the italicized words does not necessarily so indicate. This provision has been the law since 1929 and was not changed by the 1945 amendment. The employer thereunder had a right to sue for a cause of action belonging to the injured employee upon paying the award for compensation or becoming liable therefor. Future words are used because the statute envisaged all compensable injuries since 1929, including the one in question. The 1945 amendment did not affect the substantive right granted by the statute. It changed a remedial or procedural right only, by providing that the statute of limitations shall begin to run from the time the right of the employer to sue accrues, namely, paying or assuming liability for the award, and not from the time the accident occurred, as held in Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. v. Miller, supra. The amendment clearly was intended to bring relief to one who had been given the right to sue but was confronted with the bar of the statute of limitations, by lifting the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Under such circumstances, we think the correct rule to be applied here is that laid down by the Supreme Court of Indiana in Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Tal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>bot, supra, 113 Ind. at page 378, 14 N.E. at page 589, 3 Am.St.Rep. 655: \u201cThe better rule of construction, and the rule peculiarly applicable to remedial statutes, however, is that a statute must be so construed as to make it effect the evident purpose for which it was enacted; and if the reason of the statute extends to past transactions, as well as to those in the future, then it will be so applied, although the statute does not, in terms, so direct, unless to do so would impair some vested right, or violate some constitutional guaranty.\u201d See also Barnett v. Vanmeter, 7 Ind.App. 45, 52, 33 N.E. 666, 668; In re Smith, 115 Ind.App. 494, 500, 60 N.E.2d 147, 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Since the plaintiff\u2019s situation is exactly the type of hardship which the amendment was intended to ameliorate, and the statute is remedial, past transactions should not be excluded from its coverage and scope. The limited construction contended for by the defendant and applied by the District Court cannot be sustained. The judgment of the District Court is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-17\"> Burns Anno. Stat.
