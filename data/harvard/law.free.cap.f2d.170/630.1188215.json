Instant in season and out of season and staying his hand not at all, he has since written and filed seven petitions seeking release on habeas corpus, all of which have been denied. When he was here before<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on appeal from j'udgments denying the writs in\u2019 two of the cases he filed, the judgments were affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-24\">Here again on appeals from judgments-denying' writs in two cases, he urges, but with no mor\u00e9 warrant or effect than before, the same grounds that he then 'urged and two additional grounds. One of these is that negro officers were\" excluded from the court martial which tried him. The other is: that the provisions of Article of War 70,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cNo charge \u201cwill be referred to a general court martial for trial until after a thorough and impartial investigation, thereof' shall have been made\u201d, were not complied with; that this requirement is. jurisdictional; and that failure to comply with it deprived him of due process of law and rendered void the conviction \u2019 and sentence under which he is serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-25\">There was a full hearing below at which, petitioner testified, the entire court martial record was offered in evidence, as were the depositions of witnesses, including that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>petitioner\u2019s defense counsel which had been taken on previous habeas corpus hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">No evidence whatever was offered in support of the charge that negro officers were excluded from the court martial. The evidence was merely that there were none on the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">On the other question, the failure to comply with A.W. 70, it was not contended that no investigation at all was made, indeed it could not be, nor was there any dispute of the recitals in the official report of the investigating officer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the applicant did not complain of the preliminary investigation itself as not impartial and thorough, or make any showing that the recitals in the officer\u2019s report were not correct, the district judge undertook by careful inquiry of applicant<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to find out just what his complaint of the investigation was. In addition he carefully queried the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>warden\u2019s counsel as to whether, if it were found that \u2019the preliminary investigation was not thorough, fair, and impartial, as required by the rule, this would affect the jurisdiction of the court martial so as to entitle the prisoner to release.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">In addition to the recitals in the report of the investigating officer and the failure of the applicant to in any manner overthrow them, the testimony of defense counsel, which was taken, was to the effect that the preliminary examination was fair and full and that all witnesses whose names had been given to him by the accused had been examined by the investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">While, therefore, the complaint was put forward as a general attack upon the investigation, it came down at last to applicant\u2019s real complaint that the investigating officer was not present at the trial where applicant seemed to think it was his duty to be. Whatever, therefore; we might be inclined to hold as to'whether a' preliminary investigation is a jurisdictional prerequisite to a court martial trial,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> .this question is not before us for decision. A preliminary investigation was conducted, and there is no evidence whatever that it was not substantially in compliance with A.W. 70. Applicant\u2019s contention, that it was necessary for the investigating officer to be present at the' court martial hearing and that, because of his failure to be present, applicant was deprived of due process, is wholly unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">We'think it clear that the judgments were right and should be affirmed. We think it clear, too, that applicant, in continually .filing groundless applications for writs of habeas corpus, has greatly abused the process of the courts, and that if he persists in filing applications, they should be dismissed without hearing unless there is a clear and positive showing in them that they are based on new grounds or, if upon any of the old grounds, new and \u25a0substantial evidence not previously available has been discovered to support them.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-26\"> Jackson v.

At the outset of the investigation, I informed the accused of the nature of the charges alleged against him; of the names of the accuser and witnesses, so far as known to me; of the fact that the charges were about to be investigated; of his right to cross-examine all available witnesses and to present anything he may desire in his own behalf, either in defense or mitigation; of his right to have the investigating officer examine available witnesses requested by him; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-10\">\u201c2. In the presence of the accused, I have examined all available witnesses and documentary evidence * * * Accused did not wish to have witnesses examined in his presence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-11\">\u201c3. The substance of the expected testimony of the following named witnesses in oral or written form was made known to the accused who stated he did not desire to cross-examine such witnesses and therefore the same were not examined or called in his presence: * * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b687-12\"> This was the colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-13\">\u201cThe Court: Now your main contentions, as I have tried to get them, are, first, that the Investigating Officer was not present at the trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-14\">\u201cPetitioner: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-15\">\u201cThe Court: At the Courts Martial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-0\">\u201cPetitioner: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-16\">\u201cThe Court: And, therefore, that had some effect on the introduction of these statements?
