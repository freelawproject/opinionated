The initials N.O.S. stand for \u201cNot Otherwise Specified\u201d in the schedule. The government contended that Item No. 1563, \u201cAlcohol, in-bond\u201d bearing the rate of $1.23 per unit of charge was the proper item to be applied. The alcohol was actually shipped under bills of lading designating the commodity \u201cAlcohol Tax Free N.O.I.B.N.\u201d These initials stand for \u201cNot Otherwise Itemized By Name.\u201d There is no specification in the tariff schedule applying to alcohol shipments which are designated \u201cTax Free,\u201d and \u201cN.O.I.B. N.\u201d is not applied to alcohol shipments in the tariff schedule. The carrier claims that the shipments should therefore have borne the letters N.O.S. That is, the shipments are not otherwise specified. Carrier further claims that Item 1563, \u201cAlcohol, in-bond,\u201d cannot apply because of the fact that the commodity shipped was not in or under bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Before going on with the basis of the conflicting claims, it will be helpful to have in mind the fact that the U. S. government excise tax on alcohol per unit of measure is very much greater (at least 10 times greater) than the market value of the alcohol itself. It is customary and legally permissible for the manufacturer to store his product under bond to the government as security for the payment of the tax when and as it is released for use or distribution. Alcohol so held is said to be \u201cin-bond.\u201d In-bond alcohol may be transported to other localities under government regulation without the prepayment of the tax and without being released from bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">It is seen that alcohol, after tax paid, is much more valuable than alcohol, tax unpaid, and one of the important elements of a freight rate is the value of the thing shipped. United States v. Bornn, 2 Cir., 104 F.2d 641. This is so because of the greater care, responsibility and liability entailed in handling the more valuable thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">No tax is paid upon alcohol which is released from a bonded warehouse to the government, and the quantity released is freed from the bond. Upon this premise, the shipper claims that the \u201cin-bond\u201d designation of the schedule comprehends all alcohol shipped tax unpaid, whether it is in-bond or freed from bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">The shipper presented a traffic expert at the trial who testified that, in his opinion, the item providing for the lower (in-bond) rate was the applicable one. While he was on the witness stand, government counsel sought to introduce several tariff schedules not applicable to the shipments in question which contained items designated as \u201calcohol in bond (free of internal revenue tax) * * *\"<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The schedules so offered, it was claimed, tended to prove that the in-bond item in freight schedules was generally understood to encompass all shipments of alcohol which had not taken on the extra value of the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">The court understood the exhibits were being offered as \u201csubstantive\u201d evidence and declined to receive them as such, but stated: \u201cHe [the witness] can say that the reason he bases his opinion (that all shipments, tax unpaid, come under the lower rate) is because he has examined the tariffs of other lines and that they did adopt that procedure.\u201d Whereupon, the witness made a rather lengthy non-responsive statement ending as follows: \u201cTherefore, it seems to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>me, it necessarily follows logically that they [the shippers] should not be called upon to pay 60 cents a gallon, a rate based on carrier\u2019s responsibility of 60 cents a gallon plus the tax.\u201d Thus the witness, instead of proceeding along the line of the court\u2019s suggestion, rationalized the applicable facts which he thought a proper basis for the application of a certain rate, into the conclusion that such rate therefore was the legal one. This was fair argument to the rate maker, but the district court is not the rate-maker.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><em>No </em>further attempt was made to have the proffered exhibits received in evidence, nor were they used in any manner as showing custom. It is probably true that the general acceptance of the meaning of an expression in the tariff schedule for a considerable period of time, although not within its face meaning, would establish it as its \u201cterm of art\u201d meaning. It is seen that the court was careful to leave the way open for the proper use of the proffered schedules, merely ruling them out as \u201csubstantive\u201d evidence. Of course, the fact that some railways explained \u201cin-bond\u201d shipments of alcohol as those upon which the tax had not been paid would not be competent direct evidence to prove that the shipments in suit should take the rate itemized as \u201cin-bond.\u201d If the witness had followed the court\u2019s suggestion and the examining attorney\u2019s question consistent therewith, it may be that some evidence of general usage as to the significance of the term would have resulted. As it was, there was but a hint in the evidence that the schedule designation \u201cin-bond\u201d carries any meaning in addition to its common and plain face meaning. We hold that the Court was not in error in refusing to receive the proffered rate schedules as substantive evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The carrier, in his turn, presented a traffic expert who testified that the proper rate was the N.O.S. rate, or the higher of the two under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Thus the evidence shows without contradiction that the tariff schedule covers the subj ect of alcohol under different classifications ; that there is no classification \u201cTax Free\u201d; and that the shipments could not fall under any classification other than Items 1497 and 1563. That is, unless there is evidence sufficient to require a finding that Item 1563 (in-bond) covers all shipments upon which the alcohol tax has not been paid, and also all alcohol upon which no tax is required to be paid, the Court did not commit error in finding that the omnibus, or N.O.S., Item No. 1497 is the applicable one. We hold that the evidence in the case did not require the Court to so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">We note the citation by appellant of several cases in which the trial courts have received evidence which goes to the history and fundamental reason upon which freight classifications are based, and appellant\u2019s brief contains the following significant sentence : \u201cIt is the duty of the Court in construing a tariff to consider the end in view, and the object to be obtained by its framers <em>when this can be done consistently with the words used.\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Such a case is Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co. v. U. S., D.C., 1 F.Supp. 350, wherein the Court considered the history and common meaning of the items \u201cHousehold Goods\u201d and \u201cEmigrant Moveables.\u201d In Pennsylvania Ry. Co. v. U. S., 42 F.2d 600, 601, 70 Ct.Cl. 276, the Court held that, where the shipment was billed \u201ccrepe paper bandages for surgical dressing\u201d and there was no tariff so classified by name, the shipment could be given the classification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u201csurgical bandages * * * \u201d or \u201cpaper crepe * * * \u201d (the rates for these two classifications were the same) . and should not be classified under \u201cPaper N.O.I.B.N. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In the case of Macon D. &amp; S. Ry. Co. v. General Reduction Co., 5 Cir., 44 F.2d 499, certiorari denied 283 U.S. 821, 51 S.Ct. 345, 75 L.Ed. 1436, it was held that the trial court could determine whether a certain shipment was fuller\u2019s earth or clay, the two having different classifications. The jurisdictional distinction between the I. C. C. and the federal district court is understanding^ treated in the opinion, and therein also the leading case, Texas &amp; Pacific Railroad Co. v. American Tie &amp; Timber Co., 234 U.S. 138, 34 S.Ct. 885, 58 L.Ed. 1255, is compared with the case under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In the tie case, there was no tariff schedule specifically for railroad cross-ties, but there was one for \u201clumber.\u201d Railroad and timber men differed as to whether railroad cross-ties were included in the term \u201clumber\u201d and should take the shipping rate specified for lumber. The Court held the question within the rate making powers of the commission, which the courts ought not to attempt to decide. See also American Ry. Exp. Co. v. Price Bros., 5 Cir., 54 F.2d 67, wherein it was held that it was a question for the district court as to whether a shipment of small onions for planting came under the rate specified as \u201cGreen Onions\u201d or \u201cPlants, Strawberry and Vegetable.\u201d Crancer v. Lowden, 315 U.S. 631, 62 S.Ct. 763, 86 L.Ed. 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">All of these cases, with the possible exception of the tie case, are in accord with appellant\u2019s statement that evidence can be received to indicate the proper classification of a shipment \u201cwhen this can be done consistently with the words used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">It is clear that the term \u201cin-bond\u201d cannot be tortured into also meaning exactly opposite its face meaning through the application of the principle applied in the cited cases. Only through general practice, custom, or, as the trial court preferred to say, through its becoming a \u201cterm of art\u201d could this opposite meaning be attributed to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Whether an adjustment or reparation can be made, should the I. C. C. upon appropriate proceeding hold the in-bond rate applicable, we, of course, do not decide. See Pennsylvania R. Co. v. International Coal Min. Co., 230 U.S. 184, at page 197, 33 S.Ct. 893, 57 L.Ed. 1446, Ann.Cas.1915A, 315, which case is cited upon the same point in Crancer v. Lowden, 315 U.S. 631, at page 636, 62 S.Ct. 763, 86 L.Ed. 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\"> The Defense Supplies Corporation, the original plaintiff, was created by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act, \u00a7 5(d) (3), as amended, <em>55 </em>Stat. 249, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 603b (3). Its stock is owned by the RFC, which stock in turn is owned by the United States government. Defense Supplies Corporation was formed \u201cto procure, acquire, carry, sell, or otherwise deal in strategic and critical material as defined by the President.\u201d By Act of Congress, July 1, 1945 (Public Law 109, 79th Congress, Ch. 215, 1st Session, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 601 note), all functions, powers, duties, assets and liabilities of Defense Supplies Corporation were transferred to RFC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b153-15\"> One of these schedules included the Illinois Central, a connecting line which handled at least some of the alcohol in suit. The other schedules were of railways which had no connection with this case. This difference in the schedules was not alluded to in the consideration of their admissibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b154-5\"> \u201cUnder the statute there are many acts of the carrier which are lawful or unlawful according as they are reasonable or unreasonable, just or unjust. The determination of such issues involves a comparison of rate with service, and calls for an exercise of the discretion of the administrative and rate-regulating body. For the reasonableness of rates, and the permissible discrimination based upon difference in conditions, are not matters of law. So far as the determination depends upon facts, no jurisdiction to pass upon the administrative questions involved has been conferred upon the courts. That power has been vested in a single body, so as to secure uniformity and to prevent the varying and sometimes conflicting results that would flow from the different views of the same facts that might be taken by different tribunals.\u201d Pennsylvania R. Co. v. International Coal Min. Co., 230 U.S. 184, 185, 196, 33 S.Ct. 893, 895, 57 L.Ed. 1446, Ann.Cas.1915A, 315.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
