Rule 41 (b), Federal Rules Civil Procedure, supra; Gary Theatre Co. v. Columbia Pictures Corporation, 7 Cir., 1941, 120 F.2d 891, 892; Young v. United States, 9 Cir., 1940, 111 F.2d 823, 825; Bach v. Friden Calculating Mach. Co., 6 Cir., 1945, 148 F.2d 407, 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">A study of the record discloses that there was ample basis in the evidence, with a single exception, for the findings of the Court. That exception relates to the Court\u2019s finding that plaintiff\u2019s hours of work of the same nature as non-exempt employees did not exceed 20% of the number of hours worked by such non-exempt employees. We find nothing to contradict, discredit or impeach the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he worked in excess of 20% of his employed time on tasks of the same nature as those performed by non-exempt employees under his supervision. The evidence shows plaintiff to have been a hard working, courageous employee, never afraid to turn his hand to a menial task when the best interest of his employer seemed to demand it. This, however, is not a controlling fact in our case because plaintiff was in sole charge of an independent branch of defendant\u2019s business. With this single exception, the findings of fact were supported by the evidence and may not be disturbed by this Court. Walling v. General Industries, 1947, 330 U. S. 545, 550, 67 S.Ct. 883, 91 L.Ed. 1088; Chanady v. Detroit Sheet Metal Works, 6 Cir., 1947, 158 F.2d 799, certiorari denied, 1947, 330 U.S. 850, 67 S.Ct. 1095, 91 L.Ed. 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The appellee contended, and the lower court concluded, upon the basis of these findings that the appellant was, at all times during which he was in the employ of the defendant, a bona fide executive within the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the regulations of the administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">This conclusion is founded upon Section 13 (a) (1) of said Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 213 (a) (1), and upon the promulgated regulations of the Administrator. Said Section 13 (a) (1) provides that the provisions of the act relied upon by appellant \u201cshall not apply with respect to (1) any employee employed in a bona fide executive * * * capacity * * * (as such terms are defined and delimited by regulations of the Administrator).\u201d The Administrator has defined the term \u201cemployee employed in a bona fide executive * * * capacity\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-11\">\u201cThe term \u2018employee employed in a bona fide executive * * * capacity\u2019 in Section 13 (a) (1) of the Act shall mean any employee</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-12\">\u201c(a) whose primary duty consists of the management of the establishment in which he is employed or of a customarily recognized department or subdivision thereof, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-13\">\u201c(b) who customarily and regularly directs the work of other employees therein, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-14\">\u201c(c) who has the authority to hire or fire other employees or whose suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring or firing and as to the advancement and promotion or any other change of status of other employees will be given particular weight, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-15\">\u201c(d) who customarily and regularly exercise discretionary powers, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-16\">\u201c(e) who is compensated for his services on a salary basis at not less than $30 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>week (exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities), and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">\u201c(f) whose hours of work of the same nature as that performed by non-exempt employees do not exceed 20 per cent of the number of hours worked in a workweek by the non-exempt employees under his direction: Provided, that this subsection (f) shall not apply in the case of an employee who is in sole charge of an independent establishment or a physically separated branch establishment.\u201d (Code of Federal Regulations, Cum. Supp., Title 29\u2014 Labor, Chapter V \u2014 Wage and Hour Division, Part 541.1; 5 Federal Regulations 4077).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The Court correctly concluded on the basis of its approved findings that the plaintiff was a bona fide executive employee within the meaning of Section 13 (a) (1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act as construed and defined by the regulations of the Administrator. The Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
