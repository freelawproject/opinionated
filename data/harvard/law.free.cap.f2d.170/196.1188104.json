Specifically, it disallowed bonuses in the sum of $5,000 each paid to these officers in those years. It regarded the bonuses as being in reality dividend distributions of profits rather than as deductible items of business expense. The question is whether there was substantial evidence to support the finding that the bonus payments were in excess of the reasonable compensation for personal services which the statute permits as deductions from gross income. Internal Revenue Code, \u00a7 23 (a) (1) (A), as amended, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23 (a) (1) (A), and regulations thereunder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We think there was.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">The record shows that the taxpayer is a closely-held corporation completely controlled by the two officers named. These officers, who constituted a majority of taxpayer\u2019s board of three members, owned in equal shares all of taxpayer\u2019s outstanding stock except one qualifying share which was held by the third director. No dividends were declared or paid during the taxable years or had been paid since 1938. In April of 1940 the taxpayer had voted to increase the salaries of these officers to $12,000 per year each, retroactive to July 1, 1939. This represented an increase of more than 59% over the year ending June 30, 1940, and much greater increases over 1939 and prior years. In addition, during the taxable years, these officers received as part of their compensation the proceeds from the sales of scrap by the taxpayer in amounts totaling about $3,600. The enlarged salaries plus the added receipts just mentioned were thought by the Court to constitute reasonable compensation. On June 11, 1941, the taxpayer\u2019s board voted the bonus of $5,000 each to the two officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-15\">Numerous decisions of this court and those of other circuits indicate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the question of the reasonableness of salaries or other compensation claimed as deductions is purely a factual one.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Tax Court\u2019s finding of the amount constituting reasonable compensation is normally to be accepted on review if there is substantial evidence to support it. Certainly there is a rational basis in the evidence here for the conclusion arrived at by the Court. Furthermore, its opinion shows that it weighed all the relevant evidence bearing on the subject, including those factors favorable as well as those unfavorable to the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The petitioner claims that the Tax Court erred in declining to grant its motion to vacate and set aside the memorandum, findings of fact, and opinion, on the ground that the Court had not complied with the provisions of \u00a7 8(b) of the. Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The point made is that petitioner was given no opportunity to submit its exceptions to the decision of the single judge sitting in the case, and that petitioner was entitled to a review by a majority of the full Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Assuming without deciding that the Tax Court may in some respects be wit'hin the scope of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001 et seq., we think that \u00a7 8(b) is inapplicable to Tax Court procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">To begin with it is to be observed that \u00a7 2 of the Act, after defining the term \u201cagency,\u201d provides that \u201cNothing in this Act shall be construed to repeal delegations of authority as provided by law.\u201d Turning to the statute relating to the organization and procedure of the Tax Court, we note a provision authorizing the presiding judge to divide the Court into divisions of one or more members. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1103(c). Section 1118(a) of 26 U.S.C.A. provides that <em>\u201cA </em>division shall hear, and make a determination upon, any proceeding instituted before the Tax Court and any motion in connection therewith, assigned to such division by the presiding judge, and shall make a report of any such determination <em>\u2022which constitutes its final disposition of the proceeding.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) By subdivision (b) of the same section the report of the division becomes the report of the Tax Court within thirty days after such report, \u201cunless within such period the presiding judge has directed that such report shall be reviewed by the Tax Court.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>The comparable provision of the Administrative Procedure Act, as found in \u00a7 7 thereof, states that \u201cnothing in this Act shall be deemed to supersede the conduct of specified classes of proceedings in whole or part by or before boards or other officers specially provided for by or designated pursuant to statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">We conclude that the relevant procedure of the Tax Court, as prescribed specifically by law, and as followed here, is not affected by the Administrative Procedure Act.

Representative Hobbs, in his remarks on the revision of Title 28 of the Code, has pointed out how the Tax Court procedure has enabled that body to try and dispose of the vast number of cases before it. His remarks make it clear that if \u00a7 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act were to be held controlling it would be \u201cimpossible for the Tax Court to function expeditiously enough to dispose of its average case load of more than 5,000 cases a year,\u201d with the result that Congress would be required greatly to increase the number of judges unless the Court is to fall behind tragically in its disposition of cases. 93 Congressional Record pp. A3483-A3485; also reported in Title 28 U.S.C.
