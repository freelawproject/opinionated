Company, the appellant, and Dixie Cup Company, the appellee, were in interference in the United States Patent Office upon the respective applications of Hulseman and Carew. The applications of the two inventors had been previously assigned by them to the parties herein. Priority of invention was awarded Dixie Cup on Carew\u2019s application by the Board of Interference Examiners on July 11, 1946. On January 2, 1947, Paper Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>tainer brought suit in the court below against Dixie Cup to obtain a patent under R.S. \u00a7 4915, 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 63. Dixie Cup filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 12(b), 28 U.S.C.A., on the ground that the court below lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter because the suit was not being prosecuted by the real party in interest, Reconstruction Finance Corporation. RFC, while the interference was pending, had made a loan to Paper Container and had received as security an assignment of the Hulseman application. This assignment was duly recorded in the Patent Office. A hearing was had on Dixie Cup\u2019s motion to dismiss in the court below but before its determination Paper Container filed an amendment to its complaint under Rule 15(a) which purported to join RFC as a party plaintiff. Dixie Cup moved to strike the amendment. It was stipulated that the court should consider both \u2022 motions upon the hearing had and the authorities subsequently cited. The court dismissed the complaint for the reasons stated, in its opinion. See 74 F.Supp. 389. The appeal at bar followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The assignment executed by Paper Container to RFC, after recitals respecting the amount of the loan and the terms for its repayment, states that as security the assignor, Paper Container, does sell, assign and transfer to RFC \u201call right, title and interest of the Assignor in and to\u201d the Plulseman application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The assignment further provides that Paper Container should have certain \u201clicenses, rights, arid privileges\u201d and by the same instrument Paper Container entered into certain covenants with RFC, all as set out in the footnote.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It will be observed from an examination of the reservations that Paper Container (reservation (a)) reserved a \u201cper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>sonal, non-exclusive, non-assignable, and royalty-free right and license to make, use and vend the subject matter\u201d of the Hulseman application<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but that none the less (reservation (c)) RFC agreed that it would not license any person to engage in the manufacture of any product \u201cdirectly competitive\u201d with that of Paper Container without the latter\u2019s approval in writing. It follows that, although the license reserved to Paper Container is designated in the assignment as a \u201cnon-exclusive license\u201d, it is a good deal more than that and comes close to being an exclusive license, defeasible only by Paper Container\u2019s failure to repay the loan in accordance with its terms or to observe the other covenants of the assignment. Reservation (b) provides that Paper Container has the right to bring suit against any patent infringer (see note 1 <em>supra) </em>in its own name and in the name of RFC as complainants, upon procuring permission from RFC, the latter\u2019s consent to be presumed upon written request not denied within ninety days by RFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The covenants, (1) to (7) inclusive, referred to above, need not be discussed in detail. It is sufficient to state that covenant (4) states that Paper Container shall notify RFC of any interference in the Patent Office in respect to any application covered by the assignment, shall prosecute interferences at its own expense, and upon RFC\u2019s request shall grant associate powers of attorney to any attorney designated by the latter to prosecute the application to a final conclusion \u201cin the United States Patent Office and all Appellate Tribunals\u201d. Covenant (5) provides that Paper Contain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>er shall diligently prosecute all applications \u201cin the United States Patent Office and Appellate Tribunals\u201d and will not abandon any application without RFC\u2019s written consent. Covenant (6) states that Paper Container upon RFC\u2019s request shall give to it or to its attorneys power to inspect the files of any application in the Patent Office, shall furnish copies of papers filed in respect to the applications and also shall give associate powers of attorney to any attorney selected by RFC to prosecute any application \u201cin the United States Patent Office and all Appellate Tribunals\u201d to a final conclusion, expenses incurred by RFC in the prosecution of any application to be chargeable to Paper Container.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">If the clause \u201cAppellate Tribunals\u201d referred to in covenants (4), (5) and (6) be given strict construction it might be held that the reference was not intended to include a district court of the United States sitting in an R.S. \u00a7 4915 proceeding but was designated to embrace only the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, as an administrative tribunal<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Patent Office, and the Supreme Court of the United States, whence appeals lie ultimately from the decisions of the Patent Office. We think, however, that it was the intention of the parties to include a district court of the United States sitting \u201cin review\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the refusal of the Patent Office to grant a patent in an R.S. \u00a7 4915 proceeding within the phrase <em>appellate tribunals </em>as used in the covenants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Covenant (5) provides expressly that Paper Container shall prosecute applications in the Patent Office and before appellate tribunals. The language of the so-called \u201cabandonment clause\u201d of covenant (5) <footnotemark>7</footnotemark>, indicates that Paper Container and RFC agreed implicitly that Paper Container alone and in its own name should prosecute applications, such as Hulseman\u2019s. Compare the provisions of reservation (b) that suits for infringement should be prosecuted in the names of both Paper Container and RFC.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Obviously it' was not the intention of RFC to take part in proceedings in the Patent Office in its own name as assignee but to leave such proceedings to be prosecuted by Paper Container as assignee of Hulseman. The respective rights and standings of Paper Container and RFC must be determined by the terms of Paper Container\u2019s assignment to RFC. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>indication is clear that both RFC and Paper Container understood and agreed that Paper Container should prosecute the Hulseman application to a final conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">On examination of the reservations granted to Paper Container by RFC and the covenants of the assignment, we cannot say, as Dixie Cup contends, that under Waterman v. Mackenzie, 138 U.S. 252, 11 S.Ct. 334, 34 L.Ed. 923, that Paper Container is a mere non-exclusive licensee under the Hulseman application and for that reason had no right to institute the action at bar or that RFC is the only real party in interest, an indispensable party that alone was entitled to institute and maintain the instant suit. The Supreme Court in the Waterman case recognized that the assignor of a patent by an assignment couched in general terms consummates an act \u201cequivalent to delivery of possession\u201d of corporeal property and makes the title of the assignee \u201ccomplete towards all other persons, as well as against\u201d the assignor, but the Court added the qualifying phrase \u201cunless otherwise provided in the mortgage\u201d. 138 U.S. at page 260, 11 S.Ct. at page 337, 34 L.Ed. 923. The qualifications in the assignment in the case at bar are substantial and, in our opinion, are sufficient to constitute Paper Container as a real party in interest, an indispensable party. Shields v. Barrow, 17 How. 130, 139, 15 L.Ed. 158; United States v. Washington Institute of Technology, D.C. Del., 47 F.Supp. 384. It follows that both Paper Container and RFC are indispensable parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We turn now to the provisions of-R.S. \u00a7 4915 to determine how they should be applied under the circumstances at bar. The section, in pertinent part, states: \u201cWhenever a patent on application is refused by the Board of Appeals or . . . whenever any applicant is dissatisfied with the decision of the board of interference examiners, the applicant * * * may have remedy by bill in equity, if filed within six months after such refusal or decision; and the court having cognizance thereof, on notice to adverse parties and other due proceedings had, may adjudge that such applicant is entitled, according to law, to receive a patent for his invention * * The question is: Can Paper Container alone, without RFC, be deemed to be an \u201capplicant\u201d within the phrase \u201cany applicant\u201d as used in the statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">The <em>locii standi </em>of Paper Container and RFC created by the terms of the assignment are anomalous. Each has a substantial interest in the Hulseman application and those interests are in a sense indivisible or, at least, joint. RFC is interested in having the application prosecuted to fruition. If this is not accomplished RFC\u2019s security for its loan to Paper Container will be correspondingly decreased. Paper Container\u2019s interest is substantially similar to that of RFC. If the Hulseman application is not prosecuted to a successful conclusion Paper Container will lose an asset which it expects (on repayment of the loan to RFC) to recapture in toto. RFC\u2019s interest is surely not \u201cadverse\u201d to that of Paper Container, nor is that of Paper Container \u201cadverse\u201d to the interest of RFC. The \u201cadverse parties\u201d referred to in R.S. \u00a7 4915 are clearly the \u201cadverse parties\u201d of the interference proceedings or those claiming under them. Compare the circumstances attendant on our decision in Shell Development Co. v. Universal Oil Products Co., 3 Cir., 157 F.2d 421,, 424, 425, and in Nachod &amp; United States Signal Co. v. Automatic Signal Corp., 2 Cir., 105 F.2d 981; in Parker Rust-Proof Co. v. Western Union Tel. Co., 2 Cir., 105 F.2d 976, and in Klumb v. Roach, 7 Cir., 151 F.2d 374, 377, cert. den. 327 U.S. 784, 66 S.Ct. 684, 90 L.Ed. 1011. Both Paper Container and RFC are in a position analogous to that of joint inventors who have filed an application in the Patent Office; or, perhaps, more accurately, Paper Container and RFC are in a position like that of two assignees to whom a joint and indivisible interest in an application has been assigned by -the inventor, and one of whom now seeks to prosecute the application to fruition by securing a patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">Suppose, to amplify the example contained in the previous paragraph, A and B are assignees of a patent application and the Board of Interference Examiners has awarded priority of invention to the application of party X in an interference proceeding. A desires to prosecute the application in an R.S. \u00a7 4915 'proceeding but B, believing the decision of the Board to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>have been correct, desires to avoid the expense of any further action or litigation. By his refusal to join as a party plaintiff could he prevent A from maintaining an R. S. \u00a7 4915 action in the district court? We are of the opinion that he could not. We think that B would have to allow A to use his name on analogy to the principle enunciated by Mr. Chief Justice Taft in Independent Wireless Tel. Co. v. Radio Corp. of America, 269 U.S. 459, 469, 46 S.Ct. 166, 70 L.Ed. 357. Under the circumstances of the instant case Paper Container and RFC are in legal effect trustees for each other. But the statement just made begs the question to some degree for Paper Container did not attempt to make use of RFC\u2019s name in the instant suit or attempt to join it as a party plaintiff within the six months prescribed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">R. S. \u00a7 4915, however, expressly provides that, \u201cany applicant\u201d may institute suit. Prior to the amendments effected by the Act of August 5, 1939, 53 Stat. 1212, the critical words were \u201cthe applicant\u201d. See 44 Stat. 1336.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We have been unable to discover any legislative history or any decided case which throws light on the reason why the word \u201cany\u201d was substituted for \u201cthe\u201d by the 1939 amendment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Rules of Practice of the Patent Office, 35 U.S.C.A., Appendix, as amended subsequent to the changes in the Act seem to reflect no pertinent modification. Rule 133 still speaks of \u201cevery applicant for a patent, * * * \u00bb <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as if two or more inventors joining in a single application for a patent were an \u201capplicant\u201d within the purview of the rule. But the amendment may not be assumed to be meaningless and may well represent a Congressional intent to cause the statute to reflect modern circumstances where two or more persons frequently work together to make a single invention or where the application, when filed in the Patent Office often is assigned to a group or syndicate which possess a joint interest in it. Any of the persons in the categories designated might desire to prosecute an application to final determination. Under this interpretation of .the statute we must conclude that Paper Container must be deemed to be an \u201capplicant\u201d within the purview of the phrase \u201cany applicant\u201d of R.S. \u00a7 4915.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">But if the statute now used the phrase \u201cthe applicant\u201d as it did prior to the 1939 amendment, we would still be of the opinion that Paper Container would be an \u201capplicant\u201d within the meaning of the Act. RFC\u2019s title is merely for security. As is indicated by the assignment it was the intention of both RFC and Paper container that Paper Container should prosecute the Hulseman application to final determination in the Patent Office and before the appropriate appellate tribunals. The court below was sitting as' a court of equity under the terms of R.S. \u00a7 4915.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The standing of Paper Container to pursue the Hulseman application as an \u201capplicant\u201d was conferred upon it by the terms of the assignment as we have pointed out.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In a realistic sense Paper Container would be \u201cthe applicant\u201d under R.S. \u00a7 4915 as it stood prior to the 1939 amendment for RFC is interested only in maintaining its security.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> True, the assignment will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>serve to enlarge the jurisdiction of the statute but the standing of a party as \u201cthe applicant\u201d under the statute would of necessity he determined by the attendant pertinent circumstances in every case and is here settled by the terms of the assignment. We conclude, therefore, that Paper Container fulfilled the requirements of R.S. \u00a7 4915 (which we assume to be jurisdictional) when it brought suit against the adverse party, Dixie Cup, in the court below within six months of the decision of the Board of Interference Examiners.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The legal fact-remains, as we have stated, that RFC is an indispensable pary and that the suit at bar cannot proceed to a conclusion without its being joined as a party. Paper Container has endeavored to effect this by filing the amendment referred to in the first paragraph of this opinion. As we apprehend the record the court below did not pass directly upon the question of the propriety of the amendment filed under Rule 15(a) but simply dismissed the complaint. The record shows that RFC has consented to join the suit as a party plaintiff by its letter of May 23, 1947. Whether that joinder be made by way of an amendment under Rule 15(a) or by motion under Rule 21 seems to us to be immaterial but the proper course of joinder must be determined by the court below upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In conclusion we should point out that it makes no legal difference to Dixie Cup whether Paper Container or RFC is the real and therefore indispensable party in interest or whether both are real and indispensable parties. Upon answer filed and hearing Dixie Cup will have its day in court and whether a patent be issued to Paper Container or to RFC or to both of them, if any patent can issue on the Hulseman application, is a matter of no legal import to Dixie Cup. The judgment will be binding alike on Paper Container, RFC,, and Dixie Cup.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">The remaining points raised by the parties do not require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause will be remanded, with the direction to reinstate the complaint and to proceed with the case in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\"> Other patents and applications were, also assigned by the same instrument but these need not be detailed in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\"> The licenses, rights and privileges reserved to Paper Container and the covenants entered into by it with RPC under the assignment in pertinent part are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">\u201cThis assignment is made upon the understanding that the Assignor reserves and shall have the following licenses, rights, and privileges, so long only as the Assignor shall punctually and fully. pay and discharge, when and as payment or discharge thereof shall be due, all obligations and agreements made by the Assignor to or with R.

Cf. 27 Stat. 436, \u00a7 9, Act Feb. 9, 1893, which refers to \u201cany party aggrieved\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b394-7\"> The reasons for certain other changes effected in the statute by the 1939 amendments are set forth in 2 Walker on Patents, Deller\u2019s Ed., 1948 Supp. Section 214.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\"> See Rules of Practice in the United States Patent Office, 2 Walker on Patents, Deller\u2019s Ed., at p. 1011.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b394-9\"> \u201cA court of equity looks at the real object and intention of the conveyance. * * =s &gt;&gt; Hughes v.

This they cannot do. 18 Am.Jur.Ejectment \u00a7 55, and the authorities in note 14 cited to the text. The analogy is apposite although in the instant suit Paper Container seeks to try title in an invention, not in land. Dixie Cup seeks to avoid this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b394-16\"> Lord Mansfield put the matter succinctly when he said in the case of The King against the Inhabitants of St. Michael\u2019s in Bath, Vol. II Douglas reports 630, 632 (Reprint Vol. 99, p. 399) that \u201cIt is an affront to common sense to say that the mortgagor is not the real owner.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b395-6\"> The situation would be otherwise if RFC and not Dixie Cup was the adverse party.

If. such had been the case, assuming the provisions of R.S. \u00a7 4915 to be jurisdictional, RFC would have had to have been made a party within the six month period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b395-24\"> Whether or not the decision of the court below might or might not be binding upon RFC, even in the absence of joinder, is a question which we need not determine on the record in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
