Believing that $15,157.65 of this loss constituted a \u201cnet operating loss carry-back\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 122 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 122, and that this \u201cnet operating loss carry-back\u201d had the effect of extinguishing his income tax liability for the years 1941, 1942 and 1943, he filed claims for a refund of taxes paid on income for 1941 and 1942 and on account of estimated income for 1943. These claims were denied, and this action followed. The defendants (appellees) denied liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">The appellant (taxpayer) moved for a summary judgment. At the hearing on his motion it appeared that there was no genuine issue of. fact involved in the case; that the sole issue, so far as the merits of the taxpayer\u2019s claim were concerned, was whether, under the applicable law, the loss sustained by him in 1943 from the sale of his farms and equipment was a \u201cnet operating loss\u201d which could be carried back. If it was such a loss, the taxpayer was entitled to recover. If it was not a loss which could be carried back, the defendants were entitled to prevail. The District Court ruled against the taxpayer on the ground that the loss was not a \u201cnet operating loss,\u201d The court said (77 F.Supp. 241, 243): \u201cIn the instant case, the plaintiff is a farmer, and during the years in question was engaged in the operation of farms and the growing and marketing of products therefrom. He was in no sense engaged in the real estate business or in the buying and selling of farm machinery as a business. If, for example, the plaintiff had realized a profit through the sale of his farm or farm machinery, certainly such profit would not be considered as an operating profit. The converse should be true. Accordingly it seems to me that loss from the sale of the farms themselves could not be properly tertned or classified as an operating loss. If the plaintiff had been a real estate dealer engaged in the business of buying and selling farm lands, the classification would be otherwise. Accordingly, plaintiff\u2019s complaint fails to recite a cause of action upon which relief can be granted and the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss should be granted.\u201d From the judgment of dismissal of his complaint, the taxpayer has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-16\">The sole question for decision by this Court is whether the loss sustained by the taxpayer in 1943 was a \u201cnet operating loss\u201d which could be carried back. Certain procedural questions are argued in the briefs, but they were not ruled upon by the District Court and are therefore not properly before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>The applicable law is \u00a7 122 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which defines \u201cnet operating loss\u201d and provides for a \u201cnet operating loss carry-back\u201d and a \u201cnet operating loss carry-over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>It will be noted that \u00a7 122(a) provides that \u201cthe term \u2018net -operating loss\u2019 means the excess of the deductions allowed by this chapter over the gross income, with the exceptions, additions, and limitations provided in subsection (d).\u201d It will also be noted that paragraph (5) of subsection (d) provides: \u201cDeductions otherwise allowed by law not attributable to the operation of a trade or business regularly carried on by the taxpayer shall (in the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation) be allowed only to the extent of,the amount of the gross income not derived from such trade or business. For the purposes of this paragraph deductions and gross income shall be computed with the exceptions, additions, and limitations specified in paragraphs (1) to (4) of this subsection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has apparently ruled consistently that, because of the limitation contained in subsection (d) (5), an individual taxpayer who sustains a loss not attributable to the normal operation of a trade or business regularly carried on by him, may not carry over or carry back any part of such loss as \u201ca net operating loss deduction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In 1945 the Commissioner ruled that a taxpayer who sustained a loss through the sale of real estate which had been owned and operated by her as a source of income could, in computing her \u201cnet operating loss,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 122(a) of the Code as amended, deduct the loss \u201conly to the extent provided in section 122(d) (5) of the Code, * * The Commissioner said (Int. Rev. Bulletin, Cumulative Bulletin 1945 [IT 3711], pages 162-164): \u201cThe basis for this conclusion is that, although it is determined that the property upon the sale of which .the loss was sustained was used in A\u2019s business of managing and operating income-producing real estate, the loss from the sale thereof is \u2018not attributable to the operation of a trade or business regularly carried on by the taxpayer\u2019 within the purview of section 122(d) (5) of the Code, supra, since she was not a regular trader or dealer in real estate. In other words, as supported by the facts here presented, the only business regularly carried on by A was managing and operating her income-producing real estate and not trading or dealing in real estate; the property was held primarily for use, rather than for sale,' in her business; and the loss did not arise or result from the operation of su'ch business but upon the disposition of assets used therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">In Merrill v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 9 T.C. 291, decided September 9, 1947, the Tax Court considered the question of a taxpayer\u2019s right to deduct, as a net operating loss carry-over, a loss resulting -from the disposition of his interest in a partnership. In a decision by Judge Leech of the Tax Court (which was reviewed by that court), it was said: \u201cHaving concluded the transaction was a transfer of petitioner\u2019s interest in the partnership to the remaining partners, it is necessary to determine the extent to which the loss resulting therefrom is a net operating loss within the limitations prescribed in subsection (d) (5) of section 122 of the code. Obviously, such transaction was not a part of the business of the partnership, and, so far as is revealed here, petitioner was not engaged in the business of buying and selling partnership interests. Cf. United States v. Adamson, 161 F.2d 942. The transaction was clearly outside the \u2018business regularly carried on\u2019 by the petitioner and no part thereof can be taken into consideration in determining petitioner\u2019s net operating loss for 1940, subject to be carried over into the taxable year 1941. The respondent\u2019s disallowance of the deduction is sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">In Sic v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 10 T.C. 1096, decided June 10, 1948, the question presented was whether a taxpayer, a retired farmer, who had sustained a loss through the sale of farm property in 1942, could carry over any part of the loss to the taxable year 1943. The Tax Court followed its ruling in the Merrill case. The concluding -paragraph of its opinion in the Sic case (also written by Judge Leech, and reviewed by the court) is as follows: \u201cThe respondent contends the rationale of the Merrill case, supra [9 T.C. 291], is applicable and controlling here. We agree. The loss in question results from the sale of land and, although the land was used in the business of farming, its sale was an isolated transaction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>outside the business of farming which petioner 'regularly carried on.\u2019 Since it appears from the stipulated facts that the petitioner\u2019s only income was from his farming operations, no part of the loss is subject to carry-over into the taxable year 1943, under section 122(d) (5) of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">The case of Pettit v. Commissioner, 10 T.C. - (Tax Court Memo. Dec., Docket No. 12650, entered June 10, 1948), presented the question whether a loss sustained from a sale in 1942 of real estate used by a taxpayer in growing and marketing citrus fruits was' deductible as a net operating loss carry-over for 1943. The Commissioner had ruled that it was not deductible. The Tax Court\u2019s opinion, by Judge Arundell, is as follows: \u201cPetitioner was engaged in the business of producing and selling citrus fruits and was not a dealer in real estate. Because the loss in question was derived from the ultimate sale of the entire property and did not arise from the marketing of citrus fruits, the determination by the respondent is approved. Joseph Sic, 10 T.C. 1096 (Dec. 16,435); Joseph L. Merrill, 9 T.C. 291 (Dec. 15,997) ; Lazier v. United States (D.C. N.Dak.) Jan. 22, 1948 [77 F.Supp. 241] * * *. See I.T. 3711, 1945 C.B. 162; Dalton v. Bowers, 287 U.S. 404, 53 S.Ct. 205, 77 L.Ed. 389 (USTC P. 1008).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The Tax Court again dealt with this problem in Baruch v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 11 T.C 96, decided July 29, 1948. The taxpayer in that case had operated a farm as a business regularly carried on. He sold the farm in 1942 at a loss. The Commissioner allowed the loss in the computation of the taxpayer\u2019s net income for that year, but disallowed the balance of the net loss as a carry-over to the years 1943 and 1944. The Tax Court, in an opinion by Judge Black, ruled, as in the Sic case, that the loss which the taxpayer sustained in the sale of his farm in 1942 was not a loss attributable to the operation of a trade or a business regularly carried on by the taxpayer, was subject to the limitations of \u00a7 122(d) (5),'and could not be carried forward to 1943 and 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">So far as we are aware, only two courts, other than the Tax Court, have considered the question involved in the instant case, n\u00e1mely, the court below and the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In the case of Foreman v. Harrison, 79 F.Supp. 987, 988, the plaintiff, who had been engaged in the business of manufacturing, sustained a loss from the sale of his factory building and land in the year 1943. He attempted to carry back his net loss to the year'1941 and to obtain a refund of taxes paid for that year. Judge La Buy, who heard the case, stated his \u201cconclusions of Law\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">\u201c1. In applying Section 122 of the Internal Revenue Code, as effective in 1941 to 1943, a net operating loss to be available for carry-over or carry-back purposes must be one sustained as an incident to the ordinary and normal course of a trade or business regularly carried on by the taxpayer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">\u201c2. The interpretation of the Commissioner is that an isolated transaction involving the sale of building and land, formerly necessary incidents to an operating business, cannot be included within the statutory section allowing net loss carryover or carry-back for the reason that such sale for the purpose of terminating the manufacturing activity cannot reasonably be construed to come within the category of a transaction incurred in the ordinary and normal course of a trade or business regularly carried on by the taxpayer. This interpretation is consistent with the language and intent of the statutory section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">\u201c3. The plaintiff not being in the business of selling land and buildings cannot carry-back his loss sustained in 1943 and charge the same against the net operating profit derived in 1941.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">The taxpayer argues that, since Congress in \u00a7 122(a) has specifically defined \u201cnet operating loss\u201d as \u201cthe excess of the deductions allowed by this chapter over the gross income, with the exceptions, additions, and limitations provided in subsection (d),\u201d and the loss sustained by the taxpayer in 1943 being concededly deductible and exceeding gross income, he necessarily had a \u201cnet operating loss\u201d which he was entitled to carry back. The tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>payer asserts that \u00a7 122(d) (5) has no application to a loss su'ch as he sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The construction of the statute for which the taxpayer argues, is, perhaps, not demonstrably wrong, but we think that the language used by Congress, the apparent purpose of the statute, and the qualification of \u201cnet operating loss,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 122(a), by the limitations provided in subsection, (d), of which subsection (d) (5) was one, justified the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in adopting the construction which the taxpayer challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">It is possible that the Commissioner, the Tax Court and the District Courts, which have approved the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute, may have misconceived the intent of Congress with respect to the character of net losses which could be carried forward or back. No doubt, that intent could have been expressed in simpler and more understandable language. This Court, however, would not be justified in adopting the construction urged upon it by the taxpayer unless convinced that the statute has thus far been misconstrued by the taxing authorities and by the courts. See United States v. Armature Rewinding Co., 8 Cir., 124 F.2d 589, 591; Helvering v. Rebsamen Motors, Inc., 8 Cir., 128 F.2d 584, 587. One reasonably may believe that in providing for the carrying forward and carrying back of \u201cnet operating losses,\u201d Congress was concerned with \u201cnet operating losses\u201d sustained in, the normal operation of a business regularly carried on by a taxpayer and was not concerned with losses attributable to the total or partial liquidation of the physical properties used in the conduct of the business. See Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation, Vol. 5, page 318, \u00a7 29.05. The taxpayer in the instant case, as has already been pointed out, was engaged exclusively in the business of farmiijg and not in the business of selling farm lands or farm machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Counsel for the taxpayer has stressed in his brief the nation-wide interest of taxpayers in the question involved in this case. A petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court should enable that Court to give the question nation-wide repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-5\"> Title 26 U.S.O.A.
