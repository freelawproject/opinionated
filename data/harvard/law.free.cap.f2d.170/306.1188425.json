Our only possible basis of jurisdiction is \u00a7 10(f) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 61 Stat. 148, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(f), which provides that any person aggrieved \u201cby a final order of the Board granting or denying in whole or in part the relief sought may obtain a review of such order\u201d in the appropriate circuit court of appeals. We agree with the Board that the phrase \u201ca final order of the Board\u201d as used in this subsection \u201crefers solely to an order of the Board either dismissing a complaint in whole or in part or directing a remedy for the unfair labor practices found, that is to an order entered as the culmination of the procedure described in Section 10(b) and (c) of the Act, as amended.\u201d See American Federation of Labor v. N.L.R.B., 1940, 308 U.S. 401, 60 S.Ct. 300, 84 L.Ed. 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"> The issuance of a complaint under \u00a7 10 of the Act is a matter of administrative discretion. Under the National Labor Relations Act in its original form, 49 Stat. 449, it was clear that the refusal of the Board to issue a complaint was not reviewable in the circuit courts of appeals. See Jacobsen v. N.L.R.B., 3 Cir., 1941, 120 F.2d 96, 100. The Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 has effected no change in the jurisdictional language of \u00a7 10 now relevant, though in other particulars it made substantial amendments of the National Labor Relations Act. Wilke v. N.L.R.B., 4 Cir., July 7, 1948; No. 5754.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">It is to be noted that the Labqr Management Relations Act of 1947 introduced into \u00a7 3 of the National Labor Relations Act a new subsection (d), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 153(d), which took away from the Board the administrative power to issue complaints under \u00a7 10. As the Act now reads, the General Counsel of the Board \u201cshall have final authority, on behalf, of the Board, in respect of the investigation of charges and issuance of complaints under section 10.\u201d Such administrative determinations by the General Counsel are not denominated \u201corders\u201d in the Act, and the Act makes no provision for their review. That the Board itself no longer has power to make such determinations only serves to emphasize, what is otherwise abundantly clear, that there has in this case been no \u201cfinal order of the Board\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Consequently, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition must be granted, and a judgment will be entered dismissing the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-17\"> Petition for review, dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
