The claim was: that in computing its undistributed profits for surtax purposes, plaintiff was entitled to a credit under Sec. 26(c) (l)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Revenue Act of 1936, 26 U.S.C.A.Int. Rev.Acts, p. 836, by reason of an extension agreement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which it made with its bondholders prior to May 1, 1936, prohibiting it from paying dividends during the taxable year in excess of a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>amount; and that the credit had been disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The defense was that the restrictive provisions of the contract were waived by the plaintiff\u2019s failure to establish a reserve fund annually and by the bondholders\u2019 acquiescence in such lack of performance on paintiff\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The cause was submitted on a stipulation of facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The district judge found that the bondholders had not in any manner waived their rights under the contract. He found further, though, \u201cthat the contract was breached 'by the corporation in that the plaintiff (a) did not set up a reserve fund, (b) retired only $3000.00 in bonds during the fiscal year of January 31, 1937 \u2014 January 31, 1938, and (c) on January 28, 1938, declared a dividend of $2.00 per share.\u201d On the basis of this finding, he held: \u201cPlaintiff, I think, having breached the contract, is not in position to take advantage of the provisions of a breached contract when it seeks remedy under said Section 26(c) (1).\u201d So holding, he gave judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Plaintiff is here insisting that the foundation of his right is written plain in the statute; that the agreement was made in precise accordance with the statute; and that the so-called breach of its contract, of which the trial court made so much, is wholly without significance here.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">We agree with appellant. The written contract executed in this case is precisely the kind of contract with which \u25a0the statute deals. Appellant could not \u201cwithout violating a provision of a written contract * * expressly dealing \u201cwith the payment of dividends,\u201d have distributed the difference between the $13,658 paid in dividends and its adjusted net income of $32,546.92, on account of which the taxes sued for were assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">The government, in face of the fact that the district judge found against it on its defense of waiver and based his judgment solely upon the theory of breach, argues the case as though waiver had been established. This will not do. A breach of a provision of a contract is the antithesis of a waiver of its terms. If there was a waiver, there was no breach; if a breach, no waiver. Unless changed by agreement or abandoned by waiver of the bondholders for whose benefit it was made, the agreement stands as a barrier to paying out the profits on account of which the tax in question was assessed. The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-13\"> \u201c (c) Contracta Restricting Payment of Dividends.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-14\">\u201c(1) Prohibition on payment of dividends.
