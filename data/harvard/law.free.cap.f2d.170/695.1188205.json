HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Az5\">On or about September 1, 1948, Oppenheim Collins &amp; Co., Inc., filed an amended charge with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging that the respondent Local 1250, Department Store Employees Union, was engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of \u00a7 8(b), Subsection (4) (C) of the National Labor Relations Act as amended June 23, 1947, 61 Stat. 136, 29 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 158(b) (4) (C), which is set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in that it was inducing, the employees of Oppenheim Collins &amp; Co., Inc., to engage in a strike, an object being to require the employer to recognize or bargain with respondent, although on September 1, 1948, the Board had certified Retail Clerks International Association, AFL, another labor organization, as the representative of the employees under \u00a7 9 of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 159. As a basis for .'its certification, the Board had found after holding an election that a majority of the eligible voters had designated the Retail Clerks as the representative of the employees for the purposes of collective bargaining. After the certification of the Retail Clerks, the Board investigated the charge of Oppenheim Collins &amp; Co., Inc., and found it had reasonable cause to believe that the charge was true and filed a petition for injunctive relief pursuant to \u00a7 10(Z) of the Act, the pertinent portions of which are set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereupon, the District Court ordered that the respondent show cause why the injunction should not be granted; the respondent moved to dismiss the petition by the Board \u201con the grounds that\u201d the court was without jurisdiction \u201cover the subject matter of the * * * proceeding and * * * over the person of the [Unnion], by reason of the fact that Section 10 (Z) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended * * * is unconstitutional * * * being repugnant to Article III, Sections 1 and 2 of the Constitution of the United States and to the Fifth Amendment thereto.\u201d The court denied the motion to dismiss and the respondent waived the taking of formal testimony. Thereupon the court, in the preamble to the order which it issued, found that there was \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d that the Union had engaged and was engaging in \u201cacts and conduct in violation of Section 8(b), Subsection 4(C) of the Act,\u201d and pending the final adjudication of the matter, issued an injunction, the pertinent portions of which are 'quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From the fore-, going injunction and an order denying the motion to dismiss the petition therefor, the respondent has appealed. We think that there is no merit in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>The respondent Union argues that the District Court was\u2018exercising non-judicial functions and therefore violating Article III of the Constitution in that the ultimate decision as to the merits of the controversy will not be made by the court but by an administrative body, to wit, the National Labor Relations Board, whose decision will not be subject to review by the District Court, and can only be tested in the Court of Appeals in the course of an enforcement proceeding. In support of its position, respondent argues that no case or controversy existed before the District Court within the meaning of Article III of the Constitution. It admits that a court may grant a preliminary injunction to protect its own jurisdiction or that of another court, but argues on grounds most difficult to understand that Congress is constitutionally precluded from conferring on a court jurisdiction to lend its aid to an administrative body, as Congress attempted to. do in \u00a7 10(1) of the National Labor Relations Act</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">We can see no basis for such arguments. Here was a dispute to be resolved under the direct provisions of the statute. It did not cease to be a dispute because the ultimate decision on the merits would not rest with the court. A similar contention was made in the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Federal Trade Commission v. Thomsen-King &amp; Co., 109 F.2d 516, but was rejected by that court. In Evans v. International Typographical Union, D.C.S.D. Ind., 76 F.Supp. 881, Judge Swygert dealt with a like contention and granted a preliminary injunction to the Labor Board under provisions which are practically indistinguishable from those in Section 10(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The contention of appellant\u2019s counsel that he is in any way aided by the opinion of Chief Justice Hughes in Aetna Life Insurance Co. of Hartford, Conn., v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 57 S.Ct. 461, 464, 81 L.Ed. 617, 108 A.L.R. 1000, which interpreted the constitutional limits of the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, is unsound. The contention there was that the court was not dealing with a case or controversy. This contention was overruled and a case or controversy defined thus: \u201cA \u2018controversy\u2019 in this sense must be one that is appropriate for judicial determination. * * * A justiciable controversy is thus distinguished from a difference or dispute of a hypothetical or abstract character; from one that is academic or moot. * * * The controversy must be definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests. * * * It must be a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">This definition supports our view in the case at bar. It is to be noticed that the court only required the controversy to be justiciable and final in the sense that iLwas not to be merely hypothetical or advisory. We hold that for the purposes of relief by preliminary injunction the action of the District Court was final.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">It is quite apparent that the Secretary of Agriculture was aided in the exercise of his jurisdiction when the Supreme Court, after holding in Morgan v. United States, 298 U.S. 468, 56 S.Ct. 906, 80 L.Ed. 1288; Id., 304 U.S. 1, 58 S.Ct. 773, 82 L.Ed. 1129, that a full hearing had not been accorded to certain stockyard owners charged with collecting excessive rates, further decided in United States v. Morgan, 307 U.S. 183, 59 S.Ct. 795, 83 L.Ed. 1211, that the alleged overcharges should be retained in the custody of the District Court pending the result of a new and adequate hearing. It is to be noted that at this stage of the litigation there was no pending review of an administrative order and that such an order was to be based on future administrative hearings. See also United States v. Morgan, 313 U.S. 409, 61 S.Ct. 999, 85 L.Ed. 1429, opinion by Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">In Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, 154 U.S. 447, 14 S.Ct. 1125, 38 L.Ed. 1047, it was argued that the issuance of a subpoena in aid of an investigation of the ICC was not a judicial function. But the argument was rejected by the Supreme Court [Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, supra, 154 U.S., at page 489, 14 S.Ct. at page 1137]. A similar result was reached in Endicott Johnson Corporation v. Perkins, 317 U.S. 501, 63 S.Ct. 339, 87 L.Ed. 424, and Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Walling, 327 U.S. 186, 66 S.Ct. 494, 90 L.Ed. 614, 166 A.L.R. 531. In none of these cases was the constitutional argument urged before us sanctioned by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">It is also argued that if the injunction granted was final, the respondent was deprived of due process because there was no hearing on the merits, which still remain to be determined by the Board. Such a criticism might be made of any preliminary injunction, whether in aid of a suit pending in the court where the motion is made, or in another court, or in an administrative tribunal. In the present case, the District Court acted on the complaint of the Board which the respondent had an opportunity to meet if it chose. In the face of its waiver of the right to meet allegations showing probable cause, there can be no merit in the claim of lack of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The further contention is made that the injunction order is invalid because unsupported by findings of fact under Rule 52(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. But the respondent has only attacked the decision of the court on constitutional grounds and has waived'its right to meet the allegations of the complaint, which therefore procedurally stood admitted. The absence of findings was not only a non-jurisdictional defect [see opinion of Clark, J., in Rossiter v. Vogel, 2 Cir., 148 F.2d 292], but findings were not requisite where no issue of fact existed. Fontes v. Porter, 9 Cir., 156 F.2d 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the court below denying the motion to dismiss the petition and granting the preliminary injunction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-12\"> \u201cSec. 8.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-13\">\u201c(b) It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents\u2014 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-14\">\u201c(4) to engage in, or to induce or' encourage the employees of any employer to engage in, a strike or a concerted refusal in the course of their employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise han\u00e1le or work on any goods, articles, materials, or commodities or to perform any services, where an object thereof is: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-20\">\u201c(C) forcing or requiring any employer to recognize or bargain, with a particular labor organization as the representative of his employees if another labor .organization has been certified as the representative of such employees under the provisions of section 9; * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\"> \u201cSec. 10.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-9\"><em>\u201c(l) </em>Whenever it is charged that any person has engaged in an unfair labor practice within the meaning of paragraph (4) (A), (B), or (0) of section 8 (b), the preliminary investigation of such charge shall be made forthwith and given priority over all other cases except cases of like character in the office where it is filed or to which it is referred.

I am, however, much troubled by the scope of the injunction actually entered; in this matter of purely local concern, not affecting the general public as do railroad or coal strikes, we have an injunction of the broadest form, prohibiting, among other things, \u201call persons acting in active concert or participation with\u201d the union from \u201cengaging in a strike\u201d or \u201cvisiting at the homes of any of the employees\u201d of the charging party to engage in a strike, etc. Before the recent Act such injunctions appear to have been quite clearly objectionable;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Act itself explicitly preserves some rights to quit work, to express or disseminate views, arguments, and opinion, and to strike, while it directs the court only to grant such temporary relief or restraining order as the court \u201cdeems just and proper.\u201d 29 U.S.C. A. \u00a7\u00a7 143, 158(c), 160 (j,k), 163. Nevertheless it cannot be gainsaid that the Act does put the federal courts far into the task of terminating strikes, and perhaps it is not greatly worth while for an intermediate court to try to dress up the details of an injunction of its own motion. Hence I am, somewhat reluctantly, concurring in this result, although, as appears in the accompanying case, I do think respondent should have the right of court review of these matters without drastic and cumulative penalties against it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\"> See Bakery &amp; Pastry Drivers &amp; Helpers Local 802 of International Brotherhood of Teamsters v.
