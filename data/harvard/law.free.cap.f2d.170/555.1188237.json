S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 701-799, on November 1, 1945, filed a petition in bankruptcy on November 15, 1945, and was adjudged a bankrupt on November 19, 1945.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case was referred, and trustees were appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">A controversy arose between the trustees and appellants (Peter Petersen and Clara Belle Petersen, husband and wife) concerning property which appellants had in their possession. The trustees contended that the bankrupt owned the property on November 1, 1945, and November 15, 1945, and that therefore title thereto was vested in them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants disputed the trustees\u2019 contentions and contended that they, appellants, owned the property on November 1, 1945, and at all times thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">The trustees petitioned the court for a determination of the controversy. Appellants answered the petition, and a hearing was had before the referee. Thereafter the referee entered an order determining the controversy. On petition of appellants, the court (a judge thereof presiding) reviewed the referee\u2019s order and on April 19, 1948, entered an order which reversed and set aside the referee\u2019s order and recommitted the matter to the referee for further hearing. From the order of April 19, 1948, this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-17\">The trustees have moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the order of April 19, 1948, was not appealable. Obviously, the order of April 19, 1948, was not \u2018a final order. It was not an order in proceedings in bankruptcy, either interlocutory or final. It was, instead, an interlocutory order in a controversy arising in proceedings in bankruptcy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such an order is not appealable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-18\">The motion is granted, arid the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-12\"> See Petersen v.
