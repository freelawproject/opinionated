The law forfeits the truck if it is being taken out in violation of the law, and it is no defense to the libel that the person to whom the driver has entrusted the truck is taking it out without the authority of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-21\">The judgment was right. It is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
