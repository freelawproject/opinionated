Allen v. United States, 6 Cir., 162 F.2d 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">In obedience to our mandate, the district court conducted a full hearing at which many witnesses testified in open court and documentary evidence was also received and broad privilege was extended to appellant to support the allegations of his petition. Upon completion of the hearing, the district court, in its opinion, found as a fact that \u201cthere is no evidence in this record of any mental incapacity of the defendant at the time he plead guilty, or at the time he was sentenced.\u201d An order was entered reciting that' \u201cthe defendant was not insane at the time of the entry of his plea of guilty to the indictment in the case,\u201d but on the other hand \u201cwas fully capable of realizing and did realize the significance of his act in so pleading.\u201d The court\u2019s order denied and dismissed \u00ab.he petition and the appellant has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">After due consideration of the record, the briefs of appellant and the .oral argument of able, counsel appointed to represent him on this appeal and the briefs and oral argument of the United States Attorney, we are of opinion that the finding of the district court upon the crucial issue of fact is supported by substantial evidence and that no reversible error was committed in the proceedings in the district court Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
