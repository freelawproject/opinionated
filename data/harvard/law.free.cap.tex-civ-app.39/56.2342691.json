Tried below before Hon. J. M. Pearson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-10\">The bill of exceptions to the exclusion of the testimony complained of in the fifth assignment showed that defendant, in cross-examining Gladden, a material witness for plaintiff, offered witness an affidavit, sworn to by him, that a certain young woman was eighteen years of age, and that there was no legal objection to her marriage with another person named therein, and proposed to prove by the witness that the affidavit was knowingly and willfully falsely made, and that the testimony was excluded on objection that it was irrelevant and incompetent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-11\"><em>Abernathy &amp; Abernathy </em>and <em>A. M. Carter, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKK\">The testimony of witness Dobson was irrelevant, immaterial and incompetent, relating to an independent transaction between witness and defendant, and was calculated to prejudice the minds of the jury against appellant. Gulf, C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Rowland, 90 Texas, 371; Texas &amp; P. Ry. Co. v. Payne, 35 S. W. Rep., 297; Mutual, etc., Ins. Co. v. Baker, 10 Texas Civ. App., 523; Cunningham v. Austin, etc., Ry.

Co. v. Tobin, 56 S. W. Rep., 541; International, etc., Ry. Co. v. Branch, 56 S. W. Rep., 542.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-12\">It was error for counsel for plaintiff to repeatedly state, in the presence and hearing of the jury, that they offered to prove by the witnesses Steinebaugh and Fambrough' that he was acquainted with the general reputation of Freeman; that he was reckless in loading cotton at appellant\u2019s gin at the time when Crawford was injured. It was not material what was the expectancy of plaintiff\u2019s life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-13\">The court erred in refusing to permit the defendant to prove by Gladden that he made an affidavit which he (Gladden) knew at the time was willfully and deliberately false. Said Gladden having testified to material facts for the plaintiff, it was competent to impeach the witness by his mouth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-14\">The evidence in this case shows that plaintiff was a mere volunteer on the premises of the defendant, had no business there, and there was no invitation, either expressed or implied, to him to be upon said premises ; defendant owed him no duty except not to willfully and knowingly injure him. The court\u2019s charge assumed that he was lawfully on de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>fendant\u2019s premises by invitation, either implied or expressed, and that the defendant owed him the duty to exercise ordinary care, and failure so to do rendered it liable to him for damages.

T. Jones to testify as to what the expectancy of life of the plaintiff Crawford would be, for the reason that Dr. Burt testified, that it was reasonably probable that the plaintiff would suffer pain in the future from the fracture, and that the injured leg would never be as strong as the other, and plaintiff testified that his hurt leg was shorter than the other, and that in damp weather it hurts him. Gulf, C. <em>&amp; </em>S. F. Ry. v. Cooper, 8 Texas Ct. Rep., 288; Gulf, C. &amp; S. F. Ry. v. Mangham, 4 Texas Ct. Rep., 682.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-6\">The court did not err in refusing to permit the defendant to prove by the witness Gladden that an aEdavit which he made, he knew, at the time, was willfully and deliberately false, (1) because a witness can not be impeached by showing that he swore falsely to an immaterial matter; (2) because a witness can be impeached by evidence of his general reputation only, and not a particular fact. Sutor v. Wood, 76 Texas, 408; Johnson v. Brown, 51 Texas, 76.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-7\">The charge of the court is not erroneous in assuming that the plaintiff was on the premises of defendant company by invitation of defendant, express or implied, (1) because the uncontradicted evidence showed this; (2) because they saw him there, and saw his danger from their acts, and owed him the duty to exercise ordinary care, at least, not to injure him. Texas &amp; Pac. Ry. Co. v. Staggs, 90 Texas, 461.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b86-8\">EIDSON, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AKg\">This suit was brought in the court below by the appellee against the appellant, to recover damages for negligently injuring him (appellee), whereby his leg was broken. The case was tried before a jury, and resulted in a verdict and judgment for appellee in the sum of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are as follows;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>\u201c1.\u2014The court erred in permitting plaintiff\u2019s witness, Sol \"Dobson, to testify: T think it was Freeman. I am satisfied he was the boss man. He told me to drive around on the west side and back my wagon up, and I backed my wagon back. I didn\u2019t back it square back, but angling, and, just as I backed up, he thro wed down the skids into my wagon, and I saw he was going to pitch the bale of cotton into the wagon, and I said, \u201cHold up,\u201d and he said, \u201cStay there,\u201d and used a rough word, and I jumped out and it went corner-ways into my wagon, and it would have gone in between my horses, and I throwed up my hands, and it went out and sorter glanced against the right forewheel of my wagon.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-3\">\u201c2.\u2014It having been shown that Sol Dobson\u2019s wagon was in a different position, and a different kind of wagon from that of Gladden\u2019s, and a different bed, the court erred in refusing to exclude this evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">There was no error in the admission of the testimony complained of in these assignments of error. Appellee having alleged in his petition that appellant\u2019s system of loading cotton was dangerous, and that such system was known to appellant and its servants to be dangerous, testimony _ showing that, prior to the occasion when appellee was injured, appellant used the same system or method of loading cotton as was used when the appellee received his injuries, and that the use of such system on such prior occasion was attended with danger to a person whose cotton was being loaded, or would have resulted in danger to such person had he remained in the situation he wa's required or expected to remain in during the progress of the loading of a bale of cotton by such method or system, tended to prove these issues. And the testimony of this witness, to the effect that Freeman, on the occasion testified about, was in charge of the employes of appellant, and conducting the loading, and the testimony showing that the said Freeman was also in charge of such employes while loading the bale of cotton on the occasion when appellee received his injuries, tended to show that Freeman knew the system he was using to be dangerous. This testimony was also admissible, in view of the testimony of appellant\u2019s general manager to the effect that the system used at the time of the injury to plaintiff was the same used prior thereto, and appellant had never had an accident before this one. The fact that the wagon of the witness Dobson was in a different position, and a different kind of wagon to that appellee was in at the time he received his injuries, would not affect the admissibility of the testimony, but might its weight, which was a matter for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">There was no error in the action of the court complained of in appellant\u2019s third assignment of error. There was nothing improper in counsel for appellee stating to the court what he could prove in answer to the questions propounded to certain witnesses, which questions the witnesses were not permitted by the court to answer, as this was necessary in order to secure a proper bill of exceptions to the action of the court, and the jury were properly informed by the court that the statements of counsel could not be considered as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled. What the expectancy of the life of appellee would be was material, and it was admissible, in view of the evidence of the witness Dr. Burt, who testified that it was reasonably probable that appellee would suffer pain in the future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>from the fracture, and that the injured leg would never be as strong as the other; and also in view of the testimony of appellee to the effect that the injured leg was shorter than the other, and that it pained him in damp weather.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">There was no error in the action of the court complained of in appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error. It is not competent to impeach a witness by proof that he has testified falsely to an immaterial or collateral matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Appellant\u2019s sixth and seventh assignments of error are overruled. The uncontroverted evidence showing that appellee was on the premises of appellant by its invitation, the court did not err in assuming, in its charge, such fact. Appellant\u2019s business was to gin and bale cotton for the public, and, when ginned and baled, to load the bales on the wagons of its customers. The uncontroverted testimony shows that Gladden had a bale of cotton at the appellant\u2019s gin which it had ginned for hire, and that, at the request of Gladden, appellee went to the gin with him to receive it. Appellee was told where to drive Gladden\u2019s wagon to receive the bale of cotton. All of the employes saw him there, and loaded the cotton in the wagon as he backed it up.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Appellant\u2019s other assignments of error complain of various paragraphs of the court\u2019s charge, and the refusal of the court to give certain special charges requested by it. We have carefully considered all of these assignments, and are of opinion none of them is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The charge of the court is an able, clear and full enunciation of the principles of law applicable to the issues raised by the pleadings and evidence, and properly guarded and protected every right of the appellant. We find that the testimony in the record is sufficient to support the allegations of negligence against appellant contained in appellee\u2019s petition, and that the testimony is insufficient to show contributory negligence upon the part of appellee, as alleged in appellant\u2019s answer, and that the amount of the verdict of the jury and judgment of the court below is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">There being no reversible error pointed out in the record, the judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
