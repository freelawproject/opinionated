C. Vawter, Ida Deeper and her husband, J. A. Deeper, for the purpose of recovering the title to and possession of lot number 12 in block number 21, in the town of Deonard, in Fannin County, Texas. Appellant also alleged in his petition that the deed from C. C. Vawter and wife to Ida Deeper of date October 16, 1896, was voluntary and without consideration and made for the purpose of hindering, delaying and defrauding the creditors of C. C. Vawter and especially appellant, of which purpose said Ida Deeper was fully cognizant at the time such conveyance was made, and that said deed is a cloud upon the title of appellant; appellant prayed that the same be declared fraudulent and void, and that it be set aside and held for naught.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Appellees, except C. C. Vawter, answered by general demurrer, general denial and plea of not guilty, and appellee Ida Deeper further answered that the deed executed to her of date October 16, 1896, was made in good faith for the bona fide purpose of paying her a just debt, which said C. C. Vawter then owed her in amount equal to the property so conveyed; that the property was the business homestead of C. C. Vawter at that date, and prayed that appellant take nothing by its suit, and that she be quieted in her title to said premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">C. C. Vawter filed a disclaimer and prayed to be discharged with his costs. The case was tried before a jury and the court submitted special issues to the jury, and upon the answers made thereto, the court entered judgment for appellees Ida Deeper and J. A. Deeper for the lot in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error complains of the action of the court in excluding the certified copy of the depositions of C. C. Vawter and his wife, which were taken in the case of Parlin &amp; Orendorff Company v. C. C. Vawter, et al, number 15373 in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas, which depositions show that C. C. Vawter and his wife used and occupied 80 acres of land situated four miles west of Deonard for a period of nearly twenty years prior to the failure of the said Vawter on October 15, 1896, as their homestead, and that it had all that time been their homestead. Appellants\u2019 contention being that said depositions were links in the chain of its title, and were declarations of Vawter and his wife as to their homestead at the time of his failure, and for a period of twenty years prior thereto. In our opini\u00f3n the court below did not err in excluding said depositions. Ida Deeper not being a party to the suit in which said depositions were taken, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>would be but hearsay, <em>res inter alios acta, </em>as against her, and therefore not admissible. (People\u2019s Nat. Bank v. Mulkey, 94 Texas, 395; Stephens v. Johnson, 45 S. W. Rep., 328; Wallace v. Berry, 83 Texas, 328.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\">By its second assignment of error appellant complains of the action of the court in giving to the jury special charge number 1, requested by appellees, which is as follows: \u201cYou will exclude from your consideration the recitals in the verdict and the judgment rendered in the District Court of Dallas County, concerning what the court in that case adjudged to be the homestead of said Yawter and wife, because what took place in that case in Dallas County is not admissible evidence as to the homestead question now involved in this suit you are trying, such records were not admitted by the court in the present case- as being any evidence on the homestead question involved in this suit.\u201d The judgment of the District Court of Dallas County, so far as it decreed title to appellant in the lot in controversy was admissible, but the recitals in that judgment establishing the homestead of Yawter and wife could only affect the parties to that suit; and although there is in this ease the issue as to what constituted the homestead of said Yawter and wife at the date of the deed by C. C. Yawter to Ida Deeper, still, she not being a party to that suit, she could not be affected by the recital in that judgment as to the homestead; and therefore such recital was inadmissible as against her. (Hardin v. Blackshear, 60 Texas, 132.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is not in compliance with the rules of this court, and therefore will not be considered. The assignment raises several independent and distinct matters and for that reason, does not conform to said rules. (Cochran v. Siegfried, <em>75 </em>S. W. Rep., 542; Baum v. Corsicana Nat. Bank, 75 S. W. Rep., 863; Wren v. Howland, 75 S. W. Rep., 894; Cammack v. Rogers, 74 S. W. Rep., 945.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error contends that the court erred in entering judgment for appellees upon the special findings of the jury, because said findings are inconsistent and contradictory and contrary to the charge of the court, in that to question number 1, which is as follows: \u201cWas the property in controversy the business homestead of C. C. Yawter on October 16, 1896 ?\u201d the jury answered \u201cYes.\u201d To question number 4, which is as follows: \u201cDid C. C. Yawter abandon his homestead in the country, if so, at what date ?\u201d the jury answered, \u201cRp,\u201d The jury in answer to question number 3, submitted to them by the court, which was as follows: \u201cWas the deed from C. C. Yawter and wife to Ida Deeper made in good faith, or was it fraudulent as to C. C. Yawter\u2019s creditors ?\u201d found that the deed to Ida Deeper was made in good faith. If the deed to Ida Deeper was made in good faith and not fraudulent, the title to the lot in controversy vested in her prior to the levy of the appellant\u2019s attachment; and hence was not subject to such attachment, and that being true, it was immaterial as to whether the property conveyed was homestead or not at that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error is not in compliance with the rules of this court, because same is not supported by any statement, and therefore, it will not be- considered. (Galveston, H. &amp; S. A. Ry. Co. v. Pruente, 70 S. W. Rep., 362; Chimine v. Baker, 75 S. W. Rep., 330; Raywood Rice Canal <em>&amp; </em>Milling Co. v. Langford Bros., 74 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>W. Rep., 926.) However, we are of opinion that the court below did not err in refusing to give to the jury appellant\u2019s special charge number 4, because the issue to which it relates was fully covered by the general charge, and a special charge given at the request of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\">There being no reversible error pointed out in the record, the judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
