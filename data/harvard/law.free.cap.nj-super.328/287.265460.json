The two dogs were observed by defendant as they were standing over a deer carcass approximately 118 feet away. Defendant asserted that the shepherd aggressively began running toward him and in an act of self-defense, he shot the dog, apparently wounding him. He then looked in the direction of the retriever and observed the dog growling; whereupon, he shot that dog as well. After defendant reloaded his weapon, he heard the shepherd whimpering, and possibly suffering, so he proceeded to fire a second shot at that dog killing it. Defendant claimed that he did not know the dogs were pets but thought they were coyotes or wild dogs. He further claimed that he felt that his life and safety were in jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">After receiving a call from the caretaker of the hunting property and initially denying any knowledge of the dead dogs, defendant contacted the Branchburg Police Department where he voluntarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>gave a statement setting forth his version of the facts. Thereafter, defendant was charged with six separate offenses: two counts of the disorderly persons offense of needlessly killing an animal, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:22-17(a); two counts of injury to property while hunting, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>23:7-3; and two counts of the penalty offense of needlessly killing an animal, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:22-26(a). He was convicted of all offenses in the Union Township Municipal Court, and after a trial <em>de novo </em>was again convicted in the Superior Court, Law Division. As to the disorderly persons offenses, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:22-17(a), defendant was sentenced on each count to a fine of $500, a fifteen day suspended county jail sentence and thirty days of community service together with court costs. Under the penalty provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:22-26(a), defendant was sentenced on each count to a civil penalty of $250 together with court costs. Finally, under the penalty provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>23:7-3, defendant was sentenced on each count to a penalty of $1,000, court costs and a revocation of his hunting license for a period of five years. Defendant appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">On appeal, defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">POINT I THE LAW DIVISION ERRED UPON [sic] THE CREDIBILITY DETERMINATIONS OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT JUDGE, AND THIS COURT SHOULD THEREFORE MAKE INDEPENDENT FINDINGS OF FACT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">POINT II FACTUAL FINDINGS BELOW ON THE SEQUENCE AND MANNER OF THE SHOOTINGS WERE ERRONEOUS AND CLEARLY AGAINST THE EVIDENCE, AND MUST BE SET ASIDE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">POINT III THE LOWER COURTS APPLIED THE WRONG STANDARD IN DETERMINING WHETHER DEFENDANT\u2019S CONDUCT FELL WITHIN THE STATUTORY PROVISIONS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">POINT IV THE VERDICTS WERE AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">POINT V THE MUNICIPAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN REFUSING TO ADMIT DEFENDANT\u2019S PROFFER OF EXPERT TESTIMONY ON \u201cWORRYING.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">POINT VI THE SENTENCES IMPOSED WERE EXCESSIVE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">We have carefully reviewed the record and conclude that defendant\u2019s arguments are without merit. We note that Points I, II, and IV all address the judge\u2019s consideration of the evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>credibility findings and weight of the evidence. Our review of such issues is limited to determining if the findings of fact \u201c \u2018could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 471, 724 A.2d 234 (1999) (quoting <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162, 199 A.2d 809 (1964)). We find that this standard was met in this case, and the record supports the findings. We offer some additional comments regarding Points III, V and VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Defendant urges that he was justified in killing the dogs not merely if he did so in self-defense but also \u201cif he had a reasonable belief that they were chasing, worrying, wounding, destroying, chasing after, or even barking at his person or his property,\u201d relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bunn v. Shaw, </em>3 <em>N.J. </em>195, 69 A.2d 576 (1949). Defendant claims that <em>Bunn </em>supports his justification defense based on the dog\u2019s barking. Defendant\u2019s reading of both the statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:19-9,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>Bunn </em>are too expansive. There must be more than a dog\u2019s barking to justify the killing; but more importantly, both the Municipal Court judge and the Superior Court judge properly assessed whether the \u201cthreat\u201d to defendant and defendant\u2019s reaction thereto were reasonable under the described circumstances. Both found defendant\u2019s conduct to be excessive, and our review of the record does not warrant a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The term \u201cworrying\u201d was defined in <em>Bunn </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">\u201cWorry\u201d as used in statutes providing that one may destroy a dog worrying sheep means \u201cto run after; to chase; to bark at.\u201d Such is the meaning given to the word by courts of cattle raising states such as Colorado and Wisconsin. <em>In re: Failing v. People, </em>[105 <em>Colo. </em>399,] 98 P.2d 865 (Colo.); <em>Bass v. Nofsinger, </em>[222 <em>Wis. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>480,] 269 <em>N.W. </em>303 (Wis.); both cases citing 8 <em>Words and Phrases, 1st Series, </em>p. 7526; 45 <em>Words and Phrases </em>(Perm.Ed.) p. 541.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\"><em>[Bunn, supra, </em>3 <em>N.J. </em>at 198, 69 A.2d 576.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">We hold the law to be that a landowner has no right to kill a dog which is merely trespassing but he may humanely destroy a dog under circumstances giving rise to a reasonable belief that the dog is chasing, worrying, wounding or destroying stock or domestic animals, his person, his property, or that of other persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">[Id. at 200, 69 A.2d 576.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">We recognize that to the extent <em>Bunn </em>includes the definition of \u201cworrying\u201d within the scope of conduct permitting the destruction of a dog \u201cworrying\u201d one\u2019s person, then such conduct must rise to the level that involves <em>defense </em>of one\u2019s person. To construe the statute as broadly as that suggested by defendant would equate, for example, the impact of a barking dog on farm stock with the impact of the same barking on a human being. We conclude that neither the Legislature in its enactment of the statute nor the Supreme Court in <em>Bunn </em>intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Closely related to this issue is the Municipal Court judge\u2019s refusal to allow defendant\u2019s expert, Dr. Beebe, to testify as to her definition of the term \u201cworrying\u201d as it is used in the statute. We find no error in the judge\u2019s refusal to allow Dr. Beebe to testify as to whether the dogs\u2019 conduct amounted to \u201cworrying.\u201d Neither the word nor its definition is so obscure or ambiguous as to require the assistance of an expert for clarification or definition. \u201cWorrying\u201d is more than simply barking. \u201cWorrying\u201d is defined as \u201charassing] by tearing, biting, or snapping, especially at the throat\u201d; \u201cassail[ingj with rough or aggressive attack or treatment\u201d; or \u201cseizing an animal with the teeth and shaking it so as to kill or injure it.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2636-37 (1981). The term is recognized in common legislative usage as a standard in animal control and protection statutes in other jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g., Cal. Civ.Code </em>\u00a7 3341 (West 2000); <em>Cal.Penal Code </em>\u00a7 597b (West 2000); <em>Colo.Rev.Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 35-43-126 (West 1999); <em>Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 22-358 (West 1999); <em>Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. </em>tit. 12, \u00a7 7501 (West 1999); <em>N.D. Cent.Code </em>\u00a7 36-21-10 (1999); <em>People v. Superior Court, </em>201 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>1061, 247 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>647, 648, 652 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>1030, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>838, 102 L.Ed.2d 970 (1989); <em>Shirley v. State, </em>254 <em>Ga. </em>723, 334 S.E.2d 154, 155 (1985); <em>Holden v. Schwer, </em>242 <em>Neb. </em>389, 495 <em>N.W.2d </em>269, 271 (1993); <em>Trautman v. Day, </em>273 N.W.2d 712, 713-15 (N.D.1979); <em>Munyon v. Moe, </em>46 Wis.2d 629, 176 <em>N.W.2d </em>324, 326-28 (1970). We find no abuse of the judge\u2019s discretion in his refusal to admit Dr. Beebe\u2019s proffer as to \u201cworrying,\u201d as there was no need for her definition or description of such conduct. That issue was for the trial judge and was correctly determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Finally, we disagree with defendant that the killings were a single offense for which one license suspension was sufficient. Two separate pets were slain belonging to two separate owners. These were different offenses, and two suspensions were appropriately imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-9\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:19-9 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">A person may humanely destroy a dog in self defense, or which is found chasing, woriying, wounding or destroying any sheep, lamb, poultry or domestic animal.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
