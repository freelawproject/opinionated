He claims \u201cto have an exclusive right to sell certain merchandise\u201d in the condominium complex. Amir appeals from an order entered on June 19, 1998, granting summary judgment in favor of defendants, and declaring \u201cthat all covenants contained in the individual unit Deeds to Units R25 and R26 in the Ocean Club Condominium which purport to restrict, prohibit or in any other way limit the owners, successors and/or assigns of said units right to conduct the business of its choice therein, be and are hereby stricken[.]\u201d The order further \u201cstrikes\u201d \u201cany covenants in any of the individual unit deeds in any of the commercial units of the Ocean Club Condominiums which purport to restrict, prohibit or in any other way limit the owners, successors and/or assigns of Unit R-25 and R-26 from conducting the business of their choice in said units.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">On his appeal, plaintiff Amir contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because \u201crestrictions and covenants contained in individual condominium units\u2019 deeds are enforceable,\u201d even if \u201cthey were not included in the condominium\u2019s master deed,\u201d and that the trial judge \u201cerred by concluding\u201d that plaintiff lacked standing to assert his contentions and in granting summary judgment.'</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Defendant Albert Gardner, the chief officer of MLM Associates, the condominium developer, also appeals from the same judgment. He argues that \u201cthe unit deed restrictions are valid and enforceable\u201d even though not set forth in the master deed or public offering statement, that MLM has standing to enforce them, and that the restrictions are \u201csufficiently clear to be enforceable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">We affirm the order granting summary judgment substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge L. Anthony Gibson in his opinion of August 12, 1998,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reported at 328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>141, 744 A.2d 1233, with the following caveat.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The trial judge concluded that plaintiff did not have standing because \u201cthe negative restrictions Amir seeks to enforce involve prohibitions on sales that are contained in the D\u2019Agostino deed\u201d and those restrictions in the individual deed are only for the \u201cbenefit of the Sellers, its successors and assigns.\u201d 328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 152, 744 A.2d 1233. The D\u2019Agostinos acquired unit R-26 from the Fernicolas, and the D\u2019Agostinos thereafter rented that unit to Brenda Goldstein who is selling the women\u2019s clothing from which plaintiff believes he is entitled to protection. The judge believed that as the Fernicolas were the sellers, only they and their successors in title would be entitled to enforce the covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">On the other hand, the condominium developer is also seeking to enforce the restrictions. It \u201cstill retains at least one unit\u201d in the condominium complex and \u201casserts that it intended to and did, in fact, create a neighborhood scheme via the restrictions and covenants incorporated in the individual unit deeds to the commercial units.\u201d The endeavor by MLM to enforce a scheme of restrictions it created in individual deeds may avoid plaintiffs need to show standing because the Fernicolas acquired their unit, subject to the restrictions, from the developer, although plaintiff is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>not in the chain of title of the Femicolas (or defendants D\u2019Agostino from whom defendant Goldstein leased her unit). Plaintiff is, of course, in a separate chain of title of the same developer who joins plaintiff in asserting that a \u201cneighborhood scheme\u201d was created for the protection of owners like plaintiff, through restrictions placed in the individual unit deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Because we agree with Judge Gibson that the restrictions, on the specific use of the commercial units, must be \u201cplaced within the master deed [or an amended master deed], at least when created by the developer,\u201d 328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 156, 744 A.2d 1233, we find it unnecessary to pass upon the standing issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\"> The August 12, 1998 opinion made some minor typographical and other non-substantive changes to the original opinion on which the earlier June 19, 1998 order was based.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
