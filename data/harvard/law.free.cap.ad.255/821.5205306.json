Memorandum: We conclude that justice requires that petitioner\u2019s corporate existence should not be terminated pursuant to section 486 of the Banking Law until a reasonable time has been afforded petitioner or its other stockholders to bring such action as they may be advised for an accounting by Marine Trust Company as liquidator. All concur, except Crosby, J., who dissents and votes for reversal and for granting the motion for dissolution, on the ground that respondents, notwithstanding the dissolution of the Commercial Trust Company, will be able to pursue any rights which they claim they have by suing individually, either as parties to the contract or as third party beneficiaries under said contract, as the ease may be, and the dissolution of the trust company should not be unnecessarily delayed. (The order grants a reference in a bank liquidation.) Present \u2014 Sears, P. J., Crosby, Lewis, Cunningham and Taylor, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
