The defendant contends that the trial court improperly determined that governmental immunity as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not shield it from liability and that the plaintiff had proffered sufficient evidence to establish that the defendant was negligent in maintaining its property. We disagree, and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>The trial court found the following pertinent facts. For many years, the defendant has owned and operated a public municipal golf course known as Western Hills Golf Course. A clubhouse building located on the course property contains a pro shop, locker rooms, restrooms and a restaurant called The Hills Restaurant (restaurant). On or about March 1, 2002, the plaintiff and two friends went to the restaurant to listen to guitarists who were performing there that night. The restaurant is a private establishment that serves meals and alcohol and provides entertainment for its customers. The defendant leases a portion of the clubhouse to the restaurant and under the terms of the lease, the defendant is responsible for maintaining the common areas of the clubhouse that permit access to the restaurant. In 2002, the restaurant paid the defendant $29,060.16 in annual rent. The lease contains a clause that increases the restaurant\u2019s rent each year, and by the time of the trial, the restaurant was paying the defendant rent of $30,852 per year. In addition to the restaurant, a second private entity leases a portion of the clubhouse and operates it as a pro shop. The rent required under this lease is $1 per year. The golf course is open, weather permitting, from April 15 until December 15 each year. Accordingly, on March 1, 2002, the golf course was closed and the clubhouse was being used only for the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">After listening to the musical performance, the plaintiff and his two companions left the restaurant. Before exiting the clubhouse, however, one of the plaintiffs companions stopped to use the restroom while the plaintiff waited in the clubhouse\u2019s common entryway. The plaintiff stood near the exit door, adjacent to which was a glass window panel, sometimes called a \u201clite\u201d or sidelite, which was approximately eighteen to twenty-four inches wide and extended from the floor to the top of the door. While the plaintiff was waiting, his leg collapsed or, in his words, \u201cgave out,\u201d and he fell against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>the window panel, which shattered as he fell into it and onto the floor. As a result, he received multiple cuts and abrasions from glass shards and slivers as well as some general soreness and emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The plaintiff thereafter brought the present action against the defendant to recover for the injuries he sustained from his fall into the sidelite. In his one count amended complaint, he alleged that the defendant was negligent in one or more of the following ways: improperly installing or maintaining the window panel; failing to install shatterproof glass; failing to install the proper glass in an area of ingress and egress as required by the state building code; and failing to warn the plaintiff that the glass was installed improperly and could shatter. In addition, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant was liable for its negligence under \u00a7 52-557n. In its answer, the defendant denied it was negligent and alleged a special defense that it was not liable for the plaintiffs injuries under the doctrine of governmental immunity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">After a trial to the court, the defendant was found liable for the plaintiffs injuries suffered as a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence. In rejecting the special defense of governmental immunity, the trial court determined that the defendant could be held hable under \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (B) because the defendant derives a special corporate profit or pecuniary benefit from renting a portion of the clubhouse to the restaurant. Specifically, the trial court concluded that the defendant received a pecuniary benefit from the receipt of more than $29,000 in annual rent from the restaurant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>Turning to the issue of the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence, the trial court found that, although the building code did not require the defendant to replace the type of glass used in the sidelite because construction of the clubhouse predated the applicable building code provisions, the defendant nevertheless was negligent in failing to replace it. The trial court credited the testimony of the plaintiffs expert engineer, who opined that the defendant failed to maintain the building properly and in a safe condition by not replacing the existing glass with a safer type of glass. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The defendant first contends that the trial court improperly determined that it was not immune from liability for its allegedly tortious conduct. Specifically, the defendant contends that its maintenance of the golf course and clubhouse is a governmental function. In addition, the defendant claims that it is not deriving a special corporate profit or pecuniaiy benefit from the rental of a portion of its clubhouse building to the restaurant because the rental income is applied to maintenance expenses for the property. The defendant particularly takes issue with the trial court\u2019s focus on the rental income from the restaurant without viewing it as part of the defendant\u2019s overall operation of the golf course. Finally, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly failed to find that the maintenance of the clubhouse building was a discretionary function, which precludes its liability for the plaintiffs injuries under \u00a7 52-557n (a) (2) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">In response, the plaintiff claims that the trial court properly determined that the defendant was liable under \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (B). The plaintiff claims that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>considerable portion of the clubhouse was used as a source of revenue for the defendant, and, thus, the defendant should be liable for its negligent acts that are inextricably linked to this rental property. The plaintiff further argues that the defendant should be held hable in the present case because its negligence was related to the condition of the common entry way to the leased property. In addition, the plaintiff claims that the trial court correctly determined that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Carta </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>108 Conn. 697, 702, 145 A. 158 (1929), precludes the defendant from arguing that it does not receive a pecuniary benefit because it reinvests the rental income into the maintenance of the clubhouse and golf course. Moreover, the plaintiff contends that the trial court properly determined that it need not consider the expenses related to the operation of the golf course because it was the defendant\u2019s failure to maintain in a reasonably safe manner the entryway to the clubhouse that caused the plaintiffs injuries. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">The issue of whether the defendant is immune under \u00a7 52-557n from the injuries caused by its negligent maintenance of the entryway of the clubhouse presents a question of statutory interpretation, and, thus, our review is plenary. See, <em>e.g., Kinsey v. Pacific Employers Ins. Co., </em>277 Conn. 398, 404, 891 A.2d 959 (2006). \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> directs us first to consider the text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">In accordance with \u00a7 l-2z, we turn first to the text of \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, a political subdivision of the state shall be liable for damages to person or property caused by . . . (B) negligence in the performance of functions from which the political subdivision derives a <em>special corporate profit </em>or <em>pecuniary benefit </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute does not define the phrases \u201cspecial corporate profit\u201d and \u201cpecuniary benefit.\u201d \u201cIn the absence of a statutory definition, words and phrases in a particular statute are to be construed according to their common usage. . . . To ascertain that usage, we look to the dictionary definition of the term.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chatterjee </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>277 Conn. 681, 690, 894 A.2d 919 (2006); General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). Construing these two phrases according to their common usage, nevertheless, results in ambiguity. Even if we put aside the modifier \u201cspecial corporate\u201d in the phrase, \u201cspecial corporate profit,\u201d the term profit itself is susceptible to multiple common meanings. For example, profit commonly can mean either revenue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>excess of expenses or more generally an advantage, benefit, gain or valuable return. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1993). The second phrase is also susceptible to multiple meanings because \u201cpecuniary benefit\u201d commonly means a \u201cbenefit capable of monetary valuation\u201d; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999); and a benefit commonly can mean an advantage, privilege, profit, or gain. Id. Accordingly, we conclude that the text of \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) fails to yield a plain and unambiguous answer to the question of whether the defendant derives either a special corporate profit or pecuniary benefit from the lease of a portion of the clubhouse to the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Resort to the statute\u2019s legislative history is somewhat helpful, but not definitive, in resolving the meaning of \u201cspecial corporate profit\u201d and \u201cpecuniary benefit.\u201d Section 52-557n was enacted as \u00a7 13 of the Tort Reform Act of 1986, Public Acts 1986, No. 86-338 (act). This court has described the act as being \u201cdrafted in response to rapidly rising insurance rates, which, some believed, would be curtailed if tort liability could be limited and systematized. As finally enacted, the act represents a complex web of interdependent concessions and bargains struck by hostile interest groups and individuals of opposing philosophical positions.\u201d <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 185, 592 A.2d 912 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Although the legislative history of \u00a7 13 of the act provides no definition of \u201cspecial corporate profit\u201d or \u201cpecuniary benefit,\u201d it does suggest that these terms were drawn from the common law of municipal liability. Senator Richard B. Johnston, the proponent of the legislation in the Senate and chairman of the judiciary committee, described \u00a7 13 (a) of the act as \u201ccodify[ing] certain elements of common law liability as they apply to political subdivisions, by identifying three areas where liability exists. First, the negligent act within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>the [s]cope of employment or official duties. Second, negligence in the course of conduct involving profit or pecuniary benefit to that political subdivision. Third, the creation of a nuisance, except in those instances where a defective road or bridge case can only be brought under other existing statutes.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 29 S. Proc., Pt. 10, 1986 Sess., p. 3445. In contrast, subsection (b), which enumerated specific instances in which a municipality is immune from liability, was described as creating \u201cbrand new immunities to municipalities that were never there before . . . .\u201d 29 H.R. Proc., Pt. 22, 1986 Sess., p. 8088, remarks of Representative Robert F. Frankel. Although Senator Johnston\u2019s statement indicates that \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (B) was meant to codify municipal common-law liability, we cannot conclude that his interpretation was definitive because a number of other legislators generally viewed the municipal liability section of the act as either altering individuals\u2019 existing right to bring an action against a municipality, or, at the very least, as having an unclear impact on individuals\u2019 right to sue a municipality.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See 29 H.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>Proc., Pt. 16,1986 Sess., p. 5891, remarks of Representative Irving J. Stolberg (commenting, in support of amendment to strike out municipal liability sections, that \u201csacrifice of individual rights in [the sections of the bill dealing with municipal liability] is extremely extensive\u201d); 29 H.R. Proc., Pt. 22, 1986 Sess., p. 8108, remarks of Representative Michael D. Rybak (describing section on municipal liability as \u201can absolute mine field, an attempt to codify [200] years of municipal law and statute in probably two weeks\u201d); 29 H.R. Proc., Pt. 16, 1986 Sess., p. 5902, remarks of Representative David Lavine (Commenting, in support of the amendment to strike out municipal liability sections, that \u201cit may be that all this works the way the majority leader suggests that it might. And the word is might. It may be that it won\u2019t. But for sure tonight at five minutes after one, we don\u2019t know that answer.\u201d); 29 S. Proc., Pt. 10, 1986 Sess., p. 3482, remarks of Senator Anthony V. Avallone (Describing \u00a7 13 of the act as \u201ca section on municipal liability that I defy anybody in here to explain to me. . . . I\u2019ve been trying for two weeks to find municipal lawyers who understand it. And they can\u2019t.\u201d). These remarks may have been directed at the enumerated situations barring liability in \u00a7 13 (b) of the act, but this too is unclear from the context and substance of these remarks. We turn next to the common-law backdrop against which this section was enacted in an effort to determine whether the phrases \u201cspecial corporate profit\u201d and \u201cpecuniary benefit\u201d were meant to draw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>their meaning from and to codify the preexisting common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">At common law, a municipality was, under certain circumstances, immune from liability for the torts it committed. See, e.g., <em>Abbot </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>167 Conn. 143, 150 and n.2, 355 A.2d 68 (1974); <em>Carta </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>supra, 108 Conn. 701-702; <em>Hourigan </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>77 Conn. 358, 364-65, 59 A. 487 (1904). The source of this municipal immunity was the state\u2019s sovereign immunity. <em>Hourigan </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 364-65; see also 18 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d Ed. Rev. 2003) \u00a7 53.23, p. 380 (\u201crule of immunity for governmental acts and liability for corporate or proprietary acts is grounded in common-law sovereign immunity\u201d); 5 F. Harper, F. James &amp; O. Gray, Torts (2d Ed. 1986) \u00a7 29.6, p. 624 (municipal immunity \u201cwas commonly rationalized by saying that the municipality is the agent or representative of the state in performing governmental functions and so shares the state\u2019s immunity, but that it has no sovereignty or immunity of its own\u201d). This court explained in <em>Hourigan </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 364, that when the state performs its governmental function through an agent, \u201cthe agent cannot be sued for injuries resulting from a strict performance of the agency. In such case the act is regarded as the act of the [sjtate and not that of the agent, who is the mere instrument of the [sjtate and nothing more . . . .\u201d Similarly, a municipality is the agent of the state \u201cin the exercise of certain governmental powers . . . [and when] the [sjtate imposes upon an incorporated city the absolute duty of performing some act which the [sjtate may lawfully perform and pertaining to the administration of government, the city in the performance of that duty may be clothed with the immunities belonging to the mere agent of the [sjtate . . . .\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The common law also recognized that a municipality is not just restricted to acting as the agent of the state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>but may engage in acts for its own corporate benefit or for the benefit of its inhabitants. Id.; see also <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>129 Conn. 106, 109, 26 A.2d 592 (1942) (\u201cfunctions of a municipal corporation fall into two classes, those of a governmental nature, where it acts merely as the agent or representative of the state in carrying out its public purposes, and those of a proprietary nature, where it carries on activities for the particular benefit of its inhabitants\u201d). In this latter situation, the municipality \u201cis not clothed with [the state\u2019s] immunities and is hable to be sued for injuries inflicted through its negligence in the performance of such an act.\u201d <em>Hourigan </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 77 Conn. 364; see also 18 E. McQuillin, supra, \u00a7 53.23, p. 381 (\u201c[sovereign immunity protects sovereign governments, such as states, and municipalities when acting as agents of the state, but not municipal corporations acting on their own behalf\u2019); see generahy W. Williams, Liability of Municipal Corporations for Tort (1901) pp. 8-9. Thus, this court has stated that a municipality\u2019s immunity from liability for injuries applies only when it \u201cis engaged in the performance of a public duty for the public benefit, and not for its own corporate profit . . . .\u201d <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>96 Conn. 582, 588, 115 A. 11 (1921). Accordingly, the distinction between whether the municipality was acting in its governmental capacity, or in its corporate or proprietary capacity, was, under the common law, the litmus test for whether the municipality would be held liable for its negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">In determining whether a municipality\u2019s activity was proprietary in nature, this court, along with those of other jurisdictions, has examined whether the activity generated a <em>\u201cspecial corporate benefit </em>or <em>pecuniary profit </em>inuring to the municipality.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Carta </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>supra, 108 Conn. 702; accord <em>Hannon </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>106 Conn. 13, 17, 136 A. 876 (1927) (\u201ctest to apply is to ascertain whether the act or function has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>within it the <em>special corporate benefit or pecuniary profit </em>of the municipality affected\u201d [emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 96 Conn. 588 (municipality liable for negligent act committed while \u201cengaged in the performance of acts done in the management of its property or rights for its own <em>corporate benefit or profit </em>and that of its inhabitants\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Hourigan </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 77 Conn. 365 (municipality may be liable for acts done \u201cin the management of property or rights voluntarily held by them for their own <em>immediate profit or advantage as a corporation, </em>although inuring, of course, ultimately to the benefit of the public\u201d [emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]); 18 E. McQuillin, supra, \u00a7 53.23, p. 383 (\u201c[w]here the municipality\u2019s officers or servants are in the exercise of power conferred upon the municipality for its <em>private benefit or pecuniary profit, </em>and damage results from their negligence or misfeasance, the municipality is liable to the same extent as in the case of private corporations or individuals\u201d [emphasis added]); 5 F. Harper, F. James &amp; O. Gray, supra, \u00a7 29.6, p. 627 (one of most often invoked criteria for determining if municipality is operating in proprietary or governmental capacity is \u201cwhether the function is allocated to the municipality for <em>its profit or special advantage </em>or whether [it is] for the purpose of carrying out the public functions of the state without special advantage to the city\u201d [emphasis added]). The imposition of liability under \u00a7 52-557n on municipalities when they are engaged in a function from which they derive a \u201cspecial corporate profit\u201d or \u201cpecuniary benefit\u201d is nearly identical to municipalities\u2019 common-law liability for acts for their own \u201cspecial corporate benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>or pecuniary profit.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because \u201cthe legislature is presumed to be aware of prior judicial decisions involving common-law rules\u201d; <em>Chadha </em>v. <em>Charlotte Hungerford Hospital, </em>272 Conn. 776, 793-94 n.21, 865 A.2d 1163 (2005); see also 2BJ. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction (6th Ed. Singer 2000) \u00a7 50:01, p. 140 (\u201clegislature is presumed to know the common law before statute was enacted\u201d); and General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) directs that words or phrases that \u201chave acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law . . . shall be construed and understood accordingly,\u201d we conclude that the use of these phrases was an attempt to codify municipal common-law liability for acts performed in a proprietary capacity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Yale Diagnostic Radiology </em>v. <em>Estate of Fountain, </em>267 Conn. 351, 361, 838 A.2d 179 (2004) (concluding that General Statutes \u00a7 46b-37 [b] [2] codifies common-law rule that \u201cboth parents are primarily responsible for providing necessary goods and services to their children\u201d); <em>Gerrity </em>v. <em>R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>263 Conn. 120, 127, 818 A.2d 769 (2003) (observing that product liability act was designed in part to codify common law of product liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Having decided that \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (B) codifies the common-law rule that municipalities are liable for their negligent acts committed in their proprietary capacity, we must examine what the common law meant by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>phrases \u201cspecial corporate benefit\u201d and \u201cpecuniary profit.\u201d At the outset, we recognize that the distinction between a municipality\u2019s governmental and proprietary functions has been criticized as being illusory, elusive, arbitrary, unworkable and a quagmire. <em>Indian Towing Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>350 U.S. 61, 65, 76 S. Ct. 122, 100 L. Ed. 48 (1955) (calling governmental-proprietary distinction \u201cquagmire that has long plagued the law of municipal corporations\u201d); <em>Tadjer </em>v. <em>Montgomery County, </em>300 Md. 539, 546, 479 A.2d 1321 (1984) (remarking that \u201cdistinction between governmental and proprietary functions is sometimes illusory in practice\u201d); <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>East Montpelier, </em>161 Vt. 168, 177 n.3, 638 A.2d 561 (1993) (noting that its application of distinction has led to arbitrary results); 18 E. McQuillin, supra, \u00a7 53.02.10, p. 148 (calling modem distinction between municipality\u2019s dual functions elusive); W. Pro-sser <em>&amp; </em>W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 131, p. 1054 (observing that distinction \u201cis basically unworkable\u201d). Despite this criticism, Connecticut, like a minority of other jurisdictions,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> has not disavowed the application of this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">We begin with municipal activities that are <em>not </em>for a municipality\u2019s special corporate benefit or pecuniary profit. If a municipality is acting only as the \u201cagent or representative of the state in carrying out its public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>purposes\u201d; <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>supra, 129 Conn. 109; then it clearly is not deriving a special corporate benefit or pecuniary profit. Two classes of activities fall within the broader category of acting as the agent of the state: \u201c[1] those imposed by the [s]tate for the benefit of the general public, and [2] those which arise out of legislation imposed in pursuance of a general policy, manifested by legislation affecting similar corporations, for the particular advantage of the inhabitants of the municipality, and only through this, and indirectly, for the benefit of the people at large. . . . For example, the maintenance of the public peace or prevention of disease would fall within the first class; <em>Keefe </em>v. <em>Union, </em>76 Conn. 160, 166, 56 [A.] 571 [1903]; while the maintenance of a park system would fall within the second class.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hannon </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 106 Conn. 16; see also <em>Spitzer v. Waterbury, </em>113 Conn. 84, 87-88, 154 A. 157 (1931) (construction of storm water sewers is governmental function because it is part of duty imposed by state on municipality to maintain highways within its limits); <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>104 Conn. 283, 284, 132 A. 467 (1926) (use of municipal property as public park is governmental function because \u201ccontrol of public parks belongs primarily to the [s]tate and municipalities in operating and managing them act as governmental agencies exercising an authority delegated to them by the [s]tate\u201d). While the distinction remains clear with regard to the first class of activities, it becomes more difficult to discern in the second class of activities. For example, the second class of activities encompasses functions that appear to be for the sole benefit of a municipality\u2019s inhabitants, but nevertheless provide indirect benefits to the general public because the activities were meant to improve the general health, welfare or education of the municipality\u2019s inhabitants. See <em>Hannon </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 18 (operating swim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>ming pool was governmental function because it was for \u201ceducation of the people of the city in teaching them to swim and thus guarding their lives against the accident of drowning, promoting a most useful and beneficial form of exercise, and teaching cleanliness of habits of living and thus preserving their health\u201d); <em>Pope </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>91 Conn. 79, 81, 99 A. 51 (1916) (celebration of Independence Day was governmental function because its aim was to \u201cinstruct the people generally and to arouse and stimulate patriotic sentiments and love of country\u201d). The municipality may even charge a nominal fee for participation in a governmental activity and it will not lose its governmental nature as long as the fee is insufficient to meet the activity\u2019s expenses. See <em>Hannon </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 17-18 (charged small fee to use municipal pool, but fee did not cover maintenance expenses); see also <em>Couture </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>6 Conn.

When a municipality derives substantial revenue from its commercial use of municipal property, it has been considered nonetheless to be engaged in a proprietary function even if it reinvests that revenue back into the property\u2019s maintenance expenses or to pay down debt related to the property. See <em>Carta </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>supra, 108 Conn. 702 (if municipality is deriving revenue or profit from renting its property, fact that it is \u201capplied to the maintenance of the property and the reduction of the debt incurred in its construction or acquirement, or otherwise ultimately to the benefit of the public, is not sufficient to create the immunity\u201d); <em>Hourigan </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 77 Conn. 365 (municipality \u201cuses works constructed for the public benefit for its corporate profit, when the profits are to be applied to the maintenance of the works and the reduction of the debt incurred by the corporation in their construction\u201d); but cf. <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Kootsillas, </em>456 Mich. 615, 621, 575 N.W.2d 527 (1998) (if revenue generated from activity \u201cis used only to pay current and long-range expenses involved in operating the activity, this could indicate that the primary purpose of the activity was not to produce a pecuniary profit\u201d). Accordingly, it has been stated that a municipality is engaged in a proprietary function when it acts \u201cvery much like private enterprise . . . .\u201d W. Prosser &amp; W.

Accordingly, a municipality may be held hable if there is an \u201cinextricable link or inherently close connection\u201d between its neghgent act or omission and the rental of its property. <em>Martel </em>v. <em>Metropolitan District Commission, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 56 (municipality hable only if there is \u201cinextricable link or inherently close connection\u201d between alleged neghgence and municipality\u2019s operation of proprietary function); <em>Carta </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>supra, 108 Conn. 702 (municipality \u201cis responsible for its neghgent acts or omissions in connection with the property rented\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Turning to the present case, we conclude that the defendant can be held liable for the plaintiffs injuries because it was acting in its proprietary capacity when it leased a portion of the clubhouse to the restaurant and there is an \u201cinextricable link or inherently close connection\u201d; <em>Martel </em>v. <em>Metropolitan District Commission, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 56; between the defendant\u2019s allegedly neghgent maintenance of the sidelite in the clubhouse\u2019s entryway and the rental of the restaurant. By examining the character of the activity at issue, it is apparent that leasing a portion of a municipal building as a restaurant stands in stark contrast from those activities in which this court has determined that the municipality was acting as the state\u2019s agent for the direct or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>indirect benefit of the general public. See, e.g., <em>Spitzer </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 113 Conn. 87-88 (storm water sewers); <em>Vezina </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>106 Conn. 378, 379-81, 138 A. 145 (1927) (fire department); <em>Hannon </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 106 Conn. 17-18 (municipal swimming pool); <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 104 Conn. 283 (public park); see also <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Breeden, </em>134 N.C. App. 248, 253, 517 S.E.2d 171 (1999) (recounting other traditional governmental functions as including \u201coperation of jails, public libraries . . . and city garbage services\u201d). Rather, the leasing of a portion of a municipal building for a substantial rent to a private party to operate a business is an act that very much resembles private enterprise, and, accordingly, consistently has been determined to be a proprietary function. See <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>supra, 128 F.2d 299; <em>Olivers. Worcester, </em>supra, 102 Mass. <em>502; Stephenson </em>v. <em>Gamer, </em>supra, 136 N.C. App. 454; <em>Chupek </em>v. <em>Akron, </em>supra, 89 Ohio App. 266, 269; <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Soldiers &amp; Sailors Memorial Building, </em>supra, 65 Ohio App. 364-65; <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Grizzard, </em>supra, 205 Va. 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">In addition to the fact that the defendant\u2019s leasing of the restaurant is of a similar nature and character as private enterprise, it appears that the defendant was, <em>in fact, </em>deriving a pecuniary benefit from the lease. The defendant\u2019s acting deputy director of public works, Joseph A. Geary, testified that the proceeds of the lease were reinvested into a fund that is used to operate the golf course. Thus, the defendant received a pecuniary benefit from the lease because it was able to use the proceeds from the lease to offset its costs in maintaining the golf course.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, even if we were to assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>that the golf course is such an interrelated function to the restaurant that we must view its revenues and expenses in the aggregate, the fact that the revenue or profit derived from the commercial use of municipal property \u201cis applied to the maintenance of the property and the reduction of the debt incurred in its construction or acquirement, or otherwise ultimately to the benefit of the public, is not sufficient to create [governmental] immunity.\u201d <em>Carta </em>v. Norwalk, supra, 108 Conn. 702. We therefore conclude that the defendant\u2019s leasing of a portion of the clubhouse to the restaurant is a proprietary function.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Having concluded that leasing a portion of the clubhouse to be operated as a restaurant is a proprietary function, we next must consider whether there is an \u201cinextricable link or inherently close connection\u201d; <em>Martel </em>v. <em>Metropolitan District </em>Commission, supra 275 Conn. 56; between this function and the alleged negligent act \u2014 failing to maintain properly the window panel. The entryway where the plaintiff was injured was the main entrance to the clubhouse and one of two entrances by which a patron could access the restaurant. Further, the lease obligates the defendant to maintain the common areas of the building that provide access to the restaurant. Therefore, we conclude that there was an inextricable link and close connection between the defendant\u2019s negligent maintenance of the glass sidelite in the common entryway and the leasing of the restaurant portion of the clubhouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The defendant claims nonetheless that the maintenance of the clubhouse was a governmental function because this building was located on a municipal golf course, and a golf course, like a park or swimming pool, is a recreational facility that falls within the scope of a municipality\u2019s governmental functions. Even if we were to assume that the operation of a municipal golf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>course is a governmental function,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we cannot conclude that the fact that the restaurant is in a building located on a municipal golf course transforms an otherwise commercial function into a governmental one. First, the present case does not present a situation in which two municipal functions are so interrelated that the nature of each function cannot be analyzed independently. Indeed, the restaurant, in the present case, was operated independently of the golf course because it was open to the public even when the golf course was closed and its patrons, like the plaintiff, came there for reasons other than golf. Although many golfers likely patronized the restaurant before and after playing golf, it hardly can be said that the existence of a restaurant is essential to a functioning golf course. Second, the inquiry of whether the state\u2019s sovereign immunity extends to shield a municipality turns on the nature and character of the act and not its location. See <em>Hannon </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 106 Conn. 17 (whether function is governmental \u201cis determined from a consideration of the nature of the duty imposed or the privilege conferred, and of the character of the act done or the function performed\u201d); see also <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Palo Alto, </em>100 Cal. App. 2d 336, 341, 223 P.2d 639 (1950) (determining that operation of community theater was proprietary function despite its location within public park because \u201c[i]t is the nature of the activity, not its location . . . that determines its proprietary character\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The defendant also argues that it should not be held liable for its negligence because it is immune under \u00a7 52-557n (a) (2) (B) for negligent acts or omissions that require the exercise of judgment or discretion and that the maintenance of the common areas of the club<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>house was such a discretionary function.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We disagree. When a municipality is engaged in a governmental function, its immunity is restricted to discretionary acts and not ministerial acts. See <em>Heigl </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>218 Conn. 1, 4-5, 587 A.2d 423 (1991) (\u201c[A] municipality is immune from liability for the performance of <em>governmental acts </em>as distinguished from ministerial acts. . . . <em>Governmental acts </em>are performed wholly for the direct benefit of the public and are supervisory or discretionary in nature. . . . [MJinisterial acts are performed in a prescribed manner without the exercise of judgment or discretion . . . .\u201d [Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.]); accord <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 411 (\u201cunder the common law . . . both municipalities and their employees or agents have immunity from negligence liability <em>for governmental acts </em>involving the exercise of judgment or discretion\u201d [emphasis added]). Because we concluded that the defendant was engaged in a proprietary act and not a governmental act, the distinction between discretionary and ministerial acts does not apply. See <em>Adriance </em>v. <em>Standish, </em>687 A.2d 238, 241 (Me. 1996) (\u201c[i]n cases where the questioned conduct has little or no purely governmental content but instead resembles decisions or activities carried on by people generally, there is an objective standard for judgment by the courts and the doctrine of discretionary immunity does not bar the action\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, \u00a7 132, p. 1065 (generally no immunity for discretionary acts \u201cwhere governmental concerns are minimally involved and ordinary standards of safety can be applied\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly determined that it negligently had maintained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>clubhouse because the plaintiff proffered insufficient evidence to support this finding. The defendant concedes that it had a duty to the plaintiff, as an invitee, to inspect reasonably and maintain the clubhouse in order to render it reasonably safe. The defendant claims, however, that the plaintiff failed to proffer sufficient evidence to establish that the standard of care under the circumstances of the present case required it to replace the glass in the sidelite with a safer type of glass. In particular, the defendant asserts that the only evidence proffered by the plaintiff on this point consisted of references to federal regulations and the state building code, both of which did not apply to the clubhouse because they were adopted after it was built. In addition, the defendant claims that the plaintiff failed to introduce any evidence that the defendant had actual or constructive notice that the window panel was unsafe or hazardous. Rather, the defendant contends that it had no notice of the window\u2019s dangerous condition as supported by Geary\u2019s testimony that, in his twenty-six years of employment with the defendant\u2019s bureau of parks and recreation, he knew of no person that had been injured by coming into contact with the sidelite. In response, the plaintiff claims that it proffered sufficient evidence that the defendant had breached its duty because the building code was some evidence of the standard of care to which the defendant was required to conform its conduct. In addition, the plaintiff contends that the length of time that the sidelite existed in its defective condition was a sufficient basis from which the trial court could have found that the defendant had constructive notice. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The following testimony is relevant to the resolution of these claims. The plaintiffs expert witness, Michael E. Shanok, a consulting engineer specializing in forensics and safety, testified that, based on the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>stances relating to the plaintiffs injury, the glass installed in the sidelite next to the door was very likely annealed glass. Shanok further testified that, because this type of glass is not toughened in any way, it \u201cis by far the most easy to break among the various types of glass . . . .\u2019\u2019In addition, Shanok testified that there is a substantial risk of injury if one were to fall into annealed glass because it has a tendency to break into large, sharp shards of glass. He also explained in his testimony that placing a glass window panel next to an entryway door is recognized as an \u201cextremely hazardous location because people are constantly going one way or another through that set of doors, and the possibility of someone coming into contact with the [sidelite] is relatively high.\u201d He remarked that the use of annealed glass in a sidelite next to a door is more dangerous than using it in a window on a wall because there is greater likelihood that someone may come into contact with the sidelite as \u201ca person might mistake [it] for a door and push their hand against it thinking they\u2019re going to open a door . . . .\u201d Highlighting the risk of placing a glass sidelite next to an entryway door, Shanok testified that, although not applicable to the clubhouse,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the building code, enacted by the office of the state building inspector in approximately 1970, and the regulations of the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, promulgated in approximately 1980, both regard the entryway as a highly hazardous location and regulate the type of glass that can be used in this area. Shanok additionally testified that to reduce the risk of injury from such a hazardous condition, a building manager or landlord should engage in the process of risk management, \u201cwhich is simply the inspection of [its] premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>to locate hazards and deal with them so that you lessen the possibility of liability or accidents [on its] premises.\u201d Under the facts of the present case, Shanok testified that the risk posed by the sidelite could have been lessened by replacing the annealed glass in the panel with tempered, thermally toughened, or laminated glass because these types of glass are more difficult to break and, if they do break, they are less likely to cause lacerations because they break into small cubes. Accordingly, Shanok concluded that the sidelite next to the entryway door was not maintained properly by the defendant because the risk it posed should have been identified and mitigated by replacing the annealed glass with tempered, thermally toughened, or laminated glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Geary next testified that, as acting deputy director of public works and before that as acting director of the defendant\u2019s parks department, he was responsible for overseeing the clubhouse. He testified that he did not know the technical name for the type of glass that was used in the sidelite, but described it as \u201cregular\u201d glass. In addition, Geary testified that he had observed the shattered window on the night of the plaintiffs injuries and that the shards of glass appeared to be sharp and \u201cin smaller pieces than when safety glass would break.\u201d Geary further testified that an employee of the defendant\u2019s parks department visually inspected the clubhouse on a weekly basis, but that neither he nor any of his subordinates checked the building code regarding the type of glass to be used in an entryway. Geary also testified that, prior to the plaintiffs injury, the parks department\u2019s records did not indicate that anyone had injured themselves on the window panel and he did not recall in his twenty-six years of employment with the parks department that anyone had injured themselves on this sidelite. Finally, Geary testified that he had no knowledge that there was anything defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>with regard to this sidelite or that it was in any kind of damaged condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">As an initial matter, we note that \u201c[t]he standards governing our review of a sufficiency of evidence claim are well established and rigorous. . . . [W]e must determine, in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, whether the totality of the evidence, including reasonable inferences therefrom, supports the [trier\u2019s] verdict .... In making this determination, [t]he evidence must be given the most favorable construction in support of the verdict of which it is reasonably capable. ... In other words, [i]f the [trier] could reasonably have reached its conclusion, the verdict must stand, even if this court disagrees with it.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carrol </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>262 Conn. 433, 442, 815 A.2d 119 (2003). To the extent that the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s factual findings, we review such claims under our clearly erroneous standard of review. See <em>Edmands </em>v. <em>Cuno, Inc., </em>277 Conn. 425, 438, 892 A.2d 938 (2006). \u201cA court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous only in cases in which the record contains no evidence to support it, or in cases in which there is evidence, but the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 438-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">We turn first to the defendant\u2019s claim that the plaintiff failed to proffer sufficient evidence that the failure to replace the glass in the sidelite was a breach of the standard of care owed to the plaintiff. \u201cThe essential elements of a cause of action in negligence are well established: duty; breach of that duty; causation; and actual injury. . . . Contained within the first element, duty, there are two distinct considerations. . . . First, it is necessary to determine the existence of a duty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>and then, if one is found, it is necessary to evaluate the scope of that duty. . . . The existence of a duty is a question of law and only if such a duty is found to exist does the trier of fact then determine whether the defendant violated that duty in the particular situation at hand.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Maffucci </em>v. <em>Royal Park Ltd. Partnership, </em>243 Conn. 552, 566, 707 A.2d 15 (1998). Put another way, the question of what a reasonable person would have done under the circumstances is a question to be determined by the trier of fact, except where the individual\u2019s conduct \u201cclearly has or has not conformed to what the community requires, and that no reasonable [trier of fact] could reach a contrary conclusion.\u201d W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, \u00a7 37, p. 237; accord 2 Restatement (Second) Torts, Standard of Conduct, \u00a7 285, comment (g), p. 23 (1965) (\u201cjury must itself define the standard of the reasonable man with such particularity as is necessary to make it applicable to the facts of the case before it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">\u201cIn general, there is an ascending degree of duty owed by the possessor of land to persons on the land based on their entrant status, i.e., trespasser, licensee or invitee. ... A possessor of land has a duty to an invitee to reasonably inspect and maintain the premises in order to render them reasonably safe. ... In addition, the possessor of land must warn an invitee of dangers that the invitee could not reasonably be expected to discover.\u201d (Citations <em>omitted.)Morin </em>v. <em>Bell Court Condominium Assn., Inc., </em>223 Conn. 323, 327, 612 A.2d 1197 (1992). There is no dispute that the plaintiff, in the present case, was an invitee of the defendant, and, accordingly, the defendant had a duty to reasonably inspect and maintain the clubhouse in order to render it reasonably safe and to warn the plaintiff of dangers that he could not reasonably be expected to discover. Thus, to determine that the defendant breached this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>duty, the trial court had to find that the reasonable maintenance of the clubhouse to keep it reasonably safe required the defendant to replace the glass in the sidelite with a safer type of glass or to post a warning of the danger that the glass posed.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">This court previously has not had the opportunity to consider directly whether a building code, which technically does not apply to the defendant\u2019s premises, can nonetheless be considered as some evidence of the appropriate standard of care. The closest this court has come to considering this question was in the case of <em>Dinnan </em>v. <em>Jozwiakowski, </em>156 Conn. 432, 242 A.2d 747 (1968). In that case, the defendant claimed on appeal that the trial court improperly \u201cinstructed the jury with respect to [its] duty to the tenant \u2018when it refused to consider the standards established by the building code . . . Id., 434. Specifically, the defendant claimed that, the provisions of the New Haven building code, which were used in evidence during the examination of expert witnesses, \u201cmust be considered with respect to the standards of safety it sets up.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 436. This court determined that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury was not improper because the building code was not violated as it had been enacted after the building was erected. Id. Accordingly, we concluded that \u201cthe defendant certainly has no ground to complain of the court\u2019s charge that the evidence as introduced in this connection \u2018was for the purpose of testing the soundness of the opinions given\u2019 by the experts.\u201d Id. Thus, this court\u2019s decision in <em>Din-nan </em>precludes a jury instruction that a technically inapplicable building code must be considered as <em>the </em>standard of care, or, stated another way, a violation of this building code would not have constituted negligence per se.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See also <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Jablecki, </em>52 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>App. 379, 382-83, 726 A.2d 1164 (1999) (concluding that trial court properly directed verdict for defendant on plaintiffs negligence per se count based on building code violation because code did not apply to building that was erected prior to code\u2019s enactment). Although the question was not before this court, we did not reject the trial court\u2019s instruction that the building code could be considered in evaluating expert testimony regarding the standard of care.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>Although this court has not dealt directly with this question, the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>363 F.2d 973 (D.C. Cir. 1966), has considered whether such a building code could be used as some evidence of the standard of care. In that case, the plaintiff sought to recover for the injuries he sustained when he fell while walking over a vault, the covering of which was a part of the sidewalk. Id. The plaintiff alleged that he had tripped over a hinge of the covering that protruded approximately one inch above the sidewalk. Id. To establish the standard of care, the plaintiff attempted to introduce into evidence a pertinent section of the District of Columbia building code, which required that vault coverings be flush with the sidewalk. Id., 974. The trial court excluded this evidence because the vault was constructed prior to the adoption of the building code and it was not retroactive in its application. Id. On appeal, the court concluded that, even though the building code had not been violated, it \u201cwas evidence of a standard which the jury could consider in determining whether the defendants had exercised due care . . . .\u201d Id., 975. The court reasoned that \u201cthe officials with expertise and duty in the matter, decided that in the interest of safety such protrusions [from the vault coverings] should at least be prohibited in future construction. From this it follows that these safety provisions may appropriately be held competent, not in and of themselves as evidence of negligence, but as evidence of a standard by which the jury must measure the conduct of the defendants in determining whether they exercised that due care the law required in the situation.\u201d Id., 976; see also <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>InternationalHar-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number><em>vester Co., </em>691 F.2d 646, 651 (3d Cir. 1982) (concluding that, in products liability action, Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulation relating to tractor safety equipment, although not applicable because it was enacted after tractor was manufactured, supported finding that tractor was defective because it was missing this equipment); <em>Klein </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>409 F.2d 164, 166-67 (D.C.

This determination is buttressed by the similar conclusion of this court and courts of other jurisdictions that statutes, regulations, ordinances, and other safety codes can be considered as some evidence of the standard of care in analogous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>situations. For example, violations of regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration cannot be used as the grounds for a negligence per se instruction, but these regulations can be admitted into evidence as evidence of the standard of care because they will provide helpful guidance to the trier of fact. See <em>Wendland </em>v. <em>Ridgefield Construction Services, Inc., </em>184 Conn. 173, 181, 439 A.2d 954 (1981). Further, courts of other jurisdictions have allowed the trier of fact to consider regulations that prescribe safety standards as evidence of the standard of care even when the plaintiff was not within the class of individuals that the regulation was meant to protect. See <em>Koll </em>v. <em>Manatt\u2019s Transportation Co., </em>253 N.W.2d 265, 270 (Iowa 1977) (evidence of violation of Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulation is admissible evidence of negligence in action brought by plaintiff not covered by regulation); <em>Manchack </em>v. <em>Willamette Industries, Inc., </em>621 So. 2d 649, 652-53 (La.

Finally, courts generally have allowed voluntary safety codes to be considered as evidence of the standard of care. See, e.g., <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Yazoo Mfg. Co., </em>26 F.3d 81, 82-84 (8th Cir. 1994) (concluding that it was proper to admit into evidence, in personal injury action, American National Standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>Institute lawnmower safety standards to establish whether lawnmower\u2019s condition was unreasonably dangerous); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Cedar Rapids &amp; Iowa City Railways Co., </em>650 F.2d 159, 163 (8th Cir. 1981) (noting trend in federal and state court to admit advisory safety codes promulgated by government agencies, as well as industry, voluntary, or private safety codes as evidence of standard of care); <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad </em>v. <em>Talbert, </em>360 F.2d 286, 290 (1st Cir. 1966) (evidence of nonautho-ritative, nationally recognized standards concerning highway and railroad crossing design properly was admissible because it was \u201cone more piece of evidence upon which the jury could decide whether the defendant acted as a reasonably prudent person in the circumstances of this case\u201d); cf. <em>Landsiedel </em>v. <em>Buffalo Properties, LLC, </em>112 P.3d 610, 616-17 (Wyo. 2005) (trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to instruct that nonapplicable building code or industry standards constituted minimum standard of care, but trial court did allow plaintiff to present evidence of code and standards); but see <em>Wise </em>v. <em>Tidal Construction Co., </em>270 Ga. App. 725, 729, 608 S.E.2d 11 (2004) (trial court did not improperly exclude evidence of inapplicable, national building codes to illustrate standard of care).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Some authorities take the contrary view to <em>Curtis </em>and do not allow such budding codes to be considered as some evidence of the standard of care because they generally are concerned that a jury would likely misuse this evidence by treating any violation of such a code as negligence per se. See <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>supra, 363 F.2d 977-78 (Prettyman, J., dissenting) (concluding that evidence of regulation, which was inapplicable due to its adoption after construction of defendant\u2019s premises, should not be considered by jury because it would likely treat any violation of regulation as negligence per se, despite court\u2019s instruction to contrary); see also <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>161 N.W.2d 329, 330-31 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>(Iowa 1968) (determining that building code, which was not made retroactive, cannot be considered as standard of care with regard to building constructed before code\u2019s enactment because probative value of code was outweighed by risk that jury would be prejudiced by its admission); <em>Trimarco </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>56 N.Y.2d 98, 108, 436 N.E.2d 502, 451 N.Y.S.2d 52 (1982) (concluding that it was improper to admit statute, which required landlords to use certain type of glass in showers, because it risked prejudicing defendant and typical discretion to balance prejudice against relevancy was not applicable where other evidence of industry custom was available); <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Caprice, </em>96 N.J. Super. 539, 550-54, 233 A.2d 654 (App. Div.) (tenement statute regarding air shafts not admissible when prospective application only, thus not applicable to defendants\u2019 building; probative value outweighed by possibility of prejudice), cert. denied, 50 N.J. 409, 235 A.2d 901 (1967); cf. <em>Gubalke </em>v. <em>Estate of Anthes, </em>189 Neb. 385, 389, 202 N.W.2d 836 (1972) (concluding that ordinance regulating construction of fences was not relevant evidence of standard of care because it was enacted after defendant\u2019s fence was constructed and not made retroactive). Nevertheless, this concern is not implicated in the present case because the trial court, sitting as the trier of fact, explicitly stated, in its memorandum of decision, that there was no supportable claim of negligence per se because the clubhouse was built after the effective date of the building code.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the trial court properly considered the building code and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>federal regulations as <em>some </em>evidence of the standard of care because they reflected the collective experience and expertise of both the office of the state building inspector and the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission and what they believe to be the safe use of glass in entryways.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>We note moreover that the plaintiff did not rely solely on references to the building code and federal regulations in establishing the standard of care. Rather, the plaintiff also offered Shanok\u2019s expert opinion that the defendant failed to maintain properly the entryway to the clubhouse. His opinion was based on the following factors. First, the use of annealed glass in an entryway area was hazardous because it breaks easily and is likely to cause serious injury when it does break. Second, the window panel\u2019s size, extending from the floor to the top of the adjoining door, its location in an entryway, a high traffic area, and its position next to a door, where it could be mistaken for part of the door, increased the risk of someone being seriously injured. Third, the defendant could have identified the hazard posed by this condition by inspecting its property. Finally, the defendant could have mitigated this hazard by installing tempered, thermally toughened, or laminated glass. We therefore conclude that the plaintiff proffered sufficient evidence to establish that the defendant, by failing to replace the glass in the sidelite, did not reasonably maintain the clubhouse in a reasonably safe condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">We turn next to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly found that it was negligent because the plaintiff failed to present any evidence that it had actual or constructive notice of the sidelite\u2019s unsafe or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>hazardous condition.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This court previously has stated that, in the context of a negligence action based on a defective condition on the defendant\u2019s premises, \u201c[t]here could be no breach of the duty resting upon the defendants unless they knew of the defective condition or were chargeable with notice of it . . . .\u201d <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Drezek, </em>175 Conn. 230, 235, 397 A.2d 1335 (1978). In the present case, the plaintiff does not claim that the defendant had actual notice of the defective condition, but contends instead that the defendant had constructive notice.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cThe controlling question in deciding whether the defendants had constructive notice of the defective condition is whether the condition existed for such a length of time that the defendants should, in the exercise of reasonable care, have discovered it in time to remedy it.\u201d Id., 238-39. \u201cWhat constitutes a reasonable length of time is largely a question of fact to be determined in the light of the particular circumstances of a case.\u201d <em>Morris </em>v. <em>King Cole Stores, Inc., </em>132 Conn. 489, 494, 45 A.2d 710 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">In the present case, Shanok testified, and the defendant did not contest, that the hazard posed by the use of nontoughened glass in the sidelite could have been identified if the defendant had engaged in the process of risk management, \u201cwhich is simply the inspection of [its] premises to locate hazards and deal with them so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>that you lessen the possibility of liability or accidents [on its] premises.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In addition, there was testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>that the clubhouse was built in approximately 1962, and that the state building code and the Consumer Product Safety Commission regulations were enacted in 1970 and 1980, respectively. Thus, the defendant had at least twenty-two years from the time when various authorities recognized that nontoughened glass should not be used in an entryway to inspect its property to identify the hazard posed by the sidelite and remedy it or warn its invitees of that hazard. Compare <em>McCrorey </em>v. <em>Heilpern, </em>170 Conn. 220, 222, 365 A.2d 1057 (1976) (concluding that there was no reasonable basis for jury\u2019s finding of constructive notice because plaintiff proffered no evidence that defective condition existed for any period of time before plaintiffs injury), <em>White </em>v. <em>E &amp; F Construction Co., </em>151 Conn. 110, 113-14, 193 A.2d 716 (1963) (evidence that defective condition existed for two minutes before accident was insufficient to charge defendant with constructive notice), and <em>Gulycz </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., </em>29 Conn. App. 519, 522, 615 A.2d 1087 (concluding that trier of fact could not find constructive notice because plaintiff offered no evidence that defect existed for any period of time), cert. denied, 224 Conn. 923, 618 A.2d 527 (1992), with <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Zlotnick, </em>160 Conn. 341, 345, 278 A.2d 822 (1971) (concluding that there was sufficient evidence of constructive notice where defective condition of porch railing, which caused plaintiffs injuries, existed for at least two weeks), and <em>Kurti v.

Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiff proffered sufficient evidence from which the trial court properly could have found that the defendant had constructive notice of the hazard posed by the use of annealed glass in the entryway of the clubhouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">In this opinion NORCOTT, KATZ and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n (a) provides in relevant part: \u201c(1) Except as otherwise provided by law, apolitical subdivision of the state shall be liable for damages to person or property caused by . . .

This conclusion must be read in light of our standard of review to challenges of jury inst ructions in which this court \u201cmust adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . <em>[T\\he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a, court of last resort but whether it. fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vertex </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>278 Conn. 557, 572, 898 A.2d 178 (2006). Accordingly, we conclude that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Dinnan </em>is limited to the determination that the jury instruction fairly presented the case to the jury because it allowed them to consider the inapplicable building code to test the soundness of the expert\u2019s opinions regarding the applicable standard of care. As instructed, the jury was then able to view the standard of care as testified to by the plaintiffs expert in light of the standards set forth in the applicable provisions of the building code. Thus, while the <em>Dinnan </em>decision makes clear that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>conformance or noncoformance with the inapplicable building code was not dispositive of the plaintiffs negligence claim, the decision cannot be stretched to control the question of whether the trier of fact is prohibited from considering such a building code, in light of expert testimony, to arrive at the standard of care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b885-6\"> The dissent argues that evidence of the inapplicable building code was not relevant to the inquiry into whether the defendant was required to replace the glass in the sidelite in order to render the clubhouse \u201creasonably safe.\u201d The dissent reasons that the building code\u2019s prohibition of the use of annealed glass in only new construction reflects a determination that preexisting uses of such glass in entryways were not dangerous enough to warrant remediation. Accordingly, the dissent contends that the fact that the building code does prohibit the use of annealed glass in new construction \u201cdoes not reflect any definitive judgment of what is, and what is not, \u2018reasonably safe.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">We agree with the dissent that the building code in the context of the clubhouse does not pronounce a <em>definitive judgment </em>as to what is, and is not, \u201creasonably safe,\u201d because, as we discussed previously herein, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>inapplicable building code provision cannot be used to establish negligence per se. We do, however, believe that the building code does provide some relevant evidence of what is the reasonably safe use of glass in the clubhouse\u2019s entryway. The building code is jointly adopted and administered by the state building inspector and the codes and standards committee. General Statutes \u00a7 29-252 (a). The state building inspector is required to be a licensed architect or professional engineer with at least ten years of experience. General Statutes \u00a7 29-252 (b). Additionally, thirteen of the seventeen members of the codes and standards committee must include: two architects, three engineers, two builders or superintendents, one public health official, two building officials, two fire marshals, and one member of a national building trades labor organization. General Statutes \u00a7 29-251. Each of these members must also have ten years of experience in their respective fields. General Statutes \u00a7 29-251. The other four members are public members. General Statutes \u00a7 29-251. Thus, the building code reflects the reasoned judgment of numerous professionals with extensive relevant experience that in the interests of safety the use of annealed glass in the <em>entryway </em>of buildings should be prohibited in future construction. Prom this fact, a trier of fact reasonably could infer that the use of annealed glass in the entryway of a building constructed before the effective date of the code also poses a safety hazard. Indeed, it strains logic to interpret the inapplicability of this prohibition to prior construction as a determination that the use of annealed glass in the entryway of older buildings does not pose similar safety concerns. Such an interpretation is made even more doubtful in light of Shanok\u2019s testimony that if the glass in the clubhouse was not in a serviceable condition, it would need to be replaced in accordance with the building code. Accordingly, we conclude that Shanok\u2019s reference to the building code was relevant because it has a tendency to make it more probable than it would without this evidence that maintaining the clubhouse in a reasonably safe condition required replacing the annealed glass in the entryway.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b889-5\"> We note that a trial court presiding over a jury trial has wide discretion to exclude relevant evidence \u201cif its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or surprise, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury . . . Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-3; see also <em>State </em>v.

In addition, if the trial court admits such evidence, it can mitigate the concern that the jury will misuse such evidence by issuing a proper limiting jury instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b890-5\"> The dissent argues that, by permitting the inapplicable building code to be admitted as evidence of the standard of care, we are usurping the role of the drafters of the building code by requiring the owners of otherwise exempt premises to meet the standards set forth in the building code. We believe that the dissent misconstrues the reach of today\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">First, our conclusion that the inapplicable building code properly was considered as some evidence of the standard of care does not make owners of exempt premises subject to the building code\u2019s provisions. For example, the defendant, as the owner of the clubhouse, would not on the basis of today\u2019s decision become subject to any fines or other sanction as a result of using annealed glass in the clubhouse\u2019s entryway. See General Statutes \u00a7 29-254a (\u201c[a]ny person who violates any provision of the State Building Code shall be fined not less than two hundred nor more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than six months or both\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Second, we disagree with the dissent\u2019s view that our decision today signals that an owner of exempt property will be held negligent for failing to remodel his or her building to conform with otherwise inapplicable building code standards. As we have stated previously herein, the defendant had a duty \u201cto reasonably inspect and maintain the premises in order to render them reasonably safe.\u201d <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Bell Court Condominium Assn., Inc., </em>supra, 223 Conn. 327. The question of what constitutes reasonable maintenance is generally a fact intensive inquiry that will vary with the circumstances. Accordingly, it certainly could be the case that it would be unreasonable to require an exempt building owner to retrofit his or her building at great expense to comply with the present building code where the risk of injury from the existence of such a condition is proportionally not that great. See <em>Conway </em>v. <em>OBrien, </em>111 F.2d 611, 612 (2d Cir. 1940) (Judge Learned Hand noted three factors which determine standard of care owed in any given circumstance: \u201cthe likelihood that [the person\u2019s] conduct will iryure others, taken with the seriousness of the injury if it happens, and <em>balanced, against the interest which he must sacrifice to avoid the risk\u201d </em>[emphasis added]), rev\u2019d on other grounds by 312 U.S. 492, 61 S. Ct. 634, 85 L.

Gray, supra, \u00a7 16.9, p. 478 (\u201cif the risk is deemed reasonable in light of the disproportion of the cost to prevent it, it is thereby privileged in negligence law\u201d). Thus, today\u2019s decision cannot be read as establishing a negligence per se rule for nonconformance with inapplicable building code provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b892-6\"> The trial court did not make an explicit finding in its memorandum of decision that the defendant had actual or constructive notice of the defect that caused the plaintiffs injuries. Nevertheless, a finding of notice was implicit in the trial court\u2019s ultimate finding that the defendant was negligent in the maintenance of the sidelite. See <em>Giametti </em>v. <em>Inspections, Inc., </em>76 Conn. App. 352, 364, 824 A.2d 1 (2003) (despite lack of express finding of fact, implying from trial court\u2019s finding for plaintiff on merits of negligent misrepresentation claim that trial court found that plaintiff relied on misrepresentation because reliance is element of negligent misrepresentation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b892-7\"> The defendant claims that it lacked notice because it had no knowledge of any problems with the sidelite and that no one had been injured by the sidelite in the previous twenty-six years. This claim addresses solely the question of whether the defendant had actual notice \u2014 an issue the plaintiff concedes to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b893-5\"> The dissent contends that the plaintiff failed to establish constructive notice because he did not proffer evidence of how a reasonable inspection would have discovered that the glass in the sidelite was annealed glass. In particular, the dissent argues that because a visual inspection would not have revealed whether the glass was annealed glass or toughened glass and Geary testified that his review of the records and documents related to the clubhouse did not contain any information regarding the type of glass used in the sidelite, the plaintiff has failed to substantiate how a reasonable inspection would have discovered this defective condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">We disagree with the conclusion reached by the dissent because it fails to consider the evidence in light of the standard of review that is applicable to the defendant\u2019s claim. As we have stated previously herein, \u201c[w]e must determine, in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, whether the totality of the evidence, including reasonable inferences therefrom, supports the [trier\u2019s] verdict .... In making this determination, [t]he evidence must be given the most favorable construction in support of the verdict of which it is reasonably capable. ... In other words, [i]f the [trier] could reasonably have reached its conclusion, the verdict must stand, even if this court disagrees with it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carrol </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 262 Conn. 442. As we noted herein, Shanok testified that a landlord or building manager could have identified the defective condition posed by the sidelite through an inspection of the premises. Construing his testimony in the light most favorable to supporting the verdict, we believe that it supports a reasonable inference that a landlord or building manager could have identified the glass in the sidelite to not have been one of the toughened varieties of glass. Such an inference is further supported by the fact that the building was built before the building code and consumer product safety commission regulations required that toughened glass be used in entryways.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Further, the record contains no evidence to support the dissent\u2019s assertion that a visual inspection cannot distinguish between annealed and toughened glass. Nor do we believe that such a fact bears the hallmarks of accuracy and accessibility as to make it amenable to judicial notice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>251 Conn. 671, 702-703, 741 A.2d 913 (1999) (\u201c[f]acts may be judicially noticed which are so notorious that the production of evidence would be unnecessary, or which the judicial function supposes the judge to be familiar with, in theory at least, or which, although they are neither notorious nor bound to be judicially known, are capable of such instant and unquestionable demonstration, if desired, that no party wrould think of imposing a falsity on the tribunal in the face of an intelligent adversary\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Zayas, </em>195 Conn. 611, 614, 490 A.2d 68 (1985) (judicial notice may be taken of \u201cfacts which are capable of immediate and accurate demonstration by resort to easily accessible sources of indisputable accuracy\u201d). Indeed, the record would support an inference that visual inspection would reveal the distinction between these types of glass. Geary testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>that, although he did not know the technical name for the glass, he described the glass in the sidelite as \u201cregular\u201d glass. Because Geary conceded that his review of the clubhouse\u2019s records did not reveal the type of glass used in the sidelite, his description of the glass as \u201cregular\u201d could only have been made on the basis of a visual inspection. Geary\u2019s testimony that the glass in the sidelite was \u201cregular\u201d glass, viewed in the light most favorable to supporting the verdict, reasonably would support an inference that he meant that the glass in the sidelite was not one of the varieties of toughened glass.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b895-7\">ZARELLA, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A68\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. Although I agree with the conclusion of the majority in part I of its opinion that governmental immunity does not shield the defendant, the city of Waterbury, from liability, two reasons compel me to dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion in part II of its opinion that the plaintiff, Edward Considine, offered sufficient evidence to make out a prima facie case of negligence. First, the majority inappropriately affirms the use of an inapplicable building code as evidence of the standard of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.

I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s holding that the state building code is relevant evidence of the standard of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.

Code Evid. \u00a7 4-1; see also <em>Jewett </em>v. Jewett, 265 Conn. 669, 679, 830 A.2d 193 (2003) (\u201c[r]elevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). In the present case, the defendant owed the plaintiff \u201ca duty ... to reasonably inspect and maintain the premises in order to render them reasonably safe\u201d and to \u201cwarn [the plaintiff] of dangers that [he] could not reasonably [have been] expected to discover.\u201d <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Bell Court Condominium Assn., Inc., </em>223 Conn. 323, 327, 612 A.2d 1197 (1992). The primary issue is whether \u201cmaintain[ing] the premises in order to render them reasonably safe\u201d; id.; required the defendant to replace the annealed glass of the sidelite with a safer type of glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">The plaintiff introduced evidence that the state building code forbids the use of annealed glass in entryway sidelites in new construction. A necessary premise for deeming this evidence relevant to the issue of whether the defendant had a duty to replace the glass is that the state building code represents an official declaration of what is, and what is not, reasonably safe. Cf. <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>363 F.2d 973, 977-78 (D.C. Cir. 1966) (Prettyman, J., dissenting). This premise, however, does not exist in the present case. As the plaintiffs expert, Michael E. Shanok, testified at trial, the state building code sets forth two distinct safety standards, one that is applicable to regulated premises and one that is applicable to exempted premises, such as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>premises at issue in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By holding that the state building code\u2019s prohibition on the use of annealed glass in new construction is relevant evidence of what is, and what is not, \u201creasonably safe,\u201d the majority unwar-rantedly cherry-picks the standard that <em>does not </em>apply to the defendant\u2019s premises to the exclusion of the standard that <em>does </em>apply to the defendant\u2019s premises. It seems that it is more likely that the drafters of the state building code determined that preexisting uses of annealed glass in entryways were <em>not </em>so dangerous as to necessitate remediation and, accordingly, approved those uses of annealed glass by exempting them from regulation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fact that the state building code prohibits the use of annealed glass in entiyway sidelites in new construction does not reflect any definitive judgment as to what is, and what is not, reasonably safe. Evidence of the state building code therefore does not make it more or less probable that the defendant was required to replace the glass to render its premises reasonably safe, and is thus irrelevant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Moreover, even if the building code\u2019s prohibition on the use of annealed glass in an entiyway were relevant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>any probative value it may have is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or confusion, or of misleading the jury. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-3 (\u201c[r]elevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or surprise, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury\u201d). The admission of evidence of an inapplicable statutory standard of care creates a virtual certainty of jury confusion in light of the nebulous distinction between supposedly permissible use of the statute as evidence of the standard of care and supposedly impermissible use of the statute as evidence of negligence. As Judge Prettyman opined in his dissent in <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>supra, 363 F.2d 973, \u201c[o]nce the regulation is in evidence, a jury would almost inevitably give it effect. Indeed I am not quite sure myself what the line is between giving effect to the regulation and considering it as evidence of negligence.\u201d Id., 978 (Prettyman, J., dissenting); see also <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Caprice, </em>96 N. J. Super. 539, 553, 233 A.2d 654 (App. Div.) (any probative value of evidence of statute purportedly establishing standard of conduct was outweighed by possibility of prejudice), cert. denied, 50 N.J. 409, 235 A.2d 901 (1967); <em>Trimarco </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>56 N.Y.2d 98, 108, 436 N.E.2d 502, 451 N.Y.S.2d 52 (1982) (\u201cit cannot be said that [nonretroactive] statutes, once injected into the adversarial conflict, did not prejudice the defendants\u201d). This likelihood of confusion underlies Professor Wigmore\u2019s opposition to the use of statutory standards in any context other than those involving the rule of negligence per se. 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence (Chadboum Rev. Ed. 1979) \u00a7 461, pp. 606-607. For this additional reason, the trial court\u2019s consideration of evidence of the state building code was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Finally, policy considerations militate against the admission of this evidence. The drafters of the state building code expressly exempted certain premises, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>including the premises at issue in the present case, from regulation. The law, however, requires a person not to do that which is negligent \u2014 including, apparently, failing to replace exempted uses of annealed glass in entryway sidelites. See <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>supra, 363 F.2d 978 (Prettyman, J., dissenting). Thus, in permitting the state building code to inform a property owner\u2019s standard of care, the majority effectively expands the regulatory force of the code far beyond what its drafters intended.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The majority makes much of its distinction between using the building code as a substantive standard and using it as evidence of the standard of care. This distinction, however, is cold comfort to the owner of an exempted premises who nonetheless will be required either \u201cto reconstruct and remodel his building to meet changing safety standards\u201d on an ongoing basis or to take his chances with a jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>161 N.W.2d 329, 331 (Iowa 1968); see also <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>supra, 977-78 (Pret-tyman, J., dissenting). The majority\u2019s usurpation of the function of the drafters of the state building code to promulgate rules for the construction and use of buildings is another reason to preclude evidence of an inapplicable building code from informing an exempted property owner\u2019s standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">My position is supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Dinnan </em>v. <em>Jozwiakowski, </em>156 Conn. 432, 242 A.2d 747 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>(1968). The majority states that, in that case, this court \u201cdid not reject the trial court\u2019s instruction that [an inapplicable] building code could be considered in evaluating expert testimony regarding the standard of care\u201d and that <em>\u201cDinnan </em>precludes a jury instruction that a technically inapplicable building code must be considered as <em>the </em>standard of care, or, stated another way, a violation of this building code would not have constituted negligence per se.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) These statements, although accurate, are nonetheless misleading because the issues of whether an inapplicable building code may be considered in impeaching expert testimony and whether an inapplicable building code can support a negligence per se instruction were not contested in <em>Dinnan </em>and are not contested in the present case. I interpret <em>Dinnan </em>to stand for the more pertinent proposition that, although evidence of an inapplicable building code may be used to impeach a witness, it may not be used for the substantive standards that the code establishes. This <em>was </em>the issue that this court decided in <em>Dinnan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">In <em>Dinnan, </em>a tenant was injured when she fell down the staircase of a building owned by the defendant, Stanislawa Jozwiakowski. Id., 433. The staircase appeared to be in compliance with the local building code. See <em>Dinnan </em>v. <em>Jozwiakowski, </em>Conn. Supreme Court Records &amp; Briefs, April Term, 1968, Pt. A-479, Record pp. 15, 17. The staircase nevertheless was exempt from the code because it had been constructed prior to the code\u2019s enactment. See <em>Dinnan </em>v. <em>Jozwia-kowski, </em>supra, 156 Conn. 436. At trial, Henry J. Falsey, a former local building inspector, testified for the tenant that the staircase was not reasonably safe. <em>Dinnan </em>v. <em>Jozwiakowski, </em>Conn. Supreme Court Records <em>&amp; </em>Briefs, supra, Appendix to Plaintiffs Brief p. 6a. On cross-examination, the building owner introduced testimony regarding the local building code \u2014 which Falsey him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>self had been \u201cprimarily responsible for preparing\u201d\u2014 in an apparent attempt to impeach Falsey\u2019s testimony that the staircase was not reasonably safe. Id., Appendix to Defendant\u2019s Brief p. 4a. The trial court instructed the jury that the testimony regarding the local building code was admitted \u201cfor the purpose of testing the soundness of the opinions given by [Falsey].\u201d Id., Record p. 29. The trial court made it clear, however, that no party was claiming \u201cthat there [was] any violation of the building code in [the] case because it seem[ed] to be undisputed that the code was enacted sometime after [the] building was erected.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">On appeal, the building owner argued that the jury should have been instructed to consider the inapplicable local building code not only for impeachment purposes but also for the standards it established, presumably because the building owner believed that her compliance with the code, at least with respect to the staircase at issue, would support her case. Id., Defendant\u2019s Brief pp. 6-7 (\u201c[T]he [c]ode must be considered with respect to the standards of safety it sets up. . . . [T]he jury should have been charged on its consideration of the standards established in the [c]ode.\u201d). This court rejected the building owner\u2019s argument, however, reasoning that \u201c[t]here was no claim of any violation of the building code since it was enacted after the building was erected. Under the circumstances, the [building owner] certainly ha[d] no ground to complain of the court\u2019s charge that the evidence as introduced in this connection was for the purpose of testing the soundness of the opinions given by the experts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dinnan </em>v. <em>Jozwiakow-ski, </em>supra, 156 Conn. 436. The rule established in <em>Dinnan </em>is both clear and directly pertinent to the present case: Although an inapplicable building code may be used to impeach a witness, it may not be used for the substantive standards it establishes, even when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>proponent seeks to establish that his or her premises are in compliance with the inapplicable code.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Even if an inapplicable building code is admissible as evidence of the defendant\u2019s standard of care, the plaintiff still failed to meet his burden of demonstrating the defendant\u2019s negligence insofar as he failed to offer any evidence that the defendant had notice of any defect in the premises.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">A plaintiff bears the burden of proving the allegations in his or her complaint. E.g., <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Meriden, </em>72 Conn. App. 766, 769, 806 A.2d 585 (2002). In the present case, the plaintiffs burden includes making out a prima facie case of the defendant\u2019s negligence. A prima facie case of negligence consists of four elements: duty; breach; causation; and injury. E.g., <em>Jagger </em>v. <em>Mohawk Mountain Ski Area, Inc., </em>269 Conn. 672, 687 n.13, 849 A.2d 813 (2004). There can be no breach, however, unless the defendant \u201chad actual knowledge of the defect [in the premises] or . . . [was] chargeable with constructive notice of it, because, had [the defendant] exercised a reasonable inspection of the premises, [it] would have discovered [the defect]. \u201d <em>Pollack </em>v. <em>Gampel, </em>163 Conn. 462, 468, 313 A.2d 73 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">The majority opinion rests on the premise that the mere presence of annealed glass in the entry way sidelite was an unsafe defect requiring replacement or warning. The plaintiff, however, has failed to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s constructive notice that the sidelite was composed of annealed glass insofar as he has failed to offer evidence \u201cfrom which the jury reasonably could have conpluded that a reasonable inspection would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>have disclosed the [fact that the sidelite was composed of annealed glass].\u201d Id., 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Shanok testified \u2014 and the majority apparently agrees \u2014 that the hazard posed by the use of annealed glass in the sidelite could have been discovered if the defendant had engaged in the process of risk management, \u201cwhich is simply the inspection of premises to locate hazards and deal with them so that you lessen the possibility of liability or accidents . . . .\u201d The logic of this position under the circumstances of the present case is untenable. Annealed glass is indistinguishable from safety glass in appearance, and the plaintiff offered no evidence that the pane through which he fell was etched or otherwise marked as annealed glass.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>e.g., <em>Becker </em>v. <em>IRM Corp., </em>38 Cal. 3d 454, 469, 698 P.2d 116, 213 Cal. Rptr. 213 (1985) (\u201cthe undisputed affidavits are to the effect that there was \u2018no visible difference between the tempered and untempered glass in terms of visible appearance\u2019 \u201d); <em>Trimarco </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>supra, 56 N.Y.2d 102 (\u201cthe [glass] door [of a bathtub that shattered], which turned out to have been made of ordinary glass variously estimated as one sixteenth to one quarter of an inch in thickness, <em>concededly would have presented no different appearance to the plaintiff . . . than did tempered safety </em>glass\u201d [emphasis added]). Indeed, the plaintiff himself testified that \u201c[i]t didn\u2019t appear that there was anything wrong with the glass\u201d of the sidelite before he fell into it. Moreover, Joseph A. Geary, the defendant\u2019s deputy director of public works, testified that the documents and records available to him did not indicate what type of glass was used in the entryway sidelite.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> *8 In the absence of any indication of the type of glass used in the pane, an inspector would have had to shatter the pane in order to determine whether it was composed of annealed glass. This simply is not a reasonable inspection to require a property owner to perform. See <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Cestari, </em>569 So. 2d 1258, 1260 (Fla. 1990) (\u201cthe dangerous condition, in this case a lack of safety glass [in a sliding door], was not discoverable through a reasonable inspection by the owners\u201d). But cf. <em>Becker </em>v. <em>IRM Corp., </em>supra, 469 (reversing judgment in favor of defendant because jury could have found that reasonable visual inspection by defendant would have disclosed that injury causing glass was marked \u201cuntempered\u201d). Because the plaintiff has offered no evidence to demonstrate how a reasonable inspection would have put the defendant on notice of the presence of annealed glass on its premises, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>must conclude that the plaintiff has failed to meet his burden of proving the allegations contained in his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">I respectfully dissent and would reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-6\"> The former standard requires owners of regulated premises to refrain from using annealed glass in entryway sidelites whereas the latter standard does not require any particular improvement to exempted premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-7\"> The majority, after reciting the qualifications of the professionals responsible for adopting and administering the state building code, asserts that \u201cthe building code reflects the reasoned judgment of numerous professionals with extensive relevant experience that in the interests of safety the use of annealed glass in the entryway of buildings should be prohibited in future construction.\u201d Footnote 18 of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">I agree with the majority that those persons responsible for adopting and administering the state building code are experts. The majority, however, fails to appreciate that the building code also reflects the reasoned judgment of numerous professionals with extensive relevant experience that the use of annealed glass in preexisting building entryways is <em>not so unsafe </em>as to necessitate remediation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b897-9\"> If anything, evidence of the inapplicable state building code is relevant to show that the defendant did not act unreasonably in failing to replace the entryway\u2019s annealed glass.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b899-5\"> This rationale is particularly persuasive when an inapplicable building code is the <em>only </em>evidence of the standard of care. Although the majority, in stating that \u201cthe trial court properly considered the building code and the federal regulations as some evidence of the standard of care,\u201d implies that additional evidence of the standard of care will be offered beyond the inapplicable building code, it is unclear whether the majority would <em>require </em>evidence of the standard of care in addition to the evidence of the inapplicable building' code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b899-6\"> The majority disagrees that its decision \u201csignals that an owner of exempt property will be held negligent for failing to remodel his or her building to conform with otherwise inapplicable building code standards.\u201d Footnote 20 of the majority opinion. This, however, is precisely what has happened in the present case as a consequence of the majority\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b902-9\"> The plaintiff does not claim that the defendant had actual notice that the sidelite was composed of annealed glass. He only claims that the defendant had constructive notice thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b903-6\"> The majority states that \u201cthe record contains no evidence to support [my] assertion that a visual inspection cannot distinguish between annealed and toughened glass.\u201d Footnote 23 of the majority opinion. The majority, however, fails to appreciate that the record contains no evidence to support the assertion that a visual inspection \u2014 or, indeed, any reasonable inspec<em>tion </em>\u2014 can <em>distinguish </em>between annealed and toughened glass. In so doing, the majority misplaces the burden of proof. It was incumbent on the plaintiff to demonstrate that reasonable inspection of the defendant\u2019s premises would have put the defendant on notice of the presence of annealed glass in the entryway. The plaintiff has not met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Moreover, even though the standard of review requires us to view the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, drawing reasonable inferences therefrom, it can hardly be said that any reasonable inference can be drawn from Shanolc\u2019s conclusory opinion testimony, which was not grounded in facts and did not contain any reasons in support of his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">Finally, the majority\u2019s assertion that, \u201cthe record would support an inference that visual inspection would reveal the distinction between [annealed and safety] glass\u201d is disingenuous. Id. Although it is true that Joseph A. Geary, the defendant\u2019s deputy director of public works, testified that the glass appeared to be \u201cregular\u201d glass, he also testified that he \u201c[did not] know, you know, the technical version of what type of glass was in that door . . . .\u201d Moreover, Geary testified that the pieces of glass he observed upon arriving at the scene the night of the accident were \u201csmaller pieces of glass\u201d and that the broken glass \u201cappeared to be in smaller pieces than when safety glass would break.\u201d Geary testified after Shanok had testified that annealed glass \u201chas a [tendency] to break in large shards,\u201d while safety glass \u201cwould break into small cubes . . . .\u201d The majority, in attempting to use Geary\u2019s testimony to support an inference regarding (he type of glass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>in the entiyway, once again cherry-picks isolated fragments of Geary\u2019s testimony without regard to the full extent of his testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b904-7\"> Geary also testified that the glass had not been broken, repaired or replaced since the clubhouse\u2019s construction in 1962.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
