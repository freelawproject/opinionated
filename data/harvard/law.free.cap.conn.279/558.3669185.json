Dinan., appeals, following our grant of certification, from the judgment of the Appellate Court affirming the judgment of the trial court, rendered after a jury trial, in favor of the defendant, Donat C. Marchand, administrator of the estate of Albert A. Garofalo (testator). <em>Dinan </em>v. <em>Marchand, </em>91 Conn. App. 492, 881 A.2d 503 (2005). The plaintiff had claimed that the will and codicil of her husband, the testator, improperly had been admitted to probate because the testator was under the undue influence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of his daughter, Anne Patten, when, in anticipation of his marriage to the plaintiff, he executed the codicil, thereby republishing his will that had devised nothing to the plaintiff. The plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court properly had excluded certain testimonial evidence regarding threats allegedly made to the testator by his daughter in support of the claim of undue influence: (1) testimony from the plaintiff, offered under the dead man\u2019s statute, General Statutes \u00a7 52-172,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and as state of mind evidence; and (2) testimony from third party witnesses, offered as impeachment evidence. We conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the plaintiffs challenged testimony on the alternate ground of hearsay, but that the Appellate Court\u2019s impropriety was harmless. We also conclude that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the record was inadequate to evaluate the propriety of the exclusion of the third party testimony. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The following facts and procedural history, as summarized by the Appellate Court, are relevant to this appeal. \u201cAt the time the testator executed his will on December 4, 1995, he was a widower with one child, Patten, and three grandchildren. The will named as beneficiaries [1] the testator\u2019s granddaughter, Nicole Toth, [2] Patten, and [3] a residuary trust of which Patten was trustee and Patten and the three grandchildren were beneficiaries. Patten was named executrix of the estate,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Toth was named successor executrix. On December 5, 1997, two days before his marriage to the plaintiff, the testator executed a codicil to his will. It provided in relevant part: T am executing this instrument in anticipation of my marriage to [the plaintiff] on December 7,1997 and direct that my marriage subsequent to the execution hereof shall not be construed to revoke my will. . . . Except as [previously] specified [in the codicil], my Will shall continue in full force and effect as executed by me on and dated December 4, 1995, without other or further direct or implied amendment, modification or alteration. I hereby reaffirm and republish my Will subject only to the amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>ments thereof [in this codicil].\u2019<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff and the testator were married as planned.</p>\n<p id=\"pAnH\">\u201cThe testator died on July 21, 2000, survived by the plaintiff, Patten and his three grandchildren. Patten offered the will and codicil for admission to probate on July 25, 2000. The plaintiff challenged the admission of the instruments, but later withdrew her objections while reserving the right to appeal, at which time the instruments were admitted as the testator\u2019s will. The Probate Court granted the plaintiffs petition to appeal from the admission of the instruments. Additionally, upon the plaintiffs petition, the Probate Court removed Patten as executrix of the testator\u2019s estate and declined to appoint Toth successor executrix. The Probate Court instead named the defendant, an attorney with no beneficial interest in the estate, as administrator .... The plaintiff made a timely election against the will as surviving spouse. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-436.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>\u201cThe plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court on the ground that the testator executed the codicil to his will \u2018while under the influence, domination and control of Patten, and as a result of this influence, domination and control, unduly and improperly exerted, the will and codicil were not the free and voluntary expression of the testamentary intent of the [testator].\u2019 Trial was held from April 1 to April 8, 2004, following which the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant, finding that the will and codicil were executed properly, that the testator had the proper testamentary capacity to execute the codicil and that the codicil was not procured by undue influence. The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict after denying the plaintiffs motion to set it aside.\u201d <em>Dinan </em>v. <em>Marchand, </em>supra, 91 Conn. App. 494-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">The plaintiff then appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court improperly had excluded the testimony of the plaintiff and two other witnesses relating to threatening statements that Patten allegedly had made to the testator. The plaintiff made an offer of proof regarding the testimony she would have given, if allowed, as to a conversation in which the testator had recounted to her an argument he had had with Patten in which Patten allegedly had threatened to take certain action if the testator did not execute the codicil. The plaintiff made no specific offer of proof as to the other two witnesses\u2019 proposed testimony regarding Patten\u2019s alleged threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The Appellate Court first considered the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the plaintiffs testimony under the rule of <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>57 Conn. 127, 17 A. 757 (1888), and concluded that the trial court\u2019s reliance on the rule in that case was misplaced. <em>Dinan </em>v. <em>Marchand, </em>supra, 91 Conn. App. 503. Specifically, the Appellate Court noted that <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate </em>involved a will contest by a legatee who challenged the testamen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>tary capacity of the testatrix and claimed undue influence by the testatrix\u2019 son in execution of the will. Id., 501. The court noted that, in <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>this court had held that one legatee\u2019s statement, offered as an admission against interest, if potentially harmful to the inheritance rights of other legatees, was inadmissible, under the offered hearsay exception for admissions against interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id. The court in <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate </em>and its progeny reasoned that the admission effectively would be used against all the legatees, because a finding of undue influence would invalidate the entire will. Id., 501-502, citing <em>Livingston\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>63 Conn. 68, 76, 26 A. 470 (1893). Although the Appellate Court recognized that Patten\u2019s statements also potentially threatened the rights of the other legatees under the will, the court concluded that the nature of her statements differed from those in <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate </em>and its progeny. <em>Dinan </em>v. <em>Marchand, </em>supra, 502-503. In <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 129, the legatee had stated that the testator lacked capacity or executed an instrument under undue influence but later sought to take under the contested will, whereas Patten\u2019s alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>threats against the testator were not admissions that the codicil was invalid, but, rather, statements of a legatee that the plaintiff sought to utilize to prove the legatee\u2019s undue influence over the testator. <em>Dinan </em>v. <em>Marchand, </em>supra, 503. In fact, the Appellate Court noted, Patten allegedly had made the threats to protect her pecuniary interest in the testator\u2019s existing will and thereafter insisted that the will and codicil properly were executed and valid. Id., 503 and n.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Although the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court improperly had excluded the plaintiffs testimony based on <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>it held that the impropriety was \u201charmless.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., 503-504. The Appellate Court reasoned that, although Patten\u2019s statements properly could be admitted for a nonhearsay purpose, the testator\u2019s recounting of those statements to the plaintiff was inadmissible hearsay. Id., 505. The Appellate Court summarily dismissed in a footnote the application of \u00a7 52-172, commenting that, \u201cthe oft-misunderstood dead man\u2019s statute does not create a hearsay exception for statements of dead witnesses.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 506 n.15. Finally, because the plaintiff had made no offer of proof as to the testimony of her two additional witnesses on this matter, the Appellate Court concluded that it could not determine if the evidentiary ruling limiting their testimony was improper and in turn harmful.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id., 504. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Accordingly, the Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. We thereafter granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cHaving determined that the trial court improperly had invoked the rule of <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>[supra, 57 Conn. 127], to exclude evidence in the present case, did the Appellate Court improperly affirm the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings?\u201d <em>Dinan </em>v. <em>Marchand, </em>276 Conn. 917, 888 A.2d 84 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">On appeal to this court, the plaintiff contends that the Appellate Court improperly: (1) concluded that the plaintiffs testimony relating Patten\u2019s alleged threats through the testator\u2019s voice, which was highly probative as to the ultimate issue of undue influence, was inadmissible hearsay; and (2) failed to determine whether the trial court properly had excluded testimony of the two other witnesses as to Patten\u2019s alleged threats.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> *9 The defendant contends that, under <em>Vivian\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>74 Conn. 257, 50 A. 797 (1901), and its progeny, the contested portion of the plaintiffs testimony properly was excluded as hearsay, and that, even if we were to assume that the evidence should have been admitted, the impropriety was harmless. The defendant also claims that the proffered testimony of the third party witnesses properly was excluded. We conclude that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>ruling excluding the plaintiffs testimony as hearsay, but that the impropriety was harmless. We also conclude that the Appellate Court properly determined that the plaintiff had failed to make an offer of proof regarding the excluded testimony of the third party witnesses to permit review of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Before addressing the merits of the plaintiffs claims, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cUnless an evidentiary ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, the [t]rial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>272 Conn. 798, 811, 865 A.2d 1135 (2005). \u201cThe harmless error standard in a civil case is whether the improper ruling would likely affect the result. . . . When judging the likely effect of such a trial court ruling, the reviewing court is constrained to make its determination on the basis of the printed record before it. ... In the absence of a showing that the [excluded] evidence would have affected the final result, its exclusion is harmless.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kalams </em>v. <em>Giachetto, </em>268 Conn. 244, 249-50, 842 A.2d 1100 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">We turn first to the plaintiffs claim of improper exclusion of her testimony regarding statements that the testator allegedly made to her on their honeymoon, relating the substance of a conversation he had had with Patten. The plaintiff contends that statements that the testator made to her relating Patten\u2019s threats should have been admitted either under the dead man\u2019s statute, \u00a7 52-172, or as state of mind evidence. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>contends that the plaintiff is not entitled to invoke the dead man\u2019s statute and that the plaintiffs statements were properly excluded as state of mind evidence under the rule of <em>Vivian\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 74 Conn. 257. We conclude that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that this evidence was inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The record reveals the following additional facts necessary to our resolution of this claim. At trial, the plaintiff testified that she was unaware that the testator had executed a codicil to his will until the two conversed on the matter during their honeymoon. When the plaintiff attempted to introduce the substance of this conversation, the defendant objected, and the jury was excused so that the plaintiff could make an offer of proof.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In response to her counsel\u2019s inquiry, the plaintiff related the following conversation that she had had with the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: He said to me, I made a power of attorney to [Toth, my granddaughter] and I did a codicil to my will. And I said, how come? And he said, well, in case anything happened to me, he said, I had to give somebody the authority, and I didn\u2019t want to give it to [Patten]. And he said, [Patten] raised such holy hell about making a codicil, that I had to make the codicil. ... He said that she threatened him. She wouldn\u2019t come to the wedding. She wouldn\u2019t bring the grandchildren to the wedding. She was never gonna see him again. She wouldn\u2019t let the grandchildren have any contact with or see him. She wouldn\u2019t give him the papers that he needed because there was a problem at [South-port Manor, the convalescent home he owned]. The state was investigating and the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office was getting involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>\u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: [Patten] had records of his?</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: Yes, she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">\u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: And she said she wouldn\u2019t\u2014 and he told you that she told him that she wouldn\u2019t give him the records?</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: That\u2019s right. And [the testator\u2019s attorney] had problems getting the documents from [Patten] that [were] needed to protect Southport Manor from payback to the state of Connecticut for the problems that she had created . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The defendant objected to the admission of these statements on several grounds, arguing that they were inadmissible under <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 57 Conn. 140, under the dead man\u2019s statute, and as hearsay within hearsay. The plaintiff responded that the statements were not being offered for the truth of the matters asserted therein and should be admitted under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, or, alternatively, under the dead man\u2019s statute. The trial court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection, and then instructed the plaintiff that she could not offer any statements of the testator reporting the threats allegedly made by Patten, and allowed testimony only as to the testator\u2019s own statements to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">When the jury returned, the plaintiff offered the following testimony regarding her conversation with the testator:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: He said, [Patten] came up to South-port Manor, she came several times, and she called several times. And\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>\u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: Did he say he had a conversation with her?</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">\u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: All right. As a result of that conversation that he had with her, did he say how he felt?</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">\u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: What did he say?</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: He said because of her screaming\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Objection, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: It wasn\u2019t a conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">\u201c[The Court]: Sustained. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b592-14\">\u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: Did he say how he felt or what he feared or anything of that nature as a result of these conversations with [Patten]?</p>\n<p id=\"b592-15\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: He was afraid that she would \u2014 he would not see her, he would not see his grandchildren, she would not give him the documents that he needed because the state was investigating Southport Manor for fraud from 1992 forward, the years that she was running it that she took so much money. He was frightened and he said, that\u2019s what he was afraid of.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-16\">\u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: And did he say that fear had anything to do with signing the codicil?</p>\n<p id=\"b592-17\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: Yes, that\u2019s the reason he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-18\">Turning to the issue before us, as the certified question in this appeal indicates, we agree with the Appellate Court that the rule of <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>57 Conn. 127, does not control on the facts of this case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, we consider whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that, although Patten\u2019s statements to the testator could be used for a nonhearsay purpose, the testator\u2019s recounting of those statements to the plaintiff was inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">As the Appellate Court properly noted, the plaintiffs excluded testimony consisted of two levels of out-of-court statements: Patten\u2019s alleged threats to the testator constitute the first level; the testator\u2019s recounting of those threats to the plaintiff on their honeymoon constitute the second level. It is well settled that \u201c[a]n out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay and is generally inadmissible unless an exception to the general rule applies.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 803, 709 A.2d 522 (1998); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Wargo, </em>255 Conn. 113, 127, 763 A.2d 1 (2000). Moreover, \u201c[h]earsay within hearsay is admissible only if each part of the combined statements is independently admissible under a hearsay exception.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-7. Thus, the plaintiffs testimony could have been admitted only if each level of the out-of-court statements was being used for a nonhearsay purpose or satisfied a hearsay exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The Appellate Court concluded that Patten\u2019s alleged threats, the first level of out-of-court statements, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>admissible because the plaintiff offered them for a valid nonhearsay use. <em>Dinan </em>v. <em>Marchand, </em>supra, 91 Conn. App. 503. Specifically, the plaintiff sought to use Patten\u2019s alleged threats, not for the truth of whether Patten had intended to follow through on them, but simply for the fact that Patten had made them and, in turn, for their effect on the testator. Statements of declarants offered to show their effect on the listener, not for the truth of the contents of the statements, are not hearsay and are admissible. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>210 Conn. 481, 499, 556 A.2d 154 (1989) (\u201cexclusion from hearsay includes utterances admitted to show their effect on the hearer\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>212 Conn. 351, 356, 562 A.2d 1071 (1989) (\u201cAn out-of-court statement is hearsay when it is offered to establish the truth of the matters contained therein. ... A statement offered solely to show its effect upon the hearer [however] is not hearsay.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>186 Conn. 426, 429, 441 A.2d 852 (1982) (statements of officers made over police radio properly admitted to show effect on listeners); C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 8.9.1, p. 577 (\u201c[statements of others that show effect on the hearer or reader are not hearsay on such issues as notice, intent, reasonableness or good faith on the part of the hearer or reader\u201d). Thus, the Appellate Court properly concluded that Patten\u2019s alleged threats had a proper nonhearsay use to show their effect on the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The testator\u2019s statements relating Patten\u2019s alleged threats to the plaintiff constitute the next level of out-of-court statements to which we now turn. In ruling on this issue, the Appellate Court addressed only one of the plaintiffs grounds for admitting the evidence: that the testator\u2019s statements to the plaintiff were admissible under the hearsay exception for statements of then existing mental or emotional states, the so-called state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>of mind exception. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-3 (4).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Appellate Court rejected this ground, reasoning that the testator\u2019s statements were not relating his then existing mental or emotional state at the time of the conversation with the plaintiff; rather, that they reflected his past mental or emotional condition following the conversation with Patten, were offered to prove a fact remembered, and therefore did not fall within the state of mind exception. We conclude that we need not reach this parsing of the testator\u2019s perspective, for there is a straightforward solution to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The dead man\u2019s statute is a long recognized exception to the hearsay rule. See <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Balboni, </em>218 Conn. 220, 231, 588 A.2d 634 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Clemente, </em>166 Conn. 501, 530, 353 A.2d 723 (1974) <em>(Cotter, J., </em>dissenting) (noting that \u00a7 52-172 is a \u201clegislatively-created [exception] to the hearsay rule\u201d). The statute provides in relevant part: \u201cIn actions by or against the representatives of deceased persons . . . the entries, memoranda and declarations of the deceased, relevant to the matter in issue, may be received as evidence. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-172.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>The legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the dead man\u2019s statute was \u201cto remove the disparity in advantage previously possessed by living litigants as against the representatives of persons whose voices were stilled by death, by permitting the declarations and memoranda of the latter to be received and weighed in the evidential balance as against the assertions of the living.\u201d <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>112 Conn. 521, 526, 152 A. 882 (1931); see also <em>Bissell </em>v. <em>Beckwith, </em>32 Conn. 509, 516-17 (1865) (\u201c[t]he object of this law was to enable the representatives of deceased persons to sustain just and defeat unjust claims affecting the estate\u201d). The statute is remedial and construed liberally, generally admitting statements of decedents in actions by or against then-representatives. <em>Starzec </em>v. <em>Kida, </em>183 Conn. 41, 45 n.4, 438 A.2d 1157 (1981); see also <em>Facey </em>v. <em>Merkle, </em>146 Conn. 129, 134, 148 A.2d 261 (1959) (noting that dead man\u2019s statute is \u201cbroad enough to include ordinary modes of communication\u201d and allowing witness to testify to decedent\u2019s nodding or shaking his head in response to questions regarding accident); <em>Mulcahy </em>v. <em>Mulcahy, </em>84 Conn. 659, 662, 81 A. 242 (1911) (\u201cThe statute ... is a highly remedial one. Its aim was to take away the great advantage which under pre-existing law living persons had over the representatives of the deceased.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">There is no requirement that the testimony offered be that to which the decedent could have testified if living. <em>Walter </em>v. <em>Sperry, </em>86 Conn. 474, 477-78, 85 A. 739 (1913). Moreover, under the guiding principle of permitting wide latitude in admitting the declarations and memoranda \u201cin order that the deceased may speak . . . from beyond the grave\u201d; <em>Graybill </em>v. <em>Plant, </em>138 Conn. 397, 405, 85 A.2d 238 (1951); the court has admitted evidence that satisfies the dead man\u2019s statute even when such evidence otherwise may have been barred under other rules of evidence. See, e.g., <em>Plisko </em>v. <em>Mor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number><em>gan, </em>148 Conn. 510, 512, 172 A.2d 621 (1961) (in negligence action, admitting decedent\u2019s statement of opinion as to ultimate fact under statute); <em>Furcolo </em>v. <em>Auto Rental Co., </em>110 Conn. 540, 544-45, 148 A. 377 (1930) (rejecting application of rule limiting use of contradictory or inconsistent out-of-court statements solely for impeachment purposes; concluding that statements admissible for truth of facts therein under dead man\u2019s statute); see also <em>Craft\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>42 Conn. 146, 153-54 (1875) (Dead man\u2019s statute \u201cputs no limit to the number of memoranda which a man may make . . . and leave behind him; as many as [the decedent] leaves are admissible in evidence .... Nor [is there] . . . any limit to the length of time which may elapse between the doing of an act and the making of a memorandum concerning it . . . even years may intervene. If made and left it must be admitted . . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Because the motivation in the creation of the dead man\u2019s statute chiefly was policy driven, in the few instances in which this court has refused to admit evidence offered under the auspices of \u00a7 52-172, it has done so only when the same policy of putting the decedent on equal footing with the living would be thwarted by the admission of the evidence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, in <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>supra, 112 Conn. 526, the court refused to admit through the decedent\u2019s attorney \u201ca mere draft [of a will] never executed by the decedent or even, so far as appears, read to and approved by him.\u201d The <em>Doyle </em>court rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>soned: \u201c[T]he operation of the doctrine of privileged communication extends to and affects the applicability of [\u00a7 52-172] under the circumstances of the present case. . . . While the statute is entitled to, and has been accorded, a liberal construction having in view its purpose and the mischief it was designed to remedy, it does not follow that the privilege conferred by it is entirely without exceptions or limitations in operation. . . . [T]he law, primarily designed for the benefit of the decedent, through his representatives, should not be so construed or applied as to entirely deprive such representatives of that protection which would have been available to the decedent, while living, as to confidential communications between his attorney and himself.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 526-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Turning to the case at hand, we must consider whether the testimony satisfies the prerequisites for admission under \u00a7 52-172: an action by or against a representative of the estate and a declaration of the decedent that is relevant to the matter in issue. For the purposes of \u00a7 52-172, a representative of a deceased person, \u201cmust take some portion of his estate in consequence of his death, either as devisee or heir, or else he must be strictly a personal representative, as executor or administrator.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Bowne <em>v. Ide, </em>109 Conn. 307, 311, 147 A. 4 (1929); see also <em>Pixley </em>v. <em>Eddy, </em>56 Conn. 336, 340, 15 A. 758 (1888); <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Lockwood, </em>56 Conn. 106, 110, 14 A. 293 (1887). It is undisputed that the plaintiff brought this suit against the court-appointed executor of the deceased testator\u2019s estate, falling well within the reach of the statute as construed by this court. See <em>Mulcahy </em>v. <em>Mulcahy, </em>supra, 84 Conn. 663-64 (executors of decedent\u2019s will are his legal representatives for purposes of statute). Because the plaintiff claims that Patten exerted undue influence on the testator in the execution of the codicil to his will, the testator\u2019s statements relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>ing Patten\u2019s alleged threats are relevant to the central disputed issue in this matter. Thus, according to the language and purpose of the dead man\u2019s statute, all of the proffered statements of the testator, as related by the plaintiff, were admissible under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The defendant contends, however, that the dead man\u2019s statute does not apply because the statute requires that the witness testifying as to the decedent\u2019s statements must be a representative of the decedent. The defendant relies on the Appellate Court\u2019s dicta in <em>Pender </em>v. <em>Matranga, </em>58 Conn. App. 19, 28, 752 A.2d 77 (2000), wherein the court stated: \u201cThe dead man\u2019s statute requires <em>not only that the declarant be a representative of a </em>decedent, but that the action be by or against a representative of the deceased person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The <em>Pender </em>court misconstrued \u00a7 52-172. Initially we note that, under \u00a7 52-172, the <em>decedent </em>is the declarant whose out-of-court statements are offered as evidence. More significantly, according to the express language of the statute, the only requirements for admission of the decedent\u2019s out-of-court statements and writings are that they be \u201crelevant to the matter in issue\u201d and that the action be \u201cby or against the representatives of the deceased persons . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-172. In accordance with these limited requirements, we previously have recognized that a third party who was not an heir or other representative of the decedent\u2019s estate and sought to contest the decedent\u2019s will could invoke the statute to testify as to the decedent\u2019s statements. See <em>Starzec </em>v. <em>Kida, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 41. Accordingly, we decline to engraft additional requirements onto clear statutory language. See <em>Laliberte </em>v. <em>United Security, Inc., </em>261 Conn. 181, 186, 801 A.2d 783 (2002) (\u201c[i]nthe absence of any indication of the legislature\u2019s intent concerning this issue, we cannot engraft language onto the statute\u201d). This court will not substitute its own language for that chosen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>by the legislature. <em>Christoper R. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Mental Retardation, </em>277 Conn. 594, 608, 893 A.2d 431 (2006); see also <em>Echavarria </em>v. <em>National Grange Mutual Ins. Co., </em>275 Conn. 408, 416-17, 880 A.2d 882 (2005) (\u201c[t]he court . . . cannot read something into a statute . . . nor can it substitute its judgment of what would constitute a wiser provision for the clearly expressed intent of the legislature\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The defendant also contends that, irrespective of the dead man\u2019s statute, <em>Vivian\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 74 Conn. 257, requires exclusion of the evidence. In that case, this court held that evidence of a declaration of the testator that his will \u201cwas made under the constraint proceeding from his wife . . . and that in certain other matters he had acted under her domination,\u201d properly was excluded as hearsay. Id., 260-61. The party offering the testator\u2019s statements had sought their admission as evidence of the testator\u2019s state of mind, and the court rejected them on that basis, noting that, \u201c[t]hey were not presented as statements from which inferences of material facts could justly be made.\u201d Id., 261. The parties in <em>Vivian\u2019s Appeal from Probate </em>did not brief or raise the claim that the testimony was admissible under the dead man\u2019s statute and, therefore, the court did not consider whether the statute would dictate a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Unlike the facts of <em>Vivian\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>in the present case, the plaintiff expressly has invoked the dead man\u2019s statute as a basis for admitting the evidence. Therefore, <em>Vivian\u2019s Appeal from Probate </em>is not controlling.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Indeed, numerous cases decided since <em>Vivian\u2019s Appeal from Probate </em>in which the dead man\u2019s statute squarely was raised have admitted a plethora of hearsay evidence, probative of the issues in dispute, in the form of statements and writings of deceased persons. See, e.g., <em>Tarquinio </em>v. <em>Diglio, </em>175 Conn. 97, 99-100, 394 A.2d 198 (1978) (in tort action against decedent\u2019s brother, court properly allowed decedent\u2019s wife and brother to testify as to remarks made by decedent after car accident); <em>Plisko </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>supra, 148 Conn. 511-12 (in action against owner of house, decedent\u2019s written statement opining, \u201c '[i]f it had not been for the worn slippery nosing of the edge of the stair tread, I would not have hurt my leg,\u2019 \u201d should have been admitted under \u00a7 52-172, despite fact that statement contained opinion and may not have been admitted if decedent had been testifying while alive); <em>Facey </em>v. <em>Merkle, </em>146 Conn. 129, 133-34, 148 A.2d 261 (1959) (in negligence action against owners of rest home, permitting, under \u00a7 52-172, wife to testify to incapacitated husband\u2019s response, by nodding or shaking his head, to her questions regarding circumstances of fall from which he later died); <em>Sterling Materials Co. Ltd. </em>v. <em>Brooks Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>119 Conn. 549, 551, 177 A. 718 (1935) (allowing secretary to testify to statements made by her deceased employer contradicting plaintiff\u2019s claim that decedent had ordered roofing materials from plaintiff); <em>Walter </em>v. <em>Sperry, </em>supra, 86 Conn. 477-80 (holding that exclusion of decedent\u2019s handwritten document regarding disputed payments, which was admissible under predecessor to \u00a7 52-172, constituted reversible error mandating new trial, notwithstanding fact that decedent\u2019s son was permitted to testify to anything said by decedent regarding his dealings with plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Despite the fact that we conclude that the plaintiff should have been allowed to testify as to the testator\u2019s recounting of Patten\u2019s threats, after measuring the weight of the evidence that the trial court allowed the plaintiff to present, we find the impropriety in this exclusion to be harmless. The plaintiff was allowed to testify to the testator\u2019s tumultuous relationship with Patten as well as to his fear about what Patten might have done if he had not executed the codicil, thereby indirectly communicating the alleged threats through testimony of the testator\u2019s state of mind. Specifically, the plaintiff testified that, <em>as a result of his conversation with Patten, </em>the testator was afraid that he would not see Patten or his grandchildren and that Patten would not give him the documents that he needed for the state\u2019s investigation of his business. The plaintiff testified further that this fear was the reason that the testator had executed the codicil. As we discuss in greater detail in part II of this opinion, the plaintiff also was permitted to introduce testimony from third parties that the testator had told Patten not to threaten him and that the testator had said something during an argument with Patten about \u201cchanging the paper.\u201d We conclude that it is unlikely that the addition of the plaintiffs testimony relating Patten\u2019s alleged threats directly in Patten\u2019s own words would have affected the jury\u2019s decision in this case. The jury easily might have drawn the inference of these threats from the plaintiffs testimony at trial. Therefore, we conclude that the Appellate Court properly affirmed this part of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling, albeit on alternate grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Finally, we turn to the exclusion of certain testimony by the third party witnesses, who, according to the plaintiff, would have testified as to threats made by Patten, for the purpose of impeaching Patten\u2019s testimony and for substantive evidence of undue influence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Specifically, the plaintiff sought to introduce testimony as to arguments between Patten and the testator that allegedly had been overheard by Constantine Scarveles, a handyman and driver frequently employed by the testator, and by Jean Hall, an employee at Southport Manor. See footnote 3 of this opinion. The plaintiff contends that the Appellate Court improperly failed to determine whether the trial court\u2019s exclusion of this testimony was harmful. The defendant avers that, even if we were to assume that the trial court improperly relied on <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate </em>to limit the testimony of Scarveles and Hall, the excluded portion of the testimony nevertheless was inadmissible hearsay. In the alternative, he contends that, because the plaintiff failed to make an offer of proof regarding their testimony concerning Patten\u2019s alleged threats, the Appellate Court properly concluded that it was unable to make an assessment of harmfulness based on the record. For the reasons stated herein, we conclude that, because the plaintiff failed to make an offer of proof pertaining to the testimony of these witnesses regarding Patten\u2019s alleged statements, we are unable to evaluate the propriety and, in turn, possible harmfulness of the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The record reveals the following additional facts necessary to address this issue. The trial court ruled that, like the plaintiff, based on <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>Scarveles and Hall were precluded from relating any of Patten\u2019s alleged statements in their testimony, but allowed them to testify that they had witnessed Patten and the testator arguing at Southport Manor in late 1997.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In her offer of proof regarding the excluded portion of Scarveles\u2019 testimony, the plaintiff averred that she intended to call Scarveles to impeach Patten\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>testimony that she had not visited Southport Manor in late 1997 and therefore had no conversation with the testator there at that time. The trial court then permitted Scarveles to testify that he had witnessed Patten and the testator arguing at Southport Manor, and permitted him to testify to the statements made by the testator, though not those of Patten, concluding that the impeachment purpose would be served sufficiently without Patten\u2019s statements. In the course of his testimony, Scarveles testified that he had heard the testator tell Patten, \u201c \u2018don\u2019t threaten me, don\u2019t yell at me.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The record is silent, however, as to what Scarveles would have testified to, if permitted, regarding Patten\u2019s purported responses, thereby leaving us with no ability to ascertain whether Scarveles\u2019 testimony should have been admitted. See <em>Schnabel </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>230 Conn. 735, 758-59 n.17, 646 A.2d 152 (1994) (\u201cAbsent an offer of proof at trial; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Newell, </em>160 Conn. 269, 277, 278 A.2d 776 [1971]; there is no way to ascertain what additional relevant testimony [the witness] was prohibited from introducing, if any. Indeed, even before this court, [the witness] has not identified what specific testimony he would have presented beyond that which was admitted by the trial court.\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bunker, </em>89 Conn. App. 605, 628, 874 A.2d 301 (2005) (although evidence of coercion would have been relevant and helpful to establishing defense of entrapment, defendant\u2019s offer of proof included only vague assertions about \u201cpossible coercion\u201d and \u201cpossible threats\u201d that may have been revealed by informant\u2019s testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The plaintiff made no offer of proof regarding Hall\u2019s testimony, but directed Hall not to testify as to what she had overheard Patten say to the testator during the alleged argument, and only to relate the testator\u2019s statements. Hall related that she had heard Patten arguing with the testator and that she had heard the testator say something about \u201cchanging the paper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Because at trial the plaintiff made no offer of proof regarding the specific substance of the excluded testimony, we agree with the Appellate Court that it is not possible to evaluate the harmfulness of the exclusion, if improper, in light of the record. Contrary to the plaintiffs suggestion, the plaintiffs offer of proof regarding her own testimony as to conversations with the testator on their honeymoon does not serve as an offer of proof as to the substance of the testimony that Scarveles and Hall would have offered regarding the arguments between Patten and the testator that they allegedly had overheard. \u201c[A] proper offer of proof serves to inform the court of the legal theory under which the offered evidence is admissible . . . [and] of the specific nature of the offered evidence so the court can judge its admissibility, thereby creating an adequate record for appellate review. . . . The absence of an offer of proof may create a gap in the record that would invite inappropriate speculation on appeal about the possible substance of the excluded testimony.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>249 Conn. 809, 824, 734 A.2d 964 (1999); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>267 Conn. 363, 384n.21, 838 A.2d 186 (2004) (\u201c[because the defendant failed to identify the purpose of the proffered evidence adequately so that the court could determine its admissibility, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Moreover, these witnesses were allowed to testify that they heard Patten arguing with the testator at Southport Manor in either December or November of 1997, thereby directly contradicting Patten\u2019s testimony that she had not visited the testator there in the months preceding his marriage. Thus, to the extent these witnesses were called to impeach Patten\u2019s testimony, that purpose was achieved by the testimony presented at trial. The plaintiff has offered the testimony of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>witnesses for no other purpose, and we decline to create a different one here.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-8\"> \u201cUndue influence is the exercise of sufficient control over the person, the validity of whose act is brought in question, to destroy his free agency and constrain him to do what he would not have done if such control had not been exercised.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Molitor, </em>184 Conn. 526, 528, 440 A.2d 192 (1981). \u201cIt is stated generally that there are four elements of undue influence: (1) a person who is subject to influence; (2) an opportunity to exert undue influence; (3) a disposition to exert undue influence; and (4) a result indicating undue influence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pickman </em>v. <em>Pickman, </em>6 Conn.

In fact, because the declarant in <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate </em>was available as a witness and was a party to the proceeding, the court relied on the exception for a statement of a party opponent.

As we have noted previously; see footnote 6 of this opinion; in <em>Dale\u2019s Appealfrom Probate, </em>the hearsay statement that the court declined to admit was a statement offered by a party opponent, not an admission against interest of an unavailable declarant. <em>Dale\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 57 Conn. 140. Because Patten is not a party to the present action, therefore, <em>Dale\u2019s Appealfrom Probate </em>is inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b595-7\"> Section 8-3 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides: \u201cA statement of the declarant\u2019s then-existing mental or emotional condition, including a statement indicating a present intention to do a particular act in the immediate future, provided that the statement is a natural expression of the condition and is not a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b595-8\"> We note that, to the extent that the Appellate Court summarily rejected the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly had failed to admit the statements of the testator under the dead man\u2019s statute, deeming the statute inapplicable to this case, our review of that decision is de novo. See <em>State </em>v. Hardy, 278 Conn. 113, 119, 896 A.2d 755 (2006) (\u201c[statutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Because the parties are not contesting the meaning of the express terms of \u00a7 52-172, but, rather, the defendant contests its application based on requirements not expressly stated by the legislature, we need not engage in our usual exhaustive practice of statutory construction. See <em>Dark-Eyes </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>276 Conn. 559, 570, 887 A.2d 848 (2006) (setting forth pertinent general principles of statutory construction).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\"> For example, in <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, Wilmington &amp; Baltimore R. Co., </em>63 Conn. 415, 417, 28 A. 102 (1893), in disallowing the admission of a memorandum written by the decedent regarding his injuries from an accident to which he later testified in a deposition, the court explained: \u201cIt is that as the plaintiff by his deposition had already been a witness on the hearing, <em>the statute did not apply, because the reason for its application in ordinary cases did not exist in this. . . . </em>The [dead man\u2019s statute] was intended to restore . . . the looting of equality between [the living witness] and the representatives of the decedent.....It could not have been intended to discriminate against the surviving party.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b600-8\"> Indeed, <em>Vivian\u2019s Appeal from Probate </em>has been cited only in a limited number of cases; in these cases the dead man\u2019s statute apparently had not been raised as a ground for admission, and the dispositive issue was whether the evidence was admissible under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule. See, e.g., <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>127 Conn. 643, 644, 19 A.2d 416 (1941) (testator\u2019s statement, four years prior to his death, that his will was \u201call right\u201d properly was admitted because it was not used for truth of matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>asserted, but to show his state of mind regarding his will); <em>Spencer\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>77 Conn. 638, 643, 60 A. 289 (1905) (excluding decedent\u2019s statement that he had made will favoring his wife in order to \u201ckeep her quiet,\u201d but allowing statement that he spoke of his brother \u201caffectionately\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\"> There was conflicting testimony as to the exact date of this alleged argument. According to the testimony of Scarveles and Hall, it occurred in either November or December of 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
